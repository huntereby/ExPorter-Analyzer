Skin-penetrating nematodes, including the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis, infect over
one billion people worldwide and are a major source of morbidity in low-resource settings. Infections can cause
gastrointestinal distress, stunted growth and cognitive impairment in children, and even death in the case of
S. stercoralis infection. S. stercoralis infective larvae are developmentally arrested third-stage larvae that
navigate through the soil searching for hosts to infect. When they find a host, they infect by skin penetration,
resume growth and development inside the host in a process called activation, and navigate through the host
body to the small intestine. These parasites encounter widely varying levels of ambient oxygen (O2) and carbon
dioxide (CO2) throughout their life cycle, ranging from the near-atmospheric levels of O2 and CO2 they encounter
as infective larvae host seeking at the soil surface to the low O2/high CO2 levels they encounter as parasitic
adults residing in the human intestine. However, remarkably little is known about gas sensing in S. stercoralis or
any other mammalian-parasitic nematode. We propose to investigate the behavioral, neural, and molecular
mechanisms of gas sensing in S. stercoralis. We will conduct an in-depth, quantitative analysis of the behavioral
responses of S. stercoralis to acute changes in ambient O2 and CO2 levels as well as O2, CO2, and combined
O2/CO2 gradients using automated worm motility tracking. We will compare the responses of infective larvae,
activated infective larvae, free-living adults, and parasitic adults to changes in ambient O2 and CO2 to determine
how O2/CO2-evoked behaviors vary across life stages. We will then map and functionally characterize the neural
microcircuits that mediate behavioral responses to changes in ambient O2 and CO2. We will test the hypothesis
that the S. stercoralis homologs of sensory neurons and interneurons that mediate gas sensing in C. elegans
also mediate gas sensing in S. stercoralis but contain functional adaptations that enable parasite-specific
behavioral responses. Finally, we will identify and characterize the O2 and CO2 receptors that are required for
gas sensing in S. stercoralis. Together, our results will provide insight into how skin-penetrating nematodes use
gas sensing to find and infect human hosts. In the long-term, our results may identify new molecular targets that
could inform the design of novel anthelmintic drugs."

The long duration and multidrug nature of tuberculosis (TB) treatment regimens pose obstacles to treatment
completion for patients and providers, but also challenge research efforts to develop new and improved regi-
mens. Without a validated early biomarker able to discriminate regimens with different curative potential, the field
depends heavily on preclinical models. However, TB regimen development has been slow, often hindered and
misled by poor preclinical-to-clinical translation. Animal models and pharmacometric modeling played key roles
in developing groundbreaking novel regimens capable of shorting treatment durations for drug-susceptible and
multidrug-resistant TB to 4 and 6 months, respectively. However, these tools are still not utilized to their full
potential. Recent successes in TB drug discovery have produced additional clinical and preclinical drug candi-
dates, which have revealed a new challenge: with many possible combinations, how to prioritize multidrug regi-
mens to test in resource-intensive clinical trials? The most efficient “critical path” of preclinical experiments and
modeling to follow to identifying and optimizing the best regimens for advancement to clinical trials remains
uncertain. The proposed project will establish a comprehensive, collaborative, multidisciplinary consortium of
scientific leaders, drug developers and other stakeholders to develop and pursue a preclinical and translational
research agenda to identify novel regimens with the greatest potential for clinical success in adults and children
with TB. The overarching hypothesis is that integration and analysis of specific preclinical and early clinical data
using validated models and tools will enable data-driven clinical trial simulations that yield quantitative predictions
of Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial endpoints useful to identify and rank regimens with the highest probability of clinical
success in patients across the age and disease spectrum of pulmonary TB. Initial efforts will be aimed at refining
and validating preclinical in vivo (BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mouse) and in vitro models and translational tools by
leveraging the largest data warehouse on TB drugs and regimens ever assembled, with data spanning from
early preclinical stages to Phase 3 clinical trials, for both back translation and forward prediction approaches to
validation. The overall goal is to develop a fully data- and knowledge-driven approach to evaluate, prioritize and
optimize novel drug regimens for clinical trials requiring only preclinical and early clinical trial data. In addition to
endpoints based on bacterial burden and relapse (in mice), the RS ratio, a new portable biomarker of bacterial
“health”, will be evaluated as a complementary pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker to increase efficiency and
predictive accuracy of preclinical studies. The expected outcomes are novel methodologies of combining pre-
clinical and early clinical data, a defined set of critical path experiments with predictive value, and a framework
for model-informed decision-making based on quantitative predictions of clinical outcomes for emerging regi-
mens prior to initiation of phase 2/3 trials. The predictions will be used to rank order candidate regimens for
advancement to clinical trials."
11167933,"This project proposes a Sustainable Health Investment Partnership (SHIP), a new employer-
engaged upstream intervention program to reduce health disparities by increasing economic
stability for underemployed and low wage workers through an aligned and integrated countywide
safety-net program. Families earning 135-350% of federal poverty level often experience little to
no gain in net income as wages increase due to loss of public benefits such as Medicaid and are
constrained by numerous barriers to health and economic mobility. The SHIP will be designed
by cross-sector community partners to support workers throughout the continuum from poverty to
financial security by (1) aligning and expanding three local employer-based innovations: Access
Health (health coverage and SDoH impact), Tri-Share Childcare (childcare), and Wheels to Work
(transportation) 2) collaborating with place-based Impact Hubs that target minority and rural
populations 3) providing individualized, trust-based upstream SDOH support, connecting
vulnerable workers to public, private, and community resources to address self-prioritized health
and employment needs. The SHIP will be structured as a wellness plan to allow the collection of
longitudinal data related to workers’ health, social needs, employment metrics, income level, and
benefits eligibility to help create a value proposition for expanding the safety net for low income
families, Participatory research with employers and residents will help understand relevant assets,
causal loops and economic variables to effectively target governmental and organizational policy
changes within our clinical, safety-net, and employer sectors. This project will improve health and
economic stability in low-income households and draw additional individuals into the local
workforce."

Omniox is developing a unique oxygen delivery protein, OMX, as a treatment to preserve myocardial
and peripheral organ function and significantly reduce morbidity after neonatal cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) during surgical correction of congenital heart disease (CHD). Of the ~40,000 children born
annually with CHD, ~10,000 require urgent surgery to repair heart defects1, 2. Up to 60% of infants who
undergo CPB will experience post-operative complications that can result in peripheral organ dysfunction and
long-term neurological deficits3-15.
A critical driver of the myocardial and peripheral organ tissue damage is oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia3-15.
However, there are no current or promising therapeutic approaches that target hypoxia during CPB surgery to
stem or alleviate its damaging downstream effects. Omniox’s lead therapeutic candidate, OMX, is designed
to oxygenate hypoxic tissues. Supported by preliminary data from our Phase I/II Fast-Track SBIR and
generated with our collaborators, neonatal and pediatric care intensivists Drs. Fineman and Maltepe at the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), OMX has the potential to address a high unmet need of
preserving myocardial function and decreasing morbidity associated with neonatal CPB surgery.
The objective of this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is to advance development of OMX as a novel biologic for the
treatment of neonates undergoing CPB by demonstrating its therapeutic utility in oxygenating hypoxic tissue
and preserving myocardial and peripheral organ function. We propose to confirm that a more stable variant of
OMX preserves myocardial and peripheral organ function after CPB and identify the optimal dose regimen for
OMX efficacy (Aims 1 and 2), adapt and optimize a scalable production process suitable for transfer to a GMP
(Good Manufacturing Practice) contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), including
process and analytical development (Aim 3), and prepare and submit an IND for a Phase 1 clinical trial in
neonates (Aim 4). Pending good safety and efficacy data in neonatal and pediatric patients undergoing CPB,
Omniox plans to expand OMX use to other pediatric indications in which hypoxia drives disease pathology
such as persistent pulmonary hypertension in neonates16, 17 and birth asphyxia18-22."
11143512,"Project Summary
Caring for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is associated with depressive symptoms and “burden”
because dealing with AD patient's cognitive, behavioral and personality changes is very challenging and
stressful for caregivers. There are over 11 million AD caregivers in the US, providing informal care services to
family members, with high incidences of stress (59%) and depressive symptoms (30%).
Clinical trials and other academic research demonstrated the benefits of non-pharmacological interventions to
improve the psychological well-being of AD caregivers, however there is a recognized need to translate these
programs to accessible products/services and deliver them widely at minimum cost.
To address these needs, we propose the new Recharge Behavioral Therapy (RBT), derived from an evidence-
based protocol to treat depression (Behavioral Activation) and a proven program to train coping skills (Coping
With Caregiving). We will translate prior research, combine powerful behavioral activation methods, and tailor
the integrated curriculum for AD caregivers into a new intervention to reduce stress and depressive symptoms.
Besides being an effective treatment for depression (efficacy stablished by multiple clinical trials), Behavioral
Activation (BA) was selected because it motivates individuals to engage in healthy behaviors to improve their
wellness. AD caregivers usually sacrifice their own physical and emotional needs, when providing care. The
BA component will encourage caregivers to take care of their own well-being and “Recharge their energy” in
their caregiving journey, so that they can fulfil their caregiver role at their best and improve their quality of life.
Coping With Caregiving (CWC) is a psychoeducational training program for AD caregivers, evaluated in
several clinical trials with demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing caregiver distress, burden of care, stress,
and depression. By integrating CWC in RBT, we will provide the necessary consideration to the AD caregiving
context and the resulting intervention will contain beneficial coping strategies for AD caregivers.
Furthermore, the implementation mechanism for the RBT intervention will be the new Recharge Mobile App
(RMA), an interactive, easy to use, and engaging mobile app that can be deployed to millions of people on
demand (app install from app stores) and at very low cost (small subscription fee).
RMA will be tailored for AD caregivers with training, practices, and content for RBT, which is not available in
the market. Creative use of app features (interactivity, compliance, and notifications) will engage caregivers.
Phase I will determine the initial RBT curriculum, develop the RMA prototype, and evaluate the feasibility.
Phase II will fully develop RBT/RMA and evaluate the intervention effectiveness with a randomized clinical trial.
RMA will help to reduce caregiver stress and depressive symptoms related to AD caregiving with a non-
pharmacological approach; offering an effective, low-cost, and accessible mobile app to be disseminated to
innumerous families struggling with Alzheimer's Disease through Apple and Google Play app stores."
10906036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interferons (IFNs) are central orchestrators of tumor immunity and can elicit both pro-tumor and anti-tumor
responses depending on the cancer cell type, the type of IFN produced (e.g. a, b or g), duration of the signal,
and other factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In their anti-tumor role, IFNs induce expression of major
histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) on the surface of tumor cells that mediates CD8+ T cell recognition and
killing. Paradoxically, IFNs also upregulate expression of CD8+ T cell inhibitory surface molecules such as
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to temper the immune response and avoid an autoimmune reaction. Thus,
IFNs play a dual and opposing role in cancer development, making a more complete understanding of the
contexts in which their pro- or anti-tumor functions predominate important for effective cancer therapy
development. Immune evasion can occur when malignant cells lose MHC-I and antigen processing and
presentation (APP) machinery or otherwise become desensitized to IFN signaling. Thus, finding ways to
reinvigorate these pathways has significant therapeutic potential. Interestingly, recent work from the sponsor’s
lab and others has shown that mitochondrial electron transport chain activity is required for IFN-induced MHC-I
expression. In addition, preliminary data show that chronic IFN stimulation in vitro reduces mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in melanoma cells, suggesting that IFN signaling can also influence tumor
mitochondrial metabolism. To probe this novel regulatory link between the metabolic state of tumor cells and
their responses to IFN, a metabolism-targeted CRISPR knock-out screen was performed in mouse melanoma
cells. Results from this screen not only confirmed a requirement for mitochondrial OXPHOS in regulating IFN
signaling, but also implicated fatty acid metabolism and ROS. Based on these preliminary data, it is proposed
that mitochondrial OXPHOS, specifically mitochondrial fuel utilization and ROS production, can directly regulate
key IFN signaling steps, and that chronic IFN exposure leads to changes in mitochondrial metabolism that
facilitate immune evasion in melanoma. This overall hypothesis will be tested through completion of two specific
aims. Aim 1 is to determine which steps in the IFN signaling pathway are subject to mitochondrial OXPHOS-
mediated regulation and the precise mitochondrial metabolic signals involved. Aim 2 is to determine how reduced
mitochondrial OXPHOS and/or increased mitochondrial ROS are generating a suppressive tumor
microenvironment and if chronic type I IFN signaling elicits similar immunosuppressive effects as chronic type II
IFN exposure. This project will provide important new insights into the relationship between mitochondrial
metabolism and IFN responses during tumor progression that might be exploited to improve or reactivate anti-
tumor immune responses for better cancer treatment and augment cancer immunotherapy."
10906016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism by which cell death results from transcriptional inhibition.
The consensus model in the field posits that cell death following transcriptional inhibition results from the loss of
specific mRNA species and subsequent loss of protein. By targeting such a core cellular process, transcriptional
inhibition is thought to overwhelm cellular control and lead to unavoidable cell death. This death process, defined
as Accidental Cell Death (ACD), is not controlled by the cell and does not result from the use of defined effector
molecules. Contrary to the conventional model, we found that, rather than induce ACD, cell death following
transcriptional inhibition results from a previously undescribed regulated apoptotic signal. Furthermore, we found
that RNA Pol II degradation, rather than loss of mRNA production, resulted in cell death. Our data suggests a
new model, whereby degradation of Pol II induces a signal that leaves the nucleus and is received by the
mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. To identify genes that regulate a pro-apoptotic signal following transcriptional
inhibition, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Genome-wide CRISPR screens often fail to identify
death regulatory genes, making it difficult to elucidate mechanisms of cell death. To overcome this, we developed
a novel experimental strategy that allowed us to identify genes whose knockout modulated the cell death rate
following transcriptional inhibition. Based on the results of our screen, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that
the alternative splicing regulator PTBP1 facilitates altered splicing and nuclear export of regulatory pre-mRNA,
and that this activity is required for cell death following transcriptional inhibition. We will use live cell microscopy
to establish the functional role of PTBP1 nuclear export. We will use SLAM-seq and RIP-seq to quantify PTBP1
activity following transcriptional inhibition. Our screen also identified BCL2L12 as the critical apoptotic effector
gene for transcriptional inhibition. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that BCL2L12 activates apoptosis following
transcriptional inhibition in an isoform-specific manner. We will perform a series of functional genetics
experiments to characterize the role of BCL2L12 in the apoptotic response. By describing a new mechanistic
model by which transcriptional inhibition induces cell death, we will improve our understanding of how to
effectively use transcriptional inhibitors therapeutically. Ultimately, we hope our work will improve our ability to
predict which patients will best respond to transcriptional inhibitors and help identify novel treatment strategies."

Natural products play essential biological roles in producing organisms and have been a historically important
source of medicines. Microbial natural products research has focused largely on environmental organisms;
natural products, especially the potential small molecule virulent factor produced by pathogenic microbes, are
much less understood. Legionella infection causes Legionellosis, which can be present in its non-pneumonic
form as Pontiac fever or acute pneumonic form as Legionnaires’ disease. The fatality rate of legionnaires disease
is about 10% due to complications and about 25% for those infected in the healthcare facility. While how the
protein effectors of Legionella affect the host have been intensively studied, identifying the secondary
metabolites Legionella produce and the roles these natural products play in Legionella infection are understudied.
The proposed work will identify and characterize the potential bioactive nature products from the human
pathogen Legionella. Using a gene-targeting approach to identify a potential novel metalloenzyme that catalyzes
unusual oxidative rearrangement to generate the N-nitroso product, one homolog conserved in over
170 Legionella pneumophila subspecies and another homolog conserved in Legionella drozanskii was
discovered. Activity assay shows this homolog catalyzes similar reactions but utilizes different substrates.
Bioinformatic analysis of the gene neighborhood identifies the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encodes
resistance enzyme and a prodrug activating enzyme, possibly indicating the biosynthesis of potential bioactive
metabolites.
Aim 1 will identify the natural product and bioactivity from the biosynthetic gene cluster from Legionella to
uncover the potential virulent factor. Aim 2 will initiate the characterization and mechanistic study of two enzymes
in the BGC involving the biosynthesis of the potential pharmacophore to facilitate the understanding and pave
the way for the inhibitor design of this new class of pharmacophore-producing enzyme pair. Successful
completion of these aims will identify the chemical structure of the potential bioactive natural products from the
human pathogen Legionella. In addition, two key enzymes involving the potential pharmacophore biosynthesis
will also be characterized. Identification of those natural products and their biosynthesis will possibly reveal new
virulence pathways that can be targeted to combat Legionella infection. Ultimately, the overall workflow will be
generalized to investigate other novel natural products or potential virulent factors from the human
pathogen Legionella to fight the emerging infectious disease by expanding the pool of 1) new classes of cytotoxic
drug candidates/virulent factors and 2) new inhibition targets from the biosynthetic pathway."
10873909,"Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has diverse presentation but can be characterized by at core by a) rigid and
repetitive behavior and b) social communication deficits. In recent decades, there is increasing confidence that
identified genetic differences contribute to ASD in humans and a number of high confidence risk genes have
been identified. These risk genes can be studied in mice. There is hope that convergent phenotypes and
endophenotypes will illuminate key features of ASD (Hyman, 2014). One striking current area of
convergence seen in mice with ASD risk genes is a gain of function in rotarod motor learning and
alteration in neurotransmission onto spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum (Hyman, 2014).
This was first observed in mice with neuroligin gene mutations (Rothwell et al., 2014), but has also been
observed in mice with Tsc1 and Tsc2 gene mutations (Benthall et al., 2021). Tsc2 (with some studies of Tsc1
for comparison) will be the central focus of this proposal.
Here we propose that a major diagnostic criteria for ASD observed in TSC patients - restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior - is mediated by changes in the activity of basal ganglia circuits that
control the learning and updating of appropriate actions. Specifically, we hypothesize that Tsc2
haploinsufficiency leads to changes in corticalstriatal synapses and SPN activity that facilities striatal
dependent learning and makes updating learning more inflexible. In Aim 1 we will use
electrophysiological and structural imaging methods to test if specific connections are stronger in Tsc2 Het
mice than WT. We posit based on studies in the dorsolateral striatum that corticostriatal connections onto D1R
expressing SPNs (dSPNs) will be enhanced in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Aim 2 will focus on behavior
and test in two different tasks if behavioral inflexibility in Tsc2 Het mice can be ameliorated by reducing reward
probability during learning. Aim 3 will use in vivo imaging in the striatum to examine how dopamine and striatal
activity may differ in Tsc2 mice under conditions that produce behavioral differences.
In sum, these data will inform basic neurobiology surrounding a convergent gain of function phenotype seen in
many ASD models: gain of function in striatal learning (rotarod being the most common test). We will translate
this learning phenotype into more translatable behavior learning paradigm--cue guided action learning and
seek the neural correlates of this gain of function. Finally, we will test a highly translatable therapeutic idea, the
idea that using lower reward probability during training will ameliorate neural differences and allow for greater
flexibility later."

10745648,"Most patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) do not respond well to therapeutic treatment. New agents for
improving CRC therapy are urgently needed. Induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis is a major effect
of anticancer therapy. Recent studies indicate that programmed cell death also includes necroptosis, a regulated
form of necrotic death controlled by Receptor-Interacting Protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and Mixed Lineage Kinase
Domain-Like protein (MLKL). Accumulating evidence suggests that necroptosis, similar to apoptosis, functions
as a barrier against tumor development and plays an important role in anticancer therapy. Downregulation or
mutations of RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL have been frequently found in tumors and contribute to therapeutic
resistance. However, few attempts have been made to target defective necroptosis in cancer cells due to
insufficient understanding of the regulatory mechanism and functional role of necroptosis in anticancer therapy.
Our recent studies identified a new necroptosis pathway mediated by PUMA, a p53 target and a BH3-only Bcl-2
family protein that is essential for cell death induced by a variety of anticancer drugs. This pathway can be utilized
by common chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to kill a subset of CRC cells. However, this pathway
often cannot be engaged in CRC cells due to frequent loss of RIP3 expression, which prompted us to search for
agents that can restore necroptosis in RIP3-deficient CRC cells. Our preliminary data show that OSW-1, a natural
compound with potent anticancer activity, activates p53 and PUMA to induce necroptosis in CRC cells.
Surprisingly, OSW-1-induced and PUMA-mediated necroptosis does not require either RIP1 or RIP3, suggesting
a novel mechanism of action. Importantly, the in vivo antitumor activity of OSW-1 needs to be characterized using
immuno-competent tumor models, suggesting a critical role of necroptosis-triggered antitumor immunity. Based
on these findings, we propose to use OSW-1 as a chemical probe to test the hypothesis that PUMA-mediated
and RIP3-independent necroptosis is efficacious against CRC via both cell-intrinsic and immunologic effects, and
can be exploited to improve CRC therapy. Aim 1: Mechanism by which OSW-1 induces PUMA-mediated
necroptosis in RIP3-deficient CRC cells; Aim 2: Role of PUMA-mediated and RIP3-independent necroptosis in
tumor suppression by OSW-1; and Aim 3: Induction of PUMA-mediated and RIP3-independent necroptosis for
improving CRC therapy. The proposed studies will delineate a novel necroptosis pathway underlying the potent
anticancer activity of OSW-1. Completion of these studies will lay a foundation for identifying new anticancer
agents that target defective necroptosis in CRC cells to enhance tumor cell killing and antitumor immune
response, which may ultimately lead to improved treatment of CRC and other cancers."
10755303,"Project Abstract
Overtreatment – health care in which the benefit does not outweigh risks – accounts for up to $200 billion
annually in the United States, and is associated with worse outcomes and death. Unnecessary use of diagnostic
testing is a primary driver of overtreatment.
Diagnosing and treating suspected sepsis exemplifies this challenge. In hospitalized children, severe sepsis is
common (8.2% prevalence) and deadly (25% mortality rate). Pediatric hospitals prioritize early sepsis recognition
and rapid antibiotic administration as key performance metrics. Signs and symptoms of sepsis in children,
however, are non-specific. The resulting diagnostic uncertainty may lead to harmful overtreatment.
Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing sepsis due to bacteremia. Frequently, clinicians obtain blood
cultures and simultaneously start empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Only 5-15% of cultures will be positive,
however, and up to 50% of those are actually falsely positive. False positive results lead to unnecessary
antibiotics, increased lengths of stay, and increased costs. Reduction in unnecessary blood cultures in pediatric
intensive care unit patients is feasible and safe, but current practice patterns for blood culture use vary widely,
and culture use may be driven by reflexive behavior and fear of missing sepsis.
With my Primary Mentor, I have been leading an AHRQ-funded 14-site PICU blood culture quality improvement
collaborative called Bright STAR (R18 HS025642-01) since 2017. I will now leverage Bright STAR to 1)
investigate what leads to blood culture overuse in the PICU, and 2) develop and test strategies to safely reduce
blood culture overuse. I will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the concept of
cognitive bias, and the Proctor implementation framework to accomplish these objectives, in a series of
qualitative, quantitative, and quasi-experimental research investigations.
This proposal will give me experience in: applying frameworks of implementation/behavioral science, conducting
mixed methods studies, designing implementation strategies, and conducting a clinical trial. These skills are
critical to achieving my long term goal: to design and test strategies to safely reduce harmful overuse of
other unnecessary diagnostic tests (and consequently, unnecessary treatments) in critically ill children. I
will be mentored by a team of highly funded, successful researchers with expertise in infectious diseases,
implementation science, behavioral science, trial design, and mixed methods research. I will have the full support
of the Division of Critical Care at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, with
access to innumerable resources (such as the Penn Implementation Science Center, the Center for Pediatric
Clinical Effectiveness research, and the Penn Mixed-Methods Laboratory) to help me accomplish my aims. I will
use this award to become an independent implementation scientist improving patient outcomes by reducing
harmful overuse of unnecessary tests in critically ill children on a large scale."
10755304,"The central amygdala circuits in motivated behaviors
Project Summary
The central amygdala (CeA) contains heterogeneous cell types, with somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) neurons
and protein kinase C--expressing (PKC-+) neurons being two largest and largely non-overlapping
populations. Previous studies have mainly focused on the roles of these neurons in fear conditioning, revealing
that SOM+ and PKC-+ CeA neurons differentially contribute to fear learning and expression. However, it is
long recognized that the CeA contributes not only to behaviors driven by aversive stimuli, but also to those
driven by appetitive stimuli, and to the generation of anxiety state. Indeed, recent studies show that distinct
types of CeA neurons, such as SOM+ neurons, can drive appetitive behaviors and heightened anxiety.
However, how the SOM+ as well as PKC-+ CeA neurons participate in divergent motivational behaviors
remains poorly understood. Bridging this knowledge gap will have important clinical implications for improved
treatments, as CeA dysfunctions have been implicated in mood- or motivation-related disorders, including
anxiety disorders, depression and drug addiction.
We will address this question by investigating the in vivo response properties of SOM+ neurons and PKC-+
neurons in the CeA during behaviors driven by either reward or punishment, and determining how these
responses are used to control the functions of downstream circuits and, hence, behavior. Our central
hypothesis is that CeA neurons influence learning or expression of reward seeking and punishment avoidance
through their long-range projections to different targets. Based on our preliminary results, we devised an
integrated approach, combining in vivo imaging, fiber photometry, optogenetics, chemogenetics and novel
behavioral techniques, to test our hypotheses in the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the roles of SOM+ CeA neurons in motivational behaviors.

10923843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Widespread exposure to ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as phthalates, during pregnancy, a
sensitive period in the life course for both mother and baby, is of global concern. Phthalates and their
metabolites (PMs) are associated with increased oxidative stress, hormonal disturbances and epigenetic
changes that may interfere with maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and fetal growth patterns. Maternal
GWG and fetal growth rates are important as they influence both short and long-term health outcomes of the
mother and baby. Further, pregnancy related racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes have
persisted over time and environmental exposures may contribute to these. Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and
Asian women have higher concentrations of PMs likely due to the use of specific personal care products.
Although several studies have evaluated PM’s effect on birthweight (the end point of fetal growth) or on periods
of GWG, few have considered associations between PMs and fetal growth and GWG rates and those that
have are subject to methodological limitations. In addition, there is scarcity of evidence regarding associations
between mixtures of PMs and adverse health outcomes. Using data from a nested case control study in a
racially diverse population (Nulliparous Mothers To Be (nuMoM2b)), and specifically among healthy controls,
we will explore associations between PMs and GWG and fetal growth trajectories using sophisticated statistical
methods (i.e., growth mixture models, generalized estimating equations and weighted quantile sum regression)
which account for multiple measures of both exposures and outcomes, and account for PM mixtures. We
propose the following aims: 1) to examine associations between prenatal exposure to PMs (and their
mixtures), measured in each pregnancy trimester and a) GWG and b) estimated fetal growth trajectories
among 960 healthy pregnant women across the United States; 2) to evaluate modification by race/ethnicity and
fetal-sex between PMs and GWG and fetal growth. This will be the first study to evaluate the effect of a
ubiquitous environmental exposure on GWG and fetal growth trajectories. Findings from the proposed study
are important to identify critical windows of gestation when maternal GWG and fetal growth may be more be
more sensitive to insults from PMs. Importantly, this will aid the design of interventions to reduce phthalate
exposure levels, inform policies to regulate phthalate concentrations in products, and educate and target
women at greatest risk of exposure. Execution of these specific aims will advance NIEHS’s mission to
understand the impact of a ubiquitous environmental exposure, phthalates, on salient maternal fetal outcomes.
The proposed training plan will be delivered within Columbia University, one of the world’s preeminent
research universities, providing skills in environmental exposures including mixtures analysis, maternal child
health and advanced analytic methods that will, with the support of an excellent sponsor team, will ensure
successful completion of the study aims and prepare me to a career as an independent productive researcher."

Synthetic photochemistry is a powerful tool for biomedical research. The small-molecule therapeutics that
constitute the core of modern molecular medicine occupy a relatively narrow segment of chemical diversity
space. Photochemistry offers a new capability that can expand the range of chemical structures that can be
investigated for their biological activity and their potential as new life-saving drugs. Specifically, reactions
that are driven by light can use the energy of a photon to produce highly reactive intermediates that react in
ways that are not accessible by other means.
Our group's research focuses on the discovery of reaction methods that can control the outcomes of
photochemical processes in predictable ways. We have a long-standing interest in the development of
mechanistically novel catalytic processes that are directly applicable to the synthesis of complex bioactive
compounds. We are also interested in the use of external stimuli that can control or divert the intrinsic
reactivity of open-shelled photogenerated intermediates towards desirable synthetic goals. Finally, we are
deeply committed to elucidating the mechanisms by which photochemical transformations occur.
The next phase of our research will continue to investigate these broad themes. We propose investigations
into new strategies for controlling the stereochemistry of diverse photochemical reactions. We will study a
new approach towards the generation of carbocationic intermediates from photoredox activation. Finally, we
will develop a new class of photoreactions that take advantage of the direct photochemistry of base metal
coordination complexes.
These studies will result in new, generalizable strategies for the controlled photochemical synthesis of
complex organic molecules."
10755714,"In the past 5 years, it has become clear that the protein pathology of many human neurodegenerative diseases
exhibits characteristics of prions, including transmissibility, strain variation, and the ability to spread from a
focal site of introduction. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) stands out as an example where the hallmarks of
prion-like spreading is evident as weakness spreads along anatomically connected pathways. In familial ALS
caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1-ALS), patients inheriting the A4V variant of SOD1
weakness spreads rapidly (average survival <1.5 years after the onset), whereas in patients inheriting the
G37R variant weakness spreads slowly (average survival ~17 years). In the initial funding period of this award,
our laboratory has uncovered evidence that this defining feature of SOD1-ALS may be explained by prion-like
characteristics of mutant SOD1. Transgenic mice that express low levels of ALS mutant SOD1 develop
disease late in life if at all. We have shown that paralysis can be accelerated in these mice by injecting spinal
cord homogenates prepared from paralyzed mutant SOD1 transgenic mice or from human patients. We have
also shown that we can inject these homogenates into the sciatic nerve of vulnerable mice to initiate a disease
process that closely mimics the unilateral spread of weakness from one limb to another limb that is seen in
humans. We have also successfully used purified recombinant SOD1 fibrilized in vitro to seed early onset
paralysis in host mice, proving that SOD1 is capable of acting like a prion. Because we can propagate disease-
causing conformations of SOD1 to naïve SOD1 “host proteins”, from hereafter we will refer to the misfolded
conformation associated with disease-causing mutant SOD1 as an ALS prion. Building on the success of our
initial work, we now propose four Specific Aims that are designed to improve our understanding of the
biological role of prion-like spread in the pathogenesis of SOD1-ALS. In Aim 1, we seek to investigate whether
the disease-causing mutations encrypt unique strain-like characteristics in misfolded SOD1 that influences the
rate of prion-like spread in animal to animal transmission studies. In Aim 2, we seek to determine how the route
of transmission and age of the host recipient mouse influence the propagation of SOD1-ALS prions. In our third
and fourth Aims, using our novel model system we will turn our attention towards determining the extrinsic
factors that determine how misfolded protein conformations may spread in the CNS and whether inflammatory
signaling may influence such spread. In Aim 3, we will use newly generated loxp G85R-SOD1:YFP mice to
determine the contribution of astrocytes in propagating SOD1-ALS prions. In Aim 4, we will use adeno-
associated vectors to express pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as a means to assess the role of activated
astrocytes and microglia in the propagation and spreading of SOD1-ALS prions. Our over-arching goal is to
determine the contribution of intrinsic strain-like attributes in SOD1 and extrinsic non-cell autonomous
processes to the prion-like propagation properties of disease-causing SOD1 conformations."

There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the US. Social
determinants of health and social risk factors have a central role in maternal health disparities, with structural
racism reinforcing inequitable exposure to social risk factors in inner city environments. Our team provides
healthcare services in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one of the five most segregated cities in the US. The adverse
health effects associated with residential segregation, concentrated poverty, and neighborhood
conditions result in perpetuated racial disparities in all health outcomes in Southeastern WI, including maternal
health outcomes. In this proposal, we aim to address key social-structural risk factors for racial disparities in
maternal morbidity in Southeastern Wisconsin identified by our research community and community partners.
These risk factors include housing instability, medical mistrust, and fragmented access to preventative
care postpartum. We plan to address these risk factors with three research projects involving community
stakeholders in housing (research project 1), community-based doulas (research project 2), and community
health workers and postpartum telemonitoring (research project 3). The three projects were conceptualized
and developed in collaboration with community partners with synergy of addressing maternal health inequities
throughout the continuum of preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum. The MCW Center’s theme is
Addressing Key Social-Structural Risk Factors for RaCial Disparities in MatErNal MorbiDity in Southeastern
Wisconsin - ASCEND WI. ASCEND WI has four overarching aims: 1) Partner with community organizations to
mitigate the impact of social-structural risk factors on maternal health, 2) Develop and evaluate interventions to
address social-structural risk factors for racial disparities in maternal health, 3) Disseminate findings to relevant
stakeholders and policymakers, and 4) Train a diverse group of early-stage scientists in maternal health equity
research. The ASCEND WI team utilizes innovative approaches, equitable collaborations, and skilled
academic and community-based partners to create sustainable change and will work effectively to eradicate
maternal health disparities in Southeastern Wisconsin and beyond."
10913587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a broadly disseminated gammaherpes virus that, in immunosuppressed or
immunocompromised individuals, can cause serious, life-threatening B cell lymphomas. In solid organ transplant
(SOT) recipients these EBV+ B cell lymphomas are the most serious manifestation of the group of
heterogeneous lymphoproliferations termed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Predisposing
factors for PTLD include primary EBV infection, reactivation of EBV in recipient B cells, and impaired T cell
immunity due to immunosuppression. There are major gaps in our understanding of how specific viral genes
contribute to lymphomagenesis in the context of EBV+ PTLD and whether there are specific alterations in the
immune response to EBV in SOT that develop EBV+ PTLD compared to those that do not. Prior work from our
group has focused on latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the major oncogene of EBV, to better understand
EBV+ PTLD pathogenesis. In a recent prospective, multicenter clinical trial in SOT recipients we demonstrated
that specific gain of function mutations in LMP1 significantly correlate with the development of EBV+ PTLD.
We’ve also demonstrated that EBV alters the host cell microRNA profile and that this has direct effects on survival
of EBV+ B lymphoma cells. Building on our previous innovative studies of the bidirectional interactions between
EBV and host immunity, and using our unique Biorepository of samples from SOT recipients that developed
EBV+ PTLD and matched SOT controls that did not develop EBV+ PTLD, we propose to define the impact of
viral genetic diversity on protective immune responses to EBV. We hypothesize that EBV genetic diversity leads
to alterations in viral gene function and immune recognition that contribute to the pathogenesis of EBV+ PTLD.
To test this hypothesis we propose the following Specific Aims:1) Determine the genetic diversity of EBV in PTLD
and the impact on host cell function 2) Determine the effect of EBV+ PTLD-associated genetic diversity on host
immunity to EBV and 3) Determine how extracellular vesicles and microRNA contribute to the development of
EBV+ PTLD. We anticipate these studies will identify novel mechanisms underlying the EBV-driven
pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas in PTLD and will reveal new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to prevent
and treat EBV+ B cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed and immunocompromised individuals."
10755176,"Project Summary (Abstract)
We propose a multi-scale (from neurons to regions) theory that enables us to analyze neural computations from
large sets of neurons engaging in a variety of simple to complex tasks. Advances in recording techniques in
neuroscience have enabled simultaneous recordings of a large number of neural activities, providing greater
access to signals in the brain, but also presenting a challenge in analyzing these high-dimensional neural
activities in an interpretable way. Recently, we have developed a theoretical framework, which we call the
Manifold Capacity Theory (MCT) framework, to analytically connect the geometric structure of neural activities
to the capacity of a task-implementing readout. This work provides a new theoretical framework and data analysis
algorithms to measure the efficiency of neural population data on representing the stimuli invariantly, and on
implementing a given task. In Aim 1, we will use the MCT framework to characterize how properties of single
neuron tuning curves collectively shape the geometry of neural manifolds. In particular we will focus on properties
such as the number of tuning curves, and the maximum firing rate of tuning curves, as well as distribution
properties such as tuning heterogeneity. Next, in Aim 2, by utilizing machine-learning based neural network
modeling methods and new geometrical analysis framework, and we will develop a new modeling paradigm ideal
for answering how neural representations become transformed across brain regions or layers of the circuit
hierarchy, and across acquisition of a task, both in biological brains and neural network models. Our preliminary
analysis shows that geometric frameworks can produce population-level hypotheses on different mechanisms
employed by different network architectures, and employed by acquisition of a task. Finally, in Aim 3, we utilize
measures from Manifold Capacity Theory as design principles for developing artificial neural network models of
the brain. Combined together, these studies will lay a groundwork for using geometrical frameworks and machine
learning tools for (1) describing high-dimensional neural data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, (2)
testing hypothesis on geometric mechanisms underlying neural circuit motifs and learning rules in shaping
manifold representations, and (3) building novel algorithms for generating brain models and machine-generated
hypotheses. In summary, the goals of this proposal are to develop a new class of multi-level framework for
analyzing neural representations, by connecting single-neuron structure to population-level geometry to task-
level efficiency, and validate the new geometric tools using machine-learning generated neural network models
as a testbed and hypothesis generator. Accomplishing these goals will lead to new theoretical principles and
computational analysis paradigms that can be generalized across multiple spatiotemporal scales, across
different modalities and brain regions. This in turn can lead to widely applicable quantitative tools in the broader
neuroscience community, for understanding the neuronal basis of implementing behavioral and cognitive tasks
in animals and humans."
10756140,"Project Summary
We will use the `incubation of craving' model to study a major challenge in treating cocaine addiction, that is, the
persistence of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse even after long periods of abstinence. In this model, rats
exhibit progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced craving after withdrawal from extended-access
cocaine self-administration. Incubation of craving also occurs in humans. Previously, we showed that Ca2+-
permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs; homomeric GluA1) accumulate in synapses on medium spiny neurons
(MSN) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core after ~30 days of withdrawal. Thereafter, their activation is required
for expression of incubated cocaine craving. Thus, understanding CP-AMPAR plasticity may provide clues about
how the intensity of craving is regulated. Work from our lab and others has shown that cocaine withdrawal is
associated with multiple adaptations that predict reduced activity or Ca2+ signaling in NAc MSN. However, little
is known about how this might be linked to CP-AMPAR insertion. A promising candidate is a form of homeostatic
plasticity involving retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Work in hippocampal neurons has shown that Ca2+ levels
associated with ongoing synaptic transmission are sufficient to suppress RA synthesis. However, after a period
of inactivity, RA synthesis is disinhibited. This increases GluA1 translation, enabling a homeostatic increase in
synaptic strength via insertion of homomeric GluA1 CP-AMPARs. CP-AMPAR accumulation in the NAc core
during incubation of craving may likewise involve reduced Ca2+ (see above) and we recently showed that it is
associated with increased GluA1 translation. Based on these similarities to RA-mediated homeostatic plasticity
in hippocampus and on other data, we hypothesize that cocaine withdrawal is associated with decreased Ca2+
signaling in MSN, leading to disinhibition of RA synthesis, increased GluA1 translation and increased synaptic
levels of homomeric GluA1 CP-AMPARs. Aim 1 will test the relationship between excitatory transmission, RA
synthesis, and GluA1 translation in cultured NAc MSN (co-cultured with cortical cells to restore glutamate inputs).
Aim 2 will use fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that baseline Ca2+ in NAc core MSN is reduced during
cocaine withdrawal, although it may transiently increase during cue-induced seeking tests and this increase may
be augmented as incubation of craving occurs. Transgenic rats expressing Cre recombinase in D1 or A2a
receptor-positive MSN (A2a is a marker for D2 MSN) will enable both MSN populations to be studied. In Aim 3,
whole-cell patch clamp recordings in identified D1 or A2a NAc core MSN will determine if acute manipulation of
RA signaling alters CP-AMPAR levels and if protein translation is involved. Then, we will determine if knocking
down a critical RA synthetic enzyme in NAc core during cocaine withdrawal attenuates CP-AMPAR accumulation
and maintenance of incubated craving after long withdrawal. Conversely, we will knock down the enzyme that
degrades RA in saline rats to determine if a long-term increase in RA is sufficient to increase CP-AMPARs.
Overall, our studies will use state-of-the-art tools to test a conceptually novel hypothesis for incubation of craving."

Pathways to biomedical careers are exceptionally difficult for first generation, limited income
college students and other undergraduate students from underrepresented populations. Student
learning and professional development researchers have identified a critical role for an inclusive

goal of the proposed program is to help students gain necessary skills, embrace an identity as a
scientist, join a community of scientists, and embark on a biomedical career. To accomplish this,
the investigators will create the ISU Bridges to Research Careers (BRC) program. The objective
of this grant is to create a pathway to biomedical careers for undergraduate students from
underrepresented populations by interweaving a mentoring program for freshmen college
students from underrepresented populations; a bacteriophage discovery & bioinformatics course
developing biomedical research skills using an NIAID-relevant model system; and a biomedical
research network that will provide authentic research opportunities for participants in labs
conducting NIAID-relevant research. The proposed BRC program will effectively reach
undergraduates early in their college career and guide them as they develop into scientists and
embark on biomedical careers. The program efficiently leverages existing activities, providing
tangible opportunities for underserved Idahoans and training participants to meet our nation’s
future biomedical research workforce needs. The BRC program also adheres to best practices
for development of young scientists, creating an iREC that facilitates the development of
participant self-image as a scientist, enhances persistence, and prepares students for

 Despite the dismal five-year overall survival rate, a moderate response rate to treatments, and one of
the highest suicide rates among cancer patients, human papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNCs) are curable if diagnosed early. Oral epithelial dysplasias (OEDs) and oral lichen planus
(OLP) are potentially premalignant lesions that offer a window for disease eradication. The current standard of
care for these precursor lesions involves H.&E. histologic grading and long-term clinical follow-ups. Most of
OEDs and OLP do not progress to cancer. However, a significant challenge is that it is impossible to maintain
high-frequency follow-ups for every patient with OED or OLP. Emerging adjunct clinical technologies often
evaluate diagnostic success based on their power to detect “high-grade” OEDs. However, the WHO histologic
grading of OED has little, if any, prognostic value in determining the transformation risks. In addition, the
histologic grading of OEDs has low inter-observer and intra-observer consistency with the kappa-values and
strength of agreement rated slight-to-poor. As a result, the American Dental Association has not recommended
any adjunct diagnostic modalities for OED/OLP. Before we can deploy impactful early detection technologies,
we must improve our understanding of the biology of high-risk OEDs. We first learn from decades of clinical
observations. During the clinical examinations, erythematous color change and induration warrant a biopsy.
These features indicate early inflammatory and mechanical changes in the microenvironment of initiating
HNCs. Thus, we generated high-fidelity, genetically engineered mouse models to recapitulate these immune
and mechanical alterations over the course of HNC initiation. These models are uniquely poised to establish
the high-risk markers due to their 100% malignant transformation rate in the oral mucosa. Through robust
longitudinal monitoring, we have uncovered an initial set of immunometabolic markers whose signals emerge
before the HNC histology appears. This program will discover a comprehensive set of high-risk features and
employ advanced machine learning to generate a weighted risk score, which will be validated through our
extensive collections of low-risk leukoplakia and transformed OED/OLP human specimens. To support the
robust on-slide technology, we also developed an optical biopsy tool, approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, to perform non-invasive monitoring of molecular markers at a microscopic resolution below oral
mucosal surfaces. This milestone-driven program will leverage the strengths of precision in high-fidelity
modeling for transforming OEDs, the extensive translational resources, a cutting-edge optical biopsy platform,
and single-cell technologies to extend the human senses in conventional histology and clinical examination of
OED to unprecedented molecular levels. This integrated effort will inform transformative on-slide and optical
biopsy ancillary tools to capture high-risk OEDs at the earliest phase for HNC prevention."

The Pitt Trauma Research Training Program (Pitt TRTP) is focused on the training of physician-
scientists and a few full-time PhDs in trauma, sepsis, and related pathobiological process including
wound repair and tissue engineering. Progress in complex clinical fields such as trauma and
sepsis requires investigative teams collectively possessing skills in diverse areas of research.
These specialized research areas span the rapidly advancing disciplines within clinical and basic
research and thus, require scientists capable of managing and evaluating high dimensional data
sets, other scientists facile skilled in reverse translating clinical observations into relevant
preclinical models (both small and large animals), and finally, investigators well-versed in the
design and execution of clinical trials and assessing optimal strategies to improve outcomes in
acutely ill trauma/surgical patients. To address these inter- and multidisciplinary needs, we have
organized the Pitt TRTP around two broad tracks: 1) the Clinical Research Track; and 2) the
Basic Research Track. Track Oversight Committees (TOC) with demonstrated expertise oversee
each track, which in turn consists of expert faculty fully engaged with the program. These
investigators have worked together for many years in collaborative, multidisciplinary teams.
Customized training plans are developed for each trainee and approved by the TOCs. The Pitt
TRTP leverages extensive local resources at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
including robust clinical and research programs in trauma, acute care surgery, Surgical Critical

10774277,"Class V dental restorations, those on the lower third of the tooth, are the least durable type of dental restoration and are quickly increasing in placement due to a rapidly aging society. Water and bacteria mediated destruction of the dentin/restoration interface is the main cause of failure. Maintenance of integrity between the restorative material and surrounding tissue is an unexplored route to increase lifespans of Class V restorations to shield the vulnerable adhesive interface from bacteria-mediated degradation, promote restoration stability, and increase restoration aesthetics. Tissue attachment to current Class V restorative surfaces does not occur as current restorative materials lack any activity designed to influence tissue responses. This lack of attachment reveals the vulnerable dentin/restoration interface and exacerbates Class V failure. Functional tissues near Class V restorations may be able to naturally prevent subgingival plaque and lead to longer lifespans by exploiting the tissue. Our central goal is to develop new materials and apply experimental approaches toward reducing Class V failure.  In Aim 1, we aim to understand oral cellular activation responsible for signaling and test candidate molecules for their ability to survive enzymatic degradation. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate our system enables biocompatible, facile, rapid, and robust delivery of biofunctional molecules to the material surface and retains molecules through a series of challenges meant to simulate the oral environment. The results will potentially extend lifespans of Class V dental restorative materials and reduce longterm healthcare costs.

Improved understanding of these techniques will further my progress toward becoming an independent academic researcher at a dental school."
10746831,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Oral commensal microbes, including oral streptococci, are increasingly recognized as an essential
component in the development of periodontal disease. Commensals contribute to the recruitment and growth of
keystone disease-initiating microbes and are part of the dysbiotic disease-associated microbiome.
 Innate immune phagocytes, including macrophages, also play an essential role in the development of
periodontal disease, and phagocytes themselves are phenotypically diverse. Interactions between phagocytes
and keystone pathogens are well studied. However, relatively little is understood of the interactions between
phagocytes and commensal streptococci. Also unknown is how an initial immune disruption by keystone
pathogens can alter host immune interactions with oral streptococci that may enhance the latter’s contribution to
disease.
 We have data highlighting a novel, yet counterintuitive, relationship between macrophages and S. gordonii:
the bacterium is better able survive within, and promote enhanced cytokine release from, inflammatory
macrophages. This new data, along with the knowledge that active periodontitis lesions have an increase in
inflammatory macrophages leads us to our central hypothesis that upon initiation of inflammation, changes in
macrophage-oral streptococci interactions allow the normally commensal bacterium to increase resistance to
destruction and leads to enhanced cytokine production and inflammation. We will test our hypothesis by 1)
assessing the molecular details of phagosomal escape and subsequent inflammatory promotion of S. gordonii
within phagocytes, 2) determine the mechanisms of S. gordonii inflammatory modulation of macrophages initially
activated by the keystone pathogen P. gingivalis and 3) begin to examine the in vivo mechanisms of increased
S. gordonii survival within inflammatory macrophages.
 The overall aim of this research is to increase our understanding of the consequences of changes in host-
commensal interactions upon initiation of inflammation. The rationale is that with an increased understanding of
the conditions and molecular mechanisms by which commensals can act as pathobionts, we will achieve a first
step in the long-term goal of developing new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of oral
bacterial-associated inflammatory diseases."
10746833,"Herpesviruses are associated with a variety of disease in the human host, ranging from asymptomatic
infections to life threatening disease, including encephalitis and cancer. In addition to playing a direct role in
cancer genesis, herpesviruses pose an increased risk to cancer patients who may develop debilitating and life-
threatening herpesvirus infections. Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions, even if clinically not apparent,
can facilitate the transfer of HIV-infected cells or free virus from one individual to another, and HIV infection
and AIDS increase the risks of developing certain kinds of cancer. HSV-1 serves as a prototypic herpesvirus
family member and provides an ideal model to understand the requirements for virus infection since it
replicates well in cell culture and many reagents have been developed for its study. In particular, the study of
HSV-1 entry has proven useful in the understanding the mechanism of Epstein-Bar Virus (EBV)and Kaposi
Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV) – two herpesviruses associated with cancer in human infections. Herpesvirus
entry into cells requires fusion of the outer envelope of the virus with a cell membrane. Spread of infection can
occur via infectious virus or virus-induced cell fusion. The ultimate objective of studies described here is to
understand how herpesviruses, specifically HSV-1, induce membrane fusion, the process required for viral
entry and cell fusion. Requirements for HSV-induced membrane fusion include the coordinated activities of
four HSV glycoproteins (gD, the hererodimeric gHgL complex, and gB) and specific cellular receptors. Our
central hypothesis is that gD, present in the viral envelope or on an infected cell surface, binds to a cellular
receptor, such as nectin-1, on an uninfected cell and activates gHgL and gB via protein-protein interactions,
resulting in fusion mediated by gB. In three aims, we plan to define the sequence requirements and domains of
gD, gH/gL and gB that are required to mediate membrane fusion and to investigate means to stabilize gB so
that prefusion gB can be studied. The results of these studies will lead to an understanding of the mechanism
of herpesvirus-induced membrane fusion and to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of
herpesvirus infections."
10746834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) remain major causes of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) recipients. Because of the substantial use of antibiotics in these patients, their gut
microbiome balance is perturbed and becomes dominated by MDROs, vancomycin-resistant enterococci
(VRE) in particular. This disturbance is associated with subsequent invasive infections such as bacteremia that
can lead to fatal outcome. Restoration of the normal balance of the gut flora and reduction or control of MDRO
colonization may curtail these complications and improve outcomes. One innovative approach to restore the
microbiome balance of the gut flora and reduce colonization with MDROs in HCT recipients is the
administration of bacteriophages (i.e., phages). Phages are ubiquitous and natural entities, present in the
environment and in our bodies, and capable of lysing specific pathogens without disturbing the host’s normal
flora while averting the collateral damage of antimicrobial usage. My long-term research goal is to understand
how phages contribute to host-microbe interactions and their overall impact on the health of HCT recipients.
Our preliminary data indicate that VRE colonization can cause inflammation in the gut of germ-free wild-type
mice. Additionally, we found that phages are present in high numbers in HCT patients’ stool samples and that
VRE phages can be recovered from environmental samples and can lyse a variety of VRE strains in a larva
model. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the interactions between phages, the gut
bacterial microbiome, and host responses in VRE-colonized HCT recipients and to identify biomarkers in the
gut phage population predisposing patients to complications such as bacterial infections or graft versus host
disease. The central hypothesis for this project is that VRE phages can restore balance in the gut microbiota
by reducing inflammation and VRE colonization in HCT recipients. My ultimate goal is to generate significant
findings and new hypotheses for an R01 application aiming at (1) optimizing the design of a chemotherapy-
treated bone marrow-reconstituted mouse model mimicking the condition of HCT patients, (2) testing the
efficacy of phages and phages+antibiotic synergy in preventing major MDRO infections in this mouse model,
and (3) validating the role of certain phage populations in predicting and preventing poor outcomes. The
rationale is that this line of work will provide supportive evidence for future development and evaluation of a
phage-based intervention in humans. My long-term career goal is to become a leading investigator with
expertise in the design of effective and safe phage-based natural therapeutic products that may restore a

improving their overall health outcomes. The proposal will aid in the fight against MDROs by curtailing the
incidence of MDRO colonization and infections and by improving survival and quality-of-life of HCT recipients."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is incurable. Lack of dystrophin is the culprit. While the ultimate solution
to this devastating disease is to restore dystrophin, the scientific and medical communities actively seek to
discover and fix key secondary factors. We study a corrective role of phosphorylated Connexin-43 (Cx43) as a
potential secondary factor in DMD cardiomyopathy. Cx43 forms gap junction channels at the intercalated disc
(ID) of the cardiomyocytes (CMs). The gap junction helps the heart to beat in unison. We found that dystrophic
CMs exhibit pathological Cx43 remodeling – that is Cx43 lateralization away from the ID. Lateralized Cx43
proteins remain as hemichannels, allowing for an undesired passage of ions and metabolites to and from the
extracellular space of the CM. Cx43 remodeling contributes to arrhythmic events, stress-induced lethality and
long-term fibrotic cardiomyopathy in DMD. Our long-term goal is to improve cardiac function in DMD patients
by identifying secondary targets for pharmaceutical agents to protect against heart failure. In this grant
proposal, we postulate that the microtubule (MT) network is the connector between dystrophin loss and Cx43
remodeling and that phospho-Cx43 can fix the dystrophic MTs. Our central hypothesis is that Cx43 remodeling
and pathology are linked to a dystrophic, disorganized microtubule that triggers X-ROS elevation and oxidation
of CaMKII to affect the phospho-status of Cx43. Reciprocally, changes in the phospho-status of Cx43 affects
the phospho-status of b-tubulin. As a result of this loop, Cx43/MT normalization corrects downstream effectors,
with an ultimate impact on arrhythmias and long-term fibrosis. We also believe that, in addition of suppressing
Cx43 pathological remodeling, phospho-Cx43 stabilizes critical members of the intercalated disc. We will first
determine if Cx43 remodeling mediates pathology triggered by a dystrophic microtubule cytoskeleton (Aim1).
We will investigate if a phospho-mimic form (serine 172) of b-tubulin phenocopies the beneficial effect of
colchicine (an inhibitor of MT polymerization) mediated by phospho-Cx43 in dystrophic MTs. We will also test
an alternative role for phospho-Cx43 as a scaffold stabilizer. We expect to demonstrate a regulatory interplay
between MT and Cx43, in which one phospho-player rescues the other. We will then determine if and to what
extent NOX2 and oxidized CaMKII promote Cx43 remodeling and pathology. We will also test if Cx43 is a
direct target of CaMKII (Aim2). We expect that important aspects of the Cx43-mediated pathobiology of the
hearts of dystrophic mice will be prevented when X-ROS and oxidized-CaMKII are targeted. Impactfully, the
microtubules link the lack of dystrophin with Cx43 remodeling. Phospho-mimic mutations appear to correct the
dystrophic microtubule hyperdynamics, suppress Cx43 remodeling, and to protect the intercalated disc. The
study of phospho-Cx43 will lead to new treatments of DMD-cardiomyopathy."

The 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the Americas have become a major global health concern due to
their association with pre-natal birth defects such as microcephaly. Since the last outbreak, ZIKV has spilled
back to the wildlife to establish persistent reservoir populations, and this has sparked concerns of future sylvatic
transmissions that could ignite the next pandemic. Although ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been
associated with microcephaly, it is important to note that premature cranial suture fusion (craniosynostosis)
has been reported in 88% of babies with severe ZIKV infection and there is an ~22-fold increase in risk of
developing craniosynostosis in ZIKV-infected babies compared to genetic occurrence. Aberrant osteogenic
activation in the skull suture mesenchyme leads to premature cranial suture fusion, called craniosynostosis. In
fact, ~30% of a prospective Brazilian cohort of ZIKV-exposed children showed delayed childhood
neurodevelopment and neurosensory alterations. This indicates the craniofacial deformities are linked to
severe neurodevelopmental defects. Despite serious health concern, no study has been done for ZIKV-induced
craniosynostosis. Our preliminary observations in a 438 Brazilian cohort showed cranial suture fusions in ZIKV-
infected infants. Intriguingly, prenatal ZIKV-infection. Using immunocompetent hSTAT2 KI mouse model, we
demonstrated that prenatal ZIKV infection resulted in vertical transmission of virus to fetus side, resulting in
severe birth defects such as microcephaly, brain calcification and craniosynostosis. Using this in vivo ZIKV
mouse model, we have demonstrated significant downregulation of Gli1 expression, while osteogenic
differentiation gene expression was significantly increased in sagittal suture tissues of ZIKV-infected mice.
Surprisingly, ZIKV expression library screen showed that NS1 was sufficient to induce osteogenic differentiation
in cranial osteoprogenitor cells. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that ZIKV infects cranial
suture mesenchyme cells to induce osteogenic differentiation of GLI1+ cells and craniosynostosis.
Herein, I seek to address the following questions: (i) which host suture cell types are targeted for ZIKV-induced
craniofacial suture fusion in vivo, (ii) characterize the host transcriptomic landscape of ZIKV-infected calvaria
suture microenvironment, and (iii) which and how ZIKV proteins triggers craniofacial suture fusion upon infection.
This proposal is highly innovative and translational, and potentially shed new insights to congenital ZIKV-induced
fetal cranial suture anomalies."

Breast tumors are rarely eradicated by chemotherapy. Residual disease exists for 2 reasons: the tumor cells 1)
avoid death from apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and nutrient deprivation; 2) avoid immune clearance. Our
previous research has established that by activating p53-mediated programs of arrest and senescence, tumor
cells avoid death by mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis, and nutrient deprivation. We showed chemotherapy treated
breast cancer patients with p53 wild type tumors have dismal survival compared to patients with p53 mutant
tumors. Senescent cells promote relapse by their production of cytokines and chemokines (termed the
senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP).
The weakness of prior research has been a failure to identify how the treated, senescent tumor cells avoid
immune clearance. In this proposal, we present compelling preliminary data addressing this weakness, and
plans to fully characterize and investigate potential therapeutic avenues that target the evasion of cell death,
thus facilitating immune clearance and improving survival. In preliminary data, we identify a remarkable
upregulation of PD-L1 in the persisting residual disease likely mediated through interactions with stromal cells,
and expression is maintained in the relapse, suggesting a strong selective pressure.
The goal of this project is to identify mechanisms and develop strategies to target immune evasion specifically
in tumor cells that have survived chemotherapy by entering senescence.
Hypothesis: Stromal interferon gamma (IFNγ) induces PD-L1 in a specific subset of cells in a chemotherapy-
treated, senescent tumor. These persisting, senescent tumor cells can be targeted using a novel strategy that
combines senolytic drugs to induce immunogenic cell death followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors.
In Aim 1 we will use mouse mammary tumor models to determine if PD-L1 expressing tumor cells have greater
relapse potential than cells within the same treated tumor that do not express PD-L1, and how each responds to
retreatment. We will characterize gene expression differences in cells that express PD-L1 vs. those that do not.
In Aim 2 we will identify the factors in vivo that are required for PD-L1 upregulation on senescent tumor cells.
We will transplant mammary tumors into syngeneic mice that lack specific immune components such as T cells,
treat with chemotherapy, and determine changes in PD-L1 expression and immune contexture.
In Aim 3, preliminary data show only one third of senescent mouse mammary tumors responded to anti-PD-L1
therapy following chemotherapy. We will test if inducing immunogenic cell death with BH3 mimetic drugs we
have shown to have senolytic activity can improve the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
In Aim 4, we will use multiplex immunohistochemistry staining of human breast cancer specimens pre and post
chemotherapy to determine if PD-L1 expression is induced in senescent tumors."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2), has exploded into a global pandemic causing significant loss of life, pronounced economic impact and
significant long-term medical impacts which are still being characterized. Despite impressive protection afforded
by the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which are primarily mediated by antibody neutralization of virus, these
antibodies wane over time and new viral variants have emerged that are less susceptible toby these antibodies.
A major question is whether memory T cells afford more long-lasting protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Prior studies showed that people who recovered from SARS-CoV infection from 2003 exhibited SARS-CoV-
specific memory CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood for up to 11 years, virus-specific antibodies were not
detectable at 6 years, and there was no cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV peptide1,2. For the current pandemic,
we are starting to learn what types of memory T and B cells form after SARS-Cov2 infection in the blood, however
we have no idea the longevity of these responses. More importantly, we know very little about the pulmonary
memory T and B cells that form in the lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection and, based on what has been
learned from other viruses, these may be the most protective memory cells needed for superior long-
term immunity to reinfection.
 In this collaborative proposal between the Teijaro, Kaech and Farber labs, we bring together world-
 class expertise in anti-viral immunity and lung pathogenesis, immunological memory and human immunology
 to study the development and protective role of lung-resident TRM cells in SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 1, we will
study the fundamentals of SARS-CoV-2 TRM development in the lungs of hACE2-transgenic mice and
 determine whether TRM are required for long- term immunity, through genetic perturbations of Tgfbr2 and
 Smad4 in T cells, which are differentially required for TRM differentiation3, and the depletion of circulating
 memory cells. In Aim 2, we will examine if lung TRM cells contribute to the protection afforded by mRNA
 vaccines to better understand the role, if any, of memory T cells in mediating protection to SARS-CoV-2 and
 notable variants of concern (VOC). Lastly, in Aim 3, we extend and complement our studies in mice to Dr.
 Farber’s human donor repository to assess human memory formation following SARS-CoV-2 infection and
 vaccination. We hope to answer the basic question of which types of memory T cells form after SARS-
 CoV-2 infection and confer long-term protective immunity to this virus and VOCs. These studies will
 provide critical information related to the quality of immunological memory that forms after SARS-CoV-
 2 infection in mice and humans and will serve to guide current and future vaccine development."

Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) affects up to 50% of persons living with HIV (PWH), including individuals with
well-controlled infection. Biological sex is an important determinant of NCI among PWH. The strongest
available evidence indicates that women with HIV have greater cognitive deficits globally than men with HIV
and, most prominently, in learning, memory, and processing speed. Although women make up half of the
world’s HIV population, few studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying sex differences in the
prevalence and pathogenesis of NCI in PWH, despite the consequences that these differences could have on
developing distinct therapeutic approaches to NCI for women and men.
At least two pathways may differentially impact cognitive health in women and men with HIV, both through their
association with cerebrovascular injury: (1) cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and (2) immune
activation and inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that NCI is more prevalent in women with HIV than in
men with HIV due to greater burden and progression of cerebrovascular injury from increased susceptibility to
the effects of CVD risk factors and immune activation. In Aim 1, we will determine if sex modifies the
association of CVD risk factors and immune activation with cerebrovascular injury in PWH. In Aim 2, we will
compare the burden and progression of cerebrovascular injury between women and men with HIV. In Aim 3,
we will examine the extent to which cerebrovascular injury mediates the higher prevalence of NCI and decline
in women with HIV and if sex modifies the association between cerebrovascular injury and NCI.
To achieve our aims, we propose a prospective study that will leverage the research platform provided by the
NIH-funded Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined
Cohort Study (MWCCS). We will enroll 150 women (100 post-menopausal and 50 pre-menopausal women)
and 100 age-matched men from the MWCCS to ensure the study is adequately powered to determine if sex
modifies the associations between CVD risk factors, immune activation, cerebrovascular injury, and NCI. To
the longitudinal neuropsychological data and stored blood specimens collected in the MWCCS study, we will
add a comprehensive cerebrovascular imaging assessment, including of cerebral vasoreactivity, large artery,
and small vessel disease, that will yield a complete profile of cerebrovascular injury. We will also measure
immune activation and inflammatory markers that are associated with both cerebrovascular injury and NCI in
PWH and have been shown to be higher in women compared with men. The findings of this study will provide
new information on sex differences in the burden and progression of cerebrovascular disease and in the
pathogenesis of NCI in PWH, which will inform the rational design of clinical trials, including the target study
population, in which to test interventions to prevent and treat NCI in PWH."

Children born very preterm (VPT; <32 weeks’ gestation) face a disproportionate burden of neurodevelopmental
impairments (NDI). Impairments in the subdomains of mathematics, reading, and behavior are the most common
NDI, affecting 25-50% of VPT children. These abilities are critical to school readiness and success at work. In
the first cycle of this grant, we assembled the largest North American cohort of VPT infants and performed
advanced brain MRI at term corrected age (CA) with longitudinal neurodevelopmental assessments. We
demonstrated the clinical importance of diffuse white matter abnormality (DWMA) and multiple other novel MRI
biomarkers to enhance prediction of short-term NDI at 2 or 3 years CA. During this second funding cycle, our
unique cohort will reach the critical early school ages of 5 to 7 years, when higher-order cognitive abilities in
math and reading, emotional self-regulation, and behavior become more apparent and accurately testable. The
ability to accurately predict these functions several years earlier could enable early interventions. Assessment
of the dynamic trajectories of NDI in VPT children and their modifiable environmental and biologic causes can
also accelerate the development of targeted neuroprotective interventions during these critical early years when
neuroplasticity is at its peak. The overall objectives of this proposal are to map the early childhood trajectory of
brain structural and functional changes and develop early and accurate prognostic models of school readiness.
Our rationale is that elucidation of the long-term impact of DWMA, identification of the trajectory and mediators
of NDI changes, and robust prognostic models of school readiness will enable novel early intervention trials in
targeted VPT infants. To achieve our goals, we will perform morphometric, diffusion, and functional MRI at age
5 and comprehensive developmental testing at 5 and 7 years CA in our cohort of VPT children and a matched
group of term-control children. To advance this highly impactful area of research, we propose the following three
specific aims: (1) Determine the impact of DWMA at term CA on brain development and functional impairments
at age 5; (2) Model individual trajectories of NDI and identify the mediators of neurodevelopmental changes
between 3 and 7 years CA; and (3) Develop early prognostic models of school readiness. For the first aim we
will correlate objectively quantified DWMA volume at term CA with brain structural and functional connectivity
derived from advanced MRI and with higher-order cognitive functions, both at 5 years CA. Under Aim 2, we will
plot individual trajectories of neurodevelopmental scores and identify the mediators of trajectory change between
3 and 7 years CA. For the third aim, we will apply the rich collection of clinical, biologic, and neurodevelopmental
data collected between birth and 3 years CA to predict our three measures of school readiness at 5 and 7 years
CA. This study will provide U.S. population-based prevalence data about the long-term adverse neuroanatomic
and functional consequences of VPT birth, identify mediators of NDI change, and facilitate early prediction of
school readiness to enable targeted EI and novel randomized clinical trials for VPT children."
10772390,"ABSTRACT – Genomic Imprinting in the Development of NAFLD
By 2030, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is projected to affect more than 100 million
Americans, including 10 million children. NAFLD results from overaccumulation of fat in the liver and
can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality
even among children and adolescents. Accumulating evidence indicates that early life exposures alter
gene expression and influence the risk for NAFLD, but regions of the genome targeted by these
exposures remain unclear. We hypothesize that aberrant methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs),
discrete loci which regulate expression of specific genes and the function of gene networks, contributes
substantially to NAFLD. Measuring the impact of epigenetic modifications that alter NAFLD risk has
been challenging due to the lack of tools for comprehensive measurement of epigenetic modifications,
longitudinal data, cohort diversity, accurate non-invasive markers of liver fat and fibrosis, as well as the
temporal ambiguity between exposure and outcomes. To overcome these obstacles, we have
comprehensively identified DNA methylation-controlled regulatory regions for genomically imprinted
genes, many of which are implicated in metabolic disease, growth and development. Once established
in the gametes, these ICRs are stably transmitted during mitotic cell division and are thus very similar
across tissues. Importantly, imprinted genes play key roles in growth and metabolism, underscoring
plausibility in the etiology of NAFLD. The overarching goal is to utilize these novel ICRs to identify
methylation changes associated with NAFLD development. We will leverage the resources of our multi-
ethnic, pre-birth, longitudinal cohort, the Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST) to evaluate the oldest
500 children (17-21 years). We will identify ICRs at birth associated with increased liver fat, NAFLD,
and liver fibrosis using magnetic resonance imaging as well as intermediate markers of NAFLD and
metabolic dysfunction. ICR methylation will be examined in relation to metabolic outcomes, sex,
ethnicity and early life exposures. A 1-year follow-up of 200 adolescents will determine stability of the
associations. Finally, we will validate the ICR status of NAFLD-associated genes in different tissue
types to determine their ability to serve as early markers of disease risk. This proposal will contribute
significantly to knowledge on the relationship between genomic imprinting and NAFLD and clarify risk-
mediating regions and exposures that can be used to develop early detection and therapeutic tools to
combat the NAFLD epidemic."
10775825,"The neurological consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) in children is not fully understood. The inability to
accurately assess motor, sensation and extent of injury in the pediatric population raises speculation about
diagnoses, recovery potential, and treatment effectiveness. This proposed study builds upon the team's
previous work to establish quantitative imaging biomarkers using advanced imaging methods such as diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and atrophy estimated through a spinal cord cross
sectional area (SCCSA) – in pediatric SCI patients. In the recent years magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
methods such as DTI, DKI, SCCSA measurements, and Neurite Orientation Density Dispersion Imaging
(NODDI) have shown promising results as powerful and non-invasive biomarkers to evaluate the spinal cord
(SC) in children. To the best of our knowledge, our research team is the only one thus far to apply these
imaging techniques to the pediatric population. Although all of these techniques have demonstrated potential
for providing microstructural information about the SC, the development and application of objective diffusion-
based biomarkers for identifying the precise location of the injured cord has been challenging because neither
a standard anatomical template of the pediatric SC nor biological age and sex matched normative values are
available. Hence, the first aim of this study is to create a standardized SC imaging template and establish
SCCSA measurements of the entire pediatric SC between 6-17 years of age. The second aim of this study will
establish normative multishell diffusion imaging values for continuous segments of the cervical-thoracic
pediatric SC between 6-17 years of age. This work will result in standardization and consistent interpretation of
these neuroimaging metrics and will reduce user variability. A sub aim of this work is to demonstrate the
feasibility of these imaging biomarkers in a group of children with chronic motor complete (American Spinal
Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A and B) SCI. This work will address a significant knowledge gap by
providing functional imaging biomarkers to clinicians and researchers so they can objectively determine the
extent of severity and level of injury and develop prediction models in pediatric SCI. This work would also aid
clinicians in assessing neurological recovery, and evaluate treatment effectiveness in clinical trials. In addition,
these imaging biomarkers and normative templates can be extended to other pediatric SC diseases in the
future."

 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is an opportunistic, environmental bacterium that is a leading cause of
hospital acquired infections and chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. Despite Pa’s clinical relevance,
how Pa transitions from its environmental reservoir to infect humans is not well understood.
 Studies of Pa isolated from chronically infected patients have documented adaptations in Pa virulence,
biofilm formation, and metabolism over time in the CF lung environment. Many of these characteristics, or
phenotypes, are associated with changes in cyclic di-GMP (cdG), a regulatory nucleotide. Preliminarily, I have
screened a library of 53 cdG metabolism transposon mutants and found three that have altered phenotypes
when grown in media that mimics the nutrients in the CF airway. As is reported in the literature, I have also
observed phenotypic variability, or heterogeneity, of cdG concentrations in individual cells within genetically
identical Pa populations as measured by a fluorescent reporter I adapted. As cdG plays a central role in
regulating clinically relevant behaviors of Pa, I propose to establish the relationship between the three cdG
enzyme candidates and fitness within individual Pa cells in conditions that model the nutrient environment of
the CF lung using time lapse microscopy in the first aim. I will follow up on the result by investigating the role of
these candidates in cdG metabolism and phenotypic heterogeneity and of cdG on fitness.
 In a second aim, this proposal will take an unbiased approach to identity metabolic pathways that are
differentially regulated in the three cdG metabolism mutants vs. wild-type bacteria upon transition into nutrient
environment of the CF lung. Deploying the same techniques as were used to evaluate cdG, the phenotypic
heterogeneity and correlation to fitness of differentially regulated metabolic pathways and impact of cdG in Pa
will be determined at the single cell level. Overall, this proposal will investigate the impact of cdG metabolism
on single cell fitness in conditions that model the CF lung environment. This, in turn, will provide needed
insight into how Pa successfully infects humans."

 Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that all children with disabilities
are provided with appropriate public education, there is an increasing inequity in the provision of speech-
language services across the U.S. due to the critical shortage of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in public
school settings. Telepractice is one way to mitigate the shortage issue. Currently available telepractice studies
have been conducted with small sample sizes and varying methodological rigor. In particular, to date no
treatment efficacy studies via telepractice have been conducted on children with a history of cleft palate (CP).
Children with repaired CP often develop compensatory articulation patterns which are not common in children
with speech disorders. It is imperative to identify whether telepractice is efficacious for children with repaired CP
to treat compensatory articulation. In evaluation of compensatory articulation errors, two major limitations exist
in the current literature. First, these errors are mainly examined based on the listener's auditory-perceptual
judgement without instrumental analysis; second, how speech perception plays a role in production of
compensatory articulation has not been fully investigated although ample evidence suggests interplay between
perception and production skills.
 As a Phase I randomized controlled trial (RCT), this proposal responds to the NIDCR Behavioral Social
Intervention Clinical Trial Planning & Implementation Cooperative Agreement (UG3/UH3). This proposal fits with
NIDCR's Strategic Plan in that it aims to develop and test an effective behavioral intervention for children with
oral and craniofacial disorders. Our aim during the UG3 one-year planning period is to (1) finalize the intervention
protocols, (2) develop the Manual of Operations, (3) develop custom software for the data management system,
and (4) stimuli and software development for the speech perception experiment in order to complete an unbiased
RCT design for the UH3 phase. Our primary aims during the UH3 phase are (Aim 1) to establish the efficacy of
telepractice speech intervention for children with repaired CP, and (Aim 2) to quantitatively define compensatory
articulation errors using instrumentation analyses, and (Aim 3) to determine speech perception deficits in children
with CP. This research will be clinically significant because Aim 1 will assist clinicians to make evidence-based
decisions to adopt a telepractice service delivery model to treat children with repaired CP. Aims 2-3 will provide
important clinical rationales to evaluate speech production using instrumental analyses and to identify speech
perception deficits when clinicians treat children with CP. The importance of this study is highlighted by the
current COVID-19 pandemic. The associated social-distancing restrictions have been imposed upon school
teachers and SLPs to adopt telepractice while continuing to provide educational and therapeutic services. Thus,
the results of the proposed study will meet an increasing demand for telepractice efficacy studies for children
with speech disorders."

The Cross-disciplinary Otitis Media Mentoring Network towards Diversity (COMMeND) is a first-of-its-kind
program within the otitis media (OM) community that will formalize existing collaborations into a mentoring
network and create new connections among OM researchers at different career stages, including early-stage or
new investigators (ESI-NIs) and individuals from under-represented minorities (URM). As the main cause of the
global burden of hearing loss in young children, OM is an important disease to study for its pathophysiology and
epidemiology and for which to design new strategies of prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, research that
are best done through international collaboration. Decades-long attrition in the OM workforce due to a very leaky
pipeline has led to loss of scientific and career opportunities. The main objective of COMMeND is to promote the
recruitment and retention of ESI-NIs and trainees from various disciplines and backgrounds in OM research. We
have put together a highly experienced leadership team and a pool of qualified OM faculty mentors and lecturers,
as well as garnered support from our home departments and two professional organizations with strong interest
in OM, namely the International Society for Otitis Media (ISOM) and the Association for Research in
Otolaryngology (ARO). To accomplish our goal, we have three Specific Aims: (1) To recruit into and retain
experienced faculty mentors and the top mentees (trainees and ESI-NIs) in COMMeND, with enrichment for
URM individuals using a holistic admissions approach; (2) To develop a mentoring network and program of
activities that will provide scientific, career and cultural training and foster cross-disciplinary and cultural
interactions among mentors and mentees, further enhancing our OM community; and (3) To monitor, evaluate
and disseminate program outcomes by career stage and demographics and use the collected data to improve
the COMMeND structure and activities. Following the successes of other training programs that are based on
best practices and social science theories, we outlined a year-long schedule of activities: one-on-one mentoring
sessions with an OM faculty mentor; webinars or didactics; grant reviews; travel awards to the ISOM and ARO
meetings; subsidies to short skills courses; focus group discussions and interviews; and in-person socials.
Mentors will undergo refresher courses including re-training on implicit bias, mentoring and the Responsible
Conduct of Research (RCR). We will also enlist peer mentors-coaches to check in with our yearly cohort of
mentees. The combination of these activities as applied to an international mentoring network backed by ISOM
as a professional society is innovative. Short-term outcomes for evaluation will include new funding or alternative
award mechanisms, graduation or promotion to the next stage, leadership positions in relevant organizations,
presentation of OM research, and publications. We will track the long-term progress of our mentees and whether
they continued with OM research at least 10 years after participation in the COMMeND program."

This U01-supported clinical trial will test a unique T follicular helper (Tfh)-targeting vaccine approach, “s3”, that
we predict will generate exceptionally broad and long-lived antigen-specific antibody responses, characteristics
likely to result in resilient vaccines that maintain protection over long periods. The “s3” adjuvant moiety is an anti-
CD3 antibody fragment (scFv) that safely induces a potent Tfh and B-cell response to an immunogen to which it
is fused. The combined immunogen simultaneously targets immunogen-specific B cells and local Tfh cells, thus
accelerating and expanding B-cell development. Using the RBD immunogen in a low dose Ad35 vector, we
showed in macaques that s3 safely stimulates high NAb titers that are stable for >10 months.
The major deficiencies of current SARS-COV-2 and other vaccines (such as influenza) are limited durability and
breadth of protection, even with booster vaccination. Over the course of 6 months, serum antibodies in COVID-
naïve vaccine recipients decline by one order of magnitude. Booster vaccination confers greater durability but
notable declines in serum NAb titers occur by 4-6 months. Limited mucosal IgA responses is another major
deficit that may underlie failure of current vaccine options to prevent acquisition at the site of virus entry. Finally,
the breadth of responses is limited, even with bivalent vaccines. These vaccine deficiencies have been linked
repeatedly to inadequate T-cell help. Thus, new approaches that provide abundant T-cell help, such as the
proposed s3 approach, are needed to deliver more effective SARS-CoV-2 as well as pancoronavirus, influenza,
and other vaccines.
We will test the safety and immunogenicity of the s3 adjuvant using Ad35 as the vector and the SARS-CoV-2
BA.5 receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the immunogen. We will compare a vaccine with s3 (CoTend-s3B)
against one lacking s3 (CoTend-B). The vaccines will be given as a “booster” vaccine on the background of prior
SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination. This approach will allow us to evaluate the ability of CoTend-s3B to (i)
boost pre-existing antibodies and (ii) recruit new naïve B cells with new specificity for BA.5 RBD.
Aim 1. Test safety of s3-adjuvanted/Tfh-targeted (CoTend-s3B) and unadjuvanted (CoTend-B) SARS-
CoV-2 RBD vaccines. The primary safety readouts are local and systemic reactions, grade 3+ adverse events
(AEs), serious adverse events, AEs of special interest (including thrombotic events), and anti-PF4 antibodies.
Aim 2. Evaluate intensity, breadth, and durability of adaptive immune responses to CoTend-s3B
compared to CoTend-B in blood and saliva. We hypothesize that Tfh responses to CoTend-s3B will support
NAb responses of sufficient breadth and potency for long-lived protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Aim 3. Examine the mechanisms of s3 adjuvant activity in germinal centers. Tfh targeting via s3 is predicted
to generate robust germinal-center reactions that democratize recruitment of naïve B cells and spur development
of long-lived plasma cells."

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, systemic arteriopathy with excess burden on women.
FMD may have varying manifestations, including hypertension, stroke and myocardial infarction, among
others, depending on the arterial beds involved by arterial stenosis, aneurysm, dissection or tortuosity. Thus,
the clinical diagnosis of FMD encompasses a spectrum of arterial dysplasia phenotypes, and these may be
either sporadic or familial. Arterial medial fibrodysplasia underlies the pathologic arterial remodeling and
susceptibility to loss of arterial integrity, and genetic susceptibility loci identified thus far implicate arterial
smooth muscle and its corresponding extracellular matrix. The genetic architecture of these dysplasia-
associated arterial diseases is emerging as variable, with contributions of complex genetic architecture, rare
heritable variants in a subset of cases, and potential modifier genes. The proposed studies will
comprehensively characterize the genetic and allelic spectrum, and test the hypothesis that the molecular and
functional basis of these genetic influences, while operative in a model of locus and allelic heterogeneity,
converge upon alterations of the vascular smooth muscle matricellular unit. The goal of this R35 proposal is to
precisely define the genetic basis of arterial fibrodysplasia and employ relevant model systems for gene and
variant mechanistic testing, resolution of genetic variants of uncertain significance, testing influences of
potential modifier genes, and analysis of regulatory mechanisms, particularly those relevant to vascular sex
differences. This proposal builds upon strengths in vascular disease characterization, high-throughput genetic
and genomic applications, computational analysis, and molecular genetic approaches in model systems. We
will conduct high throughput targeted gene sequencing to define the allelic spectrum of the involved genes in
our clinical and biorepository resources, followed by hypothesis driven experiments in vascular cell and murine
models for in vitro and in vivo definition of the mechanisms of the genetic findings impacting the matricellular

sex differences in arterial remodeling will be determined across the experiments. The outcome of this R35 and
the proposed studies will be the successful integration of genomics and functional studies to provide new
insights into the mechanisms of arterial dysplasia. The completion of these studies will provide critical and
urgently needed biologic insights that will advance precision health objectives including disease diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment, and to reduce the burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
10773052,"A highly effective malaria vaccine remains the ultimate tool for malaria control and elimination. The front runner
is RTS,S/AS01, a recombinant protein comprising portions of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite
protein (CSP). However, the observed vaccine efficacy to clinical malaria in children living in malaria endemic
settings is only 36%. In order to understand how to improve upon this vaccine, a comprehensive evaluation of
baseline and cumulative factors that impede malaria vaccine performance, in direct contrast to factors
associated with protection from malaria, is needed. We have recently defined stronger correlates of protection
based on functional antibody activity using a systems serology approach. To date, these system serology
studies have been conducted only for adults from non-endemic regions. Here, we aim to test the overall
hypothesis that children living in malaria endemic areas who have less mature or aberrant immune cells are
unable to develop the breadth of functional antibodies and T cells elicited by RTS,S in order to become
protected against malaria. Drawing on the WHO Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program in a high-
transmission region in Kenya, we will employ an intensive longitudinal cohort study design to follow children
during their 4-dose RTS,S vaccination schedule, with active and passive follow-up for Pf infections and
episodes of clinical malaria until they reach 4 years of age. Our overall hypothesis will be tested by the
following specific aims: SA1: To comprehensively characterize baseline and peri-vaccination factors that
correlate with vaccine hyporesponsiveness. Using an integrated systems immunology and machine
learning approach, we will determine the effects of ongoing exposures to malaria, systemic inflammation, pre-
existing anti-malarial immunity, and immaturity of cellular immune signatures on RTS,S vaccine hypo-
responsiveness, defined as the inability to develop a core group of functional anti-CSP antibodies. SA2: To
comprehensively characterize the post-vaccination immune signatures in children that correlate with
protection from malaria. Using a systems immunology approach, we will determine the function of vaccine-
elicited anti-CSP antibodies and their correlation with age, cellular immune signatures, and protection from
malaria. Functional in vitro studies will assess antibody opsonization of sporozoites and antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity with and without innate immune cells; assess the phenotype and function of vaccine-
elicited CSP-specific T cells; and explore the potential for epigenetic modifications of monocytes (trained
immunity) to influence vaccine performance. Using a computational modeling/machine learning approach, we
will integrate deep immunoprofiling features to predict correlates with protection from malaria. Together, this
study aims to inform the next generation of malaria vaccines and vaccination programs that could include
immune-modulatory components or recommendations to combine antimalarial prophylaxis/treatment within the
vaccine schedule."
10773053,"Project Summary / Abstract
The overarching goal of this project is to develop the evidence base around the predictors and consequences
of clinical underdiagnosis vs early clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in
healthcare settings. Many older persons who would meet diagnostic criteria for dementia—potentially more
than half—are underdiagnosed in the healthcare setting, meaning they are diagnosed by their provider years
after symptoms that meet criteria for dementia first emerge (i.e. late diagnosis) or are never diagnosed (i.e.
missed diagnosis). We know relatively little about the factors that drive the timing of receipt of a clinical
diagnosis of dementia. Advances in this area would allow us to address diagnostic disparities. In recent years,
there has also been a push for early clinical diagnosis of dementia (i.e. identifying persons with dementia close
to the time of symptom onset), despite lack of an effective disease-altering treatment for ADRD. The
importance of an early clinical dementia diagnosis would be bolstered by clear evidence that it led to better
long-term health for diagnosed patients, more appropriate healthcare utilization, or decreased medical costs.
Conversely, evidence of harms would suggest a renewed focus on improving dementia care is warranted.
However, the benefits and harms related to the timing of a clinical dementia diagnosis remain poorly
characterized. This project will address these crucial gaps in understanding by leveraging unique data from 5
diverse, harmonized cohorts of aging from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC) with robust cognitive
assessment and linked Medicare claims records from 1991 to the present. This data is perfectly suited to these
aims, as study-based dementia ascertainment is frequent (annual) and classification of dementia is not
disclosed to participants—thus it is independent of clinical diagnosis in healthcare settings captured in the
Medicare claims. We propose to characterize the factors that make older adults with dementia more or less
likely to receive a clinical diagnosis around the time when they first meet criteria for ADRD (Aim 1), and to test
whether those with early diagnosis have better health outcomes (Aim 2), and more appropriate healthcare
utilization and less associated costs (Aim 3). These efforts are timely and have the potential to change public
perception, clinical practice, and health policy. Patients and medical providers will be able to make better
informed choices about when to seek or offer cognitive evaluation, while public health agencies, health
systems, and health insurers will be able to use our findings to decide whether and how to promote early
cognitive evaluation and diagnosis of dementia."
10928247,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RESOURCE SECTION
The role of the Genome Editing Resource Section will be to produce, import, cryopreserve, validate, and
supply unique swine models. These models will serve as specialized tools to evaluate novel reagents
(Reporter models) as well as serving as models for human conditions (Disease models). The disease models
will provide for fully-human target alleles to evaluate gene editing but will also recapitulate the human condition
to evaluate therapeutic value, alleviation of symptoms, and therapeutic windows of opportunity. Additionally,
the Resource Section will be responsible for procurement or production of animals and surveillance of
biosecurity. The Resource Section will maintain breeding colonies and produce cohorts of experimental
animals. Further, the Resource Section will be responsible for assembly and maintenance of BSL2 facilities for
use by the Testing Section. Our group is ideally suited to provide this testing due to our unique composition of
individuals that are experienced with pig production, swine biomedical models, operate successful labs that
routinely test cutting-edge genome editing technology, and are associated with world-renowned National Swine
Resource and Research Center (NSRRC) and the sunsetting Swine Somatic Cell Genome Editing Consortium

10768747,"Animal Models of Digestive Disease Core – Project Summary
The objective of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Digestive & Liver Diseases (CDLD)
is to enhance research infrastructure and expand research capacity to enable outstanding and collaborative
biomedical research in digestive and liver diseases. We wish to establish and sustain the CDLD as the driving
force for digestive and liver diseases research at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). We further
envision that the MUSC CDLD will become a major focal point for digestive and liver diseases in the state of
South Carolina, becoming a hub for trainees and established investigators alike. The topic of this COBRE is
particularly relevant given the enormous impact of digestive and liver diseases on a broad range of Americans,
including the citizens of South Carolina.
Performance of digestive disease research requires utilization of unique and complex models of disease. Thus,
we have developed a Core intended to specifically provide the COBRE in Digestive & Liver Diseases (CDLD)
with a distinctive, unified, and skilled core facility that provides access to essential animal models and guidance
on research project planning and implementation. The proposed core will leverage existing resources and
expertise within the MUSC Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) in order to efficiently develop new
capabilities that focus on producing in vivo models of digestive disease. Core leaders will offer CDLD Junior
Investigators (JIs) specialized knowledge, mentorship and training on animal models so that they obtain
sufficient, high quality data for their projects, which will then form the basis of their successful competition for
future independent extramural funding. Supporting JIs’ research is the a objective for the AMDDC; however, all
investigators at MUSC will have access to the models, resources, and training the Core provides.
To achieve the stated objective, the AMDDC will be composed of three distinct but interactive components as
follows: 1) Animal models of digestive and liver diseases, 2) A gnotobiotics facility, and 3) A focused and
extensive training and mentoring component. Members of this core are skilled and highly experienced,
supporting the generation of high quality data.

10769260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Pathology Core will be co-led by Dr. Marisa Nucci, a pathologist with expertise in gynecologic neoplasia,
and by Dr. Geoffrey Shapiro, who brings experience with biomarker development for DNA repair inhibitor-based
preclinical and clinical work. The core will provide support for all of the projects, focused on targeting replication
stress and DNA damage response in women with advanced endometrial cancer, including (1) WEE1 inhibition
in uterine serous or TP53-mutant uterine cancers; (2) combined ATR/PI3K inhibition in uterine cancers; and (3)
induction of replication stress to activate the cGAS/STING pathway to generate anti-tumor immunity in uterine
cancers. The Core will ensure quality control of data generated from human and mouse tissues in each of the
projects and carry out unbiased analyses of results utilizing proper controls. The goal of Aim 1 is to provide
histologic assessment and confirmation of experimental models via the application of standard criteria for
endometrial cancer diagnosis, along with immunohistochemical analyses to confirm Mullerian origin and
histologic subtype in both parental tumors and in organoid or patient-derived xenograft models generated from
those tumors. Models will be assessed serially to ensure that they retain fidelity to the primary tumors from
which they were derived. The primary objective of Aim 2 is to analyze immunohistochemical biomarkers of DNA
damage (g-H2AX, pKAP1), replication stress (pRPA, pKAP1), ATM deficiency, oncogene activation (cyclin E,
MYC) and homologous recombination repair proficiency (RAD51 foci). The characterization of models and
tumors pre- and on-treatment with the WEE1 inhibitors adavosertib and ZN-c3 or with a combination of the PI3K
inhibitor copanlisib and the ATR inhibitor elimusertib will determine if these biomarkers are predictive of response
and will confirm target engagement by these agents. In Aim 3, models and primary tumors subjected to WEE1
and ATR inhibitor-based treatments will be interrogated for changes in the immune microenvironment using a
validated multiple immunofluorescence platform that will quantify T-cell infiltrates and subtypes along with
immune checkpoint protein expression. Changes in the immune microenvironment will be correlated with DNA
damage and replication stress biomarkers, activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and with clinical outcomes."
10768635,"ABSTRACT
RNA modifications play diverse roles in regulating viral infection. The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) regulates infection by the positive-strand RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae family, through its effect on both
viral and cellular RNA. m6A regulates key aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, translation, and
localization, as well as interactions with m6A-binding proteins. While the basic proteins that add or bind m6A on
mRNA are known, little is known about how the m6A-methyltransferase complex or m6A-binding proteins are
specifically regulated or targeted to viral and cellular RNA during infection. Our previous work has revealed that
the RNA genomes of viruses in the Flaviviridae family are m6A-modified at specific sites, and that m6A at one
site in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome negatively regulates infectious particle production by inhibiting
interaction of the HCV RNA genome with the viral packaging protein. We also found that Flaviviridae-induced
cellular signaling pathways alter m6A changes in host mRNAs important for infection. Finally, our preliminary
data identify novel m6A-methyltransferase interacting proteins and a novel m6A-reader with a described role in
the antiviral interferon (IFN) response. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
how m6A-targeting to viral and cellular RNA regulates infection by specific viruses in the Flaviviridae family.
Based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the specific m6A regulatory pathways
co-opted and induced by viral infection can be determinants of viral replication. Guided by our preliminary data,
this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Define how the m6A-
methyltransferase complex targets HCV RNA to regulate infection; 2) Determine how Flaviviridae infection alters
m6A regulation of specific host mRNAs; 3) Characterize an IFN-induced m6A-reader that restricts Flaviviridae
infection. In Aim 1, we will define how the nuclear m6A-methyltransferase is recruited to the cytoplasmic-localized
RNA genome of HCV. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the m6A-methyltransferase complex is functionalized
during viral infection to differentially target cellular mRNAs for methylation. In Aim 3, we will define the molecular
determinants of how an IFN-induced m6A reader targets viral and host m6A-modified RNA to inhibit Flaviviridae
infection. The proposed work will be significant and innovative because it will define cellular pathways and
mechanisms that alter m6A-methyltransferase composition and function during Flaviviridae infection, as well as
define new IFN-induced regulators of m6A, thus uncovering new host pathways exploited by viruses or utilized
by the host to inhibit infection. Importantly, this work will also reveal novel aspects of how gene expression is
regulated by m6A, including the fact that specific cellular signaling pathways alter how m6A is placed on specific
mRNAs. Thus, this work has broad implications for understanding a host of human diseases that are caused by
altered gene expression and regulated by RNA modifications."
10768637,"Project Summary
Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are medical procedures that produce aerosols that can be laden with
pathogens if the patient has a viral infection, such as SARS-CoV-2 or inﬂuenza. These aerosols pose a signiﬁcant
risk to health care workers, as they can linger in the air for extended periods of time and are small enough to
bypass ordinary surgical masks. There is currently no established, unambiguous way to evaluate the risks to
healthcare workers associated with a speciﬁc AGP, nor is there a rigorous method by which to assess a proposed
risk-mitigation strategy. To address this gap, a ﬂow visualization technique must be developed that can be applied
in a clinical setting during actual medical procedures and is capable of detecting aerosol-laden ﬂows produced
by AGPs or potential AGPs.
 In this R21 proposal, we will adapt background-oriented schlieren (BOS) visualization, a method from ﬂuid
mechanics, into a technique that can be applied to study ﬂows produced by AGPs. The R21 project is high
risk with no published preliminary data, but the PIs have successfully demonstrated visualziation of aerosols
produced by jet ventilation, a speciﬁc type of AGP, using BOS in a proof-of-concept experiment. The proposed
work is signiﬁcant and timely, as assessment of the risk associated with AGPs is extremely important in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use the novel BOS technique to assess risks and evaluate mitigation
strategies for three speciﬁc AGPs in both ex vivo and in vivo conditions.
 Speciﬁc Aim 1: Develop a human-scale BOS system and establish a procedure for evaluating the risk
of AGPs in a clinical setting.
 Speciﬁc Aim 2: Quantify the risk of aerosol exposure under different simulated and in-vivo conditions,
and identify strategies to mitigate the risks.
 The signiﬁcance and impact of the proposed research will be in developing a tool for unambiguously evaluat-
ing the risks associated with AGPs in realistic clinical settings, and urgently-needed risk assessments for three
speciﬁc AGPs and experimentally veriﬁed risk mitigation strategies for each."
10768638,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is now the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death in the
US and remains a deadly disease for US veterans. Although pancreatic cancer cells show susceptibility to
standard chemotherapeutic agents, most patients eventually develop resistance, leading to poor survival.
Myeloid cells have been reported to mediate chemotherapy resistance, however the mechanisms by which this
occurs specifically in humans have yet to be elucidated. Such studies are challenging due to fresh
biospecimen acquisition, patient heterogeneity, and a diverse tumor microenvironment. I propose to address
these obstacles by exploiting opportunities to obtain specimens during endoscopic diagnostic biopsy
(treatment-naïve) and surgical resection (post-treatment).
 In this proposal, I will develop a novel pipeline to generate a comprehensive dataset of single-cell
sequenced human PDAC tumors longitudinally, before and after treatment, using pancreatic cancer patients at
the Ann Arbor VA Healthcare System. I will also use a patient-derived co-culture system in vitro to parse out
the myeloid-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance in PDAC. The overarching hypothesis is that
chemotherapy alters the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer through reprogramming of the
local and systemic immune system, and if better understood, can be exploited to uncover
mechanisms of therapy resistance. The overall goal will be to uncover the role of myeloid cells in tumor
aggressiveness and identify putative therapeutic targets to overcome chemo-refractory disease.
 In Aim 1, I will define immune signatures of PDAC response to chemotherapy in patient tumors and
peripheral blood with the goal of correlating signatures to disease outcomes. Aim 1 will utilize single-cell RNA
sequencing, multiplex immunostaining, and mass cytometry on longitudinal matched PDAC patient
biospecimens, allowing for an individualized patient-specific comparison of treatment-naïve and post-treatment
states. In Aim 2, I will use a patent-derived co-culture system of PDAC tumor organoids and peripheral
myeloid cells to dissect the crosstalk responsible for myeloid-mediated therapy resistance. Here I will test the
role of candidate ligand-receptors pairs between myeloid cells and tumor epithelial cells in tumor aggression
and resistance.
 This proposal supports the development of an invaluable single-cell sequencing dataset of matched
longitudinal pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue in PDAC patients, as well as an in vitro platform for
mechanistic studies, altogether allowing for a comprehensive study of the tumor microenvironment and
providing new immunotherapeutic targets in this deadly disease. Furthermore, this proposal will allow for the
development of a robust pancreatic cancer biospecimen program at the Ann Arbor VA using samples from
veterans that have previously been untapped for translational research purposes, with the goal of eventually
building a precision medicine platform for veterans with pancreatic cancer. Finally, this proposal will support
my continued training and development to establish myself as a VA independent investigator in the field of
pancreatic cancer, a deadly disease for the veteran population."
10768826,"Overall Program-Abstract
Blood coagulation derives from a series of specific proteolytic activation reactions that are catalyzed with
narrow and defined specificity by trypsin-like serine proteinases. In several instances, these proteinases
function in membrane assembled enzyme complexes. Distinctive protein substrate specificities and the
modulation of function by interactions with membranes, cofactors and ligands are hallmarks of the proteolytic
reactions of blood coagulation. There are major gaps in the current understanding of the molecular bases for
these unique features that underlie the function of the hemostatic reactions. This program proposes an
integrated approach focused on the modulation of enzymic function and specificity that uniquely arises from
macromolecular interactions that underlie the action of the hemostatic enzymes. Project 1 (Krishnaswamy)
uses the constituents of the prothrombinase complex as a paradigm to investigate functional and structural
mechanisms underlying regulation of zymogen, proteinase and cofactor function. Project 2 (Camire) will
investigate molecular mechanisms at play in the conversion of factor V to the cofactor, factor Va and the
surprising new biological insights that these mechanisms reveal. Project 3 (Sullenger) employs RNA aptamers
in a unique inhibitor strategy that combines specific aptamers targeting exosites linked to active site ligands to
form potent and readily reversible bivalent EXosite-ACTive site (EXACT) inhibitors to modulate coagulation
reactions for therapeutic gain. Project 4 (Samelson-Jones) is an ESI-led project that investigates mechanisms
underlying the structural correlates of IXa and VIIIa function to develop novel approaches for the treatment of
hemophilia B or to improve approaches for hemophilia A treatment by gene therapy. The objectives of the five
projects will be supported by an administrative core (Core A) and a core that provides support for molecular
biology, protein expression and structural biology (Core B). Overall, this project applies the expertise of the
individual investigators towards addressing major unanswered questions in hemostasis and thrombosis
extending from biochemical and structural insights, to biological function and the translation of of these insights
to the treatment of disease. The proposed approaches will provide new insights into the chemistry and biology
of the blood coagulation reactions with implications for an understanding of normal hemostasis and thrombosis
and the treatment of clotting or bleeding disorders."
10768962,"SUMMARY: OVERALL PROGRAM
The goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is advancing the latest discoveries in stem cell biology, human
organoid models, and gene editing to understand and treat genetic lung diseases. After a century of basic
sciences advances, culminating in recent Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, such as nuclear reprogramming
and gene editing, biomedical research now faces an inflection point, poised for clinical translation of basic
science successes. While it is hard to envision a more optimistic time in health-related research, treatments for
many devastating lung diseases have not yet been realized, and clinical therapies in most cases still largely
focus on treating symptoms or maintaining life support to allow endogenous lung tissue stem cells enough time
to repair, without available therapies able to interrupt disease-initiating mechanisms or augment the lung’s
capacity to regenerate. Here we address these challenges by proposing an integrated, multi-investigator PPG
to translate lung stem cell research from basic discovery to future clinical applications. An initial focus on
ameliorating genetic lung diseases of the airway and alveoli is pursued, given that their proximal
disease-driving gene mutations are well described. The use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying
these mutations or their gene-edited progeny is a shared technology harnessed by all Projects together with a
proposed Gene Editing Core, and coordinated by an Administrative Core. Our 4 project leaders have worked
together extensively to develop protocols to differentiate iPSCs into a broad diversity of lung epithelial lineages,
recently optimizing methods to produce the two stem cell populations that maintain all airway and alveolar
epithelia, basal cells and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s), respectively. Having established these stem cell banks
and protocols, we turn our focus here on applying these resources to advance our mechanistic understanding
of how gene mutations initiate airway and alveolar epithelial dysfunction resulting in disease, and we seek to
therapeutically intervene with novel precision therapeutics or regenerative cell therapies. Towards these
goals, we here propose 4 projects and 2 cores, all interacting to complete shared aims, and synergistic
cross-project experiments. Aim 1 will promote collaborative, integrated cross-project approaches that
produce new human models of genetic airway and alveolar diseases, and will apply these in vitro iPSC and
organoid-based models to understand basic pathogenic mechanisms that lead from epithelial dysfunction to
lung disease. Aim 2 will identify potential therapeutic strategies able to reverse or ameliorate aberrant
pathways responsible for the alveolar dysfunction present in genetic diseases that affect the distal lung,
including proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic changes that we hypothesize lead to
reversible epithelial toxic gain-of-function phenotypes. Aim 3 will develop a future approach for treating genetic
lung diseases based on the in vivo reconstitution of airway and alveolar stem cell compartments via
intra-airway transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived airway basal or distal alveolar epithelial cells."

approaches. Many daily interactions, monthly group meetings, regular advisory board meetings, and
contractual agreements are required to integrate and synergize the many components of this proposed
Program Project Grant (PPG). In addition, shared research aims are commonly pursued between multiple
projects and their subcontracts, and a broad variety of gene-edited stem cell lines, protocols, vectors,
therapeutic approaches, and datasets are anticipated to be produced, curated, and archived for public

chain of responsibility for management of the PPG, outline effective use of the shared Scientific Core (iGEC),
explain our plans for internal quality controls of on-going research, and detail methods for management of
day-to-day activities, contractual agreements, allocation of funds, and resolution of disputes. The
Administrative Core will be led by the PPG Program Director and corresponding Principal Investigator, Dr.
Darrell Kotton. Dr. Kotton will supervise a PPG Program Manager and Administrative Assistant to lead this
PPG, which is supported by a variety of Boston University administrative offices, Institutes, Departments,
and Centers, including a state-of-the-art physically contiguous Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM),
which serves as the physical home of the offices and laboratories of all 4 Project Leaders and the proposed
iGEC. An Internal Advisory Board and External Advisory Board, together comprising an Executive Oversight
Committee, will provide essential oversight, monitoring, and guidance, maximizing the success and

iGEC will serve the aims of Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4 through the application of state-of-the-art technical approaches
to manipulating iPSC and iBC populations and generating lentiviral constructs used in each Project. The reagents
that will be generated will be central to the successful completion of the individual projects composing this

genetic backgrounds than would otherwise be possible. Our three specific aims are as follows. Aim 1: To edit
existing iPSC and iBC lines derived from patients with genetic lung diseases to correct disease-associated
variants or introduce CRISPRi or CRISPRa knock-in constructs to facilitate genetically-controlled disease
modeling experiments featured in individual PPG projects. Aim 2: To perform rigorous QC testing and
biobanking of edited iPSC lines generated for and utilized in all PPG projects. Aim 3: To clone, package, titer,
bank, and distribute lentiviral constructs for use in PPG projects. PPG investigators have significant collective
expertise in a suite of technologies, including iPSC differentiation, gene editing of iPSCs and their derivatives,
and the application of lentiviruses to track cell populations, modulate gene expression, or read out pathway
activation, that will be applied in Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this PPG. The iGEC will centralize and standardize
these innovative approaches and reagents to make them available for PPG projects. The iGEC will provide gene
editing services to generate edited versions, including the introduction or correction of variants as well as the
generation of knock-in constructs, of existing iPSC lines utilized in individual Projects. It will likewise clone new
lentiviral constructs to facilitate the targeted knockdown or overexpression of genes of interest using
CRISPRi/CRISPRa technology. It will apply rigorous QC protocols to document the provenance of edited iPSC
lines through DNA “fingerprinting”, confirm their genetic stability through karyotyping, and confirm their
pluripotency. Finally, it will serve as a central repository for all edited iPSCs and lentiviral constructs utilized in
the PPG, applying best practices developed over time to minimize iPSC passage number and maintain the bank."
10768965,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
A variety of devastating lung diseases are initiated by dysfunction or damage to the diverse epithelia of the
proximal airways or distal alveoli. While these tissues are composed of many epithelial cell types, the vast
majority are continually replenished by the stem/progenitor cells of each compartment: airway basal cells or
alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s), respectively. Implicit in this biology is recognition that durably
reconstituting these stem cell compartments with exogenously-derived normal cells might result in life-long
replenishment of their many differentiated cell derivatives. In this proposal we develop approaches for
reconstituting endogenous airway and alveolar stem/progenitor cell compartments by transplanting engineered
lung epithelial progenitors derived in culture from pluripotent stem cells. We present methods for the directed
differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into airway basal cells (iBCs) and distal alveolar bud tip progenitors
(iTPs) followed by intra-airway instillation of these cells into recipient mice. We test the hypothesis that iBCs or
iTPs can be engrafted in vivo into the stem cell compartments of airways and alveoli, respectively, thus durably
reconstituting epithelial function and providing future treatments for genetic lung diseases that result from
airway or alveolar dysfunction. In aim 1 we test the capacity of engrafted iTPs to functionally rescue alveolar
epithelial cell dysfunction in vivo in 2 genetic mouse models that recapitulate distal human lung diseases. In
Aim 2 we develop a novel in vivo “competitive lung repopulation assay” able to determine which candidate
stem/progenitor cell phenotype is best able to reconstitute in vivo airway epithelial stem cell function, and we
apply this assay to functionally test the hypothesis that the subset of PSC-derived basal cells expressing the
BMP antagonist, Nbl1, possesses more potent reconstitution capacity than other iBCs, as a result of
suppressed BMP signaling activity. Finally in aim 3, we evaluate the functional capacity of engrafted mouse
iBCs to rescue motile ciliary function in a mouse model of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), and we test the
human translational potential of iBCs using normal or PCD patient-specific human iPSC lines that will be
gene-corrected, differentiated into iBCs, and xenogeneically transplanted into NSG mice."
10768966,"Summary/Abstract: Project 2
AATD is among the most common monogenic lung diseases, affecting an estimated 100,000 individuals in the
US and causing significant morbidity and mortality. Lung disease in AATD is classically attributed to low levels
of AAT in the lung resulting in protease-antiprotease imbalance and typically manifests in the form of
emphysema, identified in 100% of NHLBI longitudinal cohort participants with lung tissue available for analysis
at the time of death or lung transplant. Studies have found that severely deficient “ZZ” individuals, who
inherited two copies of the mutant “Z” allele (as opposed the normal “M” allele), collectively experience lung
function decline at an accelerated rate relative to those with “usual” COPD but have likewise demonstrated
highly variable rates of lung function decline over time among this population, suggesting that factors in
addition to antiprotease levels might contribute to injury. AAT augmentation therapy that normalizes both
circulating and epithelial lining fluid AAT levels provides a theoretical solution to “loss-of-function” injury that
results from protease-antiprotease imbalance and is the standard of care for “ZZ” individuals with impaired lung
function. Despite its ability to restore circulating AAT levels to exceed the therapeutic protective threshold,
however, efficacy was surprisingly challenging to establish, with multiple studies unable to conclusively
demonstrate significant reduction in FEV1 decline, consistent with the possibility that mechanisms in addition
to loss-of-function injury could be contributing. Based on this rationale and supported by provocative
preliminary data demonstrating toxicity in human primary AT2s expressing ZAAT, this proposal will test the
hypothesis that lung epithelial ZAAT protein production induces gain-of-function toxicity that contributes to lung
disease pathogenesis in ZZ AATD. To do so, it will leverage reagents including novel mice engineered to allow
conditional expression of ZAAT from specific lineages as well as patient-derived iPSC-type 2 cells to test the
effects of ZAAT expression alone or in combination with environmental injury on AT2 function and
predisposition to emphysema. It will then examine the effects of modulating specific cellular pathways on the
consequences of ZAAT expression in AT2s. Collectively, these experiments have the potential to suggest
novel treatment strategies for AATD-associated emphysema."
10768967,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 3
There are striking challenges to the diagnosis, care, and treatment of individuals with primary
ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). These hurdles are implicit to the fundamental biology of PCD. Compared
to cystic fibrosis, a monogenic airway disease, PCD is caused by mutations in >50 genes that
encode proteins involved in ciliogenesis and that result in impaired mucociliary clearance. Unlike
CF, where 90% of individuals carry at least one copy of the same variant, the genetic landscape
of PCD is heterogeneous, both in terms of number of genes and variants within those genes. In
CF, we now have highly effective therapies for those 90% of individuals. There are no precision
therapies for PCD, nor do they seem close. A paradigm shift is required to enable the development
of those therapies. In this proposal, we develop methods to generate a panel of PCD airway cells
using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We do so using our established methods to
generate a self-renewing source of airway basal cells (iBCs) from iPSCs capable of differentiating
into multiciliated cells (MCCs). We present preliminary data, demonstrating our ability to efficiently
knock out or precisely edit genes in iBCs and phenotype the ciliary defects that result. We test
the hypothesis that this iBC platform can detect the pathogenicity of PCD mutations and predict
the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. To do so we focus on 5 high priority PCD
genes (Aim 1). We take the novel approach of directly inserting VUS (5 per gene) into a gold-
standard iBC line to determine if they lead to defects in cilia ultrastructure and or function (Aim 2).
In aim 3, we address the intriguing question of why mutations in certain genes (CCDC39 and

proteins with broader biological roles and their loss leads to cell intrinsic defects and not simply
loss of cilia function. Finally, in aim 4 we perform proof-of concept experiments to test the
therapeutic potential of iBCs as an autologous, gene-corrected cell-based therapy approach in
xenogeneic transplantation studies in NSG mice."

In New Mexico, 15.2% of children between the ages of 6-15 are obese, ranking New Mexico 23rd among all
U.S. states. Obesity prevalence also increases with age. In 2018, only 13% of New Mexico children ages 2-4
years were obese compared with 32% of adults 18 years of age and older. Likewise for Washington in 2016,
12% of children ages 2-4 years were obese compared to 29% of adults. To address the prevalence of obesity
and related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and several types of cancer, programs focusing
on increasing opportunities for active living and healthy eating are necessary. Multi-component school-based
obesity prevention programs have demonstrated increases in PA and improvement in dietary habits; however,
most afterschool programs are short term; evidence is needed to confirm long-term effects. Moreover,
programs that involve parents have shown to be more successful in helping children choose healthier
behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to pilot test the Healthy Parents and Children
Enhancement (H-PACE) program -- a community-engaged research project – through an existing after-school
program in Las Cruces, NM and a new partnership in Sunnyside, WA among children 8-11 years of age (3rd-
5th grade). It is expected that implementing the H-PACE program will be feasible and demonstrate clinically
important changes in improving children’s lifestyle behaviors. In addition to participating in after-school
activities, which will include structural, active play as well as educational lessons and activities, children will
take home family-based engaging activities such as fruits and veggies for fun preparation at home with
parents. Parents will also be connected to each other and program staff via a private, invitation-only Facebook
group, which will provide regular updates on after-school activities and particular family-based weekly
assignments. The life skill portion of this program is designed to have lasting impact on children from
households of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and their family members. The current pilot project will also
enhance the community-academic partnerships between the local school district, New Mexico State University,
and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to deliver an after-school program that is low cost, mutually beneficial,
and sustainable. Proper nutrition and physical activity (PA) are essential parts of overall health. Together, they
can decrease the risk of developing obesity as well as related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease,
stroke, and several types of cancer. Health disparities associated with active living have led the CDC to call for
greater active living programing for children. The current project will address this need in southern NM and the
Lower Yakima Valley of Washington by implementing an active living after-school program at four school sites."

The Planning & Evaluation Core (P&E Core) of the Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research
between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) coordinates
critical functions necessary for the determination of the impact and effectiveness of Partnership activities in the
attainment of its goals and objectives. P&E Core Leads, Dr. Rachel Boren at NMSU and Dr. Julian Simon at
Fred Hutch have extensive expertise in program evaluation methodologies. Dr. Boren is Director of the
Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Evaluation and Policy Center at New Mexico State
University and has been an evaluator for over 10 years. She has previously worked as an evaluator for the
Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) based at the University of Washington. Fred Hutch is affiliated
with the University of Washington and participates in the ITHS thus giving Dr. Boren a unique familiarity with
both institutions. Dr. Simon has served as Research Project and Core Lead as well currently serving as MPI for
the Partnership. His nearly 20-year involvement with the Partnership gives him a historical perspective on the
culture of the collaboration. The five Specific Aims of the P&E Core are to: 1. Provide assessment tools to
evaluate, track and report on progress in all aspects of the Partnership; 2. Release Requests for Applications
for new pilot and full Research Projects and conduct rigorous review of proposals; 3. Engage community
members and community action boards to evaluate impact of the Partnership on advancing regional cancer
health equity; 4. Convene IAC and PSC to review progress of Cores and Research Projects, and facilitate
communication between the advisory bodies, NCI and Core and Project Leads, and; 5. Evaluate the
implementation and impact of the Guiding Principles (described in detail in Overall). In order to accomplish
these Aims, the P&E Core will work with the MPIs (Drs. Graciela Unguez and Julian Simon) as well as
Research Project and Core Leads to develop appropriate evaluation instruments to inform on the effectiveness
of the Partnership’s activities. Quantitative and qualitative measure of outcomes will be collected and assessed
based on the metrics described in the Logic Model (see P&E Core). New Research Projects will be solicited,
evaluated, and implemented through the P&E Core. Current Research Projects and Cores will be evaluated
and if necessary revised in consultation with the Internal Advisory Committee, the Program Steering
Committee and NCI Program Staff. Rigorous review of the effectiveness of projects and activities will enable
progress to meeting the Partnership’s goal of advancing health equity in the communities served."

The Partnership Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH) Core will deliver research
education activities in cancer and health disparities and prepare future scientists to contribute to the
diversification of the biomedical research workforce. The REACH Core has demonstrated exceptional success
in training undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from Historically Excluded Communities
(HECs) in previous U54 Partnership funding cycles. Based on its experience implementing a variety of
research education programs such as undergraduate (Cancer Research Internship for NMSU Undergraduates;
CRI-U) and graduate (Cancer Research Internship for NMSU Graduates; CRI-G) research internships,
Graduate Health Disparities Course (University of Washington, School of Public Health), and the Health
Disparities Field Experience (renamed the Health Equity Field Experience in the U54-IV), the Partnership will
implement integrated biomedical research education programs with an emphasis on cancer and/or health
disparities research, across a spectrum of academic levels to diversify the scientific workforce contributing to
biomedical and population health research. The Partnership will also provide concurrent and on-going support
for academic and professional goal attainment among all its participants. Formative assessments to measure
strengths and inform areas for improvement of research education activities will be carried out with the
Planning & Evaluation Core. The Partnership will continue to use long-term tracking tools to offer sustained
support to participants and evaluate impact and effectiveness of activities. In response to past program
evaluation and recommendations from the Internal Advisory Committee and external Program Steering
Committee, a portfolio of activities is proposed that prioritize the current needs to promote and heighten cancer
research education that is focused on undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions.
The REACH Core will implement education programs across academic levels and disciplines; provide support
for trainees’ goal attainment that identifies individual-specific needs and interests, opportunities as well as
potential barriers to career advancement; design experiences for trainees that create a sense of community
and belonging both within the Partnership and more broadly in the larger scientific community, and; conduct
assessments of research education activities’ effectiveness, including long-term tracking, to identify
opportunities for innovation and needs for improvement while meeting the diverse needs of participants. These
activities will contribute to the Partnership’s Aims of diversifying the biomedical workforce, creating a more
inclusive and affirmative research environment and enhancing cancer health equity."

The Outreach Core is based on the premise that the US-Mexico border and Indian Country in the
northwestern regions of New Mexico (NM), as well as the Central region of Washington State (WA) are largely
rural and medically underserved areas where inequities are severe, especially among Hispanic/Latinx,
American Indian (AI), and LGBTQAI+ populations. These geographical areas are the foci of the Outreach
Core’s work. Long term, the Partnership aspires to increase the health equity in these regions. To do so, the
Specific Aims are: 1) To integrate community engagement activities and practices within the Partnership for
Advancing Cancer Research (PACR); 2) To increase capacity for community-academic partnerships to
successfully use community-based participatory research (CBPR); and 3) To build on and use evidence-based
programs (EBPs) to promote cancer equity in Latinx, AI, and LGBTQIA+ populations. The Outreach Core was
very successful in the U54-III, reaching 4,631 individuals in NM and 3,287 in WA. Since the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in-person cancer prevention education and other Outreach Core activities were adapted
to online platforms in English and Spanish. At the request of the Community Action Boards (CABs), information
on COVID-19 and vaccination was disseminated through social media with positive results. For this U54-IV, we
will follow the Partnership Guiding Principles of 1) restructuring scientific environments; 2) restructuring scientific
processes; and 3) restructuring scientific engagement, and will work collaboratively with our CABs to foster mutual
understanding of the Partnership and the community organizations represented by the CABs to ensure that NMSU
and Fred Hutch equitably engage communities in all the activities. CAB discussions about the various Research
Projects and Cores will be initiated as well as bi-directional discussions on community-based participatory
research (CBPR). The Partnership will also endeavor to establish community organization expertise in research
initiatives by providing training and education in research. The expected end result will be community-oriented
Pilot and Pre-Pilot projects funded by the Partnership. Five modules fostering inclusion of community members in
research practices will provide opportunities for historically marginalized communities to voice their strengths and
ways of knowing through collaborative experiences. Finally, the Outreach Core will continue to collaborate with the
CABs and communities on evidence-based programs such as Screen-to-Save (a colorectal cancer screening
program), Yéego (a Navajo healthy eating project), e-Learning by the Cooperative Extension Services (on healthy
lifestyle behaviors), and Cancer 101 (a series on cancer causes, prevention and detection). The Planning &
Evaluation Core (P&E Core) will evaluate the formative and summative outcomes of the activities."
10756945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii and related apicomplexan parasites contain a specialized organelle called the inner
membrane complex (IMC) that plays essential roles in host cell invasion and daughter cell formation. The IMC
consists of flattened membrane vesicles and a supporting cytoskeletal meshwork that is flanked by the plasma
membrane and subpellicular microtubules at the periphery of the parasite. Recent in vivo biotinylation (BioID)
studies have revealed a surprising level of compartmentalization within the IMC organelle, with distinct groups
of proteins segregating to the cone-shaped apical cap, the body, or to the basal complex of both the cytoskeletal
and membrane subcompartments. Analyses from our group and others have exposed new essential functions
of the IMC including the role of the apical cap complex AC9/AC10/ERK7 in mounting the conoid which is essential
for organelle secretion and invasion as well as the conserved early daughter bud protein IMC32 that is essential
for replication. In this renewal, we will expand on these studies to determine precisely how these and other critical
IMC components are able to carry out their functions. First, we will determine the role of novel apical cap proteins
that are putative interactors of the AC9/AC10/ERK7 complex and assess their role in apical cap function and
conoid assembly. We will then explore how IMC32 collaborates with the newly discovered partner IMC48 to
function at the earliest stages of parasite division and use these proteins to further explore the early daughter
bud proteome. Finally, we will exploit our recently developed photoreactive unnatural amino acid system as well
as cryo-electron tomography to determine how critical alveolins of the parasite cytoskeleton are organized to
serve as scaffolds for the organelle. Together, this project will promote a much deeper understanding of the
architecture and function of the Toxoplasma IMC. As this organelle is parasite-specific and not present in its
human host, determining precisely how these essential IMC components function promises to enable the design
of novel therapies against T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites."

More than 40% of the 250 million people living with asthma in the United States are obese. Obese individuals
with asthma are more likely to develop “obesity-associated asthma,” a phenotype that is exacerbation-prone
and resistant to treatment. While weight loss is an effective treatment, this is difficult to attain and sustain, and
consequently there are few effective and specific treatment options for this prevalent asthma phenotype.
Obesity-induced metabolic inflammation, insulin resistance, and pre-diabetes may explain some of the excess
morbidity of obesity-associated asthma. Metformin, the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, comprehensively
treats these conditions. Preclinical data suggest that metformin improves airways hyperresponsiveness and
allergic airway inflammation among animal models of obese asthma, and observational data have shown an
inverse relationship between metformin use and risk of asthma exacerbation, suggesting that metformin may
be beneficial among patients with asthma and elevated body mass index. The objective of this application is to
conduct a pilot, six-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, two-center trial of metformin among
overweight and obese individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma recruited from Baylor College of Medicine
and Johns Hopkins University. The pilot RCT will determine (1) feasibility of a study design that utilizes remote
methods for research participation and (2) preliminary estimates of the effect of metformin on core patient-
centered and physiologic outcomes. Completion of these aims will inform the decision to proceed with a pivotal
multi-center efficacy RCT testing metformin among overweight and obese participants with asthma and inform
specifics of its design and enrollment strategies. This project will provide findings that address an urgent
research priority relevant to the millions of Americans with obesity-associated asthma."
10911342,"Project Summary
Defects in mitochondrial genes encoding the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes result in a
spectrum of disease in humans, ranging from severe pediatric syndromes to aging-related diseases. The
catalytic subunits of OXPHOS complexes I and III-IV are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA),
which is present in 6-10 copies per mitochondrion. Due to the presence of multiple mitochondria in a cell,
different mtDNAs often co-exist within an individual mitochondrion or population of cells within a tissue, a
condition termed heteroplasmy, resulting in tissue mosaicism. Mitochondrial diseases that present in
adulthood are often the result of the accumulation of mtDNAs carrying a pathogenic variant in the affected
tissue. Whether different heteroplasmic mitochondrial genetic variants exist in different tissues of the
body within the general population is not known. We hypothesize that mtDNA variants and levels (variant
allele frequency, total number of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants) differ across the tissues of the human body
reflective of their germ layer origin. We also hypothesize that the accumulation of heteroplasmic variants within
a given tissue is associated with age. We will utilize whole genome sequencing and RNAseq data previously
collected as part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, a dataset consisting of sequencing data spanning
54 tissue sites across the body of 964 individuals collected postmortem. We will create a pipeline to identify
mtDNA variants from both whole genome sequencing and RNAseq reads that will be used to identify tissue-
specific homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mtDNA variants, which we will make publicly available upon
publication. We will compare homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants across the tissues from the same
individual to identify tissue-specific variants (Aim 1A), and stratify by the germ layer (endoderm, mesoderm,
ectoderm) that gave rise to the tissues (Aim 1B). We will evaluate the association of age (at time of death) with
mtDNA heteroplasmic variant burden (total number of heteroplasmic variants, VAF) for each tissue (Aim 2).
Our study will lend insight into the possible origins of tissue-specific mtDNA variants and whether such variants
alter mitochondrial function, which may be relevant to the development of disease in that tissue. Without an
understanding of the extent to which tissue-specific mtDNA variants exist in the general population, delineating
between benign and pathogenic mtDNA variants in relation to human disease will continue to be a challenge."
10744740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An emerging concept in virology is that viral replication and virion assembly are often mechanistically
coupled in specific locations within the cell at sites termed virus “factories”. The spatial and temporal
coordination of these processes permit assembly line production of virions in a manner that is
energetically favorable while allowing for quality control of the final structure. Although factories have
been described in some detail for viruses replicating in the cytoplasm, most DNA viruses
replicate/assemble in the nucleus where morphological features of factories are problematic to identify
and characterize due to the dense chromatin network. There are also indications that the factories
usurp essential nuclear domains otherwise used for such functions as DNA damage repair (DDR),
and indeed many cellular proteins involved in DDR are found at replication sites for DNA viruses. We
propose to characterize the structure and composition of virion assembly factories for the well-studied
murine polyomavirus using a combined approach employing iPOND protein identification, high
resolution imaging, and virus/host cell genetics. Our goal is to determine the molecular architecture of
these factories at nanometer resolution as well as the spatial and functional relationships of their
protein components. With the recent identification of ten new human polyomaviruses, and the marked
increase in immunomodulatory therapies for a variety of diseases, polyomaviruses have emerged as
important human pathogens that at present have no specific therapy. Characterization of the
assembly factories not only will identify new therapeutic targets for affecting polyomavirus replication,
as well as other DNA viruses, but also provide insight as to their function in normal cellular processes."

Asthma is a heterogeneous and highly burdensome disease that is concentrated in communities of color and of
low socioeconomic status. Clinical asthma heterogeneity reflects complex interactions between molecular,
environmental, and social factors that combine to influence disease outcomes and therapeutic response. Socio-
environmental exposures, including psychosocial stressors and air pollution, are concentrated in historically
marginalized communities where they contribute to poor asthma outcomes. However, the mechanisms
underlying these exposure-related outcomes are poorly understood. There is a critical need to understand how
asthma molecular heterogeneity 1) operates in marginalized populations; and, 2) is influenced by prevalent
socio-environmental factors. The proposed multi-omics approach considering pathology both systemically and
at the main site of disease, the airways, is crucial to unraveling the complex interactions between exposures,
mechanisms, and outcomes in these understudied communities. This project aims to enroll 200 youth with and
100 youth without asthma in Richmond, CA, a predominantly Latine community with high socio-environmental
stressor burden and asthma prevalence upwards of 25%. Multi-omic data will be derived from blood and airway
(nasal swab and sputum) samples collected at disease stability over one year and airway samples collected
during acute respiratory events and recovery. These data will be integrated with deep phenotyping and exposure
data to test three specific aims. The first aim will examine the relationships between high psychosocial stress
and multi-omic outcomes across asthma and health. A hypothesis driven approach will focus on stress-
associated asthma-relevant pathologic alterations including systemic and airway immune responses, stress
hormone associated microbiome shifts, and beta-adrenergic and glucocorticoid pathology. The second aim will
examine the relationships between indoor and outdoor air pollution and multi-omic outcomes across asthma and
health. Indoor and fine-resolution outdoor air pollution monitoring will be leveraged for exposure assessments to
consider how pollutants relate to immune responses, airway repair, and cellular stress across multi-omic layers.
The third aim will examine the role of socio-environmental and microbial precipitants in asthma exacerbation
susceptibility and mechanisms, leveraging samples obtained at baseline and during acute respiratory events. A
custom multi-omic analytical pipeline that considers microbial exacerbation precipitants along with environmental
exposures will be used. Our ultimate goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying socio-environmental
exposures that influence asthma outcomes to inform therapeutic and management decisions and influence
targets for place-based mitigation efforts."
10757053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epigenetic deregulation is now widely accepted as a hallmark of pediatric cancer. Mutations and structural
alterations of the SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeler ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation, X-
linked) have been reported at high frequency in a number of adult and pediatric tumors. However, the
consequences of ATRX mutations in cancer and their underlying epigenetic sensitivities remain ill defined.
Particularly intriguing are the large N-terminal deletions of ATRX in neuroblastoma (NB) found in older
children and adolescents that generate in-frame fusion (IFF) proteins devoid of key chromatin interaction
modules. Our preliminary data suggests that NB cells harboring ATRX IFFs have distinct gene expression
programs compared to WT ATRX NB cells. This is due in part to H3K27me3-mediated silencing of REST
(RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor) target genes involved in neuronal differentiation. In turn, we find that
ATRX IFF cells display sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition (EZH2i) in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of ATRX
IFFs in indolent NB remains poorly understood. In order to decipher the underlying mechanisms of
neuronal gene silencing in ATRX IFF NB, and how to alleviate it and induce cell death, we will determine
the role of ATRX IFF proteins in promoting NB development through functional, epigenomic and proteomic
studies (AIM 1), and define NB transcriptomes and EZH2/H3K27me3/REST target genes in NB cells +/-
EZH2i (AIM 2). These integrated epigenomic, proteomic and transcriptional studies will reveal the
consequences of ATRX structural alterations in NB in development and provide rationale for EZH2
inhibition as a strategy to treat ATRX-altered NB.

10769617,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3 (RUGGERO): DECIPHERING THE ROLE OF THE
TRANSLATIONAL ONCOGENIC PROGRAM IN PROSTATE CANCER
While the approved treatments for castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), such as chemotherapy and
androgen signaling inhibition (ASI), confer significant survival benefits, up to 30% of patients have primary
refractory disease and, inevitably over time, all patients experience disease progression. There is an urgent
need for the development of novel alternative therapies that may be combined with, or used in place of,
conventional androgen receptor (AR)-targeted approaches. Recently we have discovered that phosphorylation
of eIF4E at serine 209 (P-eIF4E) by the MAP-kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2) is
essential for prostate cancer (PCa) development. However, the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in PCa
development and the mechanisms by which P-eIF4E contributes to oncogenesis remain poorly understood. In
this proposal, we seek to address the outstanding question of how human metastatic PCa cells tailor their
proteome via regulation of eIF4E activity, and to unveil the therapeutic benefits of targeting eIF4E in the lethal
state of castration resistance. We propose to explore this question with the following aims: (1) Targeting the
eIF4E-dependent translational oncogenic program in a pre-clinical metastatic CRPC model; (2) To undertake a
clinical trial to examine the effects of tomivosertib in combination with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic
CRPC; (3) To characterize novel eIF4E interacting partners in PCa that may modulate eIF4E-dependent
therapies. Important to the completion of these aims, several interaction hits that confer sensitization to
tomivosertib therapies already have been identified in our laboratories. With this knowledge, we believe that we
are in a unique position to implement rational and highly specific compounds for translation control as novel
therapies for metastatic PCa."
10769618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CORE 1 - BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS CORE (BBC)
The goal of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) is to collaborate with SPORE Investigators and other
Core resource scientists to ensure that research undertaken in the UCSF Prostate Cancer SPORE is rigorous,
reproducible and of the highest quality. The BBC will provide SPORE projects with biostatistical and
bioinformatics support tailored to the specifics of the science and the needs of each project in a timely fashion.
Support will be provided in all stages of the research projects, from the formulation of the research question,
experimental design, data collection, analysis, through to reporting and dissemination of results. The laboratory,
clinical and translational studies proposed by the UCSF Prostate SPORE projects require a wide range of
statistical and bioinformatics expertise including design and analysis of pre-clinical experiments, design and
analysis of clinical trials, and the processing and analysis of complex multi-level genome sequencing data. The
BBC has extensive experience conducting and monitoring clinical trials and analyzing trial results. On the
bioinformatics side, the BBC includes experts in genomic data quality control, germline and somatic variant
analysis, transcriptomics, methylation analysis, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq analysis. The BBC Core is the
repository for the vast amounts of genomic data directly generated by SPORE projects and additional data
sources necessary to their analysis. The BBC maintains a large computational resource available to all SPORE
investigators to provide storage and compute infrastructure for all SPORE projects. The core will also maintain
and continue to develop the Translational Research Database. This resource allows rapid sharing and cross-
fertilization of observations between SPORE projects by integrating preclinical, clinical, genomics, and non-PHI
clinical trials data. The Translational Research Database hosts only de-identified data, and will be available to
qualified researchers who are participants in Spore projects. Access to the Translational Research Database will
be managed by the BBC. The BBC is also responsible for ensuring that genomic data, metadata, and
computational analysis generated by the SPORE projects are appropriately made available to the research
community in accordance with NIH data sharing policies, and it manages the data access agreements in

10769619,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CORE 2 : PROSTATE TISSUE CORE (PTC)
The Prostate Tissue Core (PTC) is the organizing structure managing human tissue, biospecimens and
pathology resources of the UCSF Prostate Cancer SPORE. The PTC collects, processes, and distributes
biospecimens from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who have agreed to donate their tissue for research.
Specimens and corresponding data within the repository are managed through the PTC Specimen Tracking
Database, which is linked to clinical outcomes databases external to the SPORE. Prior to storage, and again at
distribution, Core pathologists review all tissue to verify histopathologic features and for quality control (QC)
purposes and record these into the database. The PTC is responsible for the distribution of tissue specimens
to SPORE approved investigators and projects (inside and outside of the institution), for tracking the use of
those tissues and recovering any unused specimens. The PTC coordinates the use of tissue from sources
outside of the PTC, including collaborations with other SPOREs, other Cancer Centers, National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN)and Pharma partners. The PTC performs a number of laboratory services in support of
research projects, including basic histology services (FFPE and OTC-embedded tissue sectioning, staining and
macro-dissection), laser-capture-microdissection, DNA and RNA extractions, selected library preparation and
sequencing, digital slide scanning and tissue microarray (TMA) construction. The PTC houses cell lines and
other tissue-based preclinical models, and catalogs unique cell lines and models developed and housed in
SPORE projects and other laboratories, to ensure that they are widely available to all SPORE investigators.
The PTC provides input to ensure the proper design and execution of projects using PTC resources. The work
of the PCT is accomplished by the efforts of a dedicated team of pathologists, scientific investigators,
biostatisticians, lab technologists, data managers, and clinical research coordinators (CRCs), along with the
medical oncologists and urologists that recruit appropriate patient volunteers to participate in these activities. At
project completion, the mCRPC collection of biopsies with matching blood and outcome data from at least 850
patients will represent one of the largest collections of such material in the world."
10930065,"Project Summary
The average age of the U.S. population is rapidly increasing and with it the prevalence of age-associated
cognitive decline. Furthermore, the risk for age-associated cognitive decline may disproportionately affect
many historically underrepresented groups. Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with lower risk for
cognitive decline, but many people struggle to maintain PA over the long term. Goal setting presents one
promising avenue to facilitate PA maintenance and has strong public health significance. Likewise, exercise
intensity may further this aim as challenging goals for higher intensity PA may provide the most robust PA
maintenance. Importantly, however, most existing research on goal setting, exercise intensity, and theory-
based exercise interventions overall has been generated among high SES, low diversity samples, and the field
has largely neglected this disparity, with recent reviews and meta-analyses failing to even report racial, ethnic,
or socioeconomic demographic factors. While systems of oppression and structural racism undoubtedly
influence disparities in health behavior and outcomes, it is also possible that existing individual-level theory-
based interventions are not culturally appropriate for many communities, such as African Americans and Black
immigrants (i.e., the Black community). In this application, we will take a community engaged research
approach to tailor and test a theory-based intervention promoting adherence to recommended levels of PA in
the Black community using the technique of person-centered goal setting. We will determine whether
prescriptions of different PA intensities moderate the effectiveness of these goal-setting approaches and test
the theoretical mediators associated with the effectiveness of these interventions on behavioral adherence and
healthy changes in biomarkers associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, the overarching goals of this
project are to take a community engaged research approach to 1) tailor a theory-based goal-setting
exercise intervention in the Denver metropolitan area Black community (R61) and 2) utilize the
Operating Conditions Framework to test the efficacy of the intervention for PA adherence, weekly
volume of exercise, and changes in biomarkers associated with cognitive decline (R33). These
objectives will be met through collaboration with our community partner The Gyedi Project to focus on and fully
engage the Black community in the Denver metropolitan area in the research process."
10769850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ultra high field neuroimaging in humans enables unprecedented resolutions that enable, for the first time, the non invasive investigation of directional information processing in vivo. These advances result from the ability of high resolutions to uncover layer specific (feedforward, feedback) activation patterns. These tools however are not validated in translational models that mimic human brain function. The reason for that is primarily due to our current inability to obtain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals at resolutions high enough to resolve layer specific responses in the non human primate. This project aims at developing novel and innovative radiofrequency hardware and using it at the ultra high field strength of 10.5 Tesla to directly test how well whole brain directional connectivity estimates from fMRI correspond with ground truth tract tracing experiments. This development and validation can directly aid us in translating findings from the animal model into future studies of the mesoscopic circuit effects of human mental illness."
10769851,"Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the destruction of β-cells, driven through autoimmune attack directed
at the pancreatic islet. In concert with β-cell destruction, β-cell stress and injury contribute to disease by initiating
enzymatic activities that compromise β-cell function and generate neoantigens. The investigators of this project
will integrate knowledge of clinical T1D, β-cell stress, islet reactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and gene
engineering to create Tregs that will home to the islet and suppress autoimmunity and inflammation in a manner
that will create an environment that will allow β-cell recovery and promote β-cell health. These engineered Tregs
(EngTregs) will be generated utilizing homology-directed repair (HDR)-based gene editing to mediate constitutive
expression of FOXP3 combined with lentiviral transduction of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences specific to
antigens presented in the islet during periods of β-cell stress. Further, we propose develop EngTregs with the
ability to co-deliver a payload (with or without TCR engagement) that will function to suppress ongoing
inflammation and/or promote β-cell survival and growth. Aim 1 will generate stressed-islet-specific CD4+ and
CD8+ EngTregs via gene editing and, in parallel, confer specificity to the pancreatic islet via expression of TCRs
that recognize citrullinated or deamidated β-cell-derived neoepitopes. The central hypothesis for Aim 1 is that
targeting neoantigens generated during periods of β-cell stress will enhance the targeted delivery of EngTregs
to the site of tissue injury. Neoepitope discovery studies will identify TCR sequences restricted to novel β-cell
stress neoepitopes. Functional studies will assess stressed-islet-specific EngTregs activation in the presence of
β-cell stress as well as in the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells. Aim 2 will generate islet-specific CD4+
and CD8+ EngTregs that mediate targeted immune suppression and co-deliver an islet-protective therapeutic
cargo. In parallel, we will develop EngTregs that release their cargo upon TCR recognition of antigen. The
proposed studies integrate primary human cell studies with relevant T1D murine models, facilitating more rapid
identification of promising candidate engineered T cell products. The proposed studies are directly responsive
to RFA-DK-21-005 with its request to 1) engineer antigen-specific Treg cells that can home to the pancreatic
islet or pancreatic draining lymph nodes and inhibit effector T cells in these compartments; 2) engineer islet-
homing synthetic suppressor cells, such as CD4+ T cells engineered to locally produce factors that dampen
inflammation, inactivate effector T cells, or promote islet tissue repair; and 3) engineer T cells that produce
factors with trophic effects on β-cells to promote function, immunoprotection and/or replication."
10769789,"Abstract - Photonics-based Fluorescence Imaging for Research, Diagnostics and Pathology
 During the past several decades fluorescence detection has become a central technology throughout the
biosciences. The basic applications include studies of biomolecule function, properties of cell membranes and
localization of target molecules in cells. The more clinical applications include immunoassays, flow cytometry,
point-of-care diagnostics, genetic testing, and cell imaging by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence is
expanding to include in-vivo measurements on brain tissues using multi-photon excitation.
 While fluorescence technology has advanced, it has not kept pace with the advances in electronics and
array detectors (cameras). The sizes of optical components such as lenses and filters are much larger than
electronic components as can be seen from a cell phone with millions of transistors, but only one or two lenses
in a cell phone. This mismatch in size cannot be circumvented by making smaller lenses, filters or fiber optics.
These optical components require dimensions of many wavelengths to manipulate freely propagating light.
 We propose to overcome this limitation by using fluorophores positioned within sub-wavelength near-field
distances from the plasmonic, photonic or plasmonic multi-layer structures (MLS). We are NOT proposing to use
the fluorophores as electronic components, but rather to directly couple their emission into CMOS imaging
detectors with MLSs without free-space propagation of light. The MLS controls the propagation of optical energy,
can separate wavelengths and can direct the energy (coupled photons) towards nearby detectors. This concept
will provide the basis for new devices for research and medicine.
 To demonstrate the usefulness of these devices we have established collaborations with senior faculty in
the School of Medicine. These collaborations include detection of weak binding in drug discovery or high
throughput screening (HTS) because much of the HTS is used with drug fragments which bind weakly to target
molicules. Most of the MLS retain spatial information in the x-y plane which allows either ensemble or virus particle
counting assays for HIV and the Covid-19 virus SARS-CoV-2. The wide field of view will allow whole slide imaging
of pathology specimens.
 Our goal is to develop this new area of near-field effects in fluorescence, with easy to fabricate strruvtures,
to enable a new generation of instruments and devices for fluorescence detection in research, sensing and
imaging."
10769791,"While scientific and medical advances have dramatically increased our ability to prevent, detect and treat
cancer, gaps remain regarding the impact of environmental exposures—particularly chemical and physical
factors—on cancer risk. The overarching goal of this application is to build collaborative infrastructure and
facilitate transdisciplinary scientific research for enhancing our understanding of environmental exposures
influencing cancer etiology, and the genetic, behavioral, and structural factors that modify risk across diverse
populations. We propose to serve as the Coordinating Center for the Cohorts for Environmental Exposures and
Cancer Risk (CEECR) Program. Our mission is to provide intellectual leadership and logistical and
collaborative infrastructure for the CEECR program by integrating efforts across the CEECR cohorts,
facilitating research activities, identifying opportunities for cross-CEECR collaboration, and disseminating
research findings through partnerships with stakeholders. We will draw upon extensive experience
coordinating large-scale consortia, conducting prospective cancer epidemiology studies, and engaging with
community partners to support the CEECR Program. We will facilitate cooperation across the CEECR cohorts
to achieve their UG3/UH3 milestones and realize their full potential as an integrated sustained powerful source
of knowledge for characterizing the impact of environmental exposures on cancer risk. Specific Aims include:
1) providing intellectual leadership and multidisciplinary scientific expertise, establishing a governance
structure, and identifying opportunities to catalyze cross-cohort collaboration; 2) assisting with the identification
of common data elements and the integration of research efforts regarding biological samples and innovative
technologies; 3) facilitating innovative transdisciplinary research by developing evidence-based infrastructure
to support collaboration, coordination, communication, outreach and engagement, and career enhancement;
and 4) fostering resource sharing by CEECR members with external researchers and stakeholders—including
the deposition of data in NIH repositories—to accelerate research and move findings towards translation and
prevention. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in cancer epidemiology, environmental health, team
science, cancer health disparities, cancer biology, toxicology, data science, applied public health practice,
outreach/community engagement, and research administration. The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer
Center provides the ideal environment for supporting the Coordinating Center due to its resources and
established relationships with local and national research and advocacy organizations. The CEECR
Coordinating Center will use multiple innovative approaches to leverage program members’ common passion
for elucidating the role of environmental factors in cancer etiology, provide expanded opportunities for
collaboration, and enable the CEECR Program to bring about substantive reductions in the cancer burden
paying special attention to populations historically excluded from the full benefits of scientific advances."

This application is a competitive renewal of R01-CA-113941 to develop technology and methodologies for time-
of-flight (TOF) imaging to advance the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) instruments and
their utilization in the management of cancer and other diseases. In this renewal we propose to continue a
systematic approach to TOF PET scanner design, but with a shift towards combining advanced TOF technology
with longer axial field-of-view (AFOV) scanner designs. Both the uEXPLORER at UC Davis and the PennPET
Explorer have produced qualitatively superior images, unmatched by modern clinical scanners, and there is
enormous excitement in the field for the opportunities that such total-body (TB) PET instruments offer. However,
the success of TB-PET will ultimately depend on integration and utilization at multiple sites, which, in turn
depends on the cost as well as performance of the instrument. We propose to perform studies to demonstrate
how to achieve improved performance while also considering ways to constrain the cost of the design.
Our goal is to study scanner configurations, with varied axial field-of-view (AFOV) and advanced detector designs
that offer different trade-offs in performance and to judge the merits of these choices by their impact on a variety
of potential TB-PET clinical/research applications. Our studies will include development of enabling technology
for two TOF detector concepts: one (with LYSO) emphasizing TOF performance with a target of 150 ps, below
that of any existing PET scanner, with the other (with BGO) emphasizing higher intrinsic sensitivity. These
detectors will be studied in the context of scanner geometries with full detector coverage, or with inter-ring gaps
that permit extending the AFOV while constraining the number of detectors. A TB-PET scanner has a dramatic
increase in the number of lines-of-response (LORs), so we can leverage the advantages of improved TOF (and
spatial) resolutions to optimize the number of LYSO detectors, or alternatively, use the higher sensitivity, but
less-costly BGO detectors.
Human clinical/research studies performed on the PennPET Explorer scanner will be complemented by
simulations of varying scanner designs and advanced detector technology. The new detector concepts will be
tested both on the benchtop and with a scanner demonstrator setup using a small number of detectors operating
in coincidence. Our work will be guided with consideration of scalability to a full system and the impact of new
methods on system performance and clinical benefit. Our access to clinical research data from a TB-PET system
provides us a unique advantage in achieving our goals. The outcome of this project will provide guidance to
prioritize the design of future TB-PET systems."

outcomes/disparities. The latter will focus on understanding and correcting health disparities in neurosurgery by
combining genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical research. The present proposal is a renewal of our current
UMINDS R25 program that will continue to help transition neurosurgery residents into junior faculty positions
and facilitate the acquisition of independent career development awards (K-equivalent or greater). The goals of
our program are 1) to create an avenue for residents to maintain robust research throughout their residency; 2)
to fully prepare neurosurgery residents for careers as independent surgeon-scientists; 3) to enhance our
trainees’ ability to attain research funding; 4) and to generate high quality research that will ultimately improve

species, FA is a major environmental toxin that is classified as a carcinogen, and FA
exposure is also connected to a variety of other serious diseases ranging from chronic
liver disorders to cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes.
At the same time, the body produces this reactive carbonyl species during normal

carbon cycle. We seek to develop and apply new chemical reagents for selective imaging
and proteomics of FA in living systems to identify its molecular sources and targets, with
the long-term goal of understanding how and in what context this reactive small molecule
contributes to both physiology and disease. This application will focus on new

sources of FA generation and metabolism, with accompanying chemoproteomics methods
to identify targets of FA in genetic models where FA metabolism is compromised. Specific
aims include developing new fluorescent probes for subcellular imaging of FA and

10768811,"ABSTRACT: Despite what are truly modern miracles of science, diagnostics and therapeutics, cardiovascular
disease remains an immense human and societal burden. The objective of this longstanding training grant is to
prepare the next generation of MD and PhD scientists for careers in cardiovascular disease research, for
positive impact on the field. An astounding 90% of prior trainees from the last two cycles have careers which
involve research, and many prior trainees from past T32 grant cycles have become academic cardiovascular
leaders across the country. The Program consists of ten educational opportunity “Pods” spanning a range of
topic areas from translational to clinical and clinical and population science. These Pods provide trainees with
cohesive research opportunities in (1) cardiovascular aging; (2) vascular biology / thrombosis / inflammation;
(3) ion channel biology & arrhythmia; (4) cardiovascular genetics; (5) population/clinical science; (6) cardiac
myocyte biology / myopathies; (7) cardiovascular disease in women; (8) multiomics and system biology
(including metabolism); (9) heart and brain health; and (10) digital health. These latter two Pods represent new
and expanded training opportunities to leverage major new institutional programs, and several of the original
Pods have been expanded/reorganized. The grant, now in its 24th year, provides both didactic training as well
as research immersion for MD, MD PhD, or PhD trainees. It has trained a large number of investigators, many
of whom have led paradigm-changing and sustained research programs and have trainees of their own. Many
of the recent trainees have obtained NIH K- or even R-level funding, with 67% remaining in academia and 23%
having secured industry positions. The T32 core leadership team consists of three senior faculty, each of
whom has a substantial portfolio of research and training, who are drawn from the fields of vascular biology,
cardiovascular pharmacology, and cardiometabolic disease. The program is integrated with common didactic
coursework including a grant-writing workshop, instruction in the responsible conduct of research, and a
diverse array of topical scientific seminars. The glue which holds this program together as a cohesive whole is
the purposeful interactions of trainees at Division-sponsored trainee luncheons, and an interactive networking
program that facilitates interchange among trainee peers and preceptors. Trainees are guided in their
individual didactic programs and experiential learning in labs (bench or computational) with a regular cadence
of meetings with T32 Program Executive leadership, as well as a Trainee Advisory Committee. Metrics for
success include coursework completion, public data presentations, publications, and preparation of an
individual (mock or real) training grant subjected to internal review and feedback. An innovation for this
program includes interaction of trainees with a group of less senior but highly accomplished near-peer
mentors, to supplement the in-depth and frequent Preceptor interactions. The overall goal here is to create and
sustain the next generation of cardiovascular scientists to focus on the most important disease of our era."

While improved early detection methods and treatments have reduced breast cancer mortality, a sizable
portion of patients remains overdiagnosed and overtreated, warranting the development of more conservative
breast cancer treatments. Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is one of the most
attractive, emerging procedures for breast cancer as it can safely and efficaciously treat localized breast
tumors non-invasively. Currently, clinical MRgFUS ablation treatments are assessed with MRI metrics that
primarily quantify thermal and vascular effects. While there is evident MR sensitivity for tissue changes induced
by MRgFUS thermal ablation, no single metric or combination of metrics have demonstrated adequate
accuracy in predicting tissue viability during or immediately post-MRgFUS ablation treatment. In addition, the
use of gadolinium contrast agent-based assessment techniques precludes further ablation treatment if positive
tumor margins are suspected. This work proposes to address this critical unmet need through developing a
deep neural network non-contrast imaging biomarker that would provide an immediate and accurate
assessment of tissue viability and could be applied repeatedly for an iterative assessment of tissue viability
during the MRgFUS ablation procedure, assuring complete non-invasive tumor treatment. This objective will be
accomplished with three specific aims.
Aim 1: Develop and validate a 3D multiparametric MRI protocol for efficient acquisition of qualitative and
quantitative MR images in the breast MRgFUS therapeutic environment.
Aim 2: Develop, train and validate a deep neural network biomarker for predicting tissue viability in a tumor
model during MRgFUS ablation treatments.
Aim 3: Integrate the tissue viability biomarker in an existing breast MRgFUS ablation clinical workflow and
demonstrate complete treatment volume ablation using the non-contrast, deep neural network biomarker as
the treatment assessment metric.
We have developed an innovative, volumetric histopathology diffeomorphic registration procedure that allows
the voxel-wise comparison of in vivo MR images to histopathological data, providing the gold-standard labeled
data set needed to develop this imaging biomarker. Training and validation of the imaging biomarker will be
performed in preclinical models designed to allow immediate generalizability and translation to ongoing clinical
trials. This imaging biomarker will provide accurate assessment of tissue viability during MRgFUS ablation
treatments, revolutionizing minimally invasive breast cancer treatments and directly addressing the critical
issue of overtreatment."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devastating illness, with a clear need for the development of novel
anti-leukemic therapy. Inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins to directly stimulate apoptosis provides a
feasible therapeutic strategy for treating AML. Venetoclax, a BCL2-specific inhibitor, has exhibited promising
anti-leukemic effect in a subset of patients with AML. However, resistance to venetoclax can develop. Therefore,
identification of other synergistic targets attacking the apoptosis defense system is needed to enhance the
efficacy of anti-BCL2 therapy in AML. Integrating functional genomics and xenograft models, I developed an in
vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen approach to identify MARCH5, a RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase, as an essential gene
for AML cell growth. My preliminary studies showed that MARCH5 is a critical regulator of apoptosis in AML cells.
MARCH5-depleted AML cells display increased apoptotic cell death and enhanced sensitivity to venetoclax,
suggesting that MARCH5 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for AML. The goal of this proposal is to
evaluate the translational potential of targeting MARCH5 as an AML therapy, and investigate the mechanism of
action of MARCH5 protein and its related network to provide biological insights for the development of therapeutic
strategies targeting MARCH5. The Specific Aims are: (1) Determine the domains of the MARCH5 protein critical
for preventing apoptosis in AML; (2) Evaluate the therapeutic potential of MARCH5 inhibition in preclinical models
of AML; and (3) Identify the key regulatory proteins critical for MARCH5-mediated apoptosis regulation. This
study will deepen our understanding of the apoptosis regulation and its clinical application in AML, uncover novel
therapeutic opportunities for targeting MARCH5 and AML, and provide a synergistic approach to enhance the
efficacy of venetoclax in AML and potentially other malignancies.
I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier at the Department of Pediatric
Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). My current research focuses on identification and
characterization novel dependencies in acute leukemia, and the application of these knowledge to the
development of novel therapeutic approaches. My long-term career goal is to establish a research program
focusing on understanding the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis and leukemia vulnerabilities, with a
strong commitment to translate basic scientific discoveries into the clinic. The proposed research will form a solid
platform from which I can establish my own research group by the end of the K99 Award period. I have developed
a focused training plan to accomplish my goal: (1) expand my scientific knowledge and vision; (2) sharpen my
critical thinking and technical skills; and (3) develop and strengthen my professional skills. With the mentorship
of Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier, deep support from my scientific advisory committee, and rich resource and

10746911,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The anaphase-promoting complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a well-defined multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin
ligase that regulates targeted cell cycle regulators for degradation by the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway
(UPP), promoting cell cycle progression from metaphase to anaphase and being involved in G1 phase
maintenance. The APC/C E3 ligase complex is evolutionarily conserved and relies on two adaptor proteins,
Cdc20 and Cdh1, to recognize different target proteins and regulate cell cycle progression. However,
compared to Cdc20 that is subjected to Cdh1-mediated destruction, regulation of the E3 ligase activity of
Cdh1 is not well known yet. Previous study has shown that there were 19 serine and threonine residues on
Cdh1 that can be phosphorylated by multi-kinases in vivo, indicating that the phosphoregulation of Cdh1 is
much more complex. In the present proposal, I found that CDK4 can phosphorylates Cdh1 in vitro and
modulates its E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation of Cdh1 by CDK4 can be
recognized by the Pin1 proline isomerase, facilitating Cdh1-Pin1 complex formation. In keeping with this
notion, employment of the CDK4/6 inhibitor or mutating the phosphorylation sites can disrupt the Cdh1-Pin1
interaction. Consequently, Cdh1 can mediate Pin1 for polyubiquitination and degradation. As such, depletion
of endogenous Cdh1 abolished the Pin1 inhibitor treatment induced Pin1 degradation in cells. Importantly,
the Pin1 inhibitor-induced cell proliferation suppression was also abolished in Cdh1-null MEFs, suggesting
the functional presence of Cdh1 is required for Pin1 inhibitor-induced cell proliferation suppression. In
addition, combination of the CDK4/6 inhibitor and Pin1 inhibitor exhibits significantly enhanced suppressing
effect in breast cancer cells. In the first Aim of this proposal, I am going to explore the role of CDK4 kinase in
regulating the E3 ligase activity of Cdh1 (Aim #1). Therefore, the second Aim in this proposal will be
exploring the potential role of Cdh1 in mediating Pin1 inhibitor treatment induced Pin1 protein destruction
(Aim 2). Together, these results implicate a functional role of the CDK4/Cdh1/Pin1 signaling axis in regulating
cell proliferation, and provide rational for combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor and Pin1 inhibitor to treat breast
cancer."

Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have the highest hemoglobin A1c values of
all across the lifespan. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is a modern approach to glucose assessment
that provides in-the-moment information about glucose levels to help optimize time-in-range ([TIR] 70-180
mg/dL). Retrospective review of ambulatory glucose patterns is an essential component for improving diabetes
self-care. However, many CGM users become overwhelmed by the voluminous CGM data and rarely review or
download their CGM. Furthermore, interpretation of CGM data should not occur in a vacuum, rather one
should consider contextual factors that impact self-care in order to improve glycemic regulation. Thus, to
maximize the clinical value of CGM in AYA with T1D, a novel, ecologically grounded approach is needed to
contextualize CGM data with information on the intra- and inter-personal context in which glucose regulation
occurs. It is timely to pair ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with CGM to develop an intervention
program to improve self-care, glycemia, and psychosocial outcomes. We will use rigorous methods to capture
dynamic relationships between in-the-moment ratings of emotional and social experiences (using EMA) and
CGM-recorded glucose values, which will be collectively displayed on a dashboard, encapsulating the
emotional and social context of ambulatory glucose (psychosocial ambulatory glucose [PAG]). Tracking
and reviewing of PAG patterns, along with ongoing structured support, within a multicomponent intervention,
will help AYA with T1D to better interpret and behaviorally respond to out-of-range glucose values, and may
serve as a catalyst to improve A1c, TIR, and self-care, as well as reduce diabetes distress. Amit Shapira, PhD,
proposes a series of studies with an overarching goal of developing, iteratively refining, and testing a PAG
intervention in AYA with T1D. The proposed 3 specific aims are: 1) to identify salient components of a PAG
dashboard using EMA that will coordinate the display of emotional and social context coupled with CGM
recorded data to enhance self-care of AYA with T1D above target A1c values using mixed methods; 2) to
adapt and build upon the dashboard for use in a behavioral intervention through expert feedback and guidance
from pertinent stakeholders; and 3) to examine if a pilot RCT of a refined PAG behavioral intervention will be
acceptable, feasible, and satisfactory to participants and have potential to improve diabetes and psychosocial
outcomes compared with PAG-alone. Results from these studies will inform a fully powered RCT for a future
R01 application. Dr. Shapira’s career objective is to become an independent diabetes behavioral researcher
focused on optimizing self-care, including use of CGM and other technologies, to improve outcomes for people
with T1D. The 5-year, mentored career development program will provide her with necessary skills in diabetes
care (e.g., diabetes technologies), advanced statistical methods, and usability and qualitative research to
launch her independence in diabetes behavioral investigation."

Whilst functions of subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissues (WAT) have been extensively analyzed,
roles of adipocytes within other depots have not been fully investigated. One population of particular
importance are bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds), which functionally interact with hematopoietic cells,
osteoblasts, and osteoclasts to influence the homeostasis of blood cell formation and bone remodeling.
Although potential connections between bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) and hematopoietic and bone
metabolism have been speculated on for decades, rigorous validation and mechanistic studies have been
limited by the lack of BMAd-specific animal models. We created a novel BMAd-specific Cre mouse model, that
uses an intersectional strategy with dual recombinases: Osterix-FLPo and FLPo-dependent Adipoq-Cre (FAC)
to stimulate recombination of floxed alleles predominantly in BMAd populations. Taking advantage of this novel
BMAd-Cre mouse model, we found that BMAd lipolysis (i.e. Pnpla2) is necessary for myelopoiesis and
osteoblast functions under conditions of energy deficit, suggesting that BMAds supply fuel substrates to other
cells within the marrow niche. We then created mice lacking BMAds, and found that, in toto, BMAds suppress
endocortical bone formation but are required for maintaining hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pools. There
are several open questions in the field. How does BMAT increase with caloric restriction (CR) whereas WAT
decreases? What are the molecular, metabolic, and functional differences between regulated and constitutive
BMAT and WAT? How does BMAd lipid metabolism influence functioning of neighboring cells, especially
hematopoiesis and osteoblasts? Our hypotheses are 1) that the selective expansion of BMAT with CR is due
to increased glucose uptake and de novo lipogenesis of BMAd, 2) that molecular signatures of regulated BMAd
(rBMAd), constitutive BMAd (cBMAd) and white adipocyte (WAd) reflect their unique location and regulation,
and will provide insights into their local functions, and 3) that BMAd metabolism, including uptake of lipid by
CD36, is critical for regulation of bone and hematopoietic cellularity through secretion of extracellular vesicles,
adipokines, cytokines, and microRNAs. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1)
To identify metabolic and molecular mechanisms that cause BMAT to expand with CR, whereas WAT depots
are decreased. 2) To investigate molecular and functional characteristics of rBMAds, cBMAds, and WAds. 3)
To investigate roles and mechanisms of BMAd metabolism in the regulation of bone and hematopoietic
cellularity."
10771250,"The overarching goal of this project is to understand how cell growth triggers cell division in yeast and in
mammalian cells. Solving this question of has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how cell division
is regulated in both natural developmental contexts and in disease. Our work has fundamental implications for
understanding how the most basic aspect of cell morphology, cell size, is controlled, and may identify novel
molecular mechanisms that can rationally be targeted in cancer therapies.
My laboratory recently made a breakthrough discovery in understanding how growth triggers division in budding
yeast. While it was expected that growth would act to increase the activities of the cyclin-dependent kinases
(Cdk) known to promote cell division, this is not the case. Rather, we found that cell growth acts in the opposite
manner. Cell growth triggers division by diluting a protein that inhibits cell division, Whi5.
This MIRA project aims to leverage our breakthrough discovery in understanding how growth triggers division in
yeast to understand the underlying transcriptional mechanism in yeast and to understand how this works in
mammalian cells. This is now possible thanks to the rapid advances in mammalian genome editing technologies
that allow us to tag cell cycle regulators at their endogenous loci. We can now measure, for the first time, the
dynamics of concentration changes of almost any protein expressed from its endogenous locus in individual
growing and dividing cells. To determine the mechanisms linking growth to division, we will examine how cell
size and growth impacts the concentration of key cell cycle regulators at single cell resolution. In addition, we
aim to examine transcription as a function of cell size genomewide in both yeast and diverse human cell types
to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms."

 Poor adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment remains the single largest
impediment to effective management for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leading to increased morbidity,
mortality, and higher health care costs. Existing interventions promoting CPAP adherence focus only on the
diagnosed individual and are delivered mostly by health professionals, with limited success. As supported by
the findings of the PI’s R15 project, the partners of patients play a significant role – either positive or negative –
in CPAP adherence, and are part of all of the major facilitative aspects and barriers to CPAP use. A dyadic
approach engaging both the patient and partner to promote CPAP adherence remains an untapped
opportunity. Our interdisciplinary team has developed a prototype of OurSleepKit, which is an innovative
couple-focused mHealth tool to promote CPAP adherence. Guided by the conceptual framework of partner
involvement in CPAP adherence, the goal of OurSleepKit is to coach mutual engagement and model positive
partner involvement in CPAP treatment, thus motivating greater CPAP adherence. Responding to the PA-18-
722, the goal of this R01 project is to refine and test OurSleepKit to support adherence to CPAP treatment. We
will refine and deploy OurSleepKit on an established secure mHealth platform, NUCoach. Getting users to
engage with an mHealth intervention is critical to its success, and low user engagement with existing mHealth
tools remains a big concern. To address this issue, we will use a participatory approach to refine OurSleepKit
and comprehensively evaluate both its effect on CPAP adherence and user engagement. Specifically, we will
1) Refine OurSleepKit using qualitative methods within a standardized iterative participatory approach by
working with end users (OSA patients and their partners); 2) Examine the effectiveness of OurSleepKit on
CPAP adherence by conducting a 6-month randomized parallel group controlled trial in 180 couples (newly
diagnosed OSA patients and their partners); and 3) Evaluate user engagement in the intervention group by
tracking objective OurSleepKit usage and understanding the subjective user experience. Results of this project
will support the development of an effective and engaging mHealth tool which can be readily adopted by OSA
patients and their partners to support adherence to CPAP treatment. Given the frequency and depth of
interaction that most patients have with their partner, OurSleepKit is likely to succeed with a sustainable effect
on CPAP adherence leading to significant health benefits. If shown to be successful, OurSleepKit can be easily
integrated with other interventions and existing technology to better promote CPAP use. This new mHealth
intervention facilitates changing the current care of OSA from a reactive disease-focused model to a more
proactive self-management model. Going beyond OSA, OurSleepKit can be an exemplar of using mHealth
technology to optimize treatment adherence and self-management involving family care partners."
10771502,"Overall Plan: Summary
The overall goal of this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) application is to strengthen the
biomedical research infrastructure in Montana with a focus on the central, multi-disciplinary theme of Integrated
Biomedical and Rural Health Research, a subject that is both sufficiently broad to enable recruitment of diverse
faculty and sufficiently focused to build cohesiveness around a common goal to address rural health in a multi-
disciplinary fashion that includes basic, translational and clinical studies. The Center for Biomedical and Rural
Health Research encompasses mentorship and collaboration between faculty in the established partnership
between the McLaughlin Research Institute, the Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine - Montana,
and the Benefis Healthcare System, the largest comprehensive provider in central Montana extending across
38,000 square miles with outreach services present in 94 percent of Montana’s counties. We focus on building
capacity in research on health problems that are especially of concern and/or prevalence in rural environments
with three specific aims to: 1) Enhance the success of Research Project Leaders (RPLs) along the integrated
trajectory from bench to translational animal models, to clinical applications. 2) Recruit a minimum of eight
additional faculty, in Phase I, as RPLs and Pilot Project Investigators (PPIs) to increase the number of
investigators, and their scope and impact, in integrated biomedical research. 3) Build and maintain two critical
core facilities that support expansion of research infrastructure. To accomplish our aims, we present four initial
projects focused on neurological diseases, diseases that are common and distinctively devastating, in rural
environments: Neutrophil apoptosis in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, age-related macular degeneration and
exosome release, misfolded SOD-1 and α-synuclein proteins in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), and
comprehensive phenotypic profiling of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). Each project is led by a new or an early-
stage investigator with an engaged mentoring team specifically tailored to their career development. Supporting
these projects are two cores: The Administrative Core and the Gene Editing and Mouse Models Assessment
(GEMMA) Core. This application is significant as it establishes a unique and sustainable center that serves the
two primary purposes of supporting career development of new and early-stage investigators in a unique
geographical and socio-cultural area of Montana and of advancing our understanding of conditions of special
concern and/or prevalence in rural communities. The application is innovative in multiple aspects but especially
as it: 1) Taps into the strengths and resources of an extensive and under-utilized sector of the healthcare
community through a partnership between an independent nonprofit research organization, an osteopathic
medical campus and a rural-serving healthcare system, and 2) serves the dual purpose of providing
unprecedented opportunities for expansion of biomedical research, talent recruitment and innovation in a rural
region of the United States while also providing the physical and intellectual presence in situ that is required to
increase public trust in biomedical research in the northern Rocky Mountain front and adjacent communities."
10771503,"Administrative Core: Summary
The overall goal of the Administrative Core (Core A) of this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
application is to provide the leadership, services, coordination and tools necessary for the success of Research
Project Leaders (RPLs), Core Directors, Pilot Project Investigators (PPIs), the External Advisory Council (EAC),
Internal Mentoring Council (IMC) members, and collaborators. We seek to accomplish our overall goal via four
specific aims to provide: 1) Administrative leadership, services, and tools to support career development and
expansion of the community of researchers in integrated biomedical and rural health research, 2) administrative
infrastructure for the recruitment of additional faculty, 3) administrative support, services and oversight to the
Gene Editing and Mouse Models Assessment (GEMMA) Research Core, and 4) leadership and support for
evaluation and other services, as needed, to ensure successful day-to-day functioning. The Administrative Core
is significant in that it will drive development and attainment of the overall COBRE timeline and milestones for
success, support development and implementation of Career Guidance Plans, oversee the progress of the
COBRE’s four initial research projects, identify and support replacement research projects, direct the Pilot
Project Program, provide continual evaluation of projects, mentors, core leaders and administration, and develop
and implement the COBRE’s Sustainability Plan through which we can effectively transition from COBRE phase
I to COBRE II and III phases with a diversified, sustainable and applicable post-COBRE funding model. The
Administrative Core is innovative in providing continual opportunities for growth through on-the-job experience
and educational enhancement, in fostering a close working relationship between scientists, administration and
the community, in promoting the intrinsic sense of individual and collective ownership of problems and solutions,
and in innovative mentoring and partnership with the first physician medical education organization in Montana
and the largest comprehensive healthcare system in central Montana. Additional innovation derives from the
location of the CoBRE within the McLaughlin Research Institute which is the only independent nonprofit
biomedical research institute nationally that is led by a female President with a majority of female faculty. To
ensure success of the component parts and the COBRE overall, we engage in ongoing comprehensive
evaluation. In short, the Administrative Core is responsible for directing the launch, day-to-day activities, and
sustained success of the Center for Integrated Biomedical and Rural Health Research in order to expand and
enhance biomedical research across Montana and our region."
10775716,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While the genomic revolution has identified several important mutations involved in cancer
progression, only a minority of patients benefit from therapies that target these alterations. An
emerging area of interest involves aberrant epigenetic modifications, which have been implicated
in a broad range of solid tumor malignancies. Importantly, specific epigenetic biomarkers have
been identified, often at much higher frequencies than genomic markers (e.g., hypermethylation
of the GSTP1 promoter is found in more than 90% of prostate cancer primary tumors). Thus, there
is a critical need to extend the concepts of precision medicine beyond genomic aberrations to
include epigenomic alterations that drive cancer progression and treatment resistance.
Unfortunately, assays to identify epigenetic biomarkers lack the sensitivity to measure many
clinical samples, which often contain relatively low cell numbers. Much of this insensitivity stems
from the extensive manipulation of DNA/protein complexes required to identify specific epigenetic
markers and the associated inadvertent dissociation of these interactions (resulting in analyte
loss). Therefore, we aim to improve the state-of-the-art of epigenetic analyses via the
implementation of two technologies to preserve molecular interactions: 1) Exclusion-based
Sample Preparation (ESP) and 2) Exclusive Liquid Repellency (ELR). With ESP, analytes are
bound to functionalized paramagnetic particles (PMPs) and magnetically transferred across
phase boundaries (e.g., air/aqueous, oil/aqueous) to isolate the PMP-bound analyte(s). The rapid
and non-dilutive nature of ESP preserves molecular interactions, particularly those that are labile
or short-lived. ELR utilizes aqueous droplets in oil that are “repelled” from a surface (i.e., they
remain suspended and do not contact the surface) to minimize surface-derived analyte loss (e.g.,
adsorption) while also minimizing reaction volumes (mitigating inadvertent dissociation).
Together, the combination of ESP-ELR platform will significantly improve the efficiency of
epigenetic analyses, facilitating epigenetic measurements within small clinical samples (e.g.,
needle biopsies, circulating tumor cells). Specifically, we will develop, optimize, and benchmark
ESP-ELR versions of methylation analysis (where a methylated DNA binding protein (MBD2) is
employed to selectively capture methylated DNA sequences) and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP; where histone/DNA complexes are isolated in order to interrogate chromatin status).
Lastly, we will automate the platform and use it to perform a prospective biomarker validation
study of GSTP1 paving the way for it’s use in clinical trials. Here we focus on prostate cancer as
a model system, but we expect that an improved platform for epigenetic analysis will have broad
impact across the biomedical sciences."

This project is a pilot effectiveness trial designed to evaluate Cognitive Processing Therapy
augmented with a suicide risk management protocol (CPT+SRM), as a viable treatment for
individuals with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality
disorder (BPD). PTSD is a significant public health problem associated with debilitating
outcomes such as suicide, employment difficulties, and family disruption. These outcomes are
further compounded when PTSD is comorbid with BPD. The comorbidity of PTSD and BPD
(PTSD-BPD) is as high as 58% and is associated with even greater functional impairment (e.g.,
suicide risk) and, subsequently, healthcare utilization than either disorder alone. Despite the
clinical and economic burden associated with PTSD-BPD, few treatments exist for this
population and emerging treatments are lengthy, intensive, resource-heavy, and difficult to
sustain in real-world community settings. Using an experimental therapeutics approach, this
proposal evaluates CPT+SRM as a parsimonious, integrative intervention that targets key
mechanisms shared across PTSD and BPD- i.e., emotional reactivity and cognitive dysfunction.
The Stanford Outpatient General Adult Psychosocial Treatment Clinic will serve as the
treatment site and study therapists will be community clinicians with part-time appointments at
the clinic. Phase 1 of this investigation will consist of an initial case series (N=5) in which we will
develop and iterate the manual, develop fidelity measures, and streamline our research
procedures. The finalized treatment manual will then be tested in Phase 2, a randomized-
controlled trial (N=28) comparing 12 individual sessions/6 weeks of CPT+SRM (n=14) versus 6
weeks of SRM only (n=14). Participants will be assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment/3-
weeks, post-treatment/6-weeks, and 3-month post-treatment follow-up. Aim 1 will be to evaluate
the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of CPT+SRM. Aim 2 will be to preliminarily evaluate the
effectiveness of CPT+SRM. Aim 3 will be to examine the relationship between change in our
putative target mechanisms (measured using self-report, behavioral, and physiological
indicators), and primary clinical outcomes (i.e., PTSD and BPD severity). The long-term
objective of this research is to conduct a subsequent large-scale intervention trial through an
R01 mechanism and ultimately enhance service delivery and accessibility of care for this
clinically complex and economically burdensome population."
10802439,"Social-emotional difficulties and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors in children are both prevalent in the US, tend to co-occur, and share underlying risk and protective factors. Difficulties in either domain are associated with a range of adverse short- and long-term health outcomes, such as mental health disorders, substance use disorders, academic problems, and chronic health conditions. Child social-emotional difficulties and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors may be exacerbated by major family stressors, such as parental trauma history and mental health difficulties, parental HIV, parental substance misuse, economic strain, and racial discrimination. Family stressors may contribute to children’s well-being indirectly by exacerbating parenting stress, impeding parents’ self-regulation, and hampering their parenting efforts. Several preventive interventions are effective in improving parenting skills and promoting children’s well-being. However, families dealing with major stressors face significant barriers to accessing and reaping the benefits of these preventive interventions, in part because of a limited focus on parents’ own stress and coping strategies. Further, these interventions typically target child outcomes in either social-emotional or healthy lifestyle domains, but not both concurrently. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a parent-based preventive intervention targeting parental self-regulation, stress reduction, and positive parenting, to promote child social-emotional and lifestyle health, among parents who have a child aged 3-9 and who are experiencing major stressors, such as history of trauma, mental health difficulties, HIV, racial discrimination, substance misuse, and/or financial strain. This pilot feasibility study is being conducted with a sample of n = 60 families randomized to a family stress-oriented preventive intervention or waitlist control. Aims include examination of: (1) feasibility, acceptability, and implementation processes of the parent-based preventive intervention via mixed methods, and (2) preliminary efficacy of the preventive intervention regarding child well-being (mood, social competence, sleep, screen time, physical activity), positive parenting, and parenting stress and self-regulation. This project is innovative in that it seeks to concurrently promote the dual prevention of children’s unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and social-emotional difficulties, emphasizing parental self-regulation and stress reduction in the context of a parenting support program. This line of research ultimately targets prevalence reduction for children’s social-emotional and health-behavior difficulties by addressing parent stress, promoting parental self-regulation, and bolstering parenting efficacy."

β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is the main culprit in preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its rate conditions
severity of ensuing neurofibrillary degeneration and precipitates the onset of cognitive deficit. Identification of AD
associated variants in the TREM2 receptor, which render microglia defective in processing Aβ plaques, well
underscores the meaning of protective function glial cell play in Aβ proteostasis. Like microglia, astrocytes
respond to Aβ deposits by altering their phenotype and function, yet molecular mechanisms governing astrocytic
response and those underlying the cooperative cross-talk between astrocytes and microglia in countering Aβ
deposition remain ill-defined. In this proposal, we put forward a novel hypothesis that an astrocytic protein
Peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 6 plays a pivotal role in these two intertwined processes. PRDX6 has two independent
enzymatic sites endowing glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and phospholipase 2 (PLA2) activities. PRDX6 is
abundantly expressed by alveolar epithelium and endothelial cells and it is responsible for repair of peroxidatively
damaged cell membrane lipids, phospholipid metabolism, and cellular signaling. In the CNS, PRDX6 is
expressed by astrocytes, and its role in neurodegeneration remains unexplored. Our hypothesis is based on
extensive preliminary data showing that hemizygous knock in of the overexpressing Prdx6 transgene in APP/PS1
mouse model promotes selective enticement of astrocytes to Aβ plaques and penetration of plaques by astrocytic
processes along with increased number and phagocytic activation of periplaque microglia. This effects
suppression of nascent plaque seeding and remodeling of mature plaques consequently curtailing brain Aβ load
and Aβ associated neuritic degeneration. Conversely, Prdx6 haplodeficiency attenuates astro- and microglia
activation around Aβ plaques promoting Aβ deposition and neuritic degeneration. Thus, our data evidence that
PRDX6 expression level in astrocytes circuitously modulates microglia function implying astrocyte-guided
microglia effect in Aβ proteostasis. Furthermore, our showing that upregulation of PRDX6 attenuates Aβ
pathology implies a novel disease modifying strategy for AD. Aim 1 of this application will use newly developed
APP/PS1 mice, which are homozygous for the overexpressing Prdx6 transgene and APP/PS1 mice with Prdx6
knockout to determine the extent of Prdx6 overexpression expedience and conversely consequences of Prdx6
deletion on Aβ deposition, periplaque astro- and micro- glia response, Aβ-associated neurodegeneration and
behavioral deficit. Aim 2 will dissect individual effects of Gpx and PLA2 functions on curtailing Aβ pathology
through crossing APP/PS1 mice with readily available Prdx6 mutant mice, in which selective point mutations
rendered either enzymatic site inactive. Aim 3 will employ transcriptomic approaches to identify molecular
pathways involved in astro/microglia cross talk, which we expect to be altered by manipulating Prdx6 expression
level in Prdx6 overexpressing and knockout mice. Transcriptomic approaches also will determine whether
PRDX6 modulates activation phenotype of astrocytes and microglia and regulates glia inflammatory response."

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive lung disease which can lead to respiratory failure and
potential death. LAM is treated with drugs targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
however, only a subset of patients responds to the treatment which is transient and not curative. Interestingly,
there are numerous studies which have suggested that other pathways are important in the pathogenesis of
the disease. Our laboratory has demonstrated that high mobility group HMGA2, a non-histone chromosomal
architectural transcription factor, is critical in the pathogenesis of LAM. Published studies from our group
demonstrate that HMGA2 is required for the mesenchymal tumorigenesis in the tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2+/-)
mouse model. We therefore hypothesize that the HMGA2 signaling pathway drives the pathogenesis of
tumors initiated in the TSC2 haploinsufficiency state in LAM. Furthermore, we postulate that the expression
of HMGA2 and its oncogenic pathway genes can be used clinically for LAM diagnosis and potential prognosis.
To test our hypotheses, we propose the following objectives: In the first aim our studies we will test the
hypothesis that fluxes in expression of HMGA2 pathway targets can be used as indices of LAM disease
occurrence and severity. In the second aim of the study, we will further delineate the role of the HMGA2
pathway in the disease of LAM by determining if genetic and pharmacological disruption of the HMGA2
pathway disrupts growth and tumor formation in human iPS cells from LAM patients."

Current models of learning and memory have focused on cell-autonomous regulation of synaptic strength such
as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD). Learning and experience induces a specific set of genes
that mediate long-lasting maintenance of synaptic strength, epigenetic alterations of chromatin, and neuronal
homeostasis. One key activity-dependent gene, Arc, is a critical mediator of long-lasting synaptic plasticity and
memory. Recently, we identified a new type of intercellular communication mediated by Arc that could be central
to its function. We unexpectedly observed that purified Arc protein spontaneously forms virus-like capsids and
determined that the Arc gene originated from an ancient family of retrotransposons. We posited that if Arc forms
capsids, perhaps other functional aspects of retroviruses have also been retained. We found that purified Arc
capsids encapsulate RNA, including Arc mRNA. Endogenous Arc from brain also associates with its own mRNA
and is released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from primary cultured neurons. Strikingly, Arc-containing EVs can
transfer Arc mRNA into Arc knock-out neurons. Thus, Arc has retained biochemical functions of the ancestral
retrovirus Gag protein. These findings raise the possibility that Arc-dependent intercellular communication might
underlie its function in learning and memory. Uptake of Arc EVs in neighboring neurons could result in Arc-
mediated AMPAR endocytosis and synapse weakening. Arc has been implicated in the removal of AMPARs
from weak synapses on the same dendrite in a form of heterosynaptic depression. However, Arc mRNA or
protein transfer between synapses could mediate heterosynaptic plasticity at the circuit level, facilitating the
stabilization of memory circuits by weaking surrounding neurons that were not active during learning. The main
aim of this proposal is to test whether Arc mediates intercellular synaptic plasticity and mechanisms of Arc
intercellular signaling. We have identified the BAR domain protein IRSp53 as an Arc interacting protein that
mediates the release of Arc from cells after LTP induction. In preliminary data, we found that Arc EVs induce a
loss of surface AMPA receptors in recipient cells.
Based on these data, we will test the following model using live-imaging and electrophysiology techniques: LTP
increases Arc protein expression in dendrites, which assembles into oligomeric virus-like capsids. LTP also
increases IRSp53 expression in dendrites, where it interacts with Arc to facilitate Arc release in EVs. Once
released, Arc EVs are taken up by neighboring neurons, inducing AMPAR endocytosis that results in non-cell
autonomous weakening of synapse strength. The proposed studies will help uncover a new form of intercellular
synaptic plasticity that may be important for memory and cognition. Disruption of Arc-dependent plasticity is
implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders – thus our work will help further clarify
mechanisms underlying these disorders."
10782009,"The neural crest is a multipotent embryonic cell population that gives rise to most of the craniofacial skeleton,
including cartilage, bone and connective tissue. Misregulation of neural crest development results in the vast
majority of craniofacial malformations and birth defects. Thus, uncovering the molecular and genetic
underpinnings of neural crest formation has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these
pathologies. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a multi-level gene regulatory network, in which
progenitor cells are progressively committed to a neural crest fate. This process requires not only shifts in gene
expression but also an extensive remodeling of the epigenomic landscape. The chromatin remodeling events
which occur between two respective stages of neural crest formation, induction and specification, are driven in
part by the action of the pioneer factor TFAP2A. TFAP2A activates distinct sets of genomic regions during
induction and specification of neural crest cells, and its target specificity is dependent upon its dimerization with
paralogous proteins TFAP2C and TFAP2B. This heterodimeric switch between TFAP2A/C and TFAP2A/B acts
to drive the transition from induction to specification, allowing for progressive cell fate commitment of neural
crest cells. Consistent with this idea, TFAP2B expression is both necessary and sufficient to drive the transition
from induction to specification. Analysis of an enhancer of TFAP2B has implicated SMAD2/3 nuclear effectors
as predicted drivers of TFAP2B expression. This observation has led to the hypothesis that TFAP2 pioneer
factors integrate environmental signals into the gene regulatory network to drive the transition from induction to
specification within the neural crest lineage. The F99 phase of this proposal aims to investigate the role of
SMAD nuclear effectors and their upstream signaling systems in the control of TFAP2B expression and
consequently the neural crest specification program. This work will shed light on how environmental stimuli act
to remodel the chromatin landscape within the presumptive neural crest.
Moreover, while much focus has been paid to understand the cis-regulatory control of neural crest cell
formation, we still have very little insight on the molecular mechanisms by which these cells differentiate to
form the bone and cartilage of the face. Single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility in neural crest
differentiation will allow for the identification of enhancer elements specific to numerous facial compartments.
Furthermore, identification of compartment-specific drivers will reveal how these regulatory factors act to
orchestrate the formation of highly complex and nuanced structures within the craniofacial skeleton. Ultimately,
this data may be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of the etiology of congenital birth defects linked to
the misregulation of craniofacial morphogenesis."

The gut microbiota is recognized as a central factor influencing immune responses. This proposal addresses
two important questions in understanding how microbes regulate human health: 1) What are the microbe-
derived molecules that influence immunity? 2) How does chronic exposure to microbial products alters the
phenotype of immune cells in their local environment? Discovering and characterizing the molecules involved
in the crosstalk between symbiont microbes and the immune system is a fundamental step towards modulating
both the beneficial and harmful potential of the human-microbe relationship.
The first major aspect of this project (Aims 1 and 2) uses a series of biochemical approaches to define specific
bioactive microbial lipids from human-derived gut microbes that activate invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a
specialized lymphocyte subset that recognizes specific lipids as antigens and orchestrates immune responses
in multiple contexts. Although animal models have uncovered a role for iNKT cells in immunity, the lipid
antigens that they recognize remain unknown in most situations. Here, we study two human symbiont
microbes that produce iNKT cell-activating lipids, an uncommon feature among gut anaerobes. To identify the
specific molecular lipid species that activate iNKT cells, we will use a newly-developed method, the “T cell
receptor trap,” to capture antigenic lipids. Once purified, these lipids will be characterized by mass
spectrometry, including new methods that distinguish sugar stereochemistry, which is of central importance to
the activity of lipids that activate iNKT cells.
The second major aspect of this project (Aim 3) builds on preliminary transcriptomic data to investigate how
chronic exposure to lipid antigens affects the phenotype of iNKT cells in the gut in a mouse model. Since iNKT
cells orchestrate immune responses in many situations, and can be either beneficial and harmful, changes to
their phenotype in the gut is likely to alter the course of enteral infection, inflammatory bowel disease, colon
cancer, or food allergy. To understand how lipids in the gut regulate iNKT cell populations, we will use two
reductionist models, feeding mice with experimental diets containing different levels of iNKT cell lipid antigens,
or colonization of germ-free mice with lipid antigen-producing microbes. In these models, we will perform high-
depth phenotyping of the gut iNKT cell populations.
Together, these studies will define lipid antigens from two important members of the human gut microbiota and
shed light on the mechanisms by which gut lipid antigens shape iNKT cell populations."

The control of movement, in spite of its seemingly effortless execution, belies a complex, multi-level collective of
neuromuscular interactions tuned and coordinated through sensory experience. Efficient and flexible behavior
in everyday contexts requires neural mechanisms that support rapid updating whenever objects around us, or
even our own movements, are disrupted during ongoing motion. As a movement unfolds, the need for predictive
or responsive control to correct for contextual perturbations changes. For example, the early stages of an action
typically exhibit fast responses to perturbations, suggesting the existence of feed-forward processes that use
internal models to predict the sensory consequences. On the other hand, later phases appear to employ
continuous sensory feedback to adjust movements. While much is known about updating for postural and arm
movements, very little is understood about the neural mechanisms of updating of dexterous movements of the
hand as we interact with objects. While the reach-to-grasp cortical anatomy is well described, the causal
functional roles of the regions still remain elusive. In particular, it is now becoming clear that the dominant
framework which describes reach-to-grasp control as being under the control of independent frontoparietal
channels is untenable because it does not explain recent empirical neurophysiological findings. Therefore, the
current project aims to leverage non-invasive stimulation to induce transient cortical perturbations, paired with
visual perturbations to the task goal and mechanical perturbations of the internal state of the limb, to causally
evaluate the contributions of four critical brain regions in components of the reach-to-grasp action. The
information derived from this work will provide a more solid background for our understanding of the functional
organization of the frontoparietal reach-to-grasp network and, by extension, of hand-arm control coordination.
This project will advance our empirical understanding of how dexterous updating of the upper limb, in particular
reach-to-grasp actions, are orchestrated by the brain. The knowledge will be immediately applicable and
translatable for rehabilitation of upper limb recovery in stroke and other similar disorders, by using error
augmentation through visual and haptic platforms to facilitate skill reacquisition and identifying cortical targets
for non-invasive neuromodulatory stimulation. These findings will be relevant to the mission of the NIH, with
broad interest to clinicians and basic scientists, and will have direct"

The proposed research explores the mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysfunction in eosinophilic esophagitis
(EoE). During its active disease phase, EoE is characterized by Th2-type, eosinophil-rich inflammation with high
levels of IL-13, IL-4 and chemoattractant chemokines. There is a growing appreciation that epithelial dysfunction
in active EoE may play an equally important role as the inflammatory component due to sensitization to allergens
and exposure to microbes. Additionally, data suggests that for many patients, epithelial dysfunction persists
during inactive EoE when therapy has cleared the inflammatory infiltrate. The mechanism of persistent epithelial
dysfunction is poorly understood. However, we and others have observed a reproducible, dysregulated gene
expression pattern during active EoE with aberrant expression of epithelial structural proteins. We show that
epithelial cells from EoE patients maintain aspects of this dysregulated gene expression pattern when grown in
a neutral culture environment. This suggests that epigenetic mechanisms maintain these gene expression
patterns in EoE epithelium in the absence of inflammation. Notably, in vitro IL-13 treatment of control epithelial
cells replicates similar aspects of the EoE mucosal transcriptome, suggesting a specific role for this Th2 cytokine
in the epithelial barrier dysfunction of EoE. IL-13-associated epigenetic alteration of epithelial function has been
shown in several types of epithelium but the affected loci and functional implications in the esophagus are
unclear. The hypothesis of this proposal is that IL-13 induces epigenetic changes in the esophageal epithelium
of patients with EoE, leading to persistent epithelial dysfunction. The work will leverage access to a training team
with expertise in epigenetics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics is uniquely situated to work with a pediatric
population of EoE patients. Aim 1 will use a three dimensional air-liquid interface model of esophageal squamous
epithelium to determine if chronic in vitro exposure to IL-13 treatment induces epigenetic changes and barrier
dysfunction in primary epithelium from non-EoE control patients. The goal of this aim is to identify if IL-13
treatment is associated with alterations in histone marks and gene expression changes in genes known to affect
barrier function. Aim 2 will use biopsy tissue from patients with and without EoE to examine changes in histone
marks and gene expression in the esophageal epithelium. The goal of this aim is to identify and localize a set of
epithelial genes with persistently dysregulated expression in active and inactive EoE (when compared to control
patients). The outcome of these studies will inform the understanding of esophageal epithelial barrier dysfunction
and EoE disease persistence, and provide the basis for the applicant’s first R01 submission. The overarching
goal of the research strategy and training plan in this proposal is to develop the candidate into an independent
investigator leading a robust research program that utilizes research and analysis skills in epigenetics,
transcriptomics and bioinformatics in the field of non-IgE mediated food allergies."

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute autoimmune disease that can present with fever and
ataxia as well as loss of consciousness and coma. ADEM largely affects children, is driven by T and B
lymphocytes aberrantly activated against a myelin antigen, and is strongly associated with a prior infection or
immunization. There is no FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of ADEM, and most cases of ADEM are
treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have significant side effects, including behavioral changes,
hypotension, and tachycardia, and fail to address the significant morbidity and mortality associated with ADEM.
Up to 50% of treated ADEM patients fail to fully recover from the disease, and ADEM has a 5 – 10% mortality
rate. Our company, Trethera, has developed a small molecule drug, TRE-515, that has the potential to selectively
block lymphocyte proliferation in ADEM by inhibiting deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), a key enzyme in the
deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway. Our preliminary studies show in the MOG35-55 experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of ADEM that (i) immune cells activate dCK during disease, (ii) TRE-515
blocks dCK activity in immune cells, (iii) prophylactic or therapeutic TRE-515 treatments block clinical symptoms,
(iv) TRE-515 treatments lead to fewer immune cell infiltrates in the central nervous system, (v) TRE-515 blocks
B and T cell proliferation without affecting other immune cell types including innate immune cells or regulatory T
and B cells, (vi) TRE-515 increases plasma deoxycytidine levels suggesting a potential biomarker for evaluation
of drug-target engagement, (vii) TRE-515 blocks T cell proliferation in culture, and (viii) TRE-515 treatments and
dCK knockout are not associated with significant toxicities. Based on these preclinical studies and due to its
status as a rare disease, the FDA recently awarded TRE-515 Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for the treatment
of ADEM. This is the first and only time the FDA has awarded an ODD for the treatment of ADEM. Parallel efforts
to develop TRE-515 as a cancer therapy have led to a Phase I clinical trial for solid tumors. Data from the trial
show TRE-515 treatments are associated with mild side effects and show evidence of efficacy. Collectively,
these data strongly suggest that TRE-515 could be an important new therapy for ADEM. In the proposed project,
we will conduct critical preclinical studies to evaluate the effect of TRE-515 on immune cell development and
determine whether TRE-515 can be combined with corticosteroids for the treatment of the MOG35-55 EAE ADEM
mouse model. This work will be critical for moving TRE-515 into the clinic for ADEM patients and for designing
clinical trials with the highest chance of success."
10756933,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: There is substantial phylogenetic evidence that horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) of host genes into large DNA viruses is a major driver of virus evolution. The status quo understanding of
HGT in viruses is based exclusively on bioinformatic and phylogenetic data; however, these approaches cannot
determine the molecular or evolutionary mechanisms underlying HGT. There is a critical need to develop an
experimental system to directly model HGT. The long-term goal is to define how host genes are acquired by
viruses and determine how these newly acquired genes evolve to provide a selective advantage to the virus. As
a step towards this goal, the objective of this project is to optimize novel in vitro and in vivo experimental models
to define mechanisms of HGT into poxviruses. The central hypothesis is that poxvirus HGT is facilitated through
RNA intermediates. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data using our novel cell culture-based experimental
model that demonstrated multiple independent long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE)-mediated HGT events
into vaccinia virus (VACV). The rationale for this proposed research is that developing a robust experimental
model of HGT into viruses will permit direct experimental approaches to address questions about the initial ac-
quisition and subsequent evolution of captured genes that cannot be addressed by bioinformatics. For example,
our preliminary data identified an unexpected evolutionary cascade that enabled transgenes to be acquired in
essential genes through a process of HGT, complementation via co-infection, and subsequent recombination.
The central hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims. 1) Characterize the molecular mechanisms of, and
factors influencing HGT into VACV. Long-read sequencing will map the genes and surrounding genomic archi-
tecture to define the mechanism(s) of HGT in cells. Cells either expressing different levels of LINE-1 or coinfected
with retroviruses will be used to determine if these conditions influence HGT. 2) Analyze the evolution of hori-
zontally transferred genes. HGT viruses will be serially passaged and subjected to long-read and Illumina-based
deep sequencing to determine how captured genes evolve, and if there are any adaptations driven by disruption
of different VACV genes due to the gene insertion event. 3) Define the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer
in vivo. A transgenic mouse line will be generated to study HGT into VACV during infection. Moreover, mouse
infection studies will be performed to investigate the newly identified mechanism for sequential virus evolution
following HGT into an essential gene and to assess the fitness of viruses that acquired transgenes. The proposed
research is significant because it will establish and test novel experimental systems of HGT into viruses that will
facilitate a detailed understanding of HGT into poxviruses that will close a fundamental gap in our knowledge of
the evolution of these important viruses. This model system will open new avenues of research to directly test
questions that are currently unanswerable by bioinformatic analyses such as the frequency of HGT, how the
transferred genes evolve and the impact of retrovirus coinfection on HGT."

Many emerging adults (aged 18-25) in the U.S. are living with unrecognized and/or untreated depression and
anxiety. Emerging adults have the highest rates (26%) of mental illness (MI) and lowest rates of treatment
seeking (38%), compared to all other age groups. Untreated depression and anxiety are particularly prevalent
among emerging adults and are key risk factors for the development of substance use disorders, cardiovascular
disease, and chronic health conditions later in adulthood, as well as premature death. Efficacious MI treatments
are available, but MI stigma is a substantial barrier to recognizing and treating depression and anxiety. Emerging
adults are particularly vulnerable to MI stigma given intense cognitive, biological, and social changes occurring
during these years. Although scientists have begun to assemble and refine an evidence-based stigma-reduction
toolbox, stigma interventions have fallen short of fully addressing MI stigma in part because they take a “one
size fits all” approach. Stigma interventions may be more efficacious if they address stigma mechanisms when
they are most pronounced, target the specific stigma mechanism(s) that are most harmful to treatment outcomes,
and provide extra support for people who lack resilience to stigma. Our long-term goal is to tailor MI stigma
interventions for emerging adults to promote positive treatment outcomes and lifetime wellbeing. In order to
inform the tailoring of these interventions, we need greater understanding of how stigma evolves and impacts
treatment outcomes during emerging adulthood. The objective of the current proposal is to examine longitudinal
relationships between MI stigma and treatment outcomes among a large, national sample of emerging adults.
Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize trajectories of MI stigma mechanisms and identify moderators of
trajectories among emerging adults experiencing depression and/or anxiety; (2) Examine associations between
MI stigma mechanisms, MI recognition and MI treatment engagement over time; and (3) Identify latent profiles
of MI stigma mechanisms, how individuals transition across profiles over time, and links between profiles and
treatment engagement. We propose a national, longitudinal study of emerging adults (aged 18-25), surveying
4000 participants 4 times a year for 3 years regarding stigma mechanisms, moderating factors, mental health,
and treatment engagement. Based on epidemiological estimates, we project that ~30% (n=1200) of participants
will experience a new onset of depression or anxiety during the study. Data will be analyzed using multilevel
modeling, moderation analyses, latent profile and latent transition analyses. Findings will enable researchers to
better identify: (1) the ideal timing of stigma interventions to maximize impact among emerging adults, (2) who
among emerging adults are most vulnerable to the effects of stigma, (3) which stigma mechanisms should be
targeted for intervention to improve lifelong health and wellbeing, and (4) how to combine stigma-reduction tools
for subgroups of emerging adults. This proposal responds to NIMH and NICHD’s strategic objectives to
determine when, where, and how to intervene to improve healthcare during the transition to adulthood."

Leucine rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1), a novel serine/threonine kinase, is expressed in bones, brain and other tissues.
We recently demonstrated that Lrrk1 gene knockout (KO) mice as well as a patient with a Lrrk1 gene mutation are
severely osteopetrotic due to osteoclast dysfunction and reduced bone resorption in long and vertebra bones. More
importantly, Lrrk1 KO mice had lifelong bone accumulation and responded normally to the anabolic actions of
teriparatide treatment but were resistant to ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone boss. These observations make LRRK1
an ideal target of a novel anti-resorption drugs for treatment of osteoporosis. In this grant, our focus is to perform in
vivo and in vitro studies to study the role of LRRK1-mediated phosphorylation of osteopetrosis specific transmembrane
protein 1 (OSTM1) in the regulation of chloride channel 7 (CLC7) complex stabilization, lysosomal peripheral
movement, lysosomal acid secretion and OC function. To this end, we hypothesize that LRRK1 phosphorylation of
OSTM1 at residues of threonine 328 and serine 329 regulates OC function and bone resorption by stabilization of
OSTM1/CLC7 complex and promotion of lysosomal peripheral movement and lysosomal acid secretion into lacuna
in vivo. Four-year studies proposed in this grant will deliver the role of LRRK1 phosphorylation of threonine and serine
residues of OSTM1 in regulation of bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. The results of this application will help our
understanding of molecular mechanisms of LRRK1 and OSTM1 actions in osteoclast and develop potential inhibitors
of LRRK1 for treatment of osteoporosis in future."

proposed to partner with the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU), in collaboration
with the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and the State University of
New York Albany School of Public Health (UAlbany SPH) along with other New York State
institutions to build capacity in conducting implementation science research that will address
gaps in HIV prevention and care in Georgia. This effort builds on the long and productive
association between Georgian universities and public health institutions, SUNY-DMC and
UAlbany SPH, within the framework of the Fogarty funded New York State International Training
and Research Program (NYS-ITRP) training grant that has been active in Georgia since 1996.
The goal is to develop adequate capacity to better understand key barriers to HIV
testing/diagnosis and linkage to care among key populations and to prepare an evidence base
to improve the national response to HIV. Proposed objectives includes:1) Provide doctoral
training in public health and implementation science to 10 Georgians, who will be trained in the
US and in Georgia; 2). Provide short-term training to 30 trainees in sciences related to
implementation research annually; 3) build institutional capacity at TSU through doctoral course
improvement and faculty training. With progress in these interventions, it may be possible to
dramatically reduce HIV incidence in a country of the former Soviet Union, one of the few
regions in the world with rising HIV rates. The proposed structure, topics, and focus were
selected based on a rigorous needs assessment conducted within the framework of a Fogarty
supported planning grant. These topics align fully with UNAIDS’s key recommendations to
policy makers on the investments needed to end the global AIDS epidemic and will be built on
an already funded CDC initiative to eliminate hepatitis C in Georgia. The program’s proposed
scientific topics also align fully with the priorities laid out in New York State’s “Plan to End the
AIDS Epidemic.” This alignment of priorities, as well as the underlying similarities in the HIV
epidemics in the Republic of Georgia and New York State, creates a unique opportunity to
incorporate a meaningful experiential learning component as part of the proposed training
program. This addresses a high priority topic from the NIH strategy on reducing the incidence of
HIV/AIDS by implementing strategies to improve HIV testing and entry into prevention services."
10756949,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern characterized by the loss of control over
alcohol drinking and the emergence of negative emotionality during abstinence from alcohol. The
transition to alcohol dependence is associated with the concomitant dysregulation of executive function
by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the recruitment of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and
its CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), but much less is known about
the role of CRF/CRF1 signaling in cortical areas. Critically, the development of new tools to access
subpopulations of CRF1 neurons has facilitated our studies of function and connectivity of CRF/CRF1
systems. In the original grant, we use an innovative transgenic mouse models in which CRF1
expressing (CRF1+) neurons co-express green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CRF1:GFP mice) to
understand the cell type-specific effects of acute and chronic alcohol in local and downstream CeA
microcircuits. Preliminary data have revealed that the CRF1+ neurons are highly expressed in mPFC
layer 2/3 and undergo specific neuroadaptations following chronic alcohol compared to unlabeled
(CRF1-) neurons. Thus, in this renewal, we will continue to use CRF1:GFP and CRF1:Cre mice to
characterize the electrophysiological, neurochemical and morphological properties of both CRF1+ and
CRF1- neurons in the mPFC, and elucidate the role of mPFC CRF1+ circuitry in anxiety-like and
drinking behaviors. Through a systems biology approach, we will delineate the CRF1-dependent effects
of ethanol in mPFC, as well as amygdala-mPFC connectivity that may regulate ethanol dependence
and withdrawal and contribute to associated anxiety-related behaviors. In addition, we will use
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by whole transcriptome analysis to reveal molecular
signatures and neuroadaptations of this specific CRF1 cortical population, which may identify new
promising targets for treatment strategies for alcoholism."

Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-transmitted disease caused by filarial nematodes, including
Brugia malayi, B. timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti, that affect millions of people in the poverty-
stricken regions of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The filarial worms are located in the
host lymphatic system, blocking lymphatic drainage, resulting in gross swelling of the limbs
(elephantiasis) and skin infections. These infections result in physical disability and disfigurement,
mental stress, and reduced productivity, hampering social-economic development in endemic
regions. Control and treatment of lymphatic filariasis rely on the mass drug administration
(MDA) of antiparasitic drugs, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. This
strategy has been successful to a certain extent, but the parasitic infections persist, mainly
attributed to the limited adulticidal effect of current anti-filarial agents. Besides, there are no
vaccines available for use, and concerns about developing drug resistance in humans. There is
an accepted need to identify novel chemotherapeutic targets and macrofilaricidal therapeutics for
more efficient control of filarial infections.
Here we propose to investigate and characterize the pharmacological properties of UNC-49 γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) channels in B. malayi to contribute to the search for novel drug targets.
The majority of the commercially available anthelmintic drugs target cys-loop ligand-gated ion
channels (LGICs), including the recently introduced emodepside (SLO potassium channels),
monepantel (nAChRs), and derquantel (nAChRs). However, nematode ion channels are an
underexploited chemotherapeutic target with a limited number already explored. Ionotropic
GABA channels are the major inhibitory chloride-gated channels at the neuromuscular junction
of invertebrates and are essential for coordinated movement. And yet, GABA receptors serve as
the target of only one antiparasitic drug, piperazine. UNC-49 GABA channels have been
characterized from Caenorhabditis elegans and Haemonchus contortus. These channels were
distinct from the vertebrate receptors in subunit composition, in vivo function, and
pharmacological properties and displayed species-based diversity. It is essential to gain insights
into the molecular mechanisms of species-based diversity among nematode ion channels to
understand drug targets better. We propose to perform cloning and heterologous expression of
the previously uncharacterized UNC-49 GABA channels from B. malayi. We will use
electrophysiological methods to conduct pharmacological characterization on the channels
expressed in a heterologous system, Xenopus oocytes, and HEK293 cell lines. We will also use
RNAi techniques on B. malayi worms to knock down GABA subunit encoding genes to validate
GABA as a drug target. The results generated through these experiments will help develop
preliminary data concerning the biology and pharmacology of GABA channels in the filarial
nematode. Upon completing this project, we will have broadened our understanding of the
filarial UNC-49 channels and identified the contribution of UNC-49 isoforms to the
endogenous GABA function. The project has two specific aims:
Aim 1: To study the role of UNC-49 channels' physiological function in adult B. malayi.
Aim 2: Cloning of UNC-49 subunits from B. malayi and functional expression to
characterize the channels' pharmacology."

We seek to understand what if any relationship exists between initiation of transmucosal buprenorphine and
poor dental outcomes in a retrospective study among a cohort of patients followed at the VA with a diagnosis
of opioid use disorder. Prior data suggest that dental problems have arisen after initiation of buprenorphine,
however a simple pre-post evaluation of buprenorphine initiation would be insufficient to answer the question of
an association, due to confounding. Dental disease worsens with age and over time, an example of time-
varying confounding, and patients with OUD, once in treatment, may be more likely to seek routine healthcare
that was deferred due to active addiction, an example of healthy user or adherer bias. As a result, we seek to
use Aim 1 to characterize longitudinal patterns of MOUD prescribing, as well as patterns of preventive and
acute dental care services over time.
To rigorously understand the association of transmucosal buprenorphine and poor dental outcomes, we will
require an adequate control group with minimal confounding. To achieve this, in Aim 2 we will compare
patients with OUD on transmucosal buprenorphine (our main exposure group) to patients with OUD receiving
injectable or implantable buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone using negative control outcomes.
Once we have determined appropriate control groups based on our analyses from Aim 2, in Aim 3 we will
report the cumulative risk and risk difference of poor dental outcomes among patients on transmucosal
buprenorphine as compared to other MOUD.
We will use the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to obtain both prescribing and dental data among patients with
OUD diagnosis between 2001 and 2021. Our study team is uniquely suited to employ our proposed
methodologies. Drs. Durkin and Roy (Co-PIs) have experience using large prescription datasets to understand
trends in utilization. Dr. Butler (Co-I) has extensive expertise in the use of negative control outcomes to reduce
bias in comparative effectiveness studies. Dr. Suda (Co-I) has expertise in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse
and the use of large datasets to understand dental healthcare utilization patterns.
Without rigorous study, the FDA warning may have the unintended consequence of deterring patients from
initiation of buprenorphine. In light of the opioid overdose epidemic and known benefits of MOUD, every effort
must be made to reduce barriers to initiating buprenorphine. This study will be the first step in understanding
the association between transmucosal buprenorphine and dental outcomes."

 In lower-and-middle income countries (LMICs) like Thailand, family members providing care for adults with
chronic disorders experience similar levels of mental health risks to that of their counterparts in higher income
countries but have significantly more limited access to mental health care. Despite comparable rates of mental
health illness, family caregivers in LMICs have significantly more limited access to mental health care—due to
a number of factors, including the limited number of providers trained in mental health care delivery, as well as
sociocultural factors, such as stigma and privacy concerns, that may prevent those in need from seeking care,
and/or result in significant delays in obtaining diagnosis and treatment. Lack of treatment for caregiver mental
health can lead to other adverse consequences for both caregivers and patients, including caregiver burnout,
patient abuse, losing employment and elevated financial strain. Despite an accumulating body of evidence of
the promise of mobile technology-based innovations for the treatment and prevention of mental health
disorders in LMICs, as well the promise for improving mental health outcomes for family caregivers, there is
limited research on the development, refinement, and implementation of evidence-based digital health
technology into the routine care of family caregivers.
 The goal of the 5-year project is to develop and test a culturally informed Caregiver Mental Health Mobile
Application (hereafter referred to as CAMMA) program that will deliver an evidence-based intervention to
reduce mental health problems in family caregivers of adults with chronic disorders in Thailand. The R21
project will allow us to systematically adapt evidence-based self-care intervention contents developed originally
in the Western world, and to make it compatible with the sociocultural and technological context in Thailand
through qualitative and formative research. The R33 will allow us to test the usability and effectiveness of the
mobile technology-enabled intervention in reducing negative mental health outcomes in Thai family caregivers.
Specific Aims of the R21 include: 1) Conducting qualitative research on family caregivers of persons with
chronic disorders, focusing on their experience with mental health problems, caregiving practice, coping
mechanisms, and socio-technological barriers to technology acceptance and use; 2) Develop a mobile
application for the delivery of the CAMMA intervention; 3)
Conduct a formative evaluation of the CAMMA
Intervention Components to ensure acceptability and usability of individual intervention components
.
Specific
aims for the R33 include: 1) Assessing usability of the CAMMA intervention (including all intervention
components); 2) Conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate effectiveness of the CAMMA
intervention in reducing psychological distress (depression, anxiety, psychological stress). We hypothesize that
participants who receive the CAMMA intervention will show significantly higher reduction in depressive
symptoms, anxiety, and psychological stress, compared to controls."

10866481,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Habits and motor skills are essential to survival, allowing for the fast, fluid, and automatic execution of actions
that have repeatedly proved beneficial. Despite their utility, habits and motor skills come at a cost: a loss of
behavioral flexibility. Automated actions that were previously beneficial can become maladaptive if action-
outcome contingencies shift. Because automated actions are hard to adjust once established, maladaptive
behaviors can persist, as is hypothesized to occur in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction, for
example. A major long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand how and why actions become automated
through the closely related processes of habit formation and motor skill acquisition. What is the normal process
of automation and how may it go awry in psychiatric disorders? Previous studies have identified a key role for
the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), but it remains unclear how the DLS becomes engaged in behavior over time as
goal-directed actions are repeated and automated. Existing theories have been difficult to test empirically, stalling
the field. This project takes advantage of recent technological advancements in neural circuit tracing,
intersectional genetic targeting of cell types, and optogenetics and fiber photometry, innovatively combined, to
bring new data to bear on the problem and to inspire work on fresh hypotheses. Our main objective in this
proposal is to characterize the neural circuits controlling dopaminergic input to the DLS, which is critical for
regulating synaptic plasticity in this brain region. We will identify synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the
dopaminergic midbrain that underlie changes in DLS dopamine release related to habit formation and motor skill
acquisition, and empirically test a long-standing hypothesis in the field, the Ascending Spiral Hypothesis, which
posits that activity in goal-directed regions of the striatum disinhibits DLS dopamine release. We will reformulate
the Ascending Spiral Hypothesis as needed based on new data. Our innovative approach integrates circuit
tracing, electrophysiology, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and behavioral studies across three specific aims,
spanning levels of analysis from detailed subcellular synaptic input mapping to in vivo circuit function. With the
successful completion of this project, we will provide a robust characterization of the Ascending Spiral circuit and
its role in controlling DLS dopamine dynamics before, during, and after action automation. This research will
have a broad impact as it will answer fundamental questions about the neural mechanisms underlying action
automation. By understanding the brain circuit activity allowing transitions from goal-directed control to habits
and motor skills, we will unlock a new point of entry into studying how complex polygenic diseases such as OCD
and addiction emerge from the confluence of genetic and environmental factors on circuit function."
10896203,"Severe sepsis is a common, expensive, and frequently fatal condition which is the leading cause of death in the
ICU in the United States. Typically, 50% of all sepsis cases start as a pulmonary infection and vast majority of
cases develop as mono-microbial sepsis. Alarming reports indicate that the frequency of gram-positive sepsis
has been increasing, likely due to the ability of S. aureus to colonize intravascular catheters or surgically
implanted materials, as well as the spread of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA). Sepsis is typically accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction, cytokine storm, disseminated
coagulation syndrome that often provoke indirect lung injury culminating in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS). ARDS is also the primary means of respiratory failure and deaths from the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. There are no effective pharmacological interventions for ARDS; rather, current treatment is primarily
limited to respiratory support through mechanical ventilation; however, suboptimal ventilation volumes can
worsen or even cause de novo lung injury. The hallmarks of ARDS are increased cytokine and chemokine levels,
inflammatory cell infiltrates, fibrosis, and loss of vascular integrity.
 This project will test a novel hypothesis that mechano-sensitive proton sensing receptor GPR68 is a key
mediator of ARDS pathophysiology that might control the magnitude of lung inflammation initiated by primary
infection insult and mitigate ARDS severity associated with suboptimal mechanical ventilation. We will test this
hypothesis using our novel first-in-class small molecule GPR68 inhibitor developed by our group through four
specific aims: 1) To examine molecular mechanisms of GPR68 activation by pro-inflammatory factors in the in
vitro and ex vivo models of inflammatory lung injury; 2) To study the functional role of GPR68 in modulation of
pulmonary endothelial response to ARDS-related insults; 3) To examine mechano-sensitive regulation of GPR68
activity; 4) To evaluate a therapeutic potential of pharmacological GPR68 inhibition for mitigation of lung
dysfunction in one-hit and two-hit mouse models of bacterial ALI.
 By better understanding how GPR68 contributes to lung barrier dysfunction and determining whether its
inhibition can ameliorate the ARDS phenotype, we will be able to develop and test novel therapeutic agents for
treatment of ARDS associated with sepsis, bacterial, viral infection, chemical injury, transfusion related lung
injury and other."

This is a competitive renewal application (1) to continue to follow children in the Illinois Kids Development Study
(IKIDS) who are Level 2 participants in ECHO, and (2) to continue recruiting new pregnant women into the IKIDS-
ECHO cohort. A key goal of our continued recruiting effort is to increase the racial/ethnic and income diversity
of our cohort through new recruiting partnerships with community agencies – the Champaign-Urbana Public
Health District (CUPHD) and Promise Health Care (our local federally qualified health center) – that serve a
primarily low-income, racially and ethnically diverse population of pregnant women. Specifically, we propose to
enroll 660 additional pregnant women (and their conceiving partners, if available) through our partnerships with
these two entities during the next phase of ECHO. We will rely heavily on community engagement, input from
an established Community Advisory Board, and feedback from focus groups to develop recruitment and retention
strategies that are effective for both retaining our current Level 2 participants and recruiting, enrolling, and
retaining new pregnant participants. A subset of these participants who report a moderate to high likelihood of
becoming pregnant again will be enrolled in the planned preconception pilot study. Our scientific aims will be
addressed in a series of ECHO Concept Papers and will build on our previous work investigating the impacts of
maternal prenatal stress or chemical exposures on birth outcomes and neurodevelopment. Leveraging data from
multiple ECHO cohorts will allow us to apply state-of-the-art mixtures methods to investigate the impact of
multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors on birth outcomes (gestational age at birth; birth weight; anogenital
distance) and child cognitive development (specific domains from the NIH toolbox cognitive battery; measures
of language development). We will also use novel approaches to evaluate the ability of a healthy maternal diet
to mitigate the negative impact of these exposures on our outcomes of interest. Our hypothesis is that multiple
prenatal stressors and/or chemical exposures jointly impact child neurodevelopment and birth
outcomes, and these impacts can be mitigated by a healthy diet. We will use multiple measures of prenatal
psychosocial stress from the core ECHO protocol (Aim 1), multiple studied and novel phthalates/replacements
and phenols from the ECHO-WC-HHEAR novel chemicals analysis (Aim 2) or both chemicals and stressors in
our mixtures models. To assess the impact of diet, we will use a novel approach in which we will include multiple
dietary components calculated using established diet quality indices, together with multiple measures of maternal
psychosocial stress or multiple chemicals, to understand the cumulative effects of the diet/stress or diet/chemical
mixture and to evaluate if particular components of healthier diets can lessen or negate adverse associations of
maternal stress or chemical exposures with child cognition or birth outcomes. Lastly, an exploratory aim will
evaluate associations of maternal preconception stressors with (1) birth outcomes and (2) neurodevelopment
during infancy."

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects approximately 70 mln people. For many patients,
epilepsy can be controlled through pharmaceutical therapies; however, approximately 30% of patients develop
refractory epilepsy that cannot be controlled with current pharmaceutical interventions. Refractory epilepsy is
associated with a high risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is the leading cause of
death in this patient population. In addition, uncontrolled epilepsy and frequent seizures are associated with
progressive cognitive decline, as well as significant behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Thus, it is of
paramount importance to identify novel critical therapeutic targets for patients with refractory epilepsy. The main
objective of this proposal is to establish the role of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in regulating synaptic
function, neural network activity and seizure susceptibility. MCU is the core component of the mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake complex and is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling, bioenergetics and cell death. Our focus on
MCU is inspired by several novel observations we made during our pilot studies. First, we found that MCU
knockout (KO) produces robust anticonvulsant effects both in vivo and in vitro. Second, deleting MCU specifically
in GABAergic, but not in glutamatergic, neurons was sufficient to produce an anticonvulsant effect. Third, MCU
deletion enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission, but did not alter glutamatergic transmission or intrinsic
neuronal excitability. Fourth, MCU deletion protected neurons from glutamate-induced Ca2+ deregulation and
toxicity. The latter is important because excitotoxicity contributes significantly to neuronal damage in epilepsy.
Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting MCU would provide a dual benefit in the context of epilepsy, first
by increasing seizure threshold, and second, by protecting neurons from excitotoxicity associated with seizures.
We hypothesize that MCU plays an important role in regulating GABAergic synaptic transmission and neural
activity, and that MCU deletion produces anticonvulsant effects by enhancing GABAergic synaptic transmission
and preventing neural network hyperexcitability. We also hypothesize that MCU deletion provides protection
from neurotoxicity associated with seizures. These central hypotheses will be tested in 3 specific aims. Aim 1
will establish the roles of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the anticonvulsant effect of MCU deletion.
Aim 2 will determine the role of MCU at inhibitory and excitatory central synapses. Aim 3 will determine the role
of MCU in epilepsy-induced neuronal toxicity. The proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into a
previously unrecognized role of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in regulating the activities of synaptic networks and
susceptibility to hyperexcitability and seizures, and could lead to development of new strategies targeting
mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and MCU for the treatment of epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders
associated with aberrant neural activity."

A critical feature of episodic memory formation is the ability to associate temporally segregated events as an
episode, called temporal association learning. Malfunctions of temporal association learning represent well-
described findings in human patients suffering from schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. There are several
critical gaps in our knowledge of current theoretical model and neurobiological evidence about mechanisms of
temporal association learning. My long-term goal is to elucidate the neural mechanisms that drive and
regulate temporal association learning by understanding neural circuits and their neural processes in
entorhinal cortical-hippocampal (EC-HPC) networks, using Pavlovian trace fear conditioning (TFC) as the
behavioral paradigm.
We previously demonstrated that pOxr1+ excitatory cells in the medial entorhinal cortex layer III (pOxr1+ cells)
project to the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and are necessary for TFC. On the other hand, some CalB+
excitatory cells in MECII (CalB+ cells) project to GABAergic neurons in hippocampal CA1, suppress the
MECIII input into the CA1 pyramidal cells through the feed-forward inhibition, and inhibit TFC. These findings
lead us to propose a disinhibition model to regulate TFC, driving TFC by pOxr1+ cells and regulating TFC by
CalB+ cells. The central hypothesis of this model is that successful TFC depends on learning-dependent
disinhibition of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells through the reduction of feed-forward inhibition mediated by
CalB+ cells. Towards this hypothesis, we have identified that pOxr1+ cells show tone-induced sustained neural
activity in all trials during TFC, while CalB+ cells show trial-dependent reduction of the tone-induced sustained
neural activity. We have also discovered that the CalB+ cells specifically express dopamine D1 receptors
(D1R) in MEC and the activation D1R in MEC is essential for the learning-dependent reduction of the c-Fos
expression in CalB+ cells and for successful TFC. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue
three Specific Aims to examine neural circuit mechanism that drive and regulate TFC: (1) To define the roles
of pOxr1+ cells and CalB+ cells for TFC. (2) To determine the role of D1R activation in CalB+ cells for TFC. (3)
To elucidate the role of dopaminergic inputs into the MEC for TFC.
Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field of learning and memory by characterizing
novel neural circuits and their neural process that drive and regulate temporal association memory in EC-HPC
networks. Our proposed studies will uncover neural substrates for temporal association memory and novel
learning-dependent gatekeeper circuits for the regulation of temporal association learning, and potentially, the
circuit mechanism can be a pharmaceutical new target for preventing inadequate memory formation."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests in the US
and its progressive form, termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), will soon be the leading indication for
liver transplantation. There are currently no effective medications to treat NASH, no biomarkers to determine
disease progression or risk of post-transplant recurrence and no effective platforms for high-throughput drug
screening. Although NASH is related to obesity and diabetes, the pathogenic factors that cause disease
progression to NASH/Cirrhosis are poorly understood. Compared to an invasive liver biopsy, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be easily obtained from patients with NASH and end-stage NASH/Cirrhosis
patients requiring liver transplantation and re-programmed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These
iPSCs may then be differentiated into iPSC-hepatocytes, which are human liver-like cells that can be cultured in
ex vivo bioengineered systems tailored to normal and cirrhotic liver stiffness, enabling an investigation that is
independent of the compounding metabolic and environmental factors that complicate analysis within human or
animal systems. In this proposal, we will utilize an iPSC-hepatocyte platform to determine the effects of
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and unfolded protein response (UPR) cell signaling on hepatic lipid
metabolism. We will initially unwind the impact and interplay between matrix stiffness and patient-specific
propensity for NASH in patient-derived iPSCs and analyze the impact on lipid metabolism and lipidomics (Aim
1). ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of
NASH. Thus, we will use iPSC-hepatocytes to develop a platform for determining the interaction between UPR
signaling and lipid metabolism relevant to NASH (Aim 2). iPSC-hepatocytes will be treated with ER stress
reducing compounds including the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDC) or FXR/bile acid
agonists, and the effects on cell differentiation, gene expression and lipid metabolism will investigated. Finally,
iPSC-hepatocytes will be used to study the cell signaling and pathogenic mechanisms of NASH in iPSCs from
patients with rapidly progressive NASH/Cirrhosis that require liver transplantation. We will develop an iPSC-
hepatocyte platform identifying matrix and UPR factors responsible for NASH using iPSC-hepatocytes from
NASH/Cirrhosis patients listed for liver transplantation (Aim 3). This MPI proposal leverages the collaboration
between three PIs at two institutions with extensive experience investigating 1) iPSCs, bioengineering matrices,
ECM biology, and transplant surgery, 2) hepatic lipid metabolism, cell signaling and transplant hepatology, and
3) lipidomics and metabolomics. The development and optimization of these iPSC-hepatocyte platforms will have
important implications for determining the pathophysiology of NASH, developing biomarkers to determine risk
for NASH progression and for use in drug development and personalized drug screening."

Several studies have found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with the
development and progression of both Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), possibly through infection of
beta cells, increased insulin resistance, increased inflammation and fibrosis, and other biological processes.
The proposed study will take advantage of robust existing infrastructure to rapidly identify, recruit, and retain
diverse cohorts of English and Spanish speaking pediatric and adult patients with recently diagnosed T1D or
T2D. The study will include 1600 study participants diagnosed with diabetes in the last 3 months, who have
had a known COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days and those with recent diagnosis of diabetes and no
known COVID-19 infection in the past year. The study will leverage PCORnet, a unique national network of
over 60 health systems with electronic health record (EHR) data on over 80 million patients and a track record
for successful study recruitment. We will query EHR records to swiftly identify potential study subjects with
recent diagnosis of diabetes and contact them via patient portals, telephone, face-to-face encounters, and
other approaches. We will also leverage the T1D Exchange (T1DX), a national network of 54 diabetes centers
and an online patient registry of 17,000 individuals with T1D. Consented participants will partake in regular
web/mobile or telephone surveys leveraging a previously developed REDCap/Twilio platform. Participants will
also come to sites for regular serological testing, and a subsample will participate in more robust testing of
glucose tolerance, biomarkers, and vascular function. This data will be supplemented by longitudinal EHR data
from participating sites and across PCORnet. Participants will be followed for 2 years. Aim 1 will examine if
patients with recent T2D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and increased insulin resistance than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 2 will examine if
patients with recent T1D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and more rapid reduction in beta cell function than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 3 will
evaluate a subset of patients with diabetes to examine if COVID-19 is associated with worse vascular function,
increased inflammation and hypercoagulability. Aim 4 will explore the role of genomic/social/environmental
factors on inflammation and metabolic function. Aim 5 will leverage EHR data to explore the role of COVID-19
and COVID-19 treatments on diabetes development and diabetes-related outcomes across the pandemic. The
study will be led by a team with significant experience related to COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC), obesity and diabetes in children and adults, epidemiological research, informatics, health services
research, genomics, metabolomics, physiology, patient and family engagement and other areas. The proposed
work will provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, that can support
future interventions and public health approaches to improve health."

Young men who have sex with men (YMSM; ages 18-29 years) have rising HIV incidence in the United States.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective medication prevent HIV infection, both at the individual
and population level. However, in several clinical trials and demonstration projects among YMSM, a majority of
participants had adherence to PrEP sufficiently low to compromise efficacy throughout the study.
Unfortunately, pill-counts and self-reported adherence have limitations in this population, and therapeutic drug
monitoring using previously available methods requires expensive equipment and specialized staff, meaning it
cannot be implemented at the point-of-care (POC). We have developed a novel POC test to measure urine
drug-levels to PrEP for the first time, providing the opportunity to target and enhance adherence counseling
during a routine clinical visit. Substantial knowledge gaps on the correct counseling approach and framing of
the drug-level feedback message must be addressed to use this strategy to improve adherence among YMSM.
The proposed training and research plan for this K23 application will allow Matthew Spinelli, MD to acquire the
necessary skills to achieve his career goal of becoming an NIH-funded independent clinical investigator with
expertise in designing interventions to improve antiretroviral adherence among men who have sex with men
(MSM). Under the guidance of a dedicated mentoring team, Dr. Spinelli will use a mixed methods approach to
test the central hypothesis that an intervention leveraging a POC urine bioassay to detect PrEP adherence can
both target and enhance adherence counseling. Brief interventions are a motivational interviewing (MI)
counseling approach with wide uptake by primary care providers for substance use prevention and medical
therapy adherence. Dr. Spinelli proposes a brief intervention be used as the framework for POC drug-level
feedback among YMSM using PrEP at the San Francisco City Clinic (SFCC). SFCC is the municipal sexually-
transmitted disease clinic for San Francisco and has a high-volume PrEP program, facilitating recruitment.
Building on the candidate's prior research in PrEP care outcomes and adherence diagnostics, this proposal will
address the following specific aims: (1) identify behavioral targets for PrEP adherence amenable to counseling
specific to YMSM; (2) develop the POC bioassay-enhanced adherence brief intervention through in-depth
interview feedback from PrEP users and providers; (3) test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact
on long-term adherence, measured through hair tenofovir levels, of the brief intervention in a pilot randomized
controlled trial among YMSM. This proposed research plan has the goal of optimizing PrEP's impact through a
novel adherence support and is aligned with Dr. Spinelli's career development plan to gain expertise in
intervention design, qualitative research, and behavioral trial design and evaluation. The findings of this
proposal will lead to a R01 application to test a POC bioassay-enhanced adherence brief intervention among
YMSM in a multi-city trial, with the goal of reducing the burden of HIV among MSM."

Lupus is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease in which cells of the immune system attack organ systems
throughout the body including the kidneys, brain, and lungs and that presents heterogeneously with symptoms
that can include fever, arthritis, alopecia, stroke, and heart attack. Lupus is driven by autoreactive B and CD4 T
cells with a particular role for TfH and TH17 CD4 T cells. Current therapies for lupus can be effective but only
work on a subset of patients, lack biomarkers to resolve the heterogeneity of the disease as it relates to treatment
efficacy, and are associated with significant and sometimes severe side effects. New safe and effective therapies
are needed to treat lupus. The deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway with rate-limiting enzyme deoxycytidine
(dCK) salvages extracellular deoxyribonucleosides for intracellular deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. dCK activity
can be measured non-invasively in vivo in mice and humans using the PET radiotracers [18F]FAC and [18F]CFA,
respectively. dCK activity is upregulated in lymphocytes in multiple preclinical models of autoimmune diseases
including autoimmune hepatitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). One study showed that dCK activity is upregulated
in the lymph nodes in a mouse lupus model at the one time-point analyzed. Trethera has recently developed
TRE-515 as a potent and selective small molecule dCK inhibitor with excellent in vivo pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties. TRE-515 was recently cleared by the FDA (IND# 131939) for investigational use
in the treatment of solid tumors and has been safely administered to multiple patients in Phase I clinical trials.
We recently showed in multiple experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models of MS that
dCK activity is upregulated in lymphocytes during disease using [18F]FAC PET, that TRE-515 can limit dCK
activity in lymphoid tissues in vivo, that TRE-515 can block clinical MS symptoms in these EAE mouse models
when treatments are initiated at disease induction or at symptoms onset, that therapeutic efficacy in these models
is associated with a measurable increase in plasma deoxycytidine levels, that TRE-515 limits disease in these
models by blocking activation-induced T and B cell proliferation without affecting other cells in the immune
system, and that TRE-515 directly blocks T cell proliferation in culture. MS and lupus are different diseases but
share activated and proliferating CD4 T and B cells as a common driver of disease. We hypothesize that TRE-
515 could be an effective treatment for lupus. We will begin to test this hypothesis in this Phase I STTR grant
through two aims. Aim 1: To quantify dCK activity in the lymphoid organs throughout disease using [18F]FAC
PET in a preclinical lupus model. Aim 2: To test whether the dCK inhibitor TRE-515 blocks disease progression
in a lupus model."

While there have been significant advances in the detection and treatment of breast cancer, mortality due to
metastatic disease recurrence remains unacceptably high and a leading cause of death. Furthermore,
chemotherapies with intolerable side effects remain the standard of care for metastatic breast cancer patients,
which is highly detrimental to quality of life. Advances in molecular targeting cancer imaging offer a window into
underlying tumor biology and support the use of individualized targeted therapies that can spare patients over-
treatment with harsh chemotherapies. However, most molecular imaging probes typically target either cancer
cells or, more recently, a single cell type in the tumor microenvironment. These approaches are inherently
limited in the information they can provide.
Optimal treatment planning relies on a complete picture of disease state, including microscopic regions of
residual disease and understanding the potential for recurrence based on a lesion’s specific molecular traits.
As such, the goal of this proposal is to provide the foundation for a clinically useful means to image and
understand disease status before, during, and after treatment of primary breast cancer and metastatic disease.
We postulate that molecular imaging of both the microenvironment and cancer cells simultaneously will provide
more complete detection of diseased regions and an understanding of dynamic changes in tumor
microenvironment that are needed to support personalized therapy.
We propose: (Aim1) A bispecific strategy targeting both breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts
in the tumor microenvironment to enhance tumor detection. (Aim 2) Differentially targeting cancer cells and
cancer-associated fibroblasts with near-infrared molecular probes with similar spectral properties but different
fluorescent lifetime values to extract tumor-stroma ratio noninvasively, which is a prognostic indicator in breast
cancer. This non-invasive method of determining the relative abundance of malignant cells and cancer-
associated fibroblasts will be compared with the traditional histologic determination of tumor-stroma ratio.
At the completion of this study, we expect to have established a signal amplification method to detect small
cancerous lesions and a non-invasive approach to map cancer-stromal ratio to understand how the dynamic
changes in the tumor microenvironment affect cancer biology."

The brain is astonishing in its complexity and capacity for change. It seems certain that the plasticity that drives
our ability to learn and remember can only be meaningful in the context of otherwise stable, reproducible, and
predictable baseline neural function. It is now clear that homeostatic signaling systems function throughout the
central and peripheral nervous systems to stabilize neural function throughout life. As a consequence, it is
widely believed that impaired or maladaptive homeostatic signaling will be directly relevant to the cause and
progression of neurological diseases that include epilepsy, autism and neurodegeneration. However, despite
widespread evidence for the homeostatic control of neural function throughout the animal kingdom and implicit
relevance to disease and aging, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. The field of homeostatic
plasticity is wide open for exploration and the potential for transformative advancement in cellular and
molecular neuroscience is tremendous. We are leading the rapidly emerging field of homeostatic plasticity,
harnessing the power of unbiased model system genetics to identify and characterize fundamentally new
cellular and molecular mechanisms of homeostatic signaling in the nervous system. Our experiments will
define many of the first signaling pathways identified to participate in the homeostatic signaling systems that
control presynaptic neurotransmitter release and intrinsic neural excitability. Our approaches have uncovered a
novel activity of the innate immune signaling system, new trans-synaptic signaling pathways, novel calcium
sensors, novel neuronal kinase signaling systems, new roles for the presynaptic endoplasmic reticulum and
tangible links to neurological disease. As such, our data will provide a foundation for exploring the impact
homeostatic plasticity in mammalian models of neurological disease including epilepsy, autism and
neurodegeneration. Our data will also directly impact current theories and models of homeostatic signaling.
Current theoretical models have captured widespread interest. Molecular insight will provide important new
ideas and new constraints for the next generation of theoretical models of homeostatic plasticity, learning and
memory."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive fibrosis leading to disruption of the gas
exchange unit and death within an average of four years from the time of diagnosis. A poor understanding of IPF
pathogenesis, in part due to a lack of reliable human disease models, has been a major hurdle to developing
effective therapies. With the advent of genome wide association studies and intensive study of familial forms of
pulmonary fibrosis, dysfunction of the distal lung epithelium and in particular dysfunction of alveolar epithelial
type 2 (AT2) cells has been implicated as a potential proximal disease driver. Using patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AT2 cells (iAT2s) our group recently described how the inception of
interstitial lung disease may result from a dysfunctional AT2 cell phenotype characterized by diminished
progenitor capacity, perturbed proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and NF-κB pathway activation. Despite
the progress made, critical information remains to be elucidated to allow for the development of effective
mechanistic IPF therapies. This proposal aims to: 1) advance our understanding of the role of mitochondrial
dysfunction in eliciting a pro-fibrotic AT2 cell phenotype, 2) understand how disease-relevant environmental
insults, such as cigarette smoke exposure, contribute to this dysfunction, and 3) test its reversibility. Specifically,
the role of insufficient adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in driving
the AT2 cell mitochondrial dysfunction, suggested by our preliminary data, will be investigated and the potential
of AMPK activators as IPF therapeutics will be tested both in vitro and in vivo. We test the hypothesis that
mitochondrial dysfunction in genetically susceptible human AT2 cells results from insufficient AMPK activity and
is exaggerated by environmental insults leading to diminished alveolar progenitor capacity, inflammatory
activation, and fibrogenic mesenchymal activation. In aim 1, using patient-specific iAT2s carrying SFTPC and
TERT variants we test the hypothesis that in genetically susceptible human AT2 cells impaired AMPK activity is
responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming that leads to downstream epithelial
canonical NF-κB pathway activation. In aim 2, we quantify the relative contribution of cigarette smoke exposure,
to disease mechanisms by utilizing a novel model system. Finally in aim 3, we test the hypothesis that AT2 cell
mitochondrial dysfunction results in fibrogenic mesenchymal activation and leverage this in vitro human platform
to test the efficacy of AMPK agonists as potential disease-modifying therapeutics for pulmonary fibrosis. Any
compounds found to be effective in vitro are then tested in vivo in the SftpcI73T mouse model."

Leveraging Observational (Real World) Data to Advance Precision Oncology
Principal Investigator: Charles Sawyers, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
Precision oncology is a firmly established pillar in the practice of cancer medicine, but we now recognize new
challenges to its broad implementation. These include: (i) heterogeneity in response to precision oncology
drugs in patients with identical driver mutations, (ii) differences in driver mutation frequencies in patients from
different ethnicities, with implications for ensuring optimal treatment, (iii) increased subtyping of cancer into
hundreds of “rare” diseases, and the resultant operational challenges in clinical trial design and execution, and
(iv) a limited understanding of how to effectively leverage observational (real world) data to address these
challenges.
The investigators in this P01 Program have had a longstanding collaboration over the past 8 years, helping to
build a large (>148,000 patients), international clinico-genomic cancer registry known as AACR Project GENIE.
We have come together to investigate these issues and propose four highly integrated projects related to these
themes. Project 1 seeks to overcome methodologic barriers in the analysis of observational clinico-genomic
data. Project 2 will address the role of genetic ancestry in precision oncology outcomes and potential inequities
in how precision oncology diagnostic tests are developed. Project 3 will use real world evidence to inform clinical
decisions for the treatment of cancer patients that cannot be addressed using conventional clinical trial datasets
and will optimize the reporting of these findings using the OncoKB knowledge base. The projects will be
supported by the Curation and Statistical Analysis Core (data abstraction and biostatistics support); the
Molecular Pathology and Bioinformatics Core (molecular profiling and data capture); and the Administrative
Core (incorporating existing GENIE infrastructure for data sharing, communications, and administrative support).
Our proposal is highly synergistic as it brings together a multi-institutional team of distinguished investigators in
population science, population genetics, cancer genomics and experimental therapeutics, with a substantial
track record of collaborative interactions, who will work together to address these important topics in precision
oncology."

This is a training program from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) to train postdoctoral
fellows in basic, translational or clinical research focusing on tumor immunotherapy, tumor immunology or stem
cell transplantation immunology. The UNC Immunotherapy Training Grant (IM-TAG) is led by an exceptional
mentor, Jonathan Serody MD, who is assisted by two superb Associate Directors in Barbara Savoldo MD PhD
and Benjamin Vincent MD. This training proposal is supported by a nationally renowned mentorship group and
exceptional facilities for translation of tumor and transplantation immunology to the clinic. Additionally, there are
world-class investigators that make up the Internal Advisory Committee and External Advisory Board. The focus
of IM-TAG is significantly underrepresented in training programs leading to a paucity of investigators working in
these areas.
IM-TAG supports the training of two postdoctoral fellows yearly. There are 11 Professors, and eight Associate
Professors, with outstanding qualifications who serve as mentors. We have identified two exceptional Assistant
Professors, who serve as co-mentors. These investigators’ interests include 1) vaccine design and vector
generation, 2) adoptive cellular therapy, 3) the role of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), 4)
immunogenomic assessment of TME, 5) enhancing our understanding of the biology of the graft-versus-tumor
response and 6) approaches to manage acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. There are innovative
mechanisms for training that include 1) didactic coursework in statistical design, 2) immunogenomic coursework
and data evaluation overseen by world experts in tumor immunogenomics, and 3) participation in Immunotherapy
Working Groups, which are translational teams that assist in the development of novel immunotherapies,
allowing trainees to be involved in the development of INDs and clinical trials. We have a comprehensive
approach to training underrepresented minorities, including a summer course for undergraduate students to
provide them with hands-on experience in immunotherapy or transplantation immunology.
Strengths of the program include 1) an extremely well-funded group of mentors with substantial experience
training postdoctoral fellows, 2) an outstanding leadership group with a long history of leading collaborative
research proposals, 3) and the presence of a world-class vaccine and transplantation infrastructure that trainees
can access. This program combines the mentors, foundation, and resources of a nationally recognized tumor
immunology, cancer immunotherapy and transplantation immunology program with novel approaches to
enhance the vertical training of underrepresented individuals and enhance the bench to bedside development of
therapeutics by individuals who are trained in this program."

The Administrative and Professional Development Core of this COBRE is designed to achieve two
complementary goals: 1) to build a critical mass of researchers who leverage large biomedical data sets to
study and improve the health of women, and 2) to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations, which we expect will
lead to significantly increased NIH-funding on our campus. The strategy for achieving these complementary
goals includes a multi-pronged approach to recruit talented new faculty, to engage existing faculty who either
have backgrounds in data science or in women’s health research, to provide training and support for cross-
disciplinary research, and to develop a strong cadre of research project leaders, who will receive extensive
support for their goals of becoming independent, NIH-funded investigators. The APD Core will be led by the
Center Director, Heather Desaire, who brings two decades of NIH-funded research and grant management
experience. The aims of the core are: (1) Hire three new tenure-track faculty. (2) Develop the Research-
Engaged Faculty Fellows (Pilot Project) Program. (3) Support five Research Project Leaders each year. (4)
Center Coordination, Semi-Annual Review, Strategic Planning. The successful completion of these aims will
markedly increase the biomedical research capabilities on our campus, establishing at our institution a unique
center that leverages data science for women’s health research. Additionally, the cross-disciplinary
collaborations will stimulate innovation, a necessary component for addressing longstanding barriers in

 The Biomedical Data Sets and Services Core (BDSSC) of this COBRE will be established to expand
services and expertise provided beyond federal datasets to encompass all types of data utilized by the
Research Project Leaders (RPLs) who will be supported by this Phase 1 COBRE and future iterations. The
BDSSC’s primary innovation will be linking biomedical, environmental, and health records data to survey data
that collects demographic, marital status, family structure, education, and employment data to understand how
behavior, environment and biology combine to influence health outcomes. The BDSSC will achieve these
goals with the specific aims of: 1) assisting RPLs with data discovery and procurement for project
development; 2) building analysis datasets and providing statistical analysis for project execution; and 3)
expand core productivity to support COBRE stakeholders including RPLs, mentors, new faculty and other
biomedical and social science researchers. Building on the success of the BDSSC, researchers at KU and
across our region will have access to a new resource to support additional biomedical research funding in the
ever-advancing field of complex data science. As of now, no data services center exists at KU or in the region.
The BDSSC will create research capacity not currently available on campus to support data-intensive research
across the biomedical, behavioral, health, and social sciences to support fundamental research designed to

10770246,"Project Summary
Women experience neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease at a higher
prevalence than men, and disease symptoms increase in severity after menopause. These connections
suggest that there is a fundamental link between estrogen regulation and brain health. Myelin damage is a
feature common to both neurological disease states, however, there are no FDA-approved therapies that
directly target myelin repair. The long-term goal of this project is to define how CNS lipids are regulated by
estrogen and how this affects neurological disease. The overall objective in this application is to determine how
estrogen regulates myelin and myelin lipid components during demyelination and remyelination. Preliminary
data presented in the application reveals that cholesterol ester metabolism has dynamic changes in response
to myelin damage. Work from other groups demonstrated that estrogen can regulate genes related to
cholesterol metabolism during demyelination and remyelination. These data form the basis for the central
hypothesis that estrogen signaling maintains myelin and promotes remyelination in part through regulation of
cholesterol synthesis and recycling. The central hypothesis will be evaluated by two specific aims: (1) Define
how estrogen signaling modulates myelin repair; (2) Map how estrogen signaling affects CNS cholesterol
metabolites during myelin damage and repair. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion,
because it tackles significant questions in women’s health at the intersection of hormone regulation and
neurological disease using an interdisciplinary approach. The proposal also features a novel mouse model of
myelin repair developed by the applicant that enables the proposed experiments, which would not be possible
with other animal models. Completion of the proposed research will reveal mechanistic insights into how
estrogen regulates cholesterol metabolism during CNS demyelination and remyelination. This contribution is
expected to be significant because it will reveal how estrogen controls CNS cholesterol during neurological
disease and may provide insight into why women experience cognitive decline during menopause and more
severe neurological symptoms in CNS diseases after menopause. This will advance this area of women’s
health research by providing insights that may lead to the development of pro-remyelination agents that would
have clinical benefit in CNS diseases with myelin damage."
10769827,"Accumulating evidence shows oncogenes/kinases that have been widely studied in cancers can be
leveraged to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). The evidence includes: 1) oncogenes/kinases (e.g., Src, ROCK,
ERK, CDK, others) are activated after TBI; 2) activation of oncogenes/kinases not only cause neuronal death
via cell cycle re-entry in mature neurons, but also mediate leukocyte infiltration and inflammation which results
in BBB disruption after TBI; and 3) oncogenes/kinases inhibitors can improve TBI outcome, such as Src
inhibitor (PP2), ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), ERK inhibitor (PD98059), CDK inhibitor (Roscovitine), and others.
 In this grant application, the investigators hypothesized that elevating a single tumor suppressor
microRNA (miR) to decrease multiple oncogenes/kinases will improve TBI outcomes. The investigators
targeted tumor suppressor microNRA-125b (miR-125b) as a candidate for TBI therapeutics, because: 1) the
pilot miR expression study showed that miR-125b is one of the top two miRNAs that significantly altered in
blood after both TBI and ICH; and 2) miR-125b decreases multiple oncogenes (e.g., Mknk2, Alpk3, Neu1,
Bap1, E2F, JNK, ERK, others) as predicted by miR-target algorithm (TargetScan), in addition to the oncogene
Src which the investigators have previously shown plays an critical role in improving TBI outcome. The
preliminary therapeutic studies demonstrate that miR-125b mimic (2.4mg/kg, intravenously, i.v.) and/or
(0.24mg/kg, intracerebroventricularly, i.c.v.) can improve pathological outcome at acute stage (24 hr) and
promote cognitive function at later times (11-15 days) after TBI.
 The investigators focus the mechanistic study on peripheral effects in this proposal, as i.v. treatment
is more translatable to humans. Using whole genome sequencing, the investigators identify the top four miR-
125b target genes (Mknk2, Alpk3, Neu1, Bap1) that are decreased in blood after miR-125b mimic treatment
after TBI. Note that all of the four top responsive genes are oncogenes/kinases. The preliminary mechanistic
study data show: 1) miR-125b binds to the 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTR) of Mknk2, Neu1 and Bap1; and 2)
Morpholino Oligos (MOs)–miR125b–Mknk2 blocks the binding of miR-125b to 3’UTR of Mknk2. Moreover, they
will prove that MO–miR125b–Mknk2/Alpk3/Neu1/Bap1 in vivo prevents miR-125b mimic-induced decrease of
these target genes in blood cells (leucocytes, platelets), endothelium, and brain cells (neurons, astrocytes,
microglia) after TBI, and thus blocks the therapeutic effects produced by miR-125b mimic after TBI.
 In summary, this proposal will show that miR-125b mimic has both peripheral and central effects to
improve TBI outcome via decreasing miR-125b target oncogenes/kinases (Mknk2, Alpk3, Neu1, Bap1). This
study will contribute to the literature of oncogenes/kinases pathophysiology in the TBI field. The combined use
of i.v. miR-125b mimic and liposomes to treat TBI in rats is novel, and can be translated to treat human TBI."

Nearly one in three people will have an arrythmia during their lifetime and up to 10% may die of sudden cardiac
death. Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are heritable and often caused by problems of cardiac
conduction or repolarization. Nevertheless, the genetic causes are not well-defined. Moreover, interpretation of
genetic variation is limited by the frequent discovery of variants of uncertain clinical significance. Our
preliminary data suggest that using high-depth genomic sequencing data from large-scale biobanks with
routinely measured electrocardiogram intervals – indicators of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death risk – has
the potential to address these challenges.
 Our overall goal is to minimize morbidity from cardiovascular disease. The specific objective of this
proposal is to utilize high-depth whole genome and exome sequencing data to identify, functionally
evaluate, and clinically characterize genetic variation that predisposes to arrhythmia risk and sudden
cardiac death. To do so, we will leverage a unique and massive repository of individuals with genomic
sequencing, electrocardiograms, and clinical data.
 The electrocardiogram is a widely utilized and inexpensive screening test. Standard electrocardiogram
intervals are reliable and reproducible measurements that are associated with a variety of cardiac conditions,
most notably arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Our overall hypothesis is that functional and clinically
relevant rare genetic variation underlies population-based electrocardiographic interval variability.
 In Aim 1, we will identify rare coding variation associated with electrocardiographic intervals. We will use
data from a unique resource of over 220,000 individuals with electrocardiograms and whole genome or exome
sequence data in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program,
UK Biobank, Geisinger MyCode/DiscovEHR cohort, and Mass General Brigham HealthCare Biobank. In Aim
2, we will validate and characterize the electrophysiological and structural impact of identified genes in stem
cell derived cardiomyocytes. In Aim 3 we will assess whether variants with large electrocardiographic trait
effect sizes are associated with arrhythmia risk using electronic health record data in nearly 400,000
sequenced individuals, and variant pathogenicity using ClinVar, a repository of clinical variant adjudications.
 Studying how rare genetic variants affect the electrocardiogram is an innovative approach for
understanding arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death risk. We anticipate that this paradigm will be broadly
applicable to other quantitative endophenotypes and heart diseases. We submit that our aims are consistent
with the NHLBI’s mission of understanding the causes of disease and enabling translation of basic discoveries
into clinical practice."

we will prepare pediatric trainees from diverse subspeciality backgrounds who will ultimately lead research
teams, compete successfully for grant support, and become the next generation of pediatric researchers focused
on the pathogenesis and pathobiology of disorders affecting children requiring blood and cell-based therapies
and who will create and implement new treatment paradigms and oversee the clinical management of
hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary and inflammatory disorders."
10934528,"Project Summary- Prehospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are an indispensable component of the
US health care system, occupying a crucial role at the intersection of medical care, public health, and public
safety. EMS professionals' work is unique, extraordinarily demanding at cognitive and physical levels, and
requires highly adaptive, unwaveringly resilient performances. The unpredictable nature of each dispatch,
scene setting and patient presentation brings together a myriad of performance shaping factors that often very
dynamic and highly variable. Study of `real time' pre-hospital cognitive work, at the individual (EMS
professionals) and distributed/ team-based levels (EMS interactions with patients/caregivers, 911 dispatch) is
limited despite being fundamental for navigating fluctuating degrees of risk inherent in prehospital emergency
care. In response to the need for targeted research in support of overlooked areas of EMS cognitive work, we
propose to establish the Resilient_EMS Patient Safety Learning Lab (PSLL), focused on enhancing and
supporting safety, quality, and equity within pre-hospital emergency care. This project will focus particularly on
prehospital care of older adults (≥ 65 yrs). The Resilient_EMS PSLL is tailored to use systems and human
factors engineering approaches to innovate in support of EMS professionals' cognitive work as individuals
(e.g., decision making) and in a distributed manner (e.g., sharing mental models). As such, we will conduct a 4-
year, multi-site, multi-method field study of geriatric pre-hospital emergency care to achieve 3 specific aims:
Aim 1. To identify and define individual and distributed cognitive work system characteristics that impact
safety, quality, and equity along the continuum of prehospital resuscitative care (dispatch call transition of
care) for older adults presenting with a `potentially critical' chief medical (non- trauma related) complaint (e.g.,
respiratory distress, acute onset of altered mental status etc.). Aim 2. To co-design with key stakeholders
(EMS professionals, patients (older adults)/ caregivers, other professionals) potential solutions to support
cognitive work of EMS professionals (individual and team/based levels) required for dynamic resilient
performances using `human-centered/ inclusive design' principles and methodologies. Aim 3. To implement
and evaluate proposed design/redesign solutions using a multi-pronged approach for improving safety/ quality/
equity along the continuum of resuscitative care for older adults through support and enhancement of EMS
professionals' individual and distributed cognitive team-based work. Resilient_EMS PSLL's long term impact
will be new insights into the very challenging domain of prehospital care that will aid in creation of innovative
and inclusive/ human-centered solutions. Our research team is composed of experts in patient safety, human
factors, systems engineering, communication, prehospital care, emergency medicine, geriatrics, nursing,
health disparities, and patient/family partners. The study will address several AHRQ priority populations (older
adults, low income, racial/ ethnic minorities, rural/inner-city residents, women)."
10771048,"Project Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts Latinos in the US. Failing to provide equitable access to
vaccines will exacerbate the profound disparities in COVID-19 and other health conditions among Latinos
communities. Our team has established a community coalition and identified effective interventions to reduce
disparities among low-income limited English proficiency (LEP) Latino communities using qualitative, survey,
and implementation science methodologies. We will test the efficacy of a combination intervention REDES
(“Networks”) - a social network and mobile health (mHealth) enhanced community health worker (CHW)
intervention - to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake among a cohort of Latinos and their
networks in Maryland. We will recruit 300 index participants who have taken the COVID-19 vaccine. Half of the
index participants will be randomized to the experimental group (n=150). CHWs will train them to be peer
mentors to conduct peer outreach in-person and by text messages and to promote vaccine acceptance and
uptake with their networks. Index participants in the control group (n=150) will receive an equal attention
intervention. In addition, we will recruit unvaccinated primary and secondary network members of indexes for
study participation and COVID-19 vaccination. We will enroll an estimated total of 1,590 primary and
secondary network members. All participants will be followed prospectively at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after
baseline intake. The specific aims are: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of a combination intervention REDES to
promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinos; 2) Examine ongoing barriers and facilitators of vaccine
uptake among Latinos and their networks to tailor our intervention and address new challenges, and 3)
Evaluate the implementation determinants and outcomes of REDES to inform future broad-scale
implementation. Our multi-disciplinary research team brings together Latino health, social network, mHealth
interventions, vaccine hesitancy expertise; a long-term history of community engagement with partner
organizations in Maryland; and existing bilingual/bicultural CHW capacity and a rich local infrastructure for
COVID-19 response. If this combination intervention demonstrates the efficacy, we will develop an
implementation strategy toolkit, both in English and Spanish, for community partners and health departments
interested in replicating the approach. This proposal primarily focuses on COVID-19 vaccination, but
knowledge gained will be relevant to future vaccine equity initiatives, such as COVID-19 boosters (if needed)
and seasonal influenza vaccination."
10772993,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 2 This K01 career development award application proposes training and research designed to provide the
 3 candidate with the foundation to establish a successful career as an independent investigator with expertise in
 4 biobehavioral mechanisms underlying development and progression of obesity across the lifespan. The
 5 candidate proposes training to provide new expertise and knowledge in three areas including (1) child and
 6 adolescent obesity prevention research; (2) foundations and assessment of diet and obesity; and (3) theory
 7 and methods of neuroscience and neuroimaging. Using this training, a research project will be conducted in
 8 order to apply training. The current application proposes to use a biobehavioral, multi-method approach
 9 integrating neuroimaging and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in a sample of adolescents to study
10 how inhibitory control and contextual factors influence eating and dietary intake behaviors during adolescence,
11 which is a critical transitional developmental period. Limitations of previous research on inhibitory control and
12 obesity includes (1) failure to examine within-person (momentary) associations between inhibitory control and
13 eating and dietary intake behaviors; (2) primarily studying inhibitory control and its effect on eating and dietary
14 intake behaviors in the laboratory; (3) lack of understanding of how neurobiological underpinnings of IC
15 contribute to real-time eating and dietary intake behaviors; (4) failure to study how contextual factors moderate
16 the link between inhibitory control and eating and dietary intake behaviors; and (5) lack of research on
17 adolescence. This proposed approach using neuroimaging and EMA will allow for the elucidation of: brain-
18 based pathways that underlie deficits in inhibitory control, and how these brain-based pathways map onto real-
19 world eating and dietary intake behaviors; how within-person fluctuations in inhibitory control are associated
20 with eating and dietary intake behaviors over the course of the day; and how dynamic contextual factors (e.g.,
21 affect, social environment, and availability of highly palatable foods), modify the association between inhibitory
22 control and eating and dietary intake behaviors. This research will launch the candidate’s independent
23 research program focused on elucidating within- and between-person biobehavioral mechanisms underlying
24 the development and progression of obesity across the lifespan, which will be translated to integrated
25 prevention programs that take into account individual difference factors and contextual factors."
10771343,"In this proposal, we present exciting preliminary data showing that we have generated an iPSC-derived human
intestinal organoid (HIO) model that co-differentiates a complex multilineage tissue that possesses epithelium,
a mesenchymal/stromal layer that includes organized smooth muscle, endothelial cells and enteric neurons.
This is the first complex HIO model from iPSCs to spontaneously co-differentiate tissues from all 3 embryonic
germ layers, which is a prerequisite for a fully formed and functional organ, and the phenotype is driven by
specific members of the EGF-family of grow factors that are supplied as niche factors in the HIO growth
medium. The goals of this proposal is to interrogate the development of the complex lineages present in
complex HIOs (Aim 1), to further enhance the organization and complexity of HIOs by using a novel
suspension culture method and via in vivo transplantation (Aim 2), and to functionally interrogate the vascular
and neuronal cells present complex HIOs using microfluidics and in vivo transplantation (Aim 3)."
10771589,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The objective of this multi-principal investigator application is to leverage the complimentary expertise of the
investigators to develop and credential multiple new mouse models of high-risk, pediatric acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). These will include both human and mouse AML with genotypes and cells of origin that are informed by
real-world patient data and represent understudied high-risk molecular subtypes of the disease. This proposal
will address a pressing clinical and scientific need. Children with AML continue to have an overall poor survival
relative to other pediatric cancer patients. Advances in targeted therapies have been slow to develop, and up-
front treatment protocols have remained remarkably stagnant for the past 4 decades. Efforts to derive new
therapies have lagged, in part due to the marked genetic heterogeneity of pediatric AML. Indeed, we have
established that there are over 20 unique molecular subtypes of pediatric AML that reflect unique driver mutations
and expression signatures. Pediatric AML also harbor secondary mutations that further exacerbate genetic
heterogeneity. Thus, therapies that might benefit patients with one genetic subtype of pediatric AML could have
limited value in a different patient population. Unfortunately, current models of pediatric AML do not reflect the
marked genomic diversity observed in patients. Current approaches commonly focus on a limited subset of
molecular subtypes, typically avoiding rare high-risk subtypes, and they either do not co-model secondary
mutations or they implement mutational combinations that are not reflected in patients. Thus, there remains a
clear unmet need to advance pediatric AML modeling as a means to expand genetically informed therapeutic
options. We will address this need through the completion of three Aims that exploit the unique skills of each
investigator’s independent research programs and the exceptional institutional infrastructures at both St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. Aim 1: Develop novel syngeneic
mouse models of high-risk pediatric AML; Aim 2: Develop human models of rare pediatric AMLs with patient-
informed cooperating mutations; Aim 3. Credential established and newly developed AML models against one
another and primary human specimens. To create AML models, we will deploy several innovative genetic
strategies, including a novel approach to generate genetically complex murine AML from induced pluripotent
stem cells and direct editing of human cord blood progenitors. Credentialing will involve a direct comparison of
primary patient material with genetically matched murine and human models based on transcriptomic,
epigenomic and proteomic strategies. The high-risk pediatric AML models developed through this
comprehensive, cross-species proposal will provide the scientific community with an unparalleled collection of
extensively characterized specimens for future investigations into disease mechanisms and therapeutic
vulnerabilities."
10746789,"Our long-term goal is to elucidate the relationship between neural activity, sound processing, perception
and behavior. We specifically propose to establish the relationship of neural activity to discriminating and
detecting sound features in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt of non-human subjects with
the goal of revealing the transformations occurring as the auditory cortical hierarchy is ascended. We
address the question: How do neuronal responses in auditory cortex relate to non-human subjects'
psychophysical and behavioral performance in discriminating sound modulation? The three aims are
designed to compare three fundamental aspects related to these issues in A1 and in the lateral belt of
auditory cortex to determine the changing emphasis of processing along the ascending cortical pathway.
Aim 1 is to determine the neural basis of modulation discrimination. Aim 2 is to determine the effect of
behavioral state and auditory attention on neurons ability to encode sound features. Aim 3. is to
determine how neuronal responses from auditory cortex are related to perception, task-parameters, and
behavioral choices. To achieve these aims, we will establish the quantitative relationships between single
neuron auditory cortical activity and the ability of neurons and non-human subjects to discriminate
sounds, and determine what codes most likely underlie perceptual ability. We will also record from single
neurons while non-human subjects perform different sound discrimination tasks with attentional
distractors to determine the role of primary and secondary sensory cortical areas in the transformation
from sensation to task performance. This will give insight into how attention improves neural processing
at the single neuron level and whether primary sensory cortex receives information or is involved in the
processes that lead to action. Because the proposal relates function to different parts of the brain it is
relevant for a better understanding about how punctate brain damage such as that caused by stroke
affects auditory function. The results of these studies will help us to better understand how attending
sound modulates auditory activity and thus makes this basic science have relevance for the spectrum
disorders (that include, but are not limited to attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, etc). The results also
could have relevance in helping to guide approaches to coding for hearing aids and cochlear implants
since both neural coding and the ability to focus on sounds are relevant for designing these devices."
10746748,"Abstract
Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a
caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and
leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to
report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life
(HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health
outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need
to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the
TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care
partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial
will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management
intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in
240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel
personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms
(e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and
real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and
mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners
that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep
relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for
adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary
team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials
implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high-
dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a
real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners.
Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental
health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden
self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI."

The Johns Hopkins Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging will facilitate innovation in advanced imaging
technologies that could be applied to fundamental basic and pre-clinical research problems in cancer biology.
The mission of our Administrative and Coordination (A&C) Core is to ensure that the individual Research Units
combine with synergy beyond the individual parts, to contribute to the CCBIR Network with strength beyond the
individual Center, to integrate with the NCI and the cancer research community, and to be a partner with patient
advocates to connect basic research with improved patient outcomes. The Center brings together preeminent
faculty from eight departments housed in two schools (Medicine and Engineering), three JHU Centers and
Institutes, and a spatial omic expert at Yale. This multidisciplinary perspective enables us to bring the latest
experimental and computational methods to bear on the most clinically relevant aspects of cancer. Center
leadership are tremendously excited about the impact of the proposed Center and this is evident in substantial
technical, administrative, and financial support provided to our team through scientific cores, administrative
support from the Provost's office and Dean's office, and over $1M in matching funds. The leadership of the
Center is strongly committed to mentoring the next generation of leaders in cancer research including those
traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Our JH Center includes two early-stage investigators
(ESI) as critical co-Leads of the first Technology Development Unit (Dr. Ho and Dr. Wu). Our Administrative Core
will ensure the successful execution of our ambitious mission directed by two aims. Aim 1: Scientific and Financial
Management of the Center. Drs. Wirtz and Wood will have overall responsibility for the scientific and
administrative leadership of the Center, with support from an experienced Project Manager. A Steering
Committee including the Multiple PIs, the Unit Leads and co-Leads, and the Project Manager will meet monthly
to discuss scientific progress, challenges, and budgetary issues. The A&C Core will refine and monitor budgets,
allocating funds to each unit to achieve overall center goals. They will also take the lead on preparing timely
reports to the NIH, the Hopkins IRB, and other oversight regulatory bodies. Aim 2: Communication and Review:
External Advisory Panel (EAP), Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), Patient Advocates, and NCI. The Core will
develop and ensure timely communications and documentation within the Center and across all Centers within
the network. In addition, the Core will monitor timelines and milestones, and assign tasks to the unit leaders to
assure that milestones are met. Oversight will be provided by an EAP and the NCI. The A&C will gather annual
progress reports from the units, address any potential major changes in direction, and with patient advocates,
guide how our research relates to patient needs. The Center progress will be tracked using standard metrics in
place for large projects at Hopkins, covering four domains (staffing, fiscal, productivity, and infrastructure)."
10747314,"Project Summary – Tech 1
The identification of key molecular and cellular events that drive the progression of metastatic breast and
pancreatic cancer could lead to improved mechanistic understanding and diagnostic tools and treatments.
However, the micro-anatomy of human pancreatic/breast tumors – their spatial organization and associated
content in cellular and non-cellular components – is poorly understood as it is intrinsically three-dimensional,
non-symmetric, and highly heterogeneous. Three-dimensional imaging tools that combine structural and spatial
omic information in large volumes are required to locate these metastatic driver events in cancerous tissue.
Specifically, we aim to investigate venous invasion, which is a common route of metastasis of breast and
pancreatic cancer cells. In Tech1, we propose to develop a new 3D multiscale imaging method, CODA, which
will allow us to probe the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumors from the multi-cm to the micron scale via
multiplexing serial imaging and registration/deep-learning algorithms. Our proposed repertoire of CODA imaging
methods addresses deficiencies of state-of-art tissue clearing and 3D imaging methods, including inconsistent
clearing and staining, lack of validation, poor antibody penetration and limited multiplexing capabilities. CODA
bypasses the limitations of optical microscopy, allowing for large volumetric imaging while achieving micron
resolution regardless of the volume of the imaged tissue. Another key advantage of CODA, which is based on
serially cut H&E sections, is that it can readily incorporate other imaging modalities to extract high
cellular/molecular content from the 3D samples. These include immunocytochemistry (CODA+IHC),
immunofluorescence (CODA+IF), and imaging mass cytometry (CODA+IMC). This is particularly important as
many potential molecular and cellular contributors of intravasation/extravasation and cancer cell invasion into
veins, including immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, require specific labels that cannot be detected
in H&E slides. These proposed expanded versions of CODA offer a unique opportunity to produce new 3D
multiplex maps of human PDAC and breast tumors near and far from blood vessels. CODA and its integrated
versions CODA+X will be tested in the RTB units of the Center."
10747317,"Project Summary
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with a dismal prognosis and a high frequency of distant metastasis. One
likely reason for the frequent metastases in pancreatic cancer is the ability of malignant cells in the primary tumor
to invade veins, providing direct access to the liver. While this intravasation is a key first step in metastasis, little
is known about the molecular and cellular alterations that underlie this process. Foci of cancer cell intravasation
are small and complex, requiring high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) approaches to study them. In this
Research Test Bed of our Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we will comprehensively characterize the
morphological, cellular, and molecular alterations of foci of intravasation in 3D in human pancreatic cancer
samples. In collaboration with Technology Development Unit 1, we will employ our novel deep learning 3D
reconstruction approach CODA to serially sectioned pancreatic cancer samples with venous invasion to quantify
morphological and cellular features of intravasation. We will also perform multi-dimensional immune profiling of
these intravasation foci in 3D using imaging mass cytometry, which can label with 40 antibodies on each tissue
section. These analyses will allow us to compare the tumor microenvironment in foci of intravasation to that in
other areas of cancer and in uninvolved veins. In collaboration with Technology Development Unit 2, we will
analyze the gene expression changes in these intravasation foci by applying a newly developed spatial
transcriptomics/proteomics approach (DBit-Seq) to pancreatic cancer samples previously reconstructed by
CODA. This approach will provide the first 3D multi-scale models of venous invasion in human pancreatic cancer,
providing unprecedented morphological, cellular, and molecular detail of the process of intravasation and
initiation of metastasis. In addition, our Research Test Bed will provide a critical opportunity to implement,
validate, and iteratively improve the novel approaches from the two Technology Development Centers. We will
work closely with these Technology Development Centers in order to evaluate the performance of CODA and
DBit-Seq in our human pancreatic tissue samples, allowing validation of the cell type identification and molecular
alterations by complementary techniques. The studies in our Research Test Bed will promote significant
improvement of the CODA and DBit-Seq imaging platforms while also providing important biological insights into
the initiation of metastasis in pancreatic cancer."
10747318,"Metastasis requires fundamental changes in cell behavior and causes most cancer deaths. Metastasis is also
an inherently 3D process involving interactions among diverse cancer cells and with the tumor microenvironment
(TME). We developed innovative 3D assays to model each step in metastasis ex vivo. We use these assays to
generate hypotheses about how cancer cells accomplish metastasis and which molecular signals should be
targeted therapeutically. In vivo validation of these hypotheses is rate limiting, technically and conceptually. We
can compare the effects of many perturbations in vitro, with real-time imaging and molecular readouts. In
contrast, in vivo validation is generally limited to measurements of tumor diameter, CTC and metastasis numbers,
and a few molecular markers in 2D sections. There is an urgent need to achieve a 3D understanding of
metastasis, including the complex interactions among cell types and transitions between cell states. The
3D imaging and spatial multi-omics approaches in TECH1 and TECH2 are ideally suited to allow us to
understand vascular invasion, the key transition from local to metastatic disease. Prior studies generally
evaluated single cell types or a few markers, largely in 2D. CODA (TECH1) will enable us to classify cell types
and their spatial relationships in 3D. DBiT-seq (TECH2) enables us to reconstruct the transcriptome and select
proteome of high-resolution regions (~10 micron) across whole sections of human tumors. We will combine these
techniques to achieve spatial multi-omics and resolve cancer cell state changes during breast cancer metastasis.
Aim 1: Adapt CODA to murine models and human breast tumors, focusing on venous invasion. We will
first supply archival human breast tumors to enable TECH to adapt their 3D deep learning algorithms to breast
cancer. We will start with a existing series of 250 human breast tumors with digitized serial sections. We will then
collect, fix, and section fresh human breast tumor samples, stained with immune and cancer cell markers. We
will use CODA to reconstruct the 3D architecture of vascular invasion and associated stromal responses. We
will also adapt CODA techniques for use with murine preclinical models. We will then leverage these insights to
reconstitute the vascular invasion niche in vitro by adapting a novel microfluidic platform we developed.
Aim 2: Adapt DBiT-seq for murine and human breast tumors, focusing on cancer cell state transitions.
We will adapt DBiT-seq to 3D human breast tumor samples to understand spatial relationships among cancer
cell states during vascular invasion. This analysis will be led from cell states and inferred state transitions we
defined in vitro using single cell RNA-seq in our 3D metastasis assays. We will then collect a staged series of
tumors and distant organs from GEMMs to define cell state transitions spatially across metastatic processes that
are difficult to sample in humans. We will then use the transcriptional and signaling dynamics identified in vivo
using DBiT-seq to identify candidate molecular regulators for functional validation in vascular invasion
microfluidic devices in vitro. Validated candidates will then be tested in vivo in breast cancer GEMMs."

10915010,"Project Summary/Abstract - Molecular Imaging Core
The overarching goal of the Molecular Imaging Core is to provide full-service assistance in the
interrogation and analysis of experimental animal and human-derived kidney tissue. This goal will be
accomplished through the conduct of the following specific aims: 1) Provide the renal research community with
three high impact services: Co-Detection by Indexing (CODEX), Large-scale 3D imaging and Tissue Cytometry
(3DTC), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) and 2) Provide analytic support to ensure the outputs of molecular
imaging are interpretable and integrated within and across technologies, and data outputs are consistent with
best practices and are harmonized with cell-type and state definitions used across the renal community. The
technologies can be offered individually to facilitate spatial anchoring of proteomic and transcriptomic signals,
or offered together on the same tissue specimen. An integrated output can be accomplished by direct co-
registration on consecutive sections or alignment in the analytical space. The analytical support provided will
allow investigators to test hypotheses and create a common framework for cell type and state annotation
across multiple NIDDK initiatives. Together, the technologies offered through the Molecular Imaging Core will
allow investigators to define, localize, and quantify: 1) all cell populations, 2) cell-cell interactions within 3D
neighborhoods, 3) morphological changes and injury regions, 4) the expression of 18,000 genes mapped over
histopathology, and 5) deep immune and injury phenotypes anchored spatially. Such outputs provide a unique
and powerful service to the renal community. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to
aid the renal community in identifying critically needed biomarkers of disease progression, optimizing
preclinical studies, and developing specific and targeted therapeutic interventions for a wide range of kidney
diseases."

presenting the opportunity to identify and characterize the entire population of cells in the context of their full
three-dimensional organization and relationship. However, there are technical challenges that hinder the wide-
spread implementation of large-scale, high-resolution microscopy as an effective research tool. The Resource
Development Core will address these challenges through (1) the development of a unique multi-scale/multi-
resolution approach to large-scale imaging of the rodent and human kidney based upon a novel hybrid open-
top lightsheet microscope system (2) the development of cutting-edge methods of automated image analysis
and (3) the development of methods for integrating imaging and transcriptomic data for combined analyses.
Methods developed here will be continuously incorporated into the services of the Molecular Imaging Core and
disseminated in publications, online repositories and through the IU O’Brien Microscopy Workshop."
10747921,"Project Summary
 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training
the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology."

services in existing cores, and enhancing an order and charge-entry system now adopted campus-wide. We
have expanded from one to two annual pilot project solicitations and have renewed successfully our American
Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant, which also serves The Jackson Laboratories. We have
consolidated remote basic and population science Members into our central Rubin Building and brought on-line
new facilities in the contiguous Williamson Translational Research Building. In addition to managing both
Geisel and D-H annual operating budgets, we have implemented for Leadership oversight an annual
philanthropic budget and extended quarterly review of Shared Resources’ financial performance to the faculty
positions for which we have lead responsibility. We continue to manage funds at both Geisel and D-H, which
informed the vision of the new Director, and we have implemented an annual distribution of research funds to
clinician Principal Investigators and Clinical Oncology Groups. In addition to the CCSG, its supplements, and
the faculty for which NCCC has a lead administrative role, we support multi-investigator grants administration,
such as our NCTN LAPS award. The Administrative role in strategic planning was most evident in the
contribution of reference documents and the convening of Members to participate in the 2018 updating of the

Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) is a central provider and resource of Career Enhancement activities for
its trainees, Program Members, at both Dartmouth and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health system (D-H), and
beyond. Importantly, the NCCC Career Enhancement programs link Dartmouth, and the Geisel School of
Medicine, with D-H in the joint endeavor to train the next generation of cancer-focused physicians and
scientists and to improve health locally and globally.
In the last five years, our new initiatives have been responsive to emerging themes, needs and opportunities,
and we have increased our funding base in key areas to implement these initiatives. These new programs
span the breadth of stages of career development and include: 1. Successful founding of the NCI-funded
Dartmouth Opportunities for Oncology Research (DOOR) Training Program for undergraduates from
underrepresented minority (URM) or disadvantaged backgrounds; 2. Implementation of the Training Program
in Surgical Innovation and the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, both of which are recently
NIH T32-funded and led by NCCC Members; 3. The establishment of two new medical residency programs in
Radiation Physics and Radiation Oncology; 4. Synergistic interaction with the NIH-funded CTSA and COBRE
Programs at Dartmouth to provide mentoring and grant writing support, which has directly contributed to the
doubling of NIH Career Development awards (K and R00) as well as new Komen, American Cancer Society
and NIH MIRA awards, to junior NCCC Members during this reporting period; 5. The expansion of training and
trainee participation in Global Oncology, facilitated by active partnerships with institutions in Honduras and
Rwanda; 6. NCCC has collaborated with Dartmouth, Geisel, and D-H to hire 21 cancer and oncology-focused
faculty within 11 different departments during the current reporting period.
Future activities and goals to facilitate Career Enhancement at NCCC have been prioritized and many are
already underway. Burgeoning initiatives are described within this application and include: integration of a new
Medical Masters in Science Program; the new Radiation Physics residency program underway (2018) and the
Radiation Oncology residency program that will begin next summer (2019); The Translational Oncology
Program Scholars (TOPS) program begins the summer of 2019, and will provide Geisel medical students a
mentored research experience and exposure to clinical translational medicine in order to give an insider’s view
of a career as a translational physician-scientist; and the 2019 launch of the D-H Cancer Faculty Fellows
Program in which six to nine faculty members from the clinical departments will be provided with 40%

11170063,"Project Summary/Abstract: Irradiation, Preclinical Imaging, and Microscopy
The Irradiation, Preclinical Imaging, and Microscopy Shared Resource (IPIM) provides a comprehensive array
of sophisticated cancer relevant diagnostic imaging and therapeutic instrumentation/techniques for cells,
tissues, and large and small animals, with a focus on preclinical work that sets the stage for subsequent rapid
clinical translation. Irradiation services are provided with a 137Cs irradiator for use on cells and animals. Optical
cellular imaging and electron microscopy provides multiple types of confocal, TIRF and wide-field fluorescence
microscopy imaging, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Rodent imaging components
include PET, CT, MRI, Bioluminescence/Fluorescent (Xenogen/IVIS), and VisualSonics Vevo 770 high-
frequency ultrasound. Large animal imaging includes MRI, fMRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, fluoroscopy/
angiography, and intra-operative MRI/CT as part of the unique Center for Surgical Innovation (CSI). Since its
opening during the current funding period, CSI has enabled a total of 7 peer-reviewed research grants, 5 of
which are from NCI. Notable CSI projects include development, imaging, and treatment of a human-porcine
xenograft brain tumor model, development of MRI-compatible instrumentation for facilitation of head and neck
cancer surgeries performed in the MRI-intraoperative environment, and development of a novel intraoperative
nerve imaging agent. The capabilities of the CSI are currently available in only a few of the largest clinical
research institutions, and IPIM is distinct in having similar capabilities for use in large animal studies. Since
2015, IPIM facilities have been utilized by 55 NCCC Members from all 4 NCCC Research Programs (CPS [2],
CBT [22], ICI [16], TEC [15]). NCCC Funded Member Users represented 72% of Total Users, and we request
only 20% of Total IPIM budget from CCSG funding. Examples of NCCC Member-supported projects include
dual modality/dual agent imaging (Davis, Pogue and Samkoe [TEC]), fundamental mechanisms associated
with membrane traffic control microvascular permeability, angiogenesis and inflammation that drive tumor
vasculature and subsequent treatment (Stan, Turk, Fiering, Noelle [ICI] and Pogue [TEC]); and Cherenkov
irradiation as a real-time dosimetry tool in the radiation oncology setting (Pogue, Gladstone, Hoopes, and
Jarvis [TEC]). In addition to providing outstanding viable imaging, IPIM will focus on accurately combining / co-

Mice are by far the most commonly used vertebrate research model organism for biomedical research, and the
ability to generate efficiently genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM), maintain those mice, and use
them for sophisticated experimentation is the basis for the dominance of mice for mammalian biomedical
research. As with most biomedical research platforms, the utilization of mice is complex, and often researchers
need specialized support to accomplish their mouse experiments. The Mouse Modeling (MM) Shared
Resource is focused on supporting researchers doing mouse experimentation by offering a broad range of
services that are adapted for specific experimental needs, updating services with the latest technological
approaches and doing this service in an efficient and cost-effective manner. By keeping the focus on flexibility,
cutting-edge capability and efficiency of services, we have been able to support mouse model experimentation
by many researchers and remain financially solvent for over 21 years. The vast majority of the experiments we
support are cancer-focused, with other major areas including neuroscience, infectious disease and antibody
generation. During the current award period services were performed for 27 Cancer Center Members, 25 of
whom now are Members of all 4 NCCC Programs (CPS [1], CBT [11], ICI [10], and TEC [3]). NCCC Funded
Members represented 37% of Total MM projects served (549), and we are requesting only 24% of the Total
MM Operating Budget from CCSG support. As an example of value added to NCCC research, “Floxed” ID2
mice were generated by the MM Shared Resource for a study investigating the role of ID2 in glioma biology,
and now these mice are available for other researchers, here and outside Dartmouth, and can be combined
with Cre-expressing mice to study the biology of ID2, a gene that that plays a role in multiple different cancers.
In a second study involving genetically engineered mice, including a knock-in of a Cre-expression-regulated
allele of constitutively active P110 of P13 kinase, the resulting model was the first reported rapidly developing
murine breast tumor model that generates predominantly adenocarcinoma breast tumors, pathologically similar
to human breast cancer. In contrast, other models are either very slow to develop or generate sarcomatoid
breast tumors, which are rare in human breast cancer. MM’s menu of services constantly is evolving to
respond to changing technologies and changing needs of new and established faculty at Dartmouth. Recently,
we have been more involved providing mouse model experimentation services to support labs that either are
not experienced with mouse experimentation or do not have sufficient lab personnel to support needed mouse
studies, such as engineering faculty from Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, or research clinical
faculty from Dartmouth-Hitchcock. Another new area of focus for MM is the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to make
directly targeted genetic modifications in mouse zygotes with no intermediate tissue culture step with ES cells.
Multiple mouse models have been made, and we continue to develop skills with this powerful technology."

acquired an Ion Torrent Chef-55 system to support its role as a central reference lab for both the adult and
pediatric NCI MATCH trials. Next generation sequencing services now include a 50-gene cancer hotspot
panel, a 50-gene solid tumor fusion gene panel, and a 54-gene myeloid panel, resulting in a somatic mutation
database of more than 4,000 patient tumors now available for investigator-initiated data mining. For the Adult
MATCH trial, the laboratory has sequenced 280 samples, and for the Pediatric MATCH trial we have
sequenced 292 samples to date. The PSR has established a somatic mutation database for routinely tested
human cancers that includes glioma, triple negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic
colorectal cancer, metastatic melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, sarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia.
These data have resulted in numerous multidisciplinary publications evaluating mutation profiles within and
across tumor types. Institutional biorepository samples are annotated in eSample, a module of Velos which is
supported by the NCCC and has connectivity with the clinical trial program eResearch, also a module in Velos.

studying known carcinogens, such as arsenic, the potential antagonistic effects of elements, such as selenium,
or the therapeutic uses of platinum or iron nanoparticles, there is a clear need for both routine and advanced
trace element analytical methods to support NCCC research. The Trace Elements (TE) Shared Resource
provides access to low-level inorganic elemental analysis to all four research programs within the Cancer
Center. TE uses state-of-the-art ICP-MS instruments to quantify multiple elements and, when coupled with
chromatography, multiple contaminant compounds (species) in a variety of biological and environmental
media. Cutting-edge ICP-MS instrumentation (e.g., triple-quadrupole ICP-QQQ) provides rapid, interference-
free analysis of established and emerging contaminants and macro- and micro-nutrient elements. The breadth
of sample types handled by TE spans water, soil, sediment, invertebrates, fish and animal tissues and organs,
cell lysates, human hair, toenail, blood, urine, placenta, foodstuffs, and beverages. The ability to handle such a
broad array of sample types is a unique feature of TE. In some cases, the sample mass available for analysis
is <10 mg, and methods often are adapted to account for small sample masses on a case-by-case basis.
Analytical data must be collected according to accepted protocols for sample preparation, analysis, and quality
control. TE has established protocols and a Quality Assurance program, uses methods based on those of the
CDC, FDA, EPA, and USGS; and participates in national and international proficiency testing programs to
ensure accurate, precise, and defensible data. TE has very strong links to the Cancer Population Sciences

10773305,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adolescent brain development is sensitive to exposures and has impacts on neurobehavioral functioning.
Insecticide exposure may impact executive and attentional brain circuits which mature during adolescence due
to pubertal hormonal influences and these changes may manifest as ADHD-related symptoms. There are gaps
in knowledge about how insecticide exposure affects the adolescent brain, when neurobehavioral
vulnerability can undermine lifelong relationships, economic attainment, and overall health.
While most general populations, including adolescents, are exposed to low levels of insecticides through non-
agricultural uses and consuming fruits and vegetables, occupational populations are known to have substantially
higher levels of exposure. Therefore, we have worked extensively with a cohort of Egyptian adolescent pesticide-
applicators who are occupationally exposed to insecticides (α-cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos). Increased ADHD
symptoms and altered neurobehavioral performance in this cohort correlate with α-cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos
toxicological burden. However, moderators and mechanisms underlying these associations remain undefined.
Our pilot data indicate that combined adolescent exposure leads to altered neurobehavior and dopamine
systems in the brain in mice. The effects in pesticide applicators are present many months after exposure. The
epigenome is a potential mediator of the relationship between exposures and long-term neurobehavioral effects
due to its unique sensitivity to the environment and potential to regulate gene expression throughout the lifespan.
Our overall hypothesis is that combined adolescent insecticide exposures impact neurobehavioral
outcomes. We additionally hypothesize that effects are modified by testosterone level, act via oxidative stress
in dopamine neurons, and have a long-term trajectory via epigenetic change. We will test these with three
synergistic aims joining human investigation and animal mechanistic assessments with translation
between them, facilitated by a transdisciplinary investigator team, novel approaches, and a well laid-out
consortium plan. In Aim 1, we will leverage stored samples and data from adolescent pesticide-applicators to
quantify the neurobehavioral impact of combined versus single insecticide exposures, assessing the high-
reward, high-risk hypothesis that pesticide-applicator testosterone level moderates this association. In
Aim 2, we will model these adolescent insecticide exposures in mice to examine causality and use
manipulations to test oxidative stress as a mechanism and testosterone level as a moderator of effects. Cell
culture studies will provide convergent results for the role of dopamine neurons. In Aim 3, we will examine DNA
methylation across both human and mouse samples collected after completion of peak insecticide exposure, to
examine the potential epigenetic mechanisms translationally of long-term neurobehavioral risk. This work

10931673,"NUT carcinoma (NC) is an aggressive squamous carcinoma driven by the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein. NC
affects all ages and is highly lethal (>90%), a median survival of 6.5 months. There are no effective treatment
options for NC; thus, this disease represents an extreme unmet need. The overarching goal of this proposal is
to improve survival of these patients through mechanism-driven identification and testing of therapeutic targets.
In response to the need for an immunocompetent animal model in which both NC cell-autonomous and -non-
autonomous pathogenic mechanisms can be investigated rigorously, we have developed the first genetically
engineered mouse (GEM) model of NC. As a squamous carcinoma, NC serves as a paradigm for fusion
oncoprotein-driven solid tumors. The NC GEM will expand that paradigm to understanding how tumor intrinsic
and extrinsic interactions sustain NC growth.
 Mechanistically, BRD4 is a BET family protein whose dual bromodomains bind acetyl-histones that when fused
to NUT, recruits the histone acetyltransferase, p300, forming enormous super-enhancers called megadomains.
BRD4-NUT megadomains maintain expression of pro-growth, anti-differentiation transcription factors including
MYC, SOX2, and TP63. Our demonstration that treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi), small
molecules that competitively inhibit binding of BET bromodomains to chromatin, can inhibit growth of NC in
humans, led to a new field investigating the role of BRD4 in cancer. However, it has become clear that
monotherapy with BETi does not fully address NC biology. We have recently found that repression of tumor
suppressor gene expression, such as that of CDKN2A/B, by the histone methyltransferse, EZH2, highly
complements oncogenic activation by BRD4-NUT in maintaining NC growth. Targeting of this pathway with
tazemetostat (taz) is highly synergistic with BETi and will be explored in the proposed GEM model.
 It is now recognized that NC harbors an immune-evasive tumor microenvironment (TME) and can respond to
immune modulation therapy. Epigenetic modulators such as taz and BETi are known to promote an anti-tumor
immune TME. Thus, pre-clinical animal models with intact immune systems such as our NC GEM are needed to
fully evaluate effects of epigenetic modifiers, and the role of immune therapy in this disease. Our GEM has a
tamoxifen-inducible, conditional knock-in fusion of murine Brd4 with human NUTM1, encoding a BRD4-NUT
fusion oncoprotein. Invasive tumors formed in our NC GEM (`mNC') have provided the most definitive evidence
that BRD4-NUT is the sole driver of this cancer. mNC closely mimics human NC, demonstrating rapid growth,
metastatic spread, and an indistinguishable histopathology and immunophenotype. Moreover, the immune cell
composition of the mNC TME also resembles that of human NC. We will make use of our novel GEM to address
the following aims: 1. establish the applicability of the NC GEM (mNC) to human NC (hNC) biology.; 2. devise
improved primary therapy for NUT carcinoma.; 3. explore approaches to prevent relapse of NC."

Epigenetic abnormalities are common in human cancers and play a critical role in tumorigenesis via
dysregulation of gene expression and by affecting chromatin function. Nuclear receptor binding SET domain
protein 3 (NSD3/WHSC1L1) belongs to the family of NSD histone methyltransferases that catalyze mono- and
di-methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me1/2). NSD3 gene is located within 8p11-12 region
amplified in approximately 15% of patients with breast carcinomas and this amplification is significantly
associated with disease-specific survival and distant recurrence in breast cancer patients. NSD3 has been
identified as a key oncogenic driver within 8p11-12 amplicon and knockdown of NSD3 results in profound loss
of growth and survival of breast cancer cells. However, NSD3 is a complex and multidomain protein, and
despite multiple efforts, no studies unambiguously validated whether the catalytic SET domain is essential for
the oncogenic activity of NSD3. Here, we propose to assess the importance of the NSD3 SET domain in
oncogenesis by developing small molecule chemical probes. This approach is highly novel as no NSD3
inhibitors targeting catalytic SET domain were reported in the literature. To date, we identified a class of small
molecule compounds that bind selectively to the NSD3 SET domain, but not to the closely related NSD1 or
NSD2. In preliminary studies, our inhibitors specifically block growth of breast cancer cells with amplifications
of NSD3. The goal of this proposal is to further develop these compounds and validate whether optimized
chemical probes blocking catalytic activity of NSD3 would impair development and progression of breast
cancer in vivo. To accomplish this goal, we will employ extensive medicinal chemistry to improve potency,
selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties of our NSD3 inhibitors. Efficacy of the most potent compounds will
be evaluated in xenograft and PDX models of breast cancer. We are confident that our comprehensive plan
will lead to successful development of potent NSD3 chemical probes for exploration of NSD3 biology in breast
cancer and other tumors with 8p11-12 amplifications."

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) occurs in 20% of children after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and
can cause multi-organ dysfunction and death. Over the last decade, our research team has advanced
understanding of the diagnosis and management of TMA. Standardized diagnostic criteria for TMA, developed
by our group, were recently adopted by international consensus (Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, 2022).
Our published data demonstrate that dysregulation of complement and interferon are associated with endothelial
injury and a high-risk TMA phenotype. Complement blockade has been associated with improved outcomes in
children with TMA (70% versus 16% historical survival), but is not effective in all patients. Furthermore, we still
do not fully understand the specific initiators or triggers for TMA. Our preliminary proteomic data demonstrate
increased phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) expression – which regulates viral replication – in HCT recipients.
In our published prospective natural history study of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), we observed that ~20% of
children had BKPyV in their blood within the first few months after HCT and BKPyV viremia was associated with
a seven-fold increased risk of TMA, making BKPyV a good model of a viral trigger in TMA. Finally, we have
sequenced over 150 clinical BKPyV samples and have identified high levels of genomic diversity after HCT. Our
established collaborations across Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and the
University of Cincinnati make us uniquely qualified to perform the proposed studies. The objective of the current
proposal is to examine initiators and mechanisms of TMA in an established cohort of children and young adults
(N=300) undergoing HCT. We hypothesize that exogenous and endogenous mechanisms both initiate
TMA, mediated by complement and interferon. Our hypothesis focuses on complement and interferon
because this hypothesis is supported by our published and preliminary data, and because these initiators can
be targeted in future interventional studies. Specifically, available therapeutic options now include inhibitors of
the complement and interferon systems and virus-specific T cells to eradicate BKPyV. To test our hypothesis,
we propose two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will systematically evaluate complement and interferon as triggers
for TMA in children undergoing allogeneic HCT. We will test for complement and interferon activation pre-HCT
and then weekly after HCT. Aim 2 will evaluate host susceptibility and viral exposure as novel triggers for TMA
in children undergoing allogeneic HCT. We will evaluate susceptibility to TMA in children with BKPyV viremia by
testing samples for BKPyV diversity and PI4K after HCT. Finally, the knowledge gained from Aim 1 and Aim 2
will be applied to a new performance cohort (N=100), to be enrolled in the final years of the award period. The
performance cohort will test, during clinical care, how the identified triggers can predict TMA and its severity after
HCT. This approach will inform the design of future interventional trials to prevent, treat, or decrease the severity
of TMA after HCT and improve patient survival for this high-risk population."
10773758,"Project Summary/Abstract
Telomere length plays a pivotal role in cancer and age-related degenerative disease. Telomeres are made of
simple tandem repeats, added by the enzyme telomerase, to establish a length distribution. A mechanistic
understanding of the forces that regulate telomere length is needed to develop approaches to disease. Current
models for how the telomere length equilibrium is maintained suggest that ends with fewer telomere repeats
are more frequently elongated than ends with many repeats implying that all telomeres are regulated around
the same length distribution. We developed a nanopore sequencing method to measure telomere length in
yeast at the nucleotide level. Surprisingly, we found that each telomere had a distinct length distribution that
was maintained over hundreds of cell divisions. This discovery requires that current models for length
regulation be revised. In this proposal we detail specific experiments to test mechanisms that may modify the
length distribution at specific chromosome ends: 1. Subtelomeric sequences 2. Telomere
transcription/telomere RNA (TERRA), and the Sir2/3/4 histone modification complex. We will use
computational approaches to determine if specific sequence motifs are associated with long or short
telomeres, and we will systematically delete DNA binding sites to test their role. We will use nanopore RNA
sequencing to study the long non-coding RNA TERRA, and test whether the RNA, or the action of transcribing
the telomere play a role in end-specific telomere lengths. Finally, we will test the role of the histone
deacetylase Sir2 and the interaction of Sir4 with Ku in determining end-specific telomere lengths. These
experiments will implicate or rule out the specific factors that establish different length distributions.
Understanding molecular mechanism(s) that influence telomere length distributions will set the stage to
specifically manipulate telomere length. Because mechanisms of telomere length regulation are conserved
across species, our experiments will set the stage for approaches to alter telomere length to treat human
disease.

The Pitx2 homeodomain transcription factor is a central transcriptional regulator in left right asymmetry that
functions within the heart to control cardiac morphogenesis. It is now clear that Pitx2 is fundamentally
connected to AF although the basis for this connection remains obscure. The first evidence for the Pitx2-AF
link was made in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) implicating a region of chromosome 4q25 in
early onset familial AF. Pitx2 was the gene in closest proximity to the disease associated single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP). AF patients with the 4q25 SNP were free of hypertension, diabetes and valve defects.
Moreover, patients with the 4q25 SNP were more prone to cardioembolic stroke adding further urgency to gain
insight to the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the 4q25 SNP. We were the first group to
report that Pitx2 heterozygous mice were predisposed to AF indicating that reduced levels of Pitx2 led to AF.
Three different groups have subsequently replicated our findings. Because of its critical role in AF, we
hypothesized that genome wide analysis of Pitx2 transcriptional target genes would provide novel and
fundamentally important insight into the molecular mechanisms for AF in the Pitx2 happloinsufficient state. Our
preliminary Multi-Omics analysis indicates that Pitx2 directly binds to a number of genes that have been
implicated in AF and also genes that respond to reactive oxygen species and induce inflammation.
There is poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying AF. New genetic insights will be critical for
diagnostic testing and family counseling in the future. Moreover, an in depth knowledge of genetics of AF will
provide critical resources for patient management as human genome sequencing becomes more
commonplace. Finally, there is the long term goal to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on solid
scientific information that will come from work in model organisms and human genetics."
10775726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive
decline. Synaptic dysfunction and loss correlates strongly with cognitive impairment in AD. Aging is the leading
risk factor for AD, and epigenetic mechanisms involving histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in
aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Among the 11 zinc-dependent HDACs, HDAC9 is the most
abundant isoform in the brain, found exclusively in neurons. We provide key preliminary data showing that
HDAC9 expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) diminishes with aging in wild-type mice, and
that reduced HDAC9 expression precedes the onset of amyloid deposition in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD.
Consistent with these preclinical findings, AD patients exhibited decreased HDAC9 expression in the dorsolateral
PFC. Moreover, global or hippocampal CA1-specific deletion of HDAC9 induces cognitive impairment and
impairs synaptic plasticity, while HDAC9 overexpression produces cognitive-enhancing effects. We hypothesize
that reduced neuronal HDAC9 mediates cognitive decline, synaptic dysfunction and other
neuropathologies associated with brain aging and AD. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that loss of HDAC9 in hippocampal and PFC neurons mediates age-
and AD-related neuropathology and cognitive impairment. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the histone
methyltransferase EZH2 [the catalytic component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which
catalyzes repressive H3K27me3 modifications at gene promoters] epigenetically silences HDAC9 expression in
the hippocampus and PFC during aging and in AD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal pentraxin
2 (NP2), nerve growth factor inducible (VGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediate the
downstream effects of HDAC9 on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognition. We expect that the results will
provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic control of genes related to aging and AD
and offer potential targets for future therapeutic interventions."

Regulated transport of Na+ and K+ in the kidney tubules is central to blood pressure regulation and fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis. The mTORC2-SGK1-ENaC axis is a well-established component of this regulatory
machinery, however, key mechanistic features remain poorly characterized, and in vivo data is limited. We have
used in vivo and in vitro approaches to identify novel features of this signaling system, particularly its role in K+
homeostasis. Our recent data suggest that: 1) K+ acts through WNK kinases to activate mTORC2; 2) tubule cell
mTORC2 is central to the rapid response to a K+ load in mice; 3) Structural features of mTORC2, elucidated
using cryo-EM, play an essential role in mTORC2 activity and specificity. To explore these hypotheses, we will:
Aim 1: Assess the temporal sequence of responses to K+ in mice with tubule-specific knockout of
mTORC2. We have generated a rapidly inducible kidney tubule-specific Rictor KO (TRKO) mouse model.
Preliminary data show that these mice fail to respond to KCl normally; differences between WT and KO mice
manifest in <3h following KCl gavage, and are striking by 48 h of high K diet. To characterize these mice, we will
determine: (A) Time course of response to acute KCl load. Mice will be treated with an oral K+ load and urinary
and plasma parameters will be assessed. Kidneys will be harvested and assessed for tissue signaling
parameters and ion transporter expression and modification. ENaC, ROMK, and BK channel activities will be
measured using patch clamp. Cytoplasm from patched cells will be captured and mRNA subjected to RNA-seq
to identify single-cell gene expression patterns. (B) Time course of gene deletion: Mice will be adapted to a high
K+ diet prior to initiating gene deletion. Balance experiments will be performed on adrenal-intact and ADX + aldo
mice at time points prior to and during emergence of phenotype. Patch clamp will be performed and cytoplasmic
RNA harvested and analyzed as in (A). (C) Evaluate PKC role and identify novel targets. We will identify key
PKC substrates using LC/MS, and functionally characterize them in vivo and in cultured cells. Aim 2: mTORC2
molecular signaling mechanisms and specificity: structural features and effects of WNK kinases. We will
establish the cellular and molecular features that underlie mTORC2 regulation of SGK1 using cultured cells and
cryo-EM. (A) Investigate WNK1 and WNK4 as scaffolds that promote mTORC2-dependent
phosphorylation of SGK1 in a K+-dependent fashion. We will examine effects of WNK kinases on physical
interactions and phosphorylation of SGK1, and functional effects on ENaC and ROMK in cultured mpkCCD and
HEK-293 cells. (B) Cryo-EM structural analysis of mTORC2 core complex, and with SGK1 and WNK1.
mTORC2 core components will be subjected to cryo-EM in the presence and absence of SGK1 and WNK
kinases. Aim 3: Assess the roles of WNK1 and WNK4 and functional interactions with mTORC2 in vivo
using inducible KO models. WNK1 and WNK4 inducible KO mice will be characterized similarly to TRKO in
aim 1A; Na+ and K+ handling, and biochemical features will be investigated."
10782527,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is associated with accelerated neurodegeneration and is a recognized cause of late-life dementia, a type of Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementia (ADRD). Although the driving pathological mechanisms are incompletely understood, preclinical evidence increasingly points to microvascular injury as a key component of TBI neuropathology, indicating that TBI-related Neurodegeneration (TreND) shares important features including a vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) with other ADRDs. While neuroimaging investigations of TBI to date have primarily focused on structural damage to neuronal cell bodies and axons, there remains an unmet need to characterize the evolution of microvascular dysfunction after TBI in humans and establish the role of TBI-related VCID. An improved understanding of how microvascular injury contributes to long-term neurodegeneration holds potential to improve patient outcome prediction and help overcome persistent barriers to the development of effective therapies to ameliorate this disease process. Thus, there is a great need to develop reliable imaging biomarkers of TBI-related VCID to better inform prognosis, classify injury endophenotypes, monitor long-term recovery, and identify treatment targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic microvascular dysfunction as a consequence of TBI represents a type of VCID and links the initial brain injury to subsequent slowly progressive neuronal loss occurring in the ensuing months to years, ultimately contributing to brain atrophy and long-term cognitive decline. To test this hypothesis, we propose a multi-timepoint neuroimaging study to determine the natural history of microvascular dysfunction over the first 3 years post-TBI, in which we will establishing the pattern of longitudinal change in MRI-based measures of microvascular function including cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, and extracellular free water in relation to brain atrophy. We expect that TBI patients will exhibit brain atrophy and microvascular dysfunction in excess of that associated with normal aging, which will be determined by comparison to a longitudinally examined healthy control group. We additionally hypothesize that microvascular imaging measures assessed in the early postinjury period will predict the magnitude of subsequent brain atrophy and cognitive decline during the first 3 years after TBI. Ultimately, this project will yield novel insights into the role of VCID in TBI pathophysiology, a potentially treatable yet understudied endophenotype of TBI."

E. Paige Lloyd, PhD is a social psychologist whose ultimate career goal is to use her expertise in intergroup
relations to investigate the social psychological underpinnings of health disparities and create interventions that
reduce treatment disparities and promote equitable care. The research she proposes titled, “Racial biases in
pain treatment: Tests of pain-care recommendations, treatment biases, and the malleability of race perception
processes” addresses gaps in the literature, offers practical insights, and provides a platform for development.
Research: Pain is a prevalent and consequential health concern. However, pain care is not equally distributed;
for example, White Americans receive more aggressive and guideline-directed pain care than Black
Americans. Although there is consistent evidence of pain care disparities, there is no work integrating models
of race perception or experimentally examining the contribution of these processes to pain care decisions. The
overall objective of this research is to identify and attenuate problematic race-perception processes
contributing to racial biases in pain treatment. To test this objective, Dr. Lloyd will pursue the following Specific
Aims: Aim #1: To investigate the presence and pattern of clinician biases in pain care for White, Black, and
multiracial Black/White hypothetical patients, Aim #2: To examine the extent to which person perception
processes are associated with treatment recommendations for hypothetical Black, White, and Black/White
patients, Aim #3: To empirically test a novel intervention designed to attenuate race perception biases. Three
complementary studies employing vignette, standardized patient, and intervention designs will 1) examine pain
care biases across Black, White, and Black/White multiracial hypothetical patients, 2) the race perception
mechanisms that inform treatment recommendations, and 3) potential solutions to biases in race perception.
Training: The proposed career development plan will build upon Dr. Lloyd’s previous training with three
training goals: 1) expand measurement and statistical expertise to encompass assessment of race
categorization and nonverbal biases, 2) gain expertise in the ethics, theory, and methodologies of health
services research relevant to disparities 3) learn about developing and implementing translational
interventions. Dr. Lloyd and her mentorship team propose specific training activities, didactic and experiential,
that will enable her to gain the skills necessary to complete the proposed research and develop as an
independent scientist. This training will be supported by an experienced and successful multidisciplinary team.
Dr. Lloyd’s institution and department, the University of Denver and the Department of Psychology, are
committed to her success and have provided extensive resources to promote her productivity and training.
This award will provide Dr. Lloyd with the training and pilot data required to seek R01 funding, become a
nationally-recognized independent investigator, and make scientific contributions that promote equitable care."

Health disparities in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) are striking with extremely high rates of
diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases. Documented rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the RMI
range from 20%-50%. This is significantly higher than global (8.5%) and US (11%) rates. The extreme
disparities in the RMI are exacerbated by a lack of research, lack of funding, a lack of services, and a lack of
culturally-appropriate interventions. Residents of the RMI experience unique barriers to self-management of
T2DM, as well as possess unique cultural assets that can be leveraged to help mitigate these barriers. The
research team worked with the Marshallese community in Arkansas to develop and evaluate a culturally-
adapted family model of DSMES (Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES). Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES is based on a
collectivist approach, incorporates Marshallese cultural practices, and uses “talk story” as a conversational,
rhythmic, and culturally preferred way of sharing knowledge. Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES includes family
members as participants and focuses on family motivational interviewing, family goal setting, and family
behavioral change with specific focus on education about supportive and nonsupportive family behaviors. The
curriculum is assets based and it works to overcome barriers facing Marshallese patients by leveraging
culturally specific facilitators of healthy behavior change. Our central hypothesis is that persons who receive
the Family Model DSMES ""Ājjmuurur Baamḷe"" will have improved HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure,
lipids, BMI, increased knowledge, self-efficacy, empowerment, and quality of life, along with decreased
diabetes-related complications and diabetes-related distress. This study's objective is to conduct a cluster RCT
using a wait-list control to evaluate the effectiveness of Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES when delivered in faith-
based organizations (FBOs) by Community Health Workers (CHWs). Our specific aims are: 1. Test the
effectiveness of Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES to improve diabetes-related outcomes among Marshallese patients;
2. Evaluate the effect of Ājjmuurur Baamḷe DSMES on family members; and 3. Conduct an indigenous
evaluation to understand the extent to which the intervention adheres to Pacific Islander cultural values and
evaluate the cultural appropriateness of the research. Data will be collected from patients (Aim 1) and their
family members (Aim 2) at baseline, immediately post-intervention (12 weeks), at four months and twelve
months post-intervention. An indigenous evaluation (Aim 3) will be conducted at six months and each year
thereafter to document and inform process improvement efforts in study implementation. While the
Marshallese are a small population, this population is underrepresented in research, and they are experiencing
a health crisis that must be addressed. The proposed study offers a promising intervention that has the
potential to affect substantially health disparities experienced by Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders in the
USAPI."
10773028,"Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a complex disease affecting many organs including skeletal muscle and
the Central Nervous System (CNS). The majority of mechanistic studies in the DM1 field have been focused on muscle and very little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of CNS dysfunction in DM1. DM1 is caused by the expanded CUG repeats which misregulate RNA-binding proteins of two families, MBNL and CUGBP (CELF). Proteins of both families are expressed in many tissues, including the CNS. CUGBP1 activity is regulated by GSK3-cyclin D3-CDK4 dependent phosphorylation. In DM1, CUG repeats reduce phosphorylation of CUGBP1 at S302 via increase of GSK3 kinase, thereby converting active CUGBP1 into inactive un-pS302-CUGBP1 (termed CUGBP1 repressor or CUGBP1REP) because it blocks translation of mRNAs in Stress Granules. We found that GSK3 is increased in the brains of congenital DM1 (CDM1) mice (DMSXL model). CUGBP1REP is also elevated in the brains of DMSXL mice. The prenatal treatment of DMSXL mice with the inhibitor of GSK3, tideglusib (TG), increases survival rate of underdeveloped DMSXL mice, improves their growth and strength and reduces their anxiety. These findings suggest that the inhibitors of GSK3 are good candidate drugs to reduce CNS defects in CDM1 via correction of GSK3-CUGBP1REP pathway in brain. In support of this hypothesis, recent Phase IIa clinical trial for adult CDM1 showed that TG has beneficial effect on cognitive function in patients with CDM1. Since GSK3 has many substrates in brain, the inhibitors of GSK3 might affect many pathways. This project will determine the contribution of the GSK3-CUGBP1REP pathway in CNS pathogenesis of CDM1 (Aim 1). We will address this question by analysis of DMSXL mice crossed with a new mouse model in which the GSK3-cyclin D3-CDK4 site of CUGBP1 (S302) is mutated (S302A knock in model). The molecular pathways disrupted by the mutant DMPK mRNA in the brains of DMSXL mice will be compared to those disrupted by CUGBP1REP in the brains of S302A mice. We found that the inhibitor of GSK3, TG, reduces the mutant DMPK mRNA in skeletal muscle cell precursors from patients with CDM1, correcting splicing events in myoblasts. To determine if TG has the same function in CNS of CDM1, we will test if TG reduces the mutant DMPK mRNA in the brains of DMSXL mice, normalizing splicing of brain-specific mRNAs (Aim 2). Positive long-term effect of the prenatal treatment of DMSXL mice with TG suggests that early correction of GSK3 in CDM1 is critical for the improved development of CDM1 patients. Aim 3 of the project will test if short postnatal treatments with TG have a long-term positive effect on phenotype of DMSXL mice. The therapeutic effect of TG will be also examined in DMSXL mice, treated at young age and in adulthood. The knowledge generated is critical for the development of the GSK3 based therapies of CNS dysfunction in CDM1."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor, and its prognosis has no significantly improved in
the past two decades. It is urgent to identify effective strategies to treat GBM, but our only partial understanding
of GBM biology significantly hinders this progress. Our laboratory has long focused on understanding GBM
biology and recently demonstrated that GBM reprograms lipid metabolism to support its rapid growth. We
identified that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a master transcription factor regulating
lipid synthesis, is highly activated in GBM and is essential for tumor growth. However, the molecular
mechanism activating SREBP-1 and lipogenesis in cancer cells remains unclear. Moreover, whether the
highly activated SREBP-1 plays new roles in malignancy is unknown. In normal cells, SREBP activation is
strongly repressed by Insulin-induced gene (Insig), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein. It binds to
the SREBP transporter, SREBP-cleavage protein (SCAP), preventing SREBP ER-to-Golgi translocation and
subsequent activation. Thus, the first key step for SREBP-1 activation is SCAP dissociation from Insig. How
cancer cells are able to release the tight repression of Insig on SCAP to promote high levels of SREBP-
1 activation remains unanswered. We recently found that glucose-mediated N-glycosylation stabilizes SCAP.
Interestingly, our new preliminary data showed that in the absence of glutamine, SREBP-1 failed to be cleaved,
although SCAP remained glycosylated. Inhibiting glutamine conversion to glutamate and ammonia by
suppressing glutaminase (GLS) markedly reduced SREBP-1 cleavage. These data strongly suggest that
glutamine plays a critical role in SREBP-1 activation. Interestingly, expressing the active N-terminal form of
SREBP-1 in GBM cells significantly enhanced glutamine uptake. Analysis of GBM patient samples showed that
the glutamine transporter, SLC1A5, is highly expressed in tumor tissues and is inversely correlated with patient
survival. Promoter analysis showed multiple putative SREBP-1 binding sites in the SLC1A5 promoter region.
Based on these new preliminary data and our published studies, we hypothesize that SCAP dissociation from
Insig is activated by glutamine-derived metabolites, leading to SREBP-1 activation; in turn, activated
SREBP-1 transcriptionally upregulate the expression of SLC1A5, resulting in a feedforward loop to
increase glutamine uptake and lipid synthesis to promote GBM growth. In this study, we will identify the
molecular mechanism activating SREBP-1 and lipogenesis by glutamine in GBM in Aim 1, and reveal the new
role of SREBP-1 in regulating glutamine metabolism in Aim 2. We will further examine whether combining
inhibition of SREBP-1 together with SLC1A5 or GLS suppression provides strong synergy to inhibit GBM growth
(Aim 2). Completion of this study will significantly advance our understanding of GBM biology and metabolism
rewiring, and provide promising approaches for GBM therapy."

Medicaid covers the majority of individuals who need opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and
disproportionately covers minoritized populations and those with socioeconomic risk factors. Improving OUD
treatment quality in Medicaid thus can reach large numbers and inform efforts to redress inequities in care.
State Medicaid programs have changed policy to expand the continuum of care, remove barriers to treatment,
and improve the quality of OUD care. However, states have taken these actions amidst OUD quality
measurement systems that are underdeveloped limiting opportunities for targeted intervention and robust
evaluation of policy effects. Current OUD quality measures are limited in three key ways. First, OUD quality
measures are seldom constructed at the provider-level, despite the fact that clinicians, practices, and facilities
are the most likely locus of intervention for quality improvement programs. Second, few measures incorporate
OUD patient-reported outcomes or experiences of care. Third, quality measures are typically not reported by
population sub-group and thus fail to identify inequities in treatment based on race and ethnicity amenable to
policy and programmatic changes.
The Medicaid Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN) has supported Medicaid agency efforts to
improve OUD treatment by developing novel measures of treatment quality and examining effects of treatment
quality on overdose. MODRN will develop Equity and QUality Improvement for Medicaid Programs
(EQUIP) and draw on our robust university-state partnerships in 12 states accounting for 24% of the US
Medicaid population. Our overarching goal is to develop OUD quality measures that can be constructed at the
provider-level, incorporate patient experience, and center health equity. Efficient and sustainable OUD quality
measures developed and implemented by MODRN-EQUIP will guide quality improvement initiatives and
Medicaid policy decisions. Our goal will be achieved through three integrated research projects aiming to: 1)
develop provider-level OUD quality measures using Medicaid administrative data; 2) measure OUD patient-
reported outcomes and examine associations with claims-based quality measures to guide quality and equity
improvement, and 3) implement and examine the effectiveness of a practice-level quality improvement

The combined economic and personal effects of children’s neurodevelopmental problems, such as conduct
disorder, ADHD, and depression and anxiety symptoms are substantial. At the same time, there is growing
evidence that dimensions of positive health can support children in leading meaningful, productive lives. In the
current proposal we address knowledge gaps related to the timing of psychosocial environmental exposures
and when their effects on child neurodevelopment and positive health emerge, and at what ages children’s risk
factors and assets are most potent in affecting developmental trajectories. We also propose to examine the
transition to adolescence. Adolescence can be a turning point in child development given rapid changes in the
brain, emotional, and social system, yet longitudinal studies from infancy to adolescence with large cohorts of
children from diverse backgrounds are sorely lacking. Last, children’s neurodevelopment and positive health
are rarely examined in concert, leading to incomplete assessments of children’s mental health at all phases of
development. This application seeks to fill some of these knowledge gaps through participation in the
Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort Study Sites for Pediatric Follow Up
Program. In this application, we propose to follow an existing sample of 1,000 children from the Early Growth
and Development Study (EGDS) cohort who are enrolled as Level 2 participants in the ECHO Program and
have ECHO Cohort Protocol data elements beginning in the prenatal period. EGDS is a nationwide sample of
children living with either their adoptive or biological parent(s). Children will be age 7 – 20 years old and
assessed annually using the ECHO Cohort Protocol in the proposed study. We have been highly successful in
achieving our planned recruitment and enrollment rates, collecting and sharing data with the ECHO Program,
and contributing to ECHO-wide science and manuscripts in the current ECHO funding cycle. We will build on
our successes and infrastructure to contribute to ECHO’s goals through leading collaborative ECHO Cohort
science, with a dual focus on ECHO Cohort Protocol core data elements and on two specialized child outcome
areas: Neurodevelopment and Child Positive Health. Through three specific aims, we will: (1) leverage ECHO
Cohort Protocol core data elements to examine the immediate and latent impact of early exposures on child
health outcomes across different developmental periods in diverse contexts; (2) leverage data from specialized
outcomes to test predictors of change in neurodevelopment and positive health in adolescence; and, (3)
implement data-driven check points every quarter to assess our retention of existing cohort participants, with
an emphasis on diversity and implementation of the protocol with high fidelity. Our overall goal is to work
collaboratively with the ECHO Program to advance the understanding of predictors and outcomes of child
health in order to inform programs, practices, and policies that will improve the health of children for
generations to come."
10745908,"The proposed research will conduct the first ever dose-determination trial of a behavioral intervention to
improve engagement in HIV care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV viral suppression. The
trial is designed to inform the implementation of behavioral interventions, including several in CDC’s
Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions. Behavioral counseling has the flexibility and reach to
overcome numerous challenges to HIV care, including social, emotional, and structural barriers. However,
basic questions of how to best implement and scale-up interventions remain unanswered, such as “how much
intervention is needed to achieve HIV suppression in subgroups of patients facing individual and social
challenges?” There are currently no dose-determination trials in the HIV behavioral intervention
literature to guide implementation decisions and health service policy. In the proposed research we
specifically aim to: (a) determine the minimum effective dose of an evidence-based HIV treatment
engagement and adherence intervention, (b) identify subgroups of patients requiring greater and fewer
intervention resources to achieve and sustain viral suppression, and (c) the costs associated with
intervention dose-response. Participants who are receiving ART and confirmed HIV unsuppressed (>200
copies/mL) will be randomized to either: (a) the dose determination condition of weekly evidence-based
behavioral self-regulation counseling until achieving HIV suppression (<200 copies/mL), or (b) fixed dose
5-weekly sessions of evidence-based behavioral self-regulation counseling sessions. The dose
determination condition adjusts to patient needs and determines the dose to achieve HIV suppression, in
contrast to the fixed dose condition that does not adjust to patient response. The trial is therefore designed
to determine the number of behavioral counseling intervention sessions needed to achieve and sustain
HIV suppression. Once viral suppressed, counseling in the dose-determination condition is suspended. In
contrast, the fixed-dose condition is delivered in five prescribed sessions as disseminated by the CDC.
Follow-up assessments commence for 12-months from baseline with the primary endpoint of 12-month
blood plasma HIV viral load and secondary outcome of ART adherence. Response to counseling is
defined by achieving viral suppression (<200 copies/mL) and non-response is defined by not achieving
viral suppression (>200 copies/mL). Participants in both the dose-determination and fixed-session
conditions who initially respond and rebound to unsuppressed viral load will receive additional counseling
with redose-response monitored and analyzed. Longitudinal analyses will examine intervention dose for
key patient subgroups and dose-response cost-effectiveness analyses to guide resource allocation and
implementation decisions. This research is aimed at informing health policy makers and programmatic
decisions regarding intervention implementation to increase the likelihood of sustained HIV suppression."

Wheezing during preschool years is a common occurrence [1] causing significant healthcare burden [2] with
frequent unscheduled physician visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, and treatment with inhaled and systemic
corticosteroids along with other medications. Recurrent wheezing is often the antecedent to asthma, one of the
most common chronic diseases of childhood. Though there is evidence of significant neurocognitive problems
in children with other chronic health conditions such as oncological diseases, diabetes, heart disease, sickle cell,
and traumatic brain injury [3], the impact of recurrent wheezing illnesses and associated treatment on the
neurocognitive and emotional development of infants and preschool children has not been fully
characterized. The ECHO cohort study has been collecting neurodevelopmental measures in children after the
late preschool years; however, critical neurodevelopmental trajectories occur in early infancy [4]. Data suggest
that these trajectories can be affected by pre-natal conditions, socioeconomic status, stress, disease severity,
and/or medication use. A recent study, in non-asthmatic patients, showed that the use of systemic
corticosteroids, a frequently administered treatment for wheezing illnesses, was associated with changes in brain
structure [5]. Building on these findings, our overarching study objective is to understand the association
of recurrent wheezing illnesses and its associated treatment on the neurocognitive and emotional
development of infants and preschool children."

We propose a multicenter open-label, single-arm type I hybrid trial to assess the effectiveness of hydroxyurea
therapy for primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in Nigeria. Our team just
completed a double-blind, parallel-group phase III randomized controlled trial (SPRING), where we compared
low-dose to moderate-dose hydroxyurea for primary stroke prevention in children with SCA and abnormal
transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities (>200 cm/sec). Children with abnormal TCD velocities have a high stroke
risk of approximately 10.7 events per 100 person-years (observation arm in the STOP trial). In the low- (n=109)
and moderate-dose (n=111) hydroxyurea groups, the stroke incidence rates were 1.2 and 1.9 per 100 person-
years, respectively, p=0.77 (combined incidence rate 1.5 per 100 person-year). Despite equal efficacy for
stroke prevention in both treatment groups, moderate- when compared to low-dose hydroxyurea, was more
effective in preventing severe acute pain and all-cause hospitalizations. Our findings supported the American
Society of Hematology's evidence-based guidelines for hydroxyurea therapy for primary stroke prevention in
low-income settings. Our hypothesis to be tested: in a multicenter single-arm type I hybrid trial, for children with
abnormal TCD velocities treated with hydroxyurea, the stroke incidence rate will be non-inferior to the SPRING
trial results, with an upper non-inferiority margin of 4 strokes per 100-person-years. The point estimate method
was used to determine the non-inferiority margin based on the Nigerian pediatrician's judgment of what
maximum stroke rate would be clinically meaningful to demonstrate the effectiveness and justify treatment for
the high-risk stroke group. A non-inferiority test with an overall sample size of 220 participants will achieve 91%
power at a 0.050 significance level to detect non-inferiority when the expected proportion of strokes is 0.035, a
minimum follow-up period of 2.5 years and a loss to follow-up of 10% per year. Participants will be followed as
per standard care, including clinic visits every 3 months and complete blood cell counts every 6 months. We
will conduct the following aims:1) Determine the incidence of the first stroke and TIA in children with abnormal
TCD velocities treated with hydroxyurea for 2.5 years in the type 1 hybrid trial; 2) Evaluate the implementation
and sustainability of the intervention within the extended RE-AIM framework; 3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness
of low- compared to a higher dose of hydroxyurea for primary stroke prevention in children with abnormal TCD
velocities. Capacity building for the three Nigerian Multiple Principal Investigators, the statisticians, and nurses
will be focused on three areas- a) developing a Nigerian data coordinating center and the required skills to
support a clinical trial; b) developing a regional TCD course for nurses, enhancing task shifting and reach, and
c) performing cost-effective analysis for the type I hybrid trial comparing low-and moderate dose hydroxyurea."
10911290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is the greatest risk factor for cancer, but it is not known which age-dependent cellular and molecular events
drive cancer initiation. Spatial transcriptomic approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of cancer
initiation, progression, and drug resistance by revealing expression patterns with tissue morphological context.
However, these approaches have not yet been applied to the interdisciplinary biology of aging-driven cancers,
despite the likelihood that intratissue and microenvironmental evolution mediate the aging phenotype. Moreover,
the majority of current single cell spatial projects are based on 3' short read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and
therefore lack the ability to detect full-length spliced isoforms, which are frequently observed in tumors and are
known to impact tumor initiation and treatment response. Work from us and others has revealed widespread
alterations in alternative RNA splicing in human tumors, including in breast cancer, and that half of all spliced
isoforms detected in human breast tumors using long-read sequencing (LR-seq) are missed by RNA-seq and
absent from reference transcriptomes. In addition, we have causally linked the upregulation of specific splicing
factors with breast tumor initiation both in vitro and in vivo and identified age-dependent changes in spliced
isoforms in cancer-associated genes in mammary epithelial cells. Together, these results suggest that alternative
splicing is a critical mechanism underlying tumor initiation with age, and that spatial LR-seq approaches are
required to resolve these mechanisms. However, standardized approaches and resources to measure, quantify,
and visualize expression of full-length isoforms within tissues are lacking. This gap in infrastructure impedes the
field's ability to identify cell populations that express age-dependent isoforms, how such isoforms impact cancer
initiation for example through changes in receptor-ligand interactions. To address these infrastructure and
knowledge gaps, we will first develop approaches to map and analyze full-length RNA isoforms spatially
within tissue sections (R21 phase, Aim 1). These tools, which merge LR-seq and spatial transcriptomics, will
be applicable across sample types and will therefore be of broad, sustainable utility to the research community.
We will then apply these technologies to generate a spatial map of full-length RNA isoforms in healthy
breast tissues and tumors during aging (R33 phase, Aims 2 and 3). Finally, we will develop data sharing
and visualization tools for spatial isoform expression to enable others to mine our data via a web resource
(R33 phase, Aim 4). To achieve these goals, this project will leverage the complementary and interdisciplinary
expertise of the Anczukow lab in alternative splicing and breast cancer, and of the Chuang lab in systems biology
and spatial transcriptomics analysis. In response to NOT-CA-22-002, Notice of NCI's Participation in PAR-20-
070, this project will deliver a spatial transcriptomic infrastructure for isoform profiling and a critical
interdisciplinary data resource for aging and cancer researchers to understand the role of splicing in tissue aging
and oncogenesis, thereby advancing approaches for cancer early detection, intervention, and prevention."
10744213,"Abstract
 Nearly 600,000 adults suffer from cardiac arrest in the United States each year, with the majority of events
occurring suddenly in an out-of-hospital setting in seemingly healthy individuals. Although advances in basic and
advanced life support have increased the likelihood of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),
nearly 70% of patients that are admitted to the hospital following resuscitation from cardiac arrest will die before
hospital discharge. The high morbidity and mortality rate of patients who initially achieve ROSC has been
attributed primarily to systemic, multi-organ injury that accompanies prolonged whole-body ischemia and
reperfusion, a pathophysiological condition referred to as “post-cardiac arrest syndrome”. Although activation of
the innate immune system is recognized to be an important component of this syndrome, the mechanisms by
which the resulting inflammatory response contributes to post-resuscitation tissue injury remain poorly
understood. Unfortunately, this knowledge gap has hindered the development of effective treatment strategies
to provide multi-organ protection in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome.
 The studies proposed in the present application aim to address this problem by testing the central hypothesis
that rapid leukocytosis and macrophage expansion are integral components of the systemic post-ROSC
inflammatory response that exacerbate multi-organ injury following resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
Using a highly translational porcine model of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, a combination of surgical and
pharmacological approaches will be employed to identify the mechanistic role of splenic leukocyte release in
post-ROSC inflammation and injury (Aim 1), determine whether this process is amplified by epinephrine-
mediated stimulation of ß2-adrenergic receptors during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (Aim 2), and evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of a targeted approach to attenuate CCR2-dependent leukocyte infiltration in post-cardiac
arrest syndrome (Aim 3). An integrated research approach to address these aims has been developed by a
multi-disciplinary investigative team with expertise in cardiovascular physiology, large animal models of heart
disease, leukocyte biology, immunology, and neuroprotective therapies. Collectively, completion of the proposed
studies is expected to significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of innate immune system-mediated
injury following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and identify novel therapeutic interventions that mitigate multi-
organ damage by attenuating the post-resuscitation inflammatory response, ultimately facilitating the
development of novel strategies to improve the unacceptably low survival rate of patients with post-cardiac arrest
syndrome."

Our studies integrate fundamental biochemical and biophysical basis of Ca2+ channel activity with
animal models of human diseases. We seek an understanding of how native channels are
constructed, activated and regulated, how they control important functions in physiological
systems and how their altered function drives disease. We are focused on the Ca2+ signaling
proteins, ORAI, STIM, MCU and NCLX. ORAI channels are encoded by three separate genes
(Orai1-3) and activated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensing proteins STIM (STIM1-
2). ORAI represent a family of highly Ca2+ selective channels in the plasma membrane (PM) of
virtually all cells. The founding member of this family, ORAI1 physically interacts with STIM1 in
ER-PM junctions, to mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE is critical in controlling
many physiological functions including secretion, migration and proliferation in virtually all cell
types. However, the physiological roles of ORAI2, ORAI3 and the mammalian-specific
translational variant of ORAI1 called ORAI1α remain poorly understood. ORAI-mediated Ca2+
signals propagate into mitochondria to regulate both bioenergetics, biogenesis and apoptosis.
Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is decoded within the mitochondrial matrix, effectively coupling PM
receptor activation to metabolic activity. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and extrusion are mediated by
the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), respectively. The
mechanisms of reciprocal regulation between MCU/NCLX and STIM/ORAI and the convergence
of these mechanisms in the control of metabolism, obesity and vascular disease are unknown.
Results from our animal models and our compelling in vivo and in vitro data support specific roles
for these Ca2+ signaling molecules at the ER-PM-mitochondria nexus, where they regulate cell
signaling and metabolism of critical importance in endothelial dysfunction, obesity, hypertension
and vascular remodeling. Our studies are aimed at understanding: 1) The fundamental
mechanisms of organization, activation and regulation of these Ca2+ channels and their
mechanisms of communication; and 2) The role of these Ca2+ signaling proteins in
patho/physiology of vascular and metabolic disease. Our studies will provide novel insights into
the precise role of these molecules in metabolic and signaling pathways controlling physiology
and pathophysiology and will lead to novel avenues for disease therapy."

We propose a better way to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) early and save lives. More than 900,000 people in the
United States suffer from acute PE, and about 100,000 die each year. With 10% of such cases being fatal within the first
hour of the onset of symptoms, rapid diagnosis of PE is critical to direct appropriate therapy. Unfortunately, clinical
evaluation alone is unreliable and often results in grave diagnostic delays. Furthermore, while echocardiography at the
patient’s bedside can rapidly detect heart dysfunction caused by PE, traditional echocardiography performed by
cardiology services is not readily available in acute care settings. Thus, there is a critical need for use of a rapid, non-
invasive diagnostic tool at the point-of-care (POC) to accurately assess for PE and direct emergency therapy. The focus of
this research is to develop innovative artificial intelligence algorithms that can transform the care of patients with PE by
enabling non-experts to use echocardiography to detect PE, direct emergency therapy, and improve survival. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that the proposed artificial intelligence technology tools will provide a relatively
simple and time-efficient strategy that can be implemented in most healthcare settings. This will, in turn, fulfill the overall
goal of creating a positive shift in the management of patients presenting with PE. The proposed specialized artificial
intelligence technology would ultimately be applicable to early detection of a wide variety of diseases. The long-term
goal of our research is to develop and implement effective automated ultrasound tools that would significantly impact the
diagnosis and treatment of different life-threatening conditions. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a
prototype mobile artificial intelligence enabled-software platform that can accurately detect echocardiographic signs of
PE. The hypothesis is that artificial intelligence algorithms will achieve levels of diagnostic accuracy equivalent to expert
physician sonographers in detecting PE. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop a
machine learning algorithm for the detection of PE that can be extended to detect other cardiopulmonary conditions using
explicit echocardiographic signs of PE and implicit image content representations. 2) Validate the accuracy of the
machine learning algorithm to detect PE on echocardiographic images using explicit sonographic signs. Innovative
reinforcement learning techniques will be utilized to accomplish the specific aims. The proposed research is significant
because it will transform the care of patients with PE by enabling non-experts to use POC echocardiography. It will also
have an immediate, positive impact because it will help lower morbidity, mortality, improve quality of life, and decrease
healthcare costs by expediting diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. The proximate expected outcome of this work is
improvement in the evaluation of patients with life-threatening PE by inexperienced healthcare providers, which will
result in more accurate and rapid identification of cases that require emergency treatment. Our proposal aligns with the
NIBIB’s overall mission to advance healthcare through innovative engineering and, more specifically, its emphasis on
development of transformative unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning technologies to enhance analysis of
complex medical images and data for diagnosing and treating a wide range of diseases and health conditions."

Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and no clinically detectable metastases are treated by
surgery. However, >70% of such patients later develop metastases, most frequently in the liver. This is strong
evidence that metastases can originate from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs). While most DCCs are eliminated
by the immune system, a few DCCs escape immune surveillance by undergoing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Such
non-proliferating DCCs can later proliferate and form lethal metastasis. What drives the dormant DCCs to prolif-
erate, escape immune surveillance, and establish metastases are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of
appropriate models. Here, we have established a novel PDAC mouse model of dormant DCCs in the liver, using
an immunization protocol followed by intrasplenic injection of PDAC cells, we found that most DCCs were elim-
inated in such “immunized” mice, but a few survived as single, non-proliferating DDCs and stayed dormant for
months. In the F99 phase, we will use this dormant PDAC mouse model to examine what could drive DCC
proliferation and how immune cells regulate metastasis. Patients with PDAC have 2-fold higher glucocorticoids
(GCs), an immunomodulatory stress hormone, than healthy adults. Mimicking this clinical phenomenon, we
treated DCC-hosting mice with GCs, achieving a 2-fold increase of GC in mice, we found that DCCs began to
proliferate. In addition, the tumor microenvironment (TME) changed upon GCs treatment: numbers of neutrophils
increased while T cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased. GCs treatment did not cause metastasis, and T
cell depletion caused only a few metastases in a small fraction of mice. However, when GCs treatment was
combined with T cell depletion, multiple metastases were observed in all mice examined. As proposed, we will
define and target the signals that trigger DCC proliferation and elucidate the mechanisms of GCs on T cells and
NK cells suppression. In the K00 phase, I plan to investigate immune-fibroblast crosstalk that regulate cancer
dormancy in the context of aging. Advanced aging is the most important risk factor for cancer overall and for
specific metastatic cancer types including PDAC. Aging changes the TME significantly, including immune cells
distributions and effector functions, fibroblasts activities, ECM, and secreted factors. However, how these
changes are relevant to the metastasis relapse from DCCs is unknown. My postdoctoral research interest is to
study aging-induced changes in immune cells and fibroblasts, with a focus on the immune-fibroblast crosstalk,
and their sequential influences on dormant DCCs. Eventually, I plan to become an independent investigator,
lead a research team to study cancer dormancy and TME, and generate knowledge to facilitate development of
target therapies that prevent metastasis and improve survival."

 Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in the U.S. continue to experience a vastly inequitable HIV
burden, particularly in Southern Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) jurisdictions. To combat this
alarming trend, there is a need for innovative, accessible, and community-developed interventions to promote
HIV health among BMSM in these areas. Given research that daily and multilevel intersectional stigma
contributes to HIV inequities among BMSM, a multicomponent intervention that addresses multilevel barriers to
HIV health and combats intersectional stigma is essential. In collaboration with THRIVE SS, a leading BMSM-
led community-based organization serving BMSM living with HIV in the Atlanta area, we developed
THRIVE365, an evidence-based multicomponent HIV intervention that provides individual-level health
education and motivation, builds social support among BMSM, facilitates access to culturally-affirmative
healthcare, and combats barriers to housing and economic empowerment in line with the Information-
Motivation-Behavioral skills, social capital, and socioecological models of health. Pilot evidence indicates
THRIVE365 is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in promoting daily antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence
and reducing daily depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties among BMSM
living with HIV. THRIVE365 is ready for a full-scale evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework that includes a
robust examination of its effectiveness for HIV-related behavioral and psychological outcomes, its moderation
effects on intersectional stigma, and its maintenance and reach over time. We will do so with a fully-powered
hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness trial using daily diary methods, self-report follow-ups over 6
months, and paradata to examine daily and longer-term intervention engagement, effects, and adaptations.
The overarching aims of this research are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of THRIVE365 in improving daily and
longer-term HIV-related behavioral health (primary outcome: ART adherence) and psychological health (e.g.,
secondary outcomes: lower depressive and anxiety symptoms) in a 6-month waitlist randomized controlled trial
with 350 BMSM living with HIV in the four Atlanta-area EHE jurisdictions; 2) Examine the moderating effect of
THRIVE365 on associations between intersectional stigma and our primary and secondary HIV outcomes; 3)
Evaluate THRIVE365 maintenance and reach at the user-level (e.g., within-user changes in engagement and
daily effects) and setting-level (e.g., intervention adaptations, BMSM community uptake). Together, these
results will establish the effectiveness of THRIVE365, a community-led, multicomponent intervention, for
improving HIV-related behavioral and psychological health among BMSM living with HIV in four of the EHE
jurisdictions with the greatest HIV burden. THRIVE365 was designed for implementation and is poised to offer
a model for effective HIV care among BMSM in high-stigma, low-resource areas of the U.S. South and beyond."

early engagement of post-graduate surgical trainees and pre-graduate engineering doctoral students will help
accelerate development of technology and solutions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiovascular diseases. Research topics will include cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, peripheral
vascular (arterial/venous) disease, aortic aneurysmal disease, and neurovascular disease. With a highly

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer defined by a poor overall
prognosis, aggressive and early pattern of metastases, and a lack of treatments that lead to sustained disease
control. There is a critical need for molecular targeted treatments for patients with TNBC that are more effective,
have reduced side effects, and decrease the mortality associated with TNBC. Mucin-1 (MUC1) is overexpressed
and underglycosylated in 94% of TNBC and the receptor density is extremely high. The combination of the
modification of the glycosylation and overexpression allow tumor associated MUC1 distinguishable and
targetable from normal tissue. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a molecular targeted treatment that
specifically uses radiolabeled moieties as biological targeting vectors intended to deliver localized cytotoxic
radiation to cancer cells that overexpress specific receptors, without harming normal cells. We propose to
combine the suitability of MUC1 as a therapeutic target in TNBC with the promising technique of TRT to develop
a novel theranostic peptide for diagnostic imaging and TRT of TNBC.
The aims of this proposal are to develop MUC1 targeted peptides that can successfully be applied for TRT,
exhibiting properties suitable for clinical translation. The advantages of peptides over previously studied antibody
radioisotope complexes include the superior pharmacokinetics, low immunogenicity, and ease of synthesis for
widespread application. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanism and specificity of peptide binding, optimize
the incorporation of a metal chelator through various spacer moieties, and employ different cyclization strategies
to improve peptide affinity and stability. In Aim 2 we will radiolabel three peptide sequences with promising
binding affinities with gallium-68 and lutetium-177. We will complete a comprehensive analysis of binding and
internalization in TNBC cells, and determine in vivo tumor targeting properties and biodsitribution in mouse
models of TNBC. In Aim 3, we will advance the most promising peptide sequence, identified through quantitative
metrics, to therapeutic studies and determine the ability of MUC1 TRT to treat TNBC in mouse models. We will
additionally complete a preliminary safety assessment. Through these studies we will also understand any issues
related to proceeding with clinical translation of the MUC1 theranostic peptide for application in TNBC.
Given the morbidity and mortality associated with TNBC and the critical need for targeted treatments, this MUC1
TRT will have high impact for the treatment and management of TNBC. We will provide proof of concept that
MUC1 is a valid therapeutic target and that TRT can effectively treat TNBC. We intend for our results to lay the
foundation for subsequent development of randomized, controlled clinical trials that test this promising treatment
in patients with TNBC. If successful, this will be a significant step forward for reducing the mortality associated
with TNBC."
10767631,"Summary: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important but extremely understudied human pathogen, causing acute and chronic
hepatitis E, high mortality during pregnancy, neurological sequelae, and foodborne hepatitis. According to WHO, estimated
20 million HEV infections occur each year, leading to >3.3 million cases and >44,000 deaths annually. HEV infection is
associated with numerous extrahepatic manifestations including a range of neurological sequelae, which is associated with
HEV-3 (mainly) and HEV-4 (lesser extent) infection and occur in ~5.5% of HEV-infected patients. HEV-associated
neurological sequelae is an emerging clinical problem, but the underlying mechanism(s) of HEV-associated extrahepatic
pathogenesis is unknown. In preliminary studies, we showed that HEV infects cells in the neurovascular unit (NVU)
including brain microvascular endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocyte, and that HEV causes pathological lesions in CNS
in infected pigs with significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and TNF-ɑ in pigs with detectable HEV
RNA in brains than in pigs with no detectable HEV RNA in brains. Our pilot study showed that gerbils are highly susceptible
to infection by HEV-1, HEV-3 and HEV-4. Our long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms of HEV-associated
extrahepatic pathogenesis. In aim 1, we hypothesize that HEV induces extrahepatic neurological injuries via induction of
pyroptosis by infecting NVU cells to release proinflammatory cytokines leading to neuroinflammation and neurological
injuries. We aim to: (1) determine the effect of HEV-3-induced pyroptosis in NVU cells; (2) identify the mechanisms of
HEV-induced pyroptosis in NVU cells particularly via caspase 1-mediated canonical pathway; (3) identify HEV-specific
pyroptosis-associated proinflammatory cytokines in NVU cells; (4) determine whether HEV-induced pyroptosis in NVU
cells is HEV genotype-specific. We anticipate that HEV induces pyroptosis in microglia, astrocyte, and neuronal cells; that
HEV induces pyroptosis through caspase 1-mediated canonical pathway to produce proinflammatory cytokines to cause
acute cell death; that only HEV-3/HEV-4, but not HEV-1, induce pyroptosis in NVU cells. In aim 2, we hypothesize that
HEV induces neurological sequelae through injuries of neural cells via induction of pyroptosis in brain and spinal cord
tissues. We aim to: (1) infect gerbils with HEV-1, HEV-3 and HEV-4, respectively, to delineate the mechanism of
neuroinflammation and neurological injuries attributable to each HEV genotype; (2) define HEV-specific neurological
lesions in CNS and correlate neurological lesions with hepatic lesions; (3) identify the mechanism(s) of HEV-induced
pyroptosis via the caspase-1–mediated pyroptosis in brain by using a caspase 1 inhibitor (VX-765) in HEV-infected gerbils.
We expect that we will identify HEV-specific neuroinflammation and neurological lesions and types of neural cells involved
in pyroptosis, that HEV-induced neurological lesions in brain occur mainly in HEV-3/HEV-4, but not in HEV-1, infected
gerbils, that HEV induces pyroptosis in brains via the caspase 1-mediated canonical pathway which will involve in activation
of inflammasome to release proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-ɑ, and that treatment of HEV-infected
gerbils with caspase 1 inhibitor VX-765 will reduce the amounts of neuroinflammation and lesions in CNS tissues compared
to controls. The information will inform potential therapeutic targets of HEV-related neurological sequelae."

There is an unmet need for innovative molecular tools that can assist in the clinical management of high-grade
serous ovarian cancer, given that more than 220,000 women in the U.S. are living with ovarian cancer and are
at risk of recurrence. Improving the performance of validated biomarkers by reinventing their detection strategy
is a compelling and underused approach to meet this need. The serum marker CA125 plays a crucial role in
the clinical management of ovarian cancer, but, despite its importance, it remains poorly understood. The iden-
tity and location of the CA125 epitopes—detected in the clinical test—are not known. In other words, the test
that underlies vital decisions in ovarian cancer care employs a mechanism that is not understood. Prior re-
search has located the CA125 epitopes somewhere within the tandem-repeat domain of a mucin (MUC16) that
contains 19 similar but non-identical subdomains. Glycan modifications, alternative splicing of mRNA, and pro-
teolytic cleavage generate many MUC16 proteoforms. Only a subset of these proteoforms contain detectable
CA125 epitopes, whereas, in others, the epitope is masked or eliminated. As a result, only a subset of the total
pool of MUC16 molecules is detectable by the serum CA125 assay. This undercounting has potentially serious
clinical implications, including mistaken decisions about whether a patient should be treated by a gynecologic
oncologist or failure to detect early evidence of possibly treatable cancer recurrence. Without knowledge of the
CA125 epitopes, it is impossible to characterize individual variation in MUC16 proteoforms or to determine
whether MUC16 expression changes during cancer development, in response to treatment, or during recur-
rence. Importantly, serum CA125 levels in Black women have been shown to be lower than levels in white
women, but the molecular-level reasons for these racial/ethnic differences in serum CA125 are unknown. The
tests and algorithms currently in use employ a single CA125 cut-off value and do not consider racial/ethnic dif-
ference, which may result in higher rates of false negative diagnoses among Black patients. To improve the
long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients of all backgrounds, there is a vital need to improve the diagnostic
value of CA125. The central hypothesis that will be tested is that CA125 epitopes are unevenly distributed over
tandem-repeat domains of MUC16, are unaffected by glycosylation, and display differences in abundance de-
pending on the cell type that expressed the MUC16. We will pursue two specific aims: (1) Map the locations
of OC125 and M11 binding on individual tandem repeats of MUC16, and (2) Characterize the binding of
OC125 and M11 to intact MUC16 from diverse sources. Successful completion of this research will identify
the CA125 epitopes on MUC16 at the amino-acid level. This accomplishment will represent an unprecedented
level of understanding of the CA125 test. This contribution will reveal regions of MUC16 that can be more ef-
fectively detected with novel affinity reagents or non-affinity-based approaches, such as mass spectrometry. It
may also contribute to explaining the origin of racial/ethnic differences in serum CA125 levels."

Nrf1/2 (human) and SKN-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog) are key infection-related transcription factors
whose regulation is incompletely understood, representing a critical gap in knowledge. The long-term goal of this
research is to understand how the host alleviates stress during exposure to pathogens. The objective of this
application is to elucidate new mechanisms of SKN-1 regulation that contribute to its protective effects. The
central hypothesis is that NIPI-3 and CDC-48.1/2 are amongst previously unknown factors that positively regulate
SKN-1 to protect against immune associated stress. The rationale for this investigation is that the identification
of new regulators which control a conserved stress response under pathogenic conditions may allow for their
therapeutic modulation to alleviate infection induced pathology. The central hypothesis will be addressed by the
following aims. Specific Aim #1 will identify how NIPI-3 regulates SKN-1 activity. The working hypothesis,
based on preliminary and published data, is that NIPI-3 regulates SKN-1 activity in the intestine via CEBP-1.
Specifically, NIPI-3 is proposed to negatively regulate CEBP-1, to directly influence the amount and/or activity of
SKN-1 available to carry out its protective transcriptional response. Specific Aim #2 will elucidate the role of
CDC-48.1/2 in influencing SKN-1 activity. CDC-48.1/2 is hypothesized to elicit its effects on SKN-1 by its role
in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Specifically, it is proposed that CDC-48.1/2 shuttles SKN-
1A, the ER-tethered form of SKN-1, to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, a process necessary for its
activation. However, CDC-48.1/2 is additionally predicted to ensure the proper trafficking of BLI-3, a NADPH
oxidase necessary for activating cytoplasmic SKN-1. Specific Aim #3 will identify additional factors that
regulate SKN-1 activity and pathogen resistance. In addition to CDC-48.1/2 and NIPI-3, other factors of in-
terest were found, including two that only affect SKN-1 activity on pathogen. In this aim, the screen will be com-
pleted and additional factors will be characterized. The approach is postulated to reveal further insights into the
mechanisms of SKN-1 regulation. Because SKN-1 and human Nrf orthologs protect against infection-related
stress, the research will have a significant impact on the understanding of the cytoprotective responses that
occur during the immune response. Knowledge of the targets and mechanisms that drive anti-inflammatory re-
sponses may allow for their eventual pharmacological targeting for the benefit of those suffering from damaging
immune responses. The proposed research is innovative because it identifies SKN-1 regulators under infectious
conditions, representing a substantive departure from previous studies."

10769861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder cancer represents a common malignancy worldwide. The main cause of death in bladder cancer
patients is metastasis, with lymphatic metastasis as the primary means. Metastatic bladder cancer is currently
difficult to remove completely, and not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Better understanding and
exploitation of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer is urgently
needed. The study of gene fusions has founded the theoretical backgrounds for many cancer diagnosis and
therapeutics. However, even with whole genome sequencing, novel recurrent gene fusions are rarely identified
in bladder cancer. Recently, our work on RNA trans-splicing and intergenic cis-splicing have helped open a
new paradigm for intergenic splicing processes that generate chimeric RNAs with pro-tumorigenic activities,
and may explain the molecular basis of the presence of driver onco-fusion products in the absence of
chromosomal rearrangement at the DNA level. Indeed, in our preliminary studies, we have identified several
chimeric RNAs unique to bladder cancer, but produced by intergenic splicing. Within a month since the issue of
the RFA, together with our Chinese collaborators, we have successfully identified a few chimeric RNAs that are
differentially expressed in lymph node metastatic group using only partial data. This success plus our past
fruitful collaboration encouraged us to propose the following aims: 1. To identify of chimeric RNAs associated
with lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer by combining the RNA-Sequencing data from TCGA and China.
By integrating with CPTAC and whole genome sequencing data associated with TCGA, we can determine
whether the chimeric RNAs may code for chimeric protein, and whether they are products of gene fusion or
intergenic splicing. Using the clinical information from TCGA and Chinese patients, we will reveal the
relationship between chimeric RNAs and lymphatic metastasis, disease progression, and prognosis; 2. To
investigate the role of the chimeric RNAs in lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer cells, and to elucidate the
molecular mechanism of the chimeric RNAs in regulating lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer; We will focus
on two groups of chimeric RNAs, fusion protein-coding and long non-coding chimeric RNA (lnccRNA). 3. To
explore the significance of chimeric RNA as an early diagnostic marker, prognostic factor, and therapeutic
target for lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer. We will investigate the potential of the candidate chimeric
RNAs as biomarkers, and nanoparticle delivery of siRNAs to target key chimeric RNAs; and 4) To develop an
interactive web-based database to disseminate the results. The proposed study fits the NCI Funding Priorities,
Genomics/Epigenomics/Transcriptomics/Proteomics, in that we will combine the large multi-omics data from
both countries, analyze the landscape of chimeric RNAs, and investigate their roles as protein-coding, or long
non-coding in lymph node metastasis of bladder cancer.

10769864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of our research program is to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which HCMV regulates host
signaling in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for the establishment and maintenance of viral
latency and reactivation from latency. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after solid
organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. HCMV
latency is complex and the signaling mechanisms regulating the establishment and maintenance of HCMV
latency, as well as for reactivation of HCMV, are poorly understood. We have identified a locus of viral genes in
the ULb’ region of the genome that coordinates the expression of four genes, UL133, UL135, UL136, and
UL138, from polycistronic transcripts. Using state-of-the art in vitro models in human CD34+ HPCs and in vivo
models in humanized mice, we will define virus-host interactions modulating host signaling for the
establishment of latency. Our preliminary data show that the latency determinant, UL138, interacts with host
WD Repeat containing protein 48 (WDR48), which serves as a scaffold to activate ubiquitin specific protease,
USP1, USP12, and USP46. WDR48-USP1 complexes regulate STAT1 and AKT signaling and we demonstrate
that UL138 directs the activity of WDR48-USP1 to induce the activation of STAT1. We further show that USP1
activity it important for the establishment of a latent infection, such that when USP1 is inhibited, the virus
replicates in the absence of a replication stimulus. We hypothesize that UL138 interaction directs WDR48-USP
complexes to regulate innate signaling to suppress virus replication to prevent reactivation. In Aim 1, we will
determine how UL138 impacts WDR48/USP complexes and function. We will map the amino acids in UL138
that are required for interaction with WDR48/USP complexes and generate recombinant viruses defective for
these interactions. We will distinguish roles of the UL138-WDR48/USP1 interactions from that of UL138-EGFR
interactions. Further, we have shown that UL138 sustains AKT signaling, at least in part through an interaction
with EGFR, but interaction with USP12 and USP46 may provide additional avenues to the regulation of AKT.
Aim 2 will determine how UL138-WDR48/USP interactions impact latency and reactivation and the role of
UL138 in activating STAT1 and AKT using recombinant viruses and knockdown of host factors. This project
will provide the comprehensive and mechanistic insights into the multi-faceted regulation of host signaling for
the control of HCMV latency. The network of viral and host factors we have identified uniquely position us to
define novel host and viral targets for antiviral strategies to control HCMV latency or reactivation."
10769866,"Although researchers have conducted more than 400 human trials for potential treatments of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) in the last two decades, the attrition rate is estimated at over 99%. Furthermore, the “one gene,
one drug, one disease” reductionism-informed paradigm overlooks the inherent complexity of the disease and
continues to challenge drug discovery for AD. The predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and
pleiotropic genetic architecture. Recent studies have suggested that AD often has common underlying
mechanisms, sharing intermediate endophenotypes with many other complex diseases. These
endophenotypes, such as amyloidosis and tauopathy, have essential roles in many neurodegenerative diseases.
Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and disease modules, more so
than mutated genes, will serve as a foundation for generating actionable targets as input for drug repurposing
and rational design of combination therapy in AD. Integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and the
human interactome are essential for such identification. Given our preliminary results, we posit that network-
based identification of novel risk genes and endophenotype modules that share degree between amyloid and
tau offer unexpected opportunities for drug therapy in AD comparing to targeting amyloid and tau separately. To
address the underlying hypothesis, we propose to establish an integrated interdisciplinary research plan with
three specific aims. Aim 1 will explore amyloid and tau-mediated endophenotype modules for AD -- We will test
the network module hypothesis for amyloid and tau using our recently developed Bayesian framework that
integrates multi-omics data (i.e., genome-wide association studies [GWAS] loci, single cell sequencing, and
human brain Hi-C data) and the human interactome. Aim 2 will be capable of searching existing drugs and
combination therapies for AD using network proximity approaches -- We will emphasize the uses of network
proximity approaches (i.e., Genome-wide Positioning Systems network [GPSnet]) to identify repurposable drugs
and efficacious combination regimens. This will be accomplished by integrating AD endophenotype module
findings, public drug-target databases, the human interactome, and the large-scale patient longitudinal Claims-
Electronic Medical Record data (over 200 million patients from the MarketScan database). Aim 3 will evaluate
brain penetration and target network engagement for repurposable drugs -- We will use the humanized in
vitro blood-brain barrier, resected brain tissues (ex vivo/in situ), and transgenic AD models (i.e., TgF344-AD rats)
to experimentally evaluate brain penetration and target network engagement. Evaluation will be based upon
network proximity to the AD-related endophenotype modules that are relevant to maximizing efficacy and to
minimizing side effects. The successful completion of this project will offer powerful network methodologies and
bioinformatics tools for prediction and population-based validation of in silico drug repurposing. It will also allow
for the identification of novel repurposable drugs and clinically relevant combination therapies toward AD trials."
10769867,"Impaired cardiomyocyte excitability and contractile function represent important targets for preventing the
occurrence of sudden cardiac death and progression of heart failure. Growing mechanistic understanding of
cardiac pathologies and increasingly safe and effective methods to deliver viruses to human body make gene
therapies an attractive strategy for combatting various heart diseases. Specifically, the ability to genetically, in a
stable fashion, directly augment sodium or L-type calcium current in cardiomyocytes could directly enhance cell
excitability and contractility and counteract occurrence of electrical abnormalities in a variety of heart diseases.
However, cardiac Na+ or L-type Ca2+ channel genes are too large to be effectively delivered by therapeutic
viruses including adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a
novel AAV-based therapy that leverages engineering of much smaller prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium
(BacNav) and calcium (BacCav) channel genes. Our preliminary results show that genetically engineered BacNav
channels can improve cardiomyocyte excitability and action potential conduction in in vitro and in silico models
of rat and human fibrotic heart tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate successful cardiomyocyte-specific AAV9
delivery of BacNav channels in healthy murine hearts without any adverse effects on cardiac electrophysiology
or contractile function. Building on these promising results, we propose to: 1) identify engineered BacNav variants
with specific mutations and trafficking motifs that maximize cardiomyocyte excitability and action potential speed
by utilizing in vitro cell culture, ex vivo heart slice preparations, and computer simulations and 2) engineer new
variants of BacCav, which alone or in combination with BacNav can augment not only cardiomyocyte excitability
but also contractile strength, which will be studied using engineered 3D heart tissue models in vitro. Finally, we
will exploit murine models of impaired cardiac tissue excitability (genetic loss of cardiac Na+ current (SCN5A+/-
)) or contractile dysfunction (myocardial infarction) to explore which of the identified BacNav and BacCav genes
delivered by AAV vector will induce optimal long-term therapeutic effects in vivo. If successful, these studies will
create a foundation for the future mechanistic studies of prokaryotic channel regulation in mammalian
cardiomyocytes and will guide testing of the engineered BacNav and BacCav channel therapies in large animal
models of heart disease."
10769763,"Abstract. The studies outlined in this proposal focus on the mechanisms by which aggressive breast cancer
cells generate large numbers of exosomes with unique cargo, together with a total secretome that
significantly enhances their potential for metastatic spread. They are based on exciting developments in
the cancer biology field which show that exosomes, a major class of extracellular vesicles (EVs), play
important roles in a number of aspects of cancer progression. These include the ability of exosomes to
confer tumor cells with the capability to show resistance to chemotherapeutic reagents as well as to immune
therapy, together with their roles in promoting metastatic spread. We recently discovered that the down-
regulation of SIRT1 by aggressive breast cancer cells has an important influence on the numbers of
exosomes that they generate, the nature of the exosome cargo, as well as the composition of their total
secretome. This is due to the NAD+-dependent deacetylase/deacylase Sirtuin (SIRT1) playing a key role in
maintaining normal lysosomal function through a novel mechanism that ensures the proper expression of a
major subunit of the vacuolar ATPae (v-ATPase). We also have recently found that the formation and
shedding of exosomes appear to be dependent on the elevations in glutamine metabolism characteristic of
breast cancer cells (i.e. their ‘glutamine addiction’). These findings now raise important questions regarding
how the dependence of aggressive breast cancer cells on glutamine metabolism influences and/or works
together with the down-regulation of SIRT1 expression/activation to regulate lysosomal function and
exosome biogenesis, thus producing a secretome that stimulates cancer cell invasiveness and helps drive
the metastatic process. The different laboratories participating in this proposal will take advantage of their
multi-disciplinary expertise in biochemical and chemical biology approaches in probing cancer cell
metabolism and exosome biogenesis, high-resolution imaging, 3D spheroid culture and tumor organoids,
and the use of mouse models, in probing three key aspects of the mechanisms driving breast cancer
metastasis. These are: 1) Examining the relationship between SIRT1 down-regulation, elevated glutamine
metabolism and the generation exosomes with unique cargo by aggressive breast cancer cells. 2)
Understanding how SIRT1 down-regulation impacts vacuolar ATPase expression to generate a secretome
capable of promoting cancer cell invasiveness. 3) Determining how SIRT1 expression/activity affects
exosome production, cell invasiveness and metastatic spread in breast cancer models. The expectation is
that these studies will lead to the identification of exciting new treatment strategies for the devastating effects
of aggressive breats cancers, and ultimately, for other metastatic diseases."

Addiction research comprises a broad range of techniques, questions, and expertise, and the interplay
(translation) between scientists working in different areas provides the best hope for developing new and better
treatments. In 2009, Behavior, Biology & Chemistry: Translational Research in Addiction (BBC) was started to
provide a meeting for the broad spectrum of researchers (from medicinal chemists to psychiatrists), clinicians,
educators, and policymakers working in the area of addiction as well as an opportunity for young investigators
to present their data, give oral presentations, and interact with leading experts. This application requests 5 years
of support to continue this highly successful 2-day meeting in San Antonio, Texas (2020-2024). BBC provides
an attractive, convenient, cost-effective, and low-threshold venue to introduce young investigators to the
importance, excitement, and breadth of addiction research while giving them the opportunity to present their
data to an audience of experts in an intimate setting that promotes interaction and discussion. Young
investigators who present at BBC receive written feedback on their presentations (oral and poster), they do not
pay a registration fee, they can apply for a travel award that covers all meeting expenses, and they can participate
in oral and poster competitions for cash awards. The Maharaj Ticku Memorial Travel Fellowship sponsors
attendance and presentation at BBC by an outstanding young faculty member. BBC hosts a very popular career
development workshop Pathways to Careers in Science that is attended by many BBC registrants. A post-meeting
online survey provides feedback to assist Organizing and Program Committees with planning future meetings.
BBC is a “launching pad” for young investigators to commit to a career in addiction research; new collaborations
and grant applications have been initiated because of BBC, and each year a manuscript is published based on the
plenary symposium. BBC operates with funding from this grant, registration fees, abstract fees, and donations;
since 2009, donations from academic institutions and individuals have exceeded $320,000. BBC does not
overlap with any existing addiction-related meeting and remains dedicated to cutting-edge addiction research
and to supporting and welcoming a large number of young investigators to the addiction field."

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have been shown to play a significant role in proper gene expression programs
and perturbations of these regions contribute to the development and progression of cancer. While many
examples of the consequences of misregulated positive regulatory elements, including enhancers and
promoters, exist, comparatively little is known about the role of disrupted negative regulatory elements (NREs)
such as silencers and enhancer blockers. Recent evidence suggests that silencers are as abundant as
enhancers and enriched for disease associated variants, indicating this imbalance is not due to genomic NRE
frequency. Rather, NREs are understudied due to lack of a high-throughput reporter assay similar to those that
accelerated enhancer identification. Currently the only standard for locating NREs in the genome involves assays
that rely on a reduction or loss of reporter signal. This results in high false positive rates due to the multiple
artefacts inherent to pooled high-throughput assays which can cause reduction in signal. High noise and low
signal from RNA-seq pools, where strong repressive elements are represented by the fewest transcripts, produce
high false negative rates. This vastly increases the sequencing depth needed to accurately detect low transcript
levels of potent NREs. As a result of these challenges, replicability of NRE assay results have been poor. We
propose to address this gap by developing a high-throughput reporter assay system where strong NREs
generate a positive signal, observed as an increase in reporter gene transcription, through the use of a dCas9-
sgRNA system. Our dCas9 Inverted Reporter Assay (ht-dCIRA) overcomes limitations of traditional NRE reporter
assays with the use of signal inversion, allowing for robust and reliable identification of silencers and enhancer
blockers in the human genome. Improving replicability will allow the detection of NREs that are differentially
active across multiple samples, making comparisons of the regulatory elements driving normal vs tumor states
or response to drug treatment feasible. Reduction of sequencing depth requirements and reliable results with
fewer replicates will additionally make this technology applicable for use across a broad set of cancer cell lines.
This will expedite identification of novel silencers and enhancer blockers that are common to cancer states versus
NREs that vary among cell types. We will demonstrate the applicability of our assay in a genome-wide screen
for silencers and enhancer blockers in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. While many studies have examined the
response of MCF-7 cells to 17β-estradiol and subsequent activation of enhancers by estrogen receptor one
(ERα), little is known about the ERα-NRE relationship. We will apply ht-dCIRA to identify active NREs in both
17β-estradiol treated and untreated MCF-7 cells to determine for the first time silencers and enhancer blockers
that are differentially activated in the ERα response."

 Stress alters the structure and function of brain reward circuitry leading to disruption of reward and
motivation. Stress can be a major risk factor or trigger episodes of psychiatric disorders, which encompass
altered motivational behavior; including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post
traumatic stress disorder. Current studies emphasize a need to approach psychiatric diseases from a combined
circuit and molecular perspective to link candidate molecules to dysfunctional cell subtypes. Our previous work
provided an initial foundation for understanding nucleus accumbens, a major brain reward region, medium spiny
neuron (MSN) subtypes in response to stress. However, there is a critical need for a comprehensive
understanding that encompasses intrinsic molecular regulators of these MSN subtype adaptations and the
extrinsic regulators (such as microglia) that help to shape these structural adaptations in mice susceptible to
stress, as well as those displaying resilient response to stress. In this proposal we will completely characterize
structural adaptations in D1-MSN subpopulations, microglia, and the interaction between the two in stress
susceptible and resilient conditions of both sexes using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and chronic witness
defeat stress (CWDS) paradigms. We will manipulate microglia and D1-MSN subpopulations to determine how
these alterations affect the other cell type, D1-MSN circuit activity, and ultimately stress vulnerable or resilient
behavior including reward value behaviors. Finally, using cell subtype RNA-seq we will determine how microglia
impact stress mediated molecular adaptations in D1-MSN subtype populations and how D1-MSNs impact stress
mediated microglia adaptations. Collectively our studies can provide improved understanding of NAc cell subtype
mechanisms in susceptible and resilient subjects. Our studies could uncover future therapeutic avenues aimed
at mimicking stress resilient mechanisms or combating stress susceptible mechanisms in psychiatric
motivational symptoms"

Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest occurs almost exclusively in pediatric intensive care units and
affects thousands of hospitalized children each year. While cardiac arrest survival outcomes have
improved, more than half of these children will die prior to discharge making prevention the best
approach to improve pediatric patient safety. In our single center prior work, the use of the
SAMURAI PICU (Situation Awareness incorporating MUltidisciplinary Teams Reduce Arrests In
the PICU) bundle improved early identification of high-risk patients, increased shared situation
awareness, and supported risk mitigation plans leading to a >50% decrease in IHCA events
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Using an innovative process of emphasizing shared
situation awareness through automated clinical decision support and mitigation of risk, we will use
a user-centered design approach to adapt, implement, and assess the feasibility and
effectiveness of SAMURAI PICU at other pediatric institutions. We hypothesize that identification
of PICU patients at high risk for in-hospital cardiac arrest through the use of our automated clinical
decision support tool and integration of this high-risk status in daily safety huddles will lead to
improved shared situation awareness and subsequent reduction in cardiac arrest events. We will
utilize a five-center pragmatic prospective Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study
leveraging the existing infrastructure of Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative to evaluate
the following specific aims: 1) adapt the SAMURAI PICU bundle at each intervention site to fit
local context through a user-centered design approach, 2) implement the SAMURAI PICU bundle
in a hybrid stepped wedge fashion and evaluate the effectiveness of the bundle to reduce CPR
events in the PICU. This proposed research is significant it has the potential to inform and
transform the field of cardiac arrest prevention and ultimately prevent death related to in hospital
cardiac arrest for thousands of children in the future significantly improving pediatric patient
safety."

 Dysfunctions of motor neuron (MN) axons that form both descending motor tracts and peripheral nerve
tracts are widely observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which often precede MN soma (and axon)
degeneration and significantly contribute to disease pathology. Although astroglial adhesion signals are essential
for proper axon growth and guidance, whether and how glial adhesion molecules play a role in axon
dysfunction/degeneration in ALS remains largely unknown. Although astroglia conditioned medium (ACM)
derived from the mouse SOD1 mutant model or from human ALS patient brain astroglia is able to substantially
modulate health and survival of MNs, astroglial factors in ACM that modulate MN survival in ALS conditions
remain essentially unidentified. Exosomes (50-150 nm in diameter), a major type of secreted extracellular
vesicles (EVs), are released from multivesicular bodies (MVBs, an intermediate endosome structure) during
endosome maturation. EVs and exosomes secreted from central nervous system (CNS) cell types have emerged
as an important intercellular pathway that is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases
including ALS. How astroglia-derived exosomes affect (motor) neuron survival especially axon properties in ALS
remains largely unexplored. In this project, we intend to investigate novel stimulatory and protective roles of
astroglial exosomes, especially exosomal adhesion molecule HepaCAM signaling to neurons, in promoting axon
growth, functions, and (motor) neuron survival. We will also determine whether dysfunctional HepaCAM signaling
from SOD1G93A astroglial exosomes to (motor) neurons contributes to MN axon dysfunction and degeneration
in ALS.
 Based on our preliminary results, we propose the following aims in this project: Aim 1: Determine the
effect of astroglial exosomes on (motor) neuron axon growth and functions; Aim 2: Investigate loss-of-function
of astroglial exosome signaling to (motor) neurons in ALS models; Aim 3: Elucidate HepaCAM-mediated
astroglial exosome signaling to (motor) neurons in ALS models; We have generated a large amount of
preliminary data to support our rationales and to demonstrate feasibility for proposed aims. We will employ
mouse genetics, primary neuron and astroglial cultures, molecular biology, virus injections, various imaging, and
biochemical approaches to complete these aims. Outcomes from this project will reveal a new astroglial
exosomal HepaCAM-mediated mechanism in modulating (motor) neuron axon growth and survival. It will also
provide important knowledge about the loss-of-functional effect of astroglial exosomes in ALS. These studies
will significantly advance our understanding of the astroglial dysfunction in ALS and help develop new astroglia-
based neuroprotective strategies."
10773091,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Microbial dormancy, defined as a state of reduced metabolic activity, is well recognized in bacterial systems as a
mechanism of transient resistance to environmental stresses, including antibiotic treatment. We have recently reported
that Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, resists long-term exposure to highly cytotoxic compounds due to
the ability of a subpopulation of intracelllular amastigotes to spontaneously assume a dormant state. This new
understanding of T. cruzi biology has implications for how currently available drugs are delivered and how new
compounds capable of reversing dormancy, may be identified. In this application, we propose experiments that will
define the timeframe and limits of T. cruzi dormancy in vivo, among different parasite isolates, if different host tissues
and with respect to the chronicity of the infections. The immunological implications of dormancy will be investigated
and this parasitological and immunological information will be integrated to enhance treatment efficacy using currently
available drugs. Using a novel high content imaging screen, we will identify small molecules that prevent or reverse
dormancy and/or drive the stage conversion of both dormant and actively replicating amastigotes into trypomastigotes.
These compounds will serve as research tools to investigate the molecular pathways involved in dormancy and will be
preliminarily investigated as new therapeutic entities for Chagas disease. We believe that the observation of dormancy
in T. cruzi and the demonstration of its clear role in drug treatment failure is a game changer for treatment design and

10773093,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a costly and worsening problem in the United States with nearly 14 million
adults suffering with symptoms of pain and stiffness. Although many treatments exist, they often lack evidence
for efficacy, bare significant risk, or are exercise programs that are difficult to maintain. Walking in one’s
neighborhood provides a low-cost solution that has been shown to control OA symptoms. However, most
Americans, and further, most OA patients do not engage in enough physical activity. Barriers to walking are
built and social environment in their neighborhood, such as walkability and fear of crime. Although walkability
and social environment have been associated with walking and physical activity, no studies have yet bridged
the gap to prevalent knee OA. Investigating and identifying walkability and social environmental components
that most influence prevalence of knee OA and trajectory of knee OA to end stage total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) can offer targets for intervention. This 5-year K23 award and strong mentorship in “Big Data”, Geospatial
Information Science (GISc) and qualitative methods will help Dr. Gebauer become a leader in integrating
Electronic Medical Record Data (EMR) and GISc and gain skills in qualitative methodology to facilitate mixed
methods studies to explore the influence of neighborhood on walking and painful conditions. Training in spatial
statistics and “Big Data” management will facilitate Aims 1 & 2, exploring the associations between
neighborhood factors, such as walkability, social capital, and violent crime rates and prevalent cases of knee
OA, as well as TKA across the United States utilizing the rich Veterans Affairs (VA) EMR Data set. Innovative
GISc modeling with time-varying measures of neighborhood walkability and social characteristics will be used
to follow veterans across the country in a dynamic retrospective cohort for 11 years, providing much needed
longitudinal data to offer evidence to inform public health action. Training in qualitative methods and
triangulation will facilitate Aim 3, using qualitative interviews with primary care providers (PCPs) and OA
patients to help understand how patient or PCP knowledge of neighborhood barriers and resources can be
leveraged to enhance shared decision making between PCPs and patients and establish concordance around
walking for knee OA treatment.
 Through the completion of these aims and additional training in longitudinal/multilevel modeling
strategies, grantsmanship, and networking with experts in neighborhoods and physical activity, Dr. Gebauer
will provide novel risk factors for knee OA and time to TKA, introduce innovative spatial survival models to
chronic disease epidemiology, as well as a new understanding of shared decision making for patients and their
PCPs, providing data for follow up R01 studies examining integration of neighborhood characteristics to
increase walking in knee OA patients, replicating this study in civilian populations and other metropolitan areas,
and begin to explore other musculoskeletal conditions that benefit from walking in the neighborhood."

The University of Chicago (UChicago) Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) is designed to
provide research training and educational opportunities for newly admitted PhD graduate students from groups
underrepresented (UR) in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and our programming is open to non-UR
students who would benefit from IMSD opportunities. The Program is tiered to focus intervention and
developmental activities to match the background preparation, research experience, and learning styles of
individual students as well as their stage of progression in graduate school. Students join the IMSD in the
Summer term upon entry to graduate studies, complete an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will serve as
the roadmap for each student's course over their tenure in the UChicago IMSD, and participate in a Summer
Research Program that helps to integrate them into the Graduate Programs and prepare them for the rigors of
a UChicago graduate education. Navigation through rotations and coursework, as well as developing
communication and coping skills will be facilitated through Interactive Learning Modules (ILMs) and augmented
by peer and faculty mentoring. Support from the Program is provided for years one through three of graduate
school. Students remain members of the IMSD program while advancing to completion of the PhD, benefitting
from ILMs designed to hone scientific skills, enhance leadership skills, develop professional and networking
skills and explore career options. Although the Program is highly structured and logically organized, it is also
customizable depending on each student’s needs. This is accomplished by a newly developed skill-based
evaluation process implemented at key milestones. Faculty are actively engaged in improving their mentoring
and training skills, while all stakeholders work together toward a more diverse community of scholars. The
ultimate success of the IMSD Program is measured by completion of the students’ PhD programs, their long-
term success as biomedical scientists, and an increase in the diversity of the biomedical research community
over time."
10746791,"Project Summary
The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide to epidemic proportions. Dysfunctional white adipose
tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and its
related metabolic syndrome. BAT is densely packed with mitochondria and requires fatty acid (FA) oxidation to
support thermogenesis. In comparison, WAT serves as a main energy storage organ and the FA oxidation in
WAT is relatively low at ambient temperature. Chronic cold exposure induces browning of subcutaneous WAT
to become thermogenic beige AT with increased FA oxidation capacity. Although FA oxidation is known to be a
critical and fundamental metabolic end point in both humans and rodents, it is not completely clear how
adipocyte FA oxidation is regulated post-translationally and how it contributes to whole-body energy
metabolism in an autonomous manner. In this regard, our preliminary studies provide compelling evidence that
a protein encoded by Apolipoprotein 6 (ApoL6) is a selective regulator of mitochondrial trifunctional protein
(TFP), the key enzyme catalyzing FA β-oxidation. ApoL6 is highly expressed in WAT and differentiated
adipocytes. In contrast, BAT normally expresses low levels of ApoL6, which increases during obesity or
thermoneutrality-induced whitening. We found that in the basal condition, ApoL6 is localized to mitochondria,
resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial FA oxidation. Transgenic mice expressing ApoL6 in BAT exhibited a
lower thermogenic capacity upon cold exposure, and decreased energy expenditure along with increased
adiposity. Conversely, adipose ApoL6 knockout mice on HFD showed a decreased body weight and fat mass
gain. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that by inhibiting mitochondrial FA oxidation and
thereby decreasing energy expenditure, ApoL6 plays a key role in (1) maintaining fat storage in WAT and
whole-body energy balance, and (2) impeding non-shivering thermogenesis in whitened BAT. There are three
aims: In aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic role of mitochondrially localized ApoL6 in adipocyte FA
oxidation by using gain- and loss-of-function cell models. In Aim 2 we will determine how adipose specific
ApoL6 ablation in mice affects diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic changes including insulin
resistance. In Aim 3 we will use both loss- and gain-of-function mouse models to define the role of ApoL6 in
the regulation of BAT thermogenesis during obesity- and thermoneutrality-induced whitening. Evidence derived
from this project should provide novel insight into the molecular basis for the regulation of FA oxidation and
energy metabolism in adipose tissue, thereby advancing the possibilities for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches to combat obesity and type 2 diabetes."

Founded 120 years ago, the Oregon State University (OSU) College of Pharmacy is one of the oldest in the
United States and has been a leader in natural products research since our predoctoral training program in
Pharmaceutical Sciences began in 1952. Founded in 1973 by two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling and
housed in the state-of-the-art Linus Pauling Science Center on the OSU campus, the Linus Pauling Institute
(LPI) remains focused on using micronutrients, phytochemicals and dietary supplements to prevent disease
and maintain human health. Our graduates occupy leadership positions in academia, industry and government
in the United States and throughout the world. Historically, natural products have accounted for over half of all
therapeutic agents, and today are still the inspiration of nearly 40% of new drugs. Training young scientists for
careers in natural products and dietary supplements research is a core mission of our College of Pharmacy
and the LPI and will be the focus of this training grant. To address the need to train a new generation of
experts in research concerning natural products drug discovery and in the safety and efficacy of dietary

This fast-track STTR application proposes to enhance, validate, and scale Sepsis Watch, a deep
learning sepsis detection and management system built using data from the Emergency
Department (ED) Duke University Hospital (DUH). The proposal will extend and enhance
Sepsis Watch to EDs, general inpatient wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) settings across
multiple health systems in the United States. While early diagnosis and prompt treatment of
sepsis can improve mortality and morbidity, early detection has remained elusive. The Sepsis
Watch integration in the DUH ED improved compliance with the 3-hour sepsis bundle by 12%
and the 6-hour sepsis bundle by 18%. The system reduced mortality for severe sepsis by 15%
and mortality for septic shock by 22%. This proposal seeks to transform Sepsis Watch into a
scalable solution to replicate such results at other health systems and in settings beyond the ED.
In Phase I, we propose external validation through a retrospective analysis of data from two
separate health systems. Phase 1 will let us automate data quality checks and ingestion
processes at scale from different health systems as we curate data from at least 200,000
encounters over a 2-year period. We will present model predictions to clinicians from each
hospital to analyze potential impact of integrating Sepsis Watch into clinical care. In Phase II,
we propose conducting temporal validation at each hospital from Phase I. This will allow us to
design real-time ingestion of data records into Sepsis Watch in a manner that is agnostic to
electronic health record (EHR) vendor systems. We will optimize the machine learning model
using Phase 1 findings to improve performance at each location while assessing federated and
centralized learning approaches that incorporate data from different hospitals. Models
variations that utilize different sets of inputs will also be assessed and models will be built to
three gold-standard sepsis definitions, including Sepsis-3, CMS SEP-1 sepsis, and CDC Adult
Sepsis Event. During the 6-month temporal validation we will also generalize the Sepsis Watch
user-interface and workflow by seeking feedback from clinicians at each hospital as it is run in
silent mode. This will allow Sepsis Watch to be configurable to various clinical workflows.
The optimized model and user-interface in Phase 2 should allow Sepsis Watch to be seamlessly
integrated into routine clinical care in each hospital and then into other hospitals within each of
the two health systems and eventually to any health system in the US."

The current proposal seeks to rigorously test how interpersonal discrimination contributes to acute and chronic
stress, allostatic load and related health risk among Hispanics and how aspects of social support networks
may mitigate these effects by reducing stress contagion. Our project focuses on discrimination, as immigrant
Hispanics – particularly recent immigrants – often report discrimination at substantially lower frequencies than
US-born Hispanics. This in turn may contribute to immigrant Hispanic’s health advantages, such as 3
additional years life expectancy, relative to US-born Hispanics. The Weathering Hypothesis and theories of
allostasis suggest that the cumulative effects of discrimination exposure and related stress would explain these
health disparities. However, this proposal will be among the first to test mechanisms of how discrimination
stress contributes to allostatic load, with a focus on social and cultural mechanisms; moreover, we will extend
this work beyond the individual to understand how discrimination stress acts on a social network. Research in
White populations has documented how social support protects against the negative health effects of stress,
but little work has examined these effects in Hispanic samples. Moreover, prior research does not account for
how social support may perpetuate stress across a network: that is, when one person experiences stress, their
supportive others will also experience stress. This is particularly relevant for stressors like discrimination, which
impact not only the target but also their social ties. Thus, in order to mitigate the effects of discrimination,
support networks may need to be used in specific ways and have specific qualities. The current study tests
these qualities. First, we will determine the extent to which discrimination stress response and discrimination
exposure frequency combine to predict changes in allostatic load, and in turn predicts risk for multiple chronic
health outcomes that are leading causes of death (e.g., cardiovascular disease). Second, we will determine the
social network qualities that mitigate discrimination stress “spilling over” from one person to another. Finally,
we determine how discrimination stress response transmits across a network to predict changes in the
networks’ allostatic load. To achieve this, we will use sampling designs (respondent-driven sampling; RDS)
and social network analyses that allow us to understand how the connections across people influence health.
We will examine social support; biomarkers of allostatic load, acute and chronic stress, and inflammation; and
daily diary assessments of discrimination frequency. Using novel Bluetooth technology developed by our team
we will also assess how often participants interact with one another and link that data to each participants
reports of discrimination and whether they discussed discrimination with supportive others. The combination of
these measures and network-based approach allows us to conduct novel tests of how social environments
influence health and potentially convey health resilience in the face of discrimination. Additionally, it will inform
how to best arrange social support interventions to limit the negative effects of interpersonal discrimination."
10746863,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Though CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment for hematologic cancers and
chronic viral infections, T cell exhaustion remains a barrier to fully realizing their therapeutic potential. T cell
exhaustion is the hierarchical loss of proliferation, cytokine production, and effector function of CD8+ T cells after
chronic antigen stimulation. Not every T cell becomes exhausted to the same degree or at the same rate, but
the factors governing heterogeneity in susceptibility to exhaustion are undefined. The Rudd lab was the first to
show that a previously-overlooked source of heterogeneity within the naïve CD8+ T cell pool—developmental
origin—is deterministic in a CD8+ T cell’s fate after acute infection. We believe that developmental origin is also
consequential in chronic infection, for our preliminary data shows that neonatal CD8+ T cells (derived from the
fetal liver) are resistant to phenotypic and functional exhaustion, whereas adult cells (derived from adult bone
marrow) are more susceptible. We also showed that overexpressing Lin28b, an oncofetal RNA-binding protein
that negatively regulates let-7 microRNAs and is only expressed in fetal liver HSCs, is sufficient to convert the
adult phenotype to the neonatal one. Our objective is therefore to dissect the developmentally-regulated
programs underlying differential responses to chronic stimulation. We will use innovative approaches to test our
hypothesis that adult CD8+ T cells are more susceptible to exhaustion than neonatal cells due to age-related
differences in let-7/Lin28b expression that program metabolism away from aerobic glycolysis. In Aim 1, we will
determine how developmental origin and Lin28b expression impact propensity for CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
Results from this aim will make clear how distinct subsets of exhausted cells arise among differently-aged CD8+
T cells, and shed light on whether developmental pathways protect against irreversible exhaustion. In Aim 2, we
will determine how Lin28b-mediated metabolic programs underlie differently-aged cells’ susceptibility to become
exhausted. These results will provide a mechanistic explanation for how developmental imprinting affects T cell
exhaustion dynamics. By investigating the developmentally-distinct CD8+ T cell response to chronic infection,
and the role that let-7, Lin28b, and metabolic programing play in said response, this proposal will uncover a
previously-unexplored factor in determining T cell exhaustion. Because developmentally-ingrained pathways are
common to all T cells, understanding these pathways—and finding strategies to fine-tune them—will have wide-
reaching implications for neonatal disease, chronic infection, and cancer alike."

As cartilage has poor innate repair and regeneration capacity, therapies that can address early cartilage injury
and prevent further osteoarthritic deterioration would have a large clinical impact. Due to the ease of isolation
and multi-lineage differentiation potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), methods that rely either on
matrix assisted mesenchymal-stromal-cell-implantation (MSCI) or microfracture (MF) have attracted clinical
attention. Currently, the functional outcomes of MSCI or MF, including approaches that deliver growth factors in
vivo, are characterized by biomechanically inferior fibrocartilage, and poor integration scores. Joint inflammation
has been identified to inhibit chondrogenesis of MSCs, thus contributing to the low efficacy of cartilage repair
outcomes. Critically, approaches that offer chondroprotection by the mitigating the catabolic effects of the pro-
inflammatory joint environment while promoting in situ chondrogenesis are required. To address the critical
challenge of improving functional-cartilage-repair outcomes, a non-invasive adjunct; continuous low-
intensity ultrasound (cLIUS) with recently published chondroinductive and chondroprotective properties
to demonstrate enhanced chondral repair for both MACI and MF procedures will be employed. The ability
of cLIUS to improve cartilage repair outcomes will be demonstrated via three specific aims: AIM 1: Demonstrate
cLIUS-induced chondrogenesis of MSCs in a pro-inflammatory environment. RNA-sequencing will be
employed to gather an in-depth transcriptomic profiling and underlying pathways that drive MSC chondrogenesis
under cLIUS in a pro-inflammatory environment. AIM 2: Develop a computationally validated and optimized
regimen of cLIUS therapy. Computational grids will be built from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) coupled
with a biphasic finite element model for wave propagation in the joints to determine the specific cLIUS regimen
for sheep joints. Models will be validated with acoustic propagation experiments in sheep-cadaver knee joints.
AIM 3: Demonstrate Improved Functional Outcomes of Cartilage Repair Under cLIUS. Demonstrate the
superior repair of critically sized chondral defects via MF and MSCI in the articular cartilage of sheep using an
optimized transdermal delivery of cLIUS and evaluate at six months. Analysis of regenerated cartilage will be
through histological, biomechanical and biochemical methods. Successful completion of this work is expected to
lead to the development of a cLIUS-based regimen and delivery system capable of generating a stable hyaline
cartilage phenotype via minimally invasive procedures, while advancing the fundamental understanding of MSC
preconditioning under cLIUS. This would, in turn, directly address the treatment of 46 million Americans who
suffer from OA at an estimated cost of $128 billion annually."

Spatial tumor heterogeneity plays a critical role in multiple stages of cancer progression and metastasis including
the venous invasion that contributes to increased risk of cancer cell dissemination. This process involves spatially
distinct interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment at multiple sites. In Tech1, PI
Wirtz will develop a new 3D multiscale tumor cell mapping method, CODA, which can create a 3D large-scale
tumor cell anatomy at single cell level via tissue histology image integration and trained deep-learning semantic
algorithms. What is highly desired to further add to this 3D tumor cell anatomic atlas is genome-wide molecular
information such as mRNAs and a large panel of proteins for unbiased discovery of cell subtype, state, and
interaction, and potentially to infer new mechanisms or targets for therapeutic intervention. TECH2 PI Fan
recently developed a novel technology called DBiT-seq for high-spatial-resolution multi-omics mapping via
deterministic barcoding in tissue at cellular level (~10µm), whole transcriptome scale (>22,000 genes), high
coverage (>2,000 genes per 10µm pixel), and multi-omics profiling (co-mapping of ~300 protein markers), which
can be readily applied to FFPE tissue sections and integrated with CODA. In Tech2, we propose the following
two aims: AIM 1. A high-throughput, low cost, high quality/coverage, multi-omic mapping method (DBiT-seq) with
full compatibility with human PFA and FFPE tissue samples. AIM 2. Integrating CODA and DBiT-seq for 3D
multi-omic tumor imaging. Successful completion of these two aims will lead to the first genome-wide multi-
omics 3D view of vascular or lymphovascular invasion of human tumors and a powerful technology platform for
the consortium to investigate spatial tissue heterogeneity in other human cancers."

10774270,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The first few months of HIV infection, broadly referred to as “early HIV infection,” are characterized by elevated
viral loads and increased per-virion infectivity, resulting in higher transmission rates compared to the
subsequent chronic infection period. Modeling studies have estimated that transmission during early infection
disproportionately contributes to population-level HIV incidence: members of our team estimated that HIV
transmission during the first five months of infection accounted for 38% of incident infections in 2010 in
Lilongwe, Malawi, while a recent model from eSwatini estimated that transmission during the first three months
of infection accounted for 15% of incident infections. Both studies concluded that to end the HIV epidemic,
transmission during early infection must be addressed. The pre-seroconversion or “acute” phase, which
represents the first several weeks of early infection, is characterized by the highest viral loads and infectivity.
Detection of acute HIV infection (AHI) requires RNA or antigen testing, which is difficult to implement in many
settings. Members of this study team have shown that sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics are
consistently high-yield settings for AHI detection and that an intervention (iKnow - NCT02467439) integrating
AHI screening, assisted partner notification, and social contact referral in STI clinics can efficiently identify
undiagnosed cases of HIV. The iKnow team assembled one of the largest documented cohorts of persons with
AHI in Africa (n=115) between 2015 and 2019 at Bwaila STI clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. Using questionnaire,
household GPS, and phylogenetic data from the iKnow study, the proposed project will examine the prevention
potential of AHI-focused interventions that are anchored in STI clinics and supplemented by geographically-
and demographically-guided interventions in communities. Specifically, we will: 1) investigate the
characteristics of persons and places associated with AHI; 2) test for spatiotemporal clustering of AHI cases
and determine whether spatiotemporal AHI clusters were formed through phylogenetically linked transmission
events; and 3) model the population-level impact on HIV incidence of interventions focusing on acute and early
HIV infection. These analyses will provide novel insights into HIV transmission dynamics and inform
interventions against transmission during acute and early HIV infection. To support the completion of this
project and the applicant’s development into an independent investigator, the proposed training plan includes
close mentorship by global experts in phylogenetics, phylogeography, mathematical modeling, and HIV
prevention, as well as external coursework and readings. The applicant will develop scientific communication
skills through manuscript writing and presentations to the PANGEA HIV consortium."
10774271,"Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect affecting 1% of all live born infants. While
~90% of patients with CHD survive into adulthood, there are many comorbidities that make CHD an
increasingly significant public health problem. Genomic analyses of large cohorts of CHD patients have
identified a significant genetic contribution to CHD, but the link between etiology and clinical outcome remains
an important question. When I began my search for the cause of CHD, I identified the cilium as being central to
left-right (LR) axis and cardiac development, and most recently, as part of the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics
Consortium (PCGC), identified significant contributions from mutations affecting cilia and chromatin remodeling
genes to human CHD. However, the question of how cilia dysfunction precisely influences CHD remains
unanswered. I have assembled a group of co-investigators with expertise in mouse and zebrafish
development, live-cell imaging, optogenetics and genomics to take a multi-pronged approach to understanding
the central role of the cilium in heart development with the long-term goal of leveraging this data with ongoing
genomic and clinical studies to improve clinical outcomes of CHD. First, we will resolve the long-standing
question of how cilia instruct cardiac LR asymmetry. We will use single-cell RNAseq to define the cellular
composition of the left-right organizer (LRO), a transient ciliated organ that is essential for instructing cardiac
asymmetry. We will then establish the molecular mechanism linking cilia signaling at the LRO to cardiac LR
development in mouse and zebrafish embryos. Together these experiments will uncover the mechanism by
which an embryo determines LR asymmetry, and provide gene sets that will inform the search for human CHD
candidate genes. Second, we will investigate the role of cilia in cardiac valve formation. We have found
dynamic, flow-sensitive cilia in the presumptive atrio-ventricular valve region of the zebrafish heart, and will test
the hypothesis that valve specification is driven by the mechanical forces occurring at interfaces between
differentially contracting chambers, and that valve cilia are the mechanotransducers leading to changes in
transcription of klf2/klf4 and downstream valve morphogenesis. Third, we will unravel the mechanism by which
epigenetic factors influence cardiac development. The important role of chromatin remodeling genes in human
CHD has raised the question whether any of these transcriptionally regulate cilia in heart development. We
have already found that histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2BUb1) transcriptionally regulates cilia function at
the LRO. We are now testing how H2BUb1 affects cardiac development in mouse embryos and human iPSC-
derived cardiomyocytes through cilia-dependent and/or cilia-independent mechanism(s). Our long-term goal of
translating the basic biologic and genomic data to clinical impact will be addressed by returning mechanistic
and genetic data from our cilia work to the PCGC CHD genomics project so that the resulting discoveries lead
to personalized medicine for patients with CHD.

10773376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The intestinal epithelium, constantly challenged by environmental toxins, chemicals, or pathogens, is
continually being renewed and regenerated to maintain gut homeostasis through the proliferation and
differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). When this regenerative process is impaired, particularly in response
to injury, chronic inflammation and disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease may result. The
matricellular protein CCN1 has emerged as an overarching regulator of multiple functions in intestinal repair and
regeneration through its direct interactions with distinct integrin receptors in disparate cell types. Recently, we
have shown that CCN1 coordinately regulates ISC proliferation and differentiation into distinct epithelial cell types
through the regulation of Wnt and Notch signaling, in part by activating YAP, which contributes to epithelial
regeneration in homeostasis. In our new supporting data, we observed that (1) Mice with Ccn1 deletion in Lgr5+
ISCs and knock-in mice expressing integrins αv-binding defective CCN1 suffer high mortality and impaired
epithelial regeneration in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced injury. (2) Moreover, these knock-in mice fail to
restore the ISC pool after diphtheria toxin receptor-mediated ablation of the Lgr5+ ISCs, indicating that CCN1
may be required for the reprogramming or dedifferentiation of epithelial cells into ISCs. (3) Although senescent
cells are generally thought to be deleterious, mice treated with the senolytic drug ABT-263 to eliminate senescent
cells sustain impaired epithelial restitution after DSS injury, and similar defects are observed in knock-in mice in
which Ccn1 is unable to bind integrin α6β1 and are therefore unable to induce stromal fibroblast senescence.
These findings suggest that senescent fibroblasts promote intestinal epithelial repair and CCN1 may be a key
inducer of senescence. Based on these results, we will scrutinize the hypothesis that CCN1 is an overarching
regulator of intestinal injury repair by controlling both the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells to restore the ISC
pool and the induction of fibroblast senescence in the stroma through integrins αv and α6β1, respectively, with
the following specific aims: (Aim 1) To analyze how CCN1 regulates cell dedifferentiation to restore the ISC pool
upon injury and dissect the distinct functions of CCN1 and YAP in a regulatory loop to control this process. (Aim
2) To investigate the role of CCN1-induced stromal cell senescence in epithelial regeneration via the release of
the senescence regenerative factors (SRFs). These studies will yield new insights into a powerful endogenous
repair program that coordinately regulates complex cellular processes in various cell types for intestinal injury
repair and pave the way for novel targeted therapeutics that promote intestinal repair and regeneration following
injury."
10756451,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA packaging into chromatin mediates chromosome segregation, telomere protection, and genome integrity,
among other essential, conserved cellular processes. However, many chromatin proteins are strikingly
unconserved—domains and residues evolve rapidly between even closely related species. This paradox of
conserved, chromatin-dependent functions supported by fast-evolving chromatin proteins suggests that some
essential cellular processes require recurrent innovation. The biological significance of this paradox is poorly
understood, and yet aberrant chromatin packaging is a hallmark of cancer, infertility, and aging. We
hypothesize that the pervasive rapid evolution of chromatin proteins is driven by the exceptionally rapid
evolution of DNA repeats, including transposons and DNA satellites. Specifically, we hypothesize that
chromatin proteins and DNA repeats antagonistically coevolve: repetitive DNA evolution imperils essential
chromatin functions, triggering reciprocal evolution of chromatin proteins to restore these essential chromatin
functions. Repeated bouts of DNA repeat evolution and chromatin protein adaptation result in exquisitely
coevolved, species-specific components of the genome. To probe this model of antagonistic coevolution, we
conduct evolution-guided functional analysis: we swap into a focal genome a diverged chromatin protein from a
closely related species, generating an ""evolutionary mismatch"" between the contemporary DNA repeats of one
species and a contemporary chromatin protein of another species. Upon swapping a diverged version of a
transposon-silencing protein into Drosophila melanogaster, we triggered transposon hyper-proliferation and a
consequent loss of genome integrity. Upon swapping a diverged version of a DNA satellite-associated protein
into D. melanogaster, we similarly triggered a profound loss of genome integrity but through a distinct pathway.
Having successfully defined the genome components engaged in antagonistic coevolution during the current
funding period, we are now poised to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which DNA repeats imperil
essential chromatin biology and the molecular mechanisms by which chromatin proteins mitigate these threats.
Leveraging our two established systems, we will probe the evolutionary and functional diversification of two
vital chromatin-mediated pathways shaped by coevolution: 1) the regulation of chromatin accessibility at
genomic regions vulnerable to transposon insertions and 2) the resolution of DNA entanglements enriched in
DNA satellite arrays. Our published and preliminary data also propel our investigations of how antagonistic
coevolution reverberates beyond the two embattled parties, triggering secondary coevolutionary dynamics that
preserve protein:protein interactions among multiple host chromatin proteins. Using transgenics, cell biology,
biochemistry, and classical genetics, we will elucidate the otherwise invisible hazards of DNA repeat evolution
and determine how adaptive evolution shapes and reshapes chromatin to preserve vital genome functions."

The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) seeks a fourth renewal of its successful
multidisciplinary postdoctoral Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional
Research Training Grant (T32) in injury and critical illness. The goal of this training program is to provide
multidisciplinary research training for postdoctorates in trauma to develop future independent investigators who
will use these skills in academic careers that increase understanding of the mechanisms of traumatic injury and
subsequent critical illness and to inform clinical practice. To accomplish these goals, our program recruits and
selects postdoctoral candidates who are interested in pursuing an academic career in trauma-related research
each calendar year for two-year positions. At the end of the two years of training, each fellow is able to: 1)
critically analyze available published data; 2) formulate a focused hypothesis; 3) design and perform necessary
experiments to test the hypothesis; 4) analyze and interpret results to draw appropriate conclusions and
potentially modify experimental strategies; 5) effectively present the results of their research both orally and in
writing; and 6) prepare a competitive research proposal. Over 15 years, 52% (10/17) of fellows who completed
their training (T32 and subsequent) are currently in academic positions, and 41% have been awarded
independent funding; 208 manuscripts have resulted from the award over the past 10 years. Since its creation
in 2001, this T32 training program has evolved, and we propose new elements and faculty to advance and focus
our training efforts. In the proposed Program Plan, we expand our focus to the following areas in injury and
critical illness: Traumatic Brain Injury; Hemorrhage Control and Resuscitation; Inflammatory Consequences and
Organ Dysfunction; Cell Therapy; and Bum with each fellow receiving instruction in responsible conduct of
research, reproducibility, epidemiology, biostatistics, and informatics in concert with their career goals and
Individual Development Plan. Dr. Charles Cox remains the Program Director of the training program, and he is
assisted by a newly added Assistant Director and a Program Manager to form the Steering Committee. The
leadership receives guidance from an External Advisory Committee, including a sub-committee to enhance
diversity. Each trainee is assigned 1 of 10 Primary Faculty Mentors who bring varied expertise and vast
mentoring experience and are responsible for ensuring that fellows receive appropriate training to design
effective, ethical, and informative research projects. Resource Faculty members are also available to assist in
project execution in areas of expertise different from Primary Mentors. Lastly, expanded evaluation procedures
are proposed to improve the training experience for both mentors and trainees. This comprehensive approach
ensures that a well-rounded, diverse faculty will assist and guide these young scientists along the path to
academic independence and significant future contributions to the care of injured patients."
10771504,"GEMMA Core: Summary
The primary goal of the Gene Editing and Mouse Models Assessment (GEMMA) Core is to provide COBRE
project leaders and their staff access to facilities, expertise and training essential to execution of their projects
and establishing their research programs at the MRI. The GEMMA Core will also support non-COBRE faculty
and projects at the MRI and other institutions in Montana, increasing research capacity in the region by providing
access to transgenic, genotyping and neurobehavior services, consultation and training for mouse colony
maintenance and gene editing, and access to a shared research environment for conducting basic and
translational studies in a mentored environment. Three specific aims are proposed to accomplish the overall
goal: 1) provide transgenic and genotyping services needed to successfully execute experiments involving mice;
2) provide mouse colony management and training; and 3) develop a state-of-the-art mouse phenotyping service
in a shared research environment. This application is significant because it will provide a unique combination of
services, facilities and expertise to COBRE projects and other investigators working with mouse models across
the region, which will increase their success in obtaining independent NIH funding and performing impactful
research that advances our understanding of health and disease. It is innovative because it delivers these
resources to scientists in the northern Rocky Mountain front and surrounding area in a collaborative research
environment and provides employment opportunities in the field of biomedical research in an underserved region.
In addition, the shared research laboratory, neurobehavior and phenotyping facilities provide a supportive
environment and novel model across the spectrum of “research readiness” to spur research expansion while
also implementing innovative mouse handling techniques of compassionate care that minimize stress-related
behaviors. The GEMMA Core is integral to the success of our COBRE program and maintaining a sustainable
Center of Excellence in the long-term."
10771505,"Project I: Summary
Chronic systemic inflammation and immune activation are associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
pathogenesis, and neuroinflammation mediated by astrocytes and microglia is observed in the brain prior to the
onset of cognitive decline. However, there is a need to delineate contributions of other inflammatory cells to AD,
particularly those that can be targeted in the periphery. The overall goals for this study are to 1) determine if
altered neutrophil lifespan exacerbates neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in AD mouse models, and 2)
investigate neutrophil cell death as a potential therapeutic target in AD. There is strong published evidence that
neutrophils are dysregulated in AD and exacerbate disease pathogenesis. In humans and AD mouse models,
neutrophils infiltrate the brain vasculature and parenchyma and neutrophil activation in the periphery
corresponds with disease progression. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that depleting neutrophils
results in cognitive improvement in a familial AD mouse model. While aberrant neutrophil responses damage
tissue and contribute to neurodegeneration, appropriate responses could be helpful in containing inflammatory
stimuli (e.g., infection, amyloid beta, myelin debris) and participate in tissue repair. This balance between
damage and beneficial physiological function is maintained by tightly regulated neutrophil lifespan. Under
homeostatic conditions, neutrophils are short-lived, spending only a few hours in circulation on average. Our
hypothesis is that delayed neutrophil apoptosis in AD contributes to increased neutrophils, neutrophil-mediated
inflammation, and AD pathogenesis. This hypothesis is based on compelling evidence from published work and
our preliminary data. The pathways that regulate neutrophil apoptosis are dysregulated in Alzheimer’s disease
(MAPK and NFkb/TNFa signaling). In addition, delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been shown to result in
increased neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, and NET release is a component of AD pathogenesis.
Finally, our preliminary data demonstrate that neutrophil apoptosis is altered in AD mouse models and this
associates with markers of NET release. We will address our hypothesis and achieve our study goals by pursuing
the following two aims: 1) Investigate the hypothesis that altered neutrophil apoptosis is a therapeutic target in
AD using mouse models; and 2) Determine if neutrophil apoptosis and NETosis are altered in persons with AD.
This project is significant and transitionally innovative because neutrophil apoptosis represents a promising
therapeutic target based on the following: 1) apoptosis and clearance of neutrophils are fundamental to the
resolution of inflammation, a known factor in AD pathogenesis; 2) promoting neutrophil apoptosis can dampen
inflammation without severely compromising host defense; and 3) neutrophils can be targeted in the periphery.
The data from these aims will provide the foundation to investigate therapeutics targeting neutrophil apoptosis
in vivo in mouse models and have the capacity for significant translational impact on promising future AD
treatment options."
10771506,"Project II: Summary
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among older Americans and is
caused by dysfunction of the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) leading to neurodegeneration. The RPE
functions to maintain the outer blood-retinal barrier and support photoreceptor function, including regeneration
of visual pigment and turnover of outer segments. Given that a major function of the RPE is to process photo-
receptor outer segments, the proper functioning of the RPE endosomal pathway is important for retinal health.
Thus, RPE-derived exosomes are a likely source of real-time biological information into retinal health and are
available in the systemic circulation. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that release of exosomes (nano-
sized extracellular vesicles) from stressed RPE cells plays a central role in desmosome disassembly, outer
blood-retina barrier (oBRB) integrity, and contributes to pathognomonic deposit formation in AMD. To explore
this hypothesis, I present two aims focused on neurodegeneration and the RPE with the goal of translation of
this work to novel therapeutic interventions in retinal degenerative diseases: Aim 1 interrogates the role of
exosome release in vitro in stressed RPE models of AMD and Aim 2 interrogates the role of exosome release in
AMD and retinal degeneration mouse models. By evaluating complementary in vitro and in vivo AMD models,
our approach is to determine the role of exosome secretion on RPE health, and test whether pharmacological
or gene therapy interventions are possible by: (1) Characterizing the desmosomal and hemidesmosomal content
of basal-side exosomes in aged RPE and RPE stressed by pathophysiological conditions implicated in AMD,
while modulating exosome release, and (2) modulating the level of exosome release in two different and
complementary mouse models of AMD features to identify novel approaches to therapy and/or intervention. This
project is innovative as it tests the novel hypothesis that exosomes from the basolateral side of stressed RPE
cells play a central role in disassembly of desmosomes which impacts oBRB integrity, and contribute to
pathognomonic deposit formation in AMD. Moreover, the proposal is both significant and innovative as it explores
possible avenues for therapeutic intervention aimed at regulating exosome release from RPE, a novel avenue
for AMD treatment to achieve functional restoration in situ. The project is also significant in leveraging my
background in developing and characterizing AMD mouse models, and my expertise in RPE cell biology and
exosome biology. The project plan lays the foundation for my future research program."
10771507,"Project III: SUMMARY
Increasing evidence indicates that neurodegenerative diseases may share overlapping proteinopathies and
common molecular mechanisms. The overall goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of the role of
two proteins in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the
United States and is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Although most
PD cases are idiopathic, genetic causes have been identified including mutations and copy number variants of
the gene that encodes alpha synuclein (SNCA) protein, a major component of Lewy body aggregates observed
in postmortem PD brain tissue. SNCA has been shown to possess prion properties in that it can induce misfolding
and aggregation that can spread from cell to cell. Much less is known about other proteins that may modulate
SNCA aggregation and have an impact on PD pathology. This project addresses the hypothesis that Superoxide
Dismutase 1 (SOD1) aggregates are correlated with SNCA aggregates in idiopathic PD brain and that they
exacerbate disease progression in concert with misfolded SNCA. SOD1 is a major cytoplasmic antioxidant
enzyme that metabolizes superoxide radicals; mutations in the SOD1 gene were the first mutations linked to the
neurodegenerative disorder Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Although several reports indicate SOD1
aggregates occur in postmortem PD brain tissue, the role of SOD1 in PD is not clear. This project builds on
substantial preliminary data that demonstrates development of a SOD1 aggregation assay that can detect and
propagate misfolded SOD1 in postmortem human neural tissues with high specificity and sensitivity. To address
the hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 is focused on the use of human tissues and cells to
examine the propagation and toxicity of SOD1 aggregates, whereas Specific Aim 2 uses mouse models to test
the hypothesis. We will quantify SNCA and SOD1 aggregates in postmortem idiopathic PD brain regions,
examine neurotoxicity from idiopathic PD-SOD1 on dopaminergic neurons, and determine whether the presence
of the human SOD1 wild type allele exacerbates neurobehavioral deficits and protein aggregation in a PD mouse
model expressing human SNCA. This project is significant as it addresses the underlying molecular pathology
of a common neurodegenerative disease; the project is also significant in that PD has an outsized impact in rural
communities, where incidence of PD has been reported to be higher and access to specialists is limited relative
to urban areas. Several aspects of the project are innovative including: 1) the hypothesis, based on shared
proteinopathy of SNCA and SOD1, 2) the use of novel tools such as the first SOD1 real time quaking induced
conversion (RT-QuIC) assay, and 3) the use of complementary but independent studies in humans and mouse
models. Outcomes of this study will shed light on the role of SOD1 in idiopathic PD and disease progression.
Results may also uncover new mechanisms, identify novel biomarkers, and/or contribute to design of novel
strategies for treatments for idiopathic PD."
10771508,"Project IV: Summary
Background: Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious prion disease of cervids (elk, deer, moose, and
reindeer) with no current treatment, few management tools, and lack of clarity regarding potential for
transmissibility to humans. Overall goal: In this project, we will establish comprehensive phenotypic profiling in
CWD diseased mouse models and investigate zoonotic barriers. Proposal: This project will
expand critical scientific knowledge in an underexplored field of zoonotic diseases. Limited phenotypic analyses
have made definitive diagnosis of CWD difficult, even though early diagnosis is crucial to reducing spread of
disease in wildlife and aiding in understanding the zoonotic capabilities. We propose two aims to address this
deficit of knowledge. In the first, we will establish comprehensive phenotyping profiling in cervidized mouse
models (with CWD modulating genetics of mule deer). Extensive behavioral assessments will be performed,
clinical biomarkers tracked, and a peripheral organ study will be performed to understand the course of disease
better, thereby, contributing new strain information and early diagnostic tools which may inform strategies for
management and therapies in the future. In the second, we will probe transmissibility of CWD to humans using
novel knock-in mice carrying human PRNP inoculated with CWD. Innovation: We will develop new clinical
capabilities in mouse models to explore the mechanisms, progression, and transmissibility of CWD. The
uniqueness of this project is twofold. First, phenotyping assessments have been limited for CWD mouse models
and have not translated to better or earlier diagnosis in wildlife. Due to the limitations with current methods, it is
also still unknown if this disease is zoonotic. This will be the first comprehensive investigation of this type
regarding CWD. Second, a limited number of studies in mouse models have been performed on the PRNP
variant chosen, a particularly highly disease resistant polymorphism found in wild mule deer. Our studies of
PRNP variants will aid in determining mechanisms of disease resistance and transmissibility factors.
Significance: Immediate significance is in providing guidelines for earlier and efficient detection of prion disease
manifestations. Additional significance: Investigating the phenotypes of mice with CWD modulating genetics may
contribute vital information regarding disease characteristics already occurring in wild mule deer which may affect
species barriers and disease outcomes."
10771509,"Alterations and Renovations: Summary
The overall goal of the Center for Integrated Biomedical and Rural Health Research is to strengthen the
biomedical research infrastructure in Montana with a focus on the central, multi-disciplinary theme of Integrated
Biomedical and Rural Health Research. As noted throughout the application, integrated research is generally
defined as interdisciplinary research that incorporates, or integrates, basic and translational research with
anticipated applications, whereas rural health research is most often focused on equity and access to healthcare
more than on the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. We propose to establish the Center for
Integrated Biomedical and Rural Health Research (CIB-RHR) as the only interdisciplinary research center in the
state of Montana to combine the basic and translational research strength of the only independent nonprofit
biomedical research institute in the state, with the training opportunities and research resources of the only
nonprofit medical school in the state, and the clinical strength of the largest comprehensive health provider
system in central Montana. The Alterations and Renovations, proposed here, are critical improvements to our
mouse phenotyping facilities, a central part of the translation of basic science to preclinical models and clinical
applications. The result is that we can optimize and expand services available within the Gene Editing and Mouse
Model Assessment (GEMMA) Core by adding a Gait Analysis system, which will be used by multiple COBRE
projects, and an in vivo bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging system that will accommodate current and
future COBRE projects and increase capacity for multidisciplinary basic and translational research across a
broad range of biomedical fields. To accommodate these upgrades for phenotyping, we renovate the space that
will house the expanded capabilities. Given the vital importance of mouse phenotyping to all of the proposed
COBRE projects and the long-term objectives of the GEMMA Core and the Center for Integrated Biomedical and
Rural Health Research, we propose Alterations and Renovations that will make significant improvements to our
mouse assessment facilities and ensure research rigor through more consistent and reproducible data."
10771563,"Abstract
 Drug addiction is an intractable psychiatric disorder exerting a deleterious impact on public health in the
United States and beyond. Influences of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) on neuropsychiatric disorders are
recognized, and several studies supported that the gut microbiome plays a massive role in brain-behavior
function. A common variant in the gene that encodes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Val66Met) is of
considerable interest due to the extensive role of BDNF in neurodevelopment and opioid abuse. In particular,
there is a gap in knowledge about the relationship between addiction and gut microbiome in adolescence.
Therefore, it is still unclear how oxycodone affects the gut microbiome and metabolome in adolescents, one
potential mechanism that may explain the link between brain-gut opioid-induced dysbiosis is BDNF. The goal
of this proposal is to validate the role of BDNF in adolescent microbiome dysbiosis caused by chronic
oxycodone use. The specific aims of this proposal will serve as a transitional career steppingstone and
preliminary research for R01 proposals to determine 1) adolescent gut microbiome changes associated with
oxycodone dependence and withdrawal in Val66met mice, 2) establish the therapeutic value of fecal
microbiota transplants (FMT) on BDNF Val66Met mice on oxycodone-induced-dysbiosis, and 3) to analyze
levels of SCFA and kynurenine metabolites in a non-invasive in vivo model of voluntary oral oxycodone-self
administration (SA). The novelty and innovation of this proposal will cover gaps in knowledge about the effects
of oxycodone-induced dysbiosis on adolescent microbiomes. It will also be the first study to evaluate the direct
effect of BDNF deficiency and opioid-induced dysbiosis in context with the adolescent microbiome-gut-brain
axis. This understanding is needed for the development of future interventions to prevent or treat substance
abuse. Finally, the project will support the Research Project Leader’s future success in targeting extramural
funding (e.g., NIH R25 or R01 funding) and establishing a new direction of research program."
10772568,"Specialized cellular identity requires unique protein expression control. Such expression control in gametes and
reproductive neurons ensures fertility. By studying cell- and tissue-level genetic code regulation, we discovered
multiple links to reproductive biology. Specifically, we found that in both flies (Drosophila) and humans, the germ
cells of the testis but not the ovary upregulate numerous mRNAs that are enriched in rarely used codons. We
then revealed that rare codons restrict the ribosomal protein RpL10Aa to the fly testis to ensure fertility. Few
other fly cell types express a rare codon reporter outside of the testis, with an additional example being most
types of neurons of the brain. From genetic screening, we identified the conserved mRNA binding proteins Not3
and Orb2 as critical regulators of rare codon-dependent expression in both germ cells of the testis and in neurons
throughout the brain. Notably, Orb2 has two main functions- ensuring spermatogenesis and control of mating
behavior in reproductive neurons of the brain. Thus, our data are revealing important rare codon regulation of
reproduction in both male gametes and neurons (including those neurons that control reproduction). In this
proposal, we capitalize on our model and robust preliminary data to find new rare codon-dependent regulation
in the testis and brain, and to define its function in fertility and reproductive behavior. The significance of our
proposed work lies in the conservation of our findings in human testis biology and the impact on reproductive
biology. Further significance is in the conservation of the new regulators of rare codon expression to be studied
(Not 3 and Orb2). Our studies are innovative because we will study testis/neuron biology and reproduction in a
new way, from the perspective of tissue-specific interpretation of the redundant code. In Aim1, we will identify
the role of testis- and neuron-specific tRNA levels and mRNA stability on rare codon expression. To answer this
question, we will determine the impact of rare codon tRNA levels, rates of mRNA decay, and the CCR4-Not de-
adenylation complex on rare codon expression. We will compare each of these mRNA translation inputs in the
testis vs. ovary and neurons vs. neural progenitors. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanism of Orb2 rare codon
regulation in the testis and neurons. To do so, in the testis and neurons we will identify critical Orb2 domains
required for rare codon expression, determine the role of rare codons in mRNA/Orb2 interactions, and identify
rare codon-enriched Orb2 targets involved in fertility and reproductive behavior. In Aim 3, we will define the
function of specific rare codon-derived proteins in the testis and neurons. To do so, we will further our mechanistic
study of the testis-specific RpL10Aa in gametogenesis and fertility and use candidate genetics and ribosome
profiling to find new examples where rare codons direct expression and/or function, focusing on testis-specific
expression in gametogenesis/fertility, and male neuron-specific expression in reproductive behavior (courtship).
Together, our proposed work will reveal new insight into how an ancient feature of life, the redundancy of the
genetic code, regulates testes and neuron protein expression in the context of reproduction."

Rectal cancer is a common cancer and leading cause of cancer death. The majority of rectal cancer patients
are diagnosed with stage II or III locally advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total
mesorectal excision is the standard of care for treating these patients. However, the response to neoadjuvant
therapy is highly heterogeneous. While approximately 20% patients achieve a pathologic complete response
and long-term disease control, over 30% patients will develop distant metastasis despite multimodality
treatment. Because total mesorectal excision is associated with significant morbidity and poor quality of life,
organ preservation (i.e., watchful waiting without surgery) is recommended for patients who are deemed to
achieve a complete response. On the other hand, for patients at high risk of recurrence, total neoadjuvant
therapy with induction chemotherapy is increasingly used for early eradication of micrometastases to improve
cure rate. The successful implementation of these two highly promising treatment strategies (organ
preservation and total neoadjuvant therapy) hinges on the precise knowledge of (1) which patients will have a
pathologic complete response; and (2) which patients will develop distant metastasis. Unfortunately, current
clinical tools are rather crude and do not allow for accurate outcome prediction on an individual basis, leading
to over-treatment in some patients and under-treatment in others. There is a pressing unmet need for reliable
prognostic and predictive biomarkers to guide personalized treatment of rectal cancer.
To address this unmet need, we adopt a rational approach for prognosis prediction by developing radiomic and
deep learning models that are informed and guided by established knowledge of the tumor pathobiology.
Additionally, we propose novel approaches to analyze serial images for predicting pathologic response to
neoadjuvant therapy. Further, by leveraging the complementary value of imaging and blood-based biomarkers,
we will construct integrative models to improve outcome prediction. To establish clinical validity, we will use a
large retrospective dataset for model training and conduct rigorous prospective validation. If successful, this
project will lead to risk-adaptive and response-driven personalized treatment strategies, which may ultimately
improve outcomes for patients with rectal cancer."

Activity patterns in the brain establish the manner in which sensory information is perceived and salience and
valence are assigned. Disruptions of these patterns through genetic mutations are likely a major cause of
neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illness more broadly defined. The midbrain dopamine system plays
an essential role in salience and valence assignment and mutations within several ion channels known to
regulate action potential firing patterns by dopamine neurons have been identified in neurodevelopmental
disorders, yet virtually nothing is known of the impact of these mutations on dopamine physiology, circuit
function, and behavior. We have demonstrated that genetic inactivation of different genes associated with
mental illness can have differential effects on dopamine neuron physiology and phenotypic outcomes.
Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia are represented by a mosaic of phenotypic
outcomes that gives rise to the spectral nature of these disorders. Disruption of ion channel function, or
channelopathies are a major factor in disorder etiology. Of these, potassium channels are the most diverse
group and are among the most broadly implicated in channelopathies. Dopamine neurons express a suite of
voltage and non-voltage sensitive potassium channels that regulate the action potential waveform, synaptic
integration, and neurotransmitter release. Based on these diverse functions, we propose that elucidating the
physiological and phenotypic outcomes associate with a loss of function of these channels in dopamine
neurons will provide important insight into how disruption of these channels yields a mosaic of phenotypes. To
this end, we have developed a single viral vector-based system for the rapid mutagenesis of potassium
channels in dopamine neurons and demonstrated that inactivation of different channels yields both overlapping
and non-overlapping phenotypes in mice. The experiments proposed here will further elucidate common and
uncommon phenotypic outcomes and the impact of ion channels on the operation of distinct dopamine
subsystems."

Herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that infect almost all mammals, including humans, making them
highly effective pathogens. A hallmark event in the herpesvirus replication cycle requires immature capsids to
bud through the inner nuclear membrane (INM) to the perinuclear space in a process termed nuclear egress.
This essential first step in viral exit is mediated by the conserved viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) and is the
focus of this proposal. The ability of the NEC to oligomerize on membranes is important for capsid budding, yet
the conformational changes undergone to perform this are unknown. The long-term goal of this research is to
determine how disruption of NEC oligomerization perturbs conformational changes that drive budding (Aim 1)
and develop peptide-based screening platforms for identifying novel NEC inhibitors (Aim 2). This work stems
from a central hypothesis, formulated from substantial preliminary data, that the NEC can be inhibited,
specifically by perturbing NEC oligomerization. The scientific premise of this work is to formulate a detailed
mechanism of herpesvirus nuclear egress to inform the design of innovative therapeutic compounds. A
combination of cutting-edge biophysical techniques, including cryoelectron microscopy/tomography (cryoEM/T),
along with mutational and functional approaches will be used to identify the molecular interactions undergone by
Herpes Simplex NEC during budding and to identify routes for inhibiting this process. The K99 phase of this
proposal is structured to not only answer these fundamental questions surrounding herpesvirus nuclear egress
but also provide a platform for transitioning to an independent research career centered around identifying
small molecule and peptide inhibitors targeting specific protein-protein interactions occurring at various stages
of herpesviral replication. This type of protein targeting will provide a novel means for determining specific protein
function within the virus and expand the repertoire of therapeutic targets available for the treatment of this
disease. Focus during this phase will be on fine-tuning expertise in cryoEM/T by investigating NEC mutants
designed to perturb oligomerization (in collaboration with cryoEM/T expert Dr. Zhiheng Yu at the HHMI Janelia
Research Campus), gain instruction in virological techniques to perform functional studies on NEC mutants (in
collaboration with herpes biology experts Dr. Richard Roller at the University of Iowa and Dr. David Knipe at
Harvard Medical School) and establish peptide screening platforms (under advisement from Dr. Joshua Kritzer
at Tufts University – an expert in therapeutic peptide design). Under the guidance of an extremely qualified
mentor (Dr. Katya Heldwein – an expert in structural virology) and co-mentor (Dr. Ralph Isberg – an expert in
postdoctoral training for successful academic careers), within the supportive institutional environment of Tufts
University, this proposal ensures a timely transition to leading a successful independent academic career."

Use of remote data collection methodology in developmental research has increased significantly, in part due to in-person data collection stoppage that occurred at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. These kinds of data collection methods are likely to decrease barriers to participation for families, increase sample sociodemographic diversity, and could potentially address common problems in the field related to statistical power and sampling bias, all significant issues associated with construct and ecological validity. The central objective of this proposal is to support the rigorous application and validation of remote infant testing methodology of early cognitive development when infants are 4, 8, and 12-month of age. We will recruit 300
families who are traditionally underrepresented in developmental neuroscience research to participate in this longitudinal study. The primary aims of this project are to (i) establish and validate remote physiological and behavioral measurements of infant attention and memory skills, (ii) investigate the impact of caregiver-infant physiological co-regulation on infant outcomes, and (iii) evaluate predictors of infant attention phenotypes and longitudinal associations with socioemotional outcomes and autism risk. This proposal integrates multi-level data to improve measurement of infant cognition within the home and will substantially enrich our understanding of developmental trajectories and mechanisms across socio-demographically diverse environments and contexts, leading to increased precision for prevention and intervention efforts."

Recently, high-throughput spatial omics technologies have made it possible to simultaneously measure close-
to-cell-level gene or protein expressions and spatial locations of these cells within a tissue or organ. These new
technologies have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate tissue architecture and cell-cell
communications. Although multiple computational tools for spatial omics data analysis have recently become
available, a rigorous statistical framework for designing spatial omics experiments is still missing in the literature.
Researchers need to determine various experimental design parameters, such as the sequencing depth and the
number and sizes of Field-Of-View (FoV), in planning a spatial omics experiment. These choices affect whether
key goals of spatial omics experiments can be achieved, e.g., identification of tissue architecture and cell-cell
communications. In this proposal, we aim to develop a rigorous power analysis framework for spatial omics
experiments across various experimental designs and profiling technologies. The assembled team has strong
and complementary expertise in development of statistical frameworks for power analysis and design of high
throughput sequencing studies, statistical modeling of spatial omics and scRNA-seq data, technology
development in spatial omics, spatial statistics, bioinformatics tool development, pulmonary science, and lung
fibrosis and relevant age-related mechanisms. We will achieve the proposed goal by implementing three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a rigorous power analysis framework for multi-sample and longitudinal
sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics experiments (e.g., 10X Genomics Visium). In Aim 2, we will develop
a statistical power analysis framework for imaging-based spatial transcriptomics and proteomics experiments
(e.g., seqFISH+, MERFISH, CODEX) in single- and multi-sample and longitudinal settings. In Aim 3, we will
develop an interactive web interface for power analysis of spatial omics experiments and utilize and validate it
for designing spatial omics experiments for lung cells. The proposed power analysis framework will be developed
and evaluated using simulation data, spatial omics data in the public domain, and in-house spatial omics datasets
from collaborators. The to-be-developed statistical framework in this project, along with the open-source software
implementing this framework, will provide essential tools for the optimal design of future spatial omics
experiments."

Life expectancy is increasing, and consequently, the burden of chronic age-related disease is also increasing.
Interventions and treatments that target the fundamental biological process of human aging have the potential
to mitigate risk of multiple diseases faced by our aging population. To develop interventions targeting the aging
process, one must identify predictive factors and biomarkers associated with the aging clinical endpoints. By
definition, the development of aging-based conditions and diseases takes time and requires a great deal of
follow-up time. To accelerate research in human aging, biomarkers of human aging and prognostic biomarkers
of healthy human aging are desperately needed. Without reliable biomarkers, early-stage drug development is
severely limited. In this application, we propose a framework to identify biomarkers of healthy human aging
using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods applied to a wide range of deeply phenotyped studies that
collected data from humans and non-humans. We have assembled a team with deep expertise in clinical
research of aging, genetic epidemiology, biology of aging, and AI. To identify biomarkers of aging through the
integrative analysis of omic data with AI, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 (R21, first stage).
Assemble datasets from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Longevity Consortium (LC) with multiple
omics to test AI methods and to identify biomarkers associated with human aging. Aim 2 (R21, first stage).
Test biologically informed AI Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with FHS and LC data to integrate omic
data, predict outcomes, and identify predictive omic features. Aim 3 (R33, second stage). Apply models from

between biomarkers and longevity phenotypes through Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis and cell
culture experiments."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a rapidly growing epidemic of liver disease that can predispose
affected individuals to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Strategies for targeting cellular mediators
of liver fibrosis, such as activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), remain limited due to an incomplete
understanding of the mechanisms governing myofibroblastic differentiation and the signaling between liver
parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell (NPC) types. The importance of microenvironmental signal crosstalk,
including interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM) protein composition and mechanical stiffness in cell
phenotypic alterations, is increasingly appreciated. Although animal models have provided insights into NASH,
significant differences across species in drug metabolism and disease pathways exist. Thus, there is a need for
human-relevant in vitro approaches that enable the investigation of hepatocellular phenotypes within
physiological and NASH-like microenvironments and could facilitate the high-throughput discovery of novel
therapeutics. The goal of this project is to implement engineered culture platforms for selectively modulating
microenvironmental signals and utilize these systems to reveal key phenotypic programming pathways and
interaction mechanisms within the context of a NASH-like microenvironment. Our approach will enable
hypothesis-driven studies incorporating controlled perturbations of extracellular signals. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the microenvironmental regulation of myofibroblastic phenotype. Utilizing defined ECM compositions
and mechanical stiffness regimes in engineered cultures, we will examine the role of epigenetic gene regulatory
mechanisms and test the hypothesis that combinatorial microenvironmental cues regulate epigenetic changes
that are critical for the myofibroblastic programming of human hepatic stellate cells within the context of normal
and NASH-like soluble triggers. In Aim 2, we will examine the influence of ECM composition and stiffness on
Kupffer cell (KC) and primary human hepatocyte (PHH) functions including reciprocal intercellular interactions
and cooperative effects of NASH-like soluble stimuli. Our approach will facilitate modular control and
deconvolution of the effects of ECM composition, substrate stiffness, and soluble signals. In Aim 3, we will
develop and implement multicellular 3D liver microtissues for the systematic analysis of multicellular phenotype
regulation in the context of disease-like ECM alterations. We will investigate heterotypic cellular crosstalk
mechanisms between non-parenchymal cell types (HSC, KC, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells), and their
collective influence on primary human hepatocyte functions. We will further establish capabilities for assessing
NASH-relevant therapeutics within the multicellular liver platform. The proposed studies will provide a)
fundamental insights into the microenvironmental cues and signaling mechanisms underlying cellular phenotypic
alterations in NASH, which could aid the development of novel drug therapies, and b) novel engineered liver
culture platforms that can serve as enabling tools for a broad range of physiological and disease outcomes."
10745912,"Cartilage damage is extremely common in the active-duty and Veteran populations, both by trauma and wear-
and-tear. These initial injuries compromise the biophysical and biochemical environment around cells,
characterized by softening of the surrounding microenvironment and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
The softer cellular microenvironment leads to volumetric and morphological changes of the cartilage cells, or
chondrocytes, and the pro-inflammatory signaling leads to the continued degradation of the surrounding matrix.
Combined, these early degenerative changes lead to aberrant cell behavior and a vicious deteriorative process,
leading to progressive cartilage wear with time and culminating in osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a significant burden
on the Veteran population, causing pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life. Halting the degenerative process
early in its progression, by specifically rehabilitating the cell and its surrounding environment, represents an
impactful and innovative approach to preventing or delaying the onset of OA. Thus, the overarching goal of this
proposal is to utilize a novel hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel system to both fortify damaged cartilage tissue and
provide persistent presentation of inflammation-inhibiting peptides, all with the goal of preventing the progression
of OA. This goal will be tested with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the restorative effect of PCM fortification on chondrocyte cytoskeletal organization and
mechano-transduction. First, a library of HA formulations and applications will be developed and tested on
damaged cartilage tissue to achieve 3-4 levels of PCM fortification. Then, in a cartilage explant culture model,
the impact of fortification on chondrocyte volume regulation, morphology, cytoskeletal composition and
organization, and mechano-transductive properties will be determined and compared to healthy cells.
Aim 2: Establish whether the combination of PCM fortification and persistent inflammatory inhibition prevents
catabolism and restores chondrocyte homeostasis. HA will be conjugated with cell-instructive peptides that mimic
an active sequence of IL-1 receptor antagonist (inhibits inflammation). In cartilage explants, the relative effects
of fortification and inflammatory-inhibiting peptide, and their combination, will be tested on inflammatory cytokine
release, matrix breakdown and loss, and matrix synthesis. Specifically, focus will be maintained on restoring the
balance of matrix synthesis and deposition (anabolism) with degradation (catabolism).
Aim 3: Evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effect of combined reinforcement and anti-inflammatory peptide
presentation on cartilage deterioration. In a Yucatan minipig model, partial-thickness defects will be treated with
fortification or a combination of fortification and anti-inflammatory peptide. Functional multi-scale biomechanical
testing and matrix retention and quality will be assessed at 1- and 3-months post-treatment, to characterize
whether early markers of cartilage deterioration were prevented or reduced.
This research will enhance knowledge and understanding of the early degenerative changes to chondrocytes
and their surrounding matrix, and directly develops a novel therapeutic strategy to mechanically stabilize
cartilage and deliver cell-instructive cues to prevent, or even reverse, aberrant chondrocyte behavior.
Furthermore, the multi-scale, multi-modal nature of the proposed work uses these cell-level outcomes to drive
tissue-scale function and rehabilitation. Such a therapy would be monumental in the cartilage injury and
osteoarthritis treatment in the Veteran population, improving activity levels and quality of life, and delaying or
preventing the need for total joint replacement. Finally, the proposed CDA-2 research combined with the
proposed mentoring and training plan, will allow Dr. Patel to acquire a plethora of new skills and knowledge, and
position him well for a transition to a successful VA-based, independent research career."
10755245,"Project Summary
Epithelial cell polarization is an essential biological process, serving many physiological roles including tissue
morphogenesis and wound healing. A defining feature of polarization is the separation of cell plasma membrane
(PM) lipids and proteins into apical and basolateral compartments between which molecular exchange is
restricted. Decades ago, the apical PM was found to be enriched in saturated lipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol.
Mechanistic hypotheses to explain the biogenesis and unique composition of the apical PM include self-
assembling membrane domains (i.e., lipid rafts), specific protein sorting motifs, and post-translational
modifications mediating protein sorting. However, neither the detailed composition nor the mechanisms of protein
and lipid sorting between PM domains in epithelial cells have been resolved. The lipid profile of the basolateral
PM remains unresolved, leaving doubts about the differentiation and lipid separation of the apical and basolateral
PM. The general determinants of protein sorting are poorly understood, with past studies focusing on either
specific proteins or trafficking machinery. Importantly, the apical PM hosts an extensive extracellular glycocalyx
consisting of glycolipids, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides, which can be crosslinked by sugar binding proteins
called lectins natively present in the extracellular space. The role of these glycocalyx molecules on protein sorting
has not been revealed, despite a major fraction of apical proteins being glycosylated. Finally, the apical PM of
polarized epithelia takes on highly outward-curved membrane shapes such as cilia or microvilli, but must also
be simultaneously capable of forming inward membrane invaginations for cell signaling and uptake from the
extracellular space. The driving forces for the formation of these highly-curved membrane structures remain
undetermined. We will investigate these knowledge gaps in membrane and epithelial biology. In Aim 1, we will
use advanced lipidomics and imaging techniques to characterize the changes in lipid organization, membrane
composition, and membrane properties during the cellular polarization process. We hypothesize that the apical
PM will be enriched in highly saturated lipids and glycolipids relative to the basolateral PM, with apical PM
biophysical properties reflecting a raft-enriched environment. In Aim 2, we will systematically evaluate the
transmembrane protein structural determinants of apical versus basolateral sorting including transmembrane
domain features, protein raft affinity, and glycosylation. We hypothesize that these protein features cooperatively
direct protein sorting to the apical PM. In Aim 3, we will explore the role of the apical PM glycocalyx in driving
membrane bending. We hypothesize that lectin-mediated interactions control the curvature and organization of
membranes. Successful execution of these aims will address several largely open questions in membrane
biology about how lipid composition, membrane properties, and protein structural features coordinate to organize
composition and structure of the polarized cell PM."

institutions to fund important new pilot projects with promising translational potential, to generate sufficient
preliminary data for an independently funded NIH grant. This is a crucial part of our SPORE as it provides a
pipeline and testing ground for novel substrates for translational impact. These projects are intended to last one
year with the possibility of a second year of support with the demonstration of sufficient progress and are
budgeted with the intention that the majority of the funds be spent on supplies, rather than salary support. Pilot
projects that make significant progress and are deemed to be capable of high translational impact will be
considered for promotion to full SPORE projects. To be eligible, the applicant must have a current academic
appointment at any of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Applicants must hold an M.D., or Ph.D. degree or
both. The applicants are expected to provide evidence of a significant research commitment (at least 15% effort
commitment) to ensure that the proposal can in fact be addressed in an effective and productive way. As many
as 10 Research Awards will be funded annually, two will be Developmental Research Projects supported by
funds budgeted within the SPORE, and the remainder through funds available through The Patrick C. Walsh

10878908,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Specifically, this proposal focuses on novel new small molecules that inhibit both the blood and liver
stages of malaria infection. The causative pathogen – Plasmodium spp. – was responsible for 241,000,000 cases
that resulted in 627,000 deaths in 2020. Plasmodium spp. drug-resistant infections leave few good choices for
physicians and put at risk the productivity and the lives of those infected. A clear case has been made for new
drugs to treat these infections through the discovery and development of novel therapeutic strategies. These
strategies would optimally be dual stage, targeting the blood stage for treatment and the liver stage for
prophylaxis.
 The innovative strategy in this proposal builds on the technology of machine learning models for the
prediction of novel dual-stage antimalarial small molecules with significant potential as drug discovery entities.
Such a computational approach to seed the discovery of small molecule malaria parasite inhibitors with dual-
stage efficacy has only been reported by us in 2022. The approach begins with preliminary data around two novel
antimalarial small molecules with demonstrated in vitro efficacy versus both blood and liver stages of Plasmodium
spp. infection and a lack of significant cytotoxicity to cultured liver cells. These molecules were derived from a
set of hits discovered with a random forest model trained with high-throughput screening data. The molecules
are representative of novel chemotypes for dual-stage antimalarials and, thus, offer a high probability of
modulating new targets that are critical throughout the parasite’s lifecycle. This initial machine learning effort will
be significantly expanded with a range of model types and a different and larger commercial library to predict a
set of new hit compounds.
 Two validated hits, meeting in vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity criteria and maintaining wild type in vitro
efficacy versus a set of drug-resistant parasite strains, will be profiled for key molecular properties such as mouse
liver microsomal stability, aqueous solubility, and mouse pharmacokinetic profile. These data along with the
existing in vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluations will guide the evolution of each hit with a goal of preparing
one or more analogs with a composite profile to enable downstream in vivo efficacy evaluation in infection
models. A novel combination of medicinal chemistry and machine learning will be leveraged to afford such
molecules."
10878883,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heterozygous, pathogenic variants in POU4F1 were recently reported by our group to cause a novel ataxia
syndrome (Webb et al., 2021). This neurological disorder is characterized by childhood onset ataxia, intention
tremor, and hypotonia, and affected individuals have global developmental delay with mildly impaired
intellectual development and speech delay or learning difficulties. POU4F1, also known as BRN3A, encodes a
class IV POU-domain containing transcription factor expressed in the developing and adult brain. Little is
known about the role POU4F1 plays in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal survival in human
neurons. Therefore, we propose to use iPSC to generate cellular models of the human brain to interrogate the
consequences of POU4F1 haploinsufficiency. Our specific aims in this proposal are to 1) determine
transcriptional signatures, epigenetic status, and functional abnormalities resulting from POU4F1
haploinsufficiency in iPSC – derived neurons; 2) assess the impact of POU4F1 haploinsufficiency in a iPSC
model of the developing brain using cortical organoids; and 3) create a patient registry for POU4F1-related
ataxia and better define the clinical features of this newly identified disorder. Taken together, these studies will
uncover the pathophysiology, disease mechanism, and clinical spectrum of disease of POU4F1-related ataxia
and address fundamental questions of human neurodevelopmental biology."

10901909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is predicted to become the second deadliest cancer within the
next 10 years. Investigations into novel mechanisms of PDAC transformation are urgently needed as no
effective PDAC treatment currently exists. Transcriptional regulation during transformation is multifaceted with
genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations playing vital interconnected roles. A key unelucidated facet of
gene regulation in the context of transformation is the molecular mechanism which mediates changes in
chromatin reorganization. ChIP-seq and ChIP-PCR studies in an inducible model of oncogenic KRAS, a key
initiating factor in PDAC, demonstrate a relocation of heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery. These lamina
associated domains (LADs) are enriched in H3K9me2 and positioned at the nuclear lamina. ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq identified loss of active enhancer regions incorporated into LADs and downregulation of LAD
associated genes, respectively. To investigate the mechanism regulating the assembly of LADs downstream of
oncogenic KRAS we performed several molecular and biochemical studies. We conducted a screening BioID
utilizing Lamin A, a core component of the nuclear lamina known to interact with LADs, as bait. Lamin A BioID
identified a novel myosin, Myosin 18a (MYO18a), enriched at the nuclear lamina under oncogenic KRAS
signaling. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased nuclear localization of MYO18a and enrichment at the
lamina upon KRAS activation. Biochemical analysis validated MYO18a-Lamin A interaction and confirmed
MYO18a interaction with chromatin. siRNA knockdown for MYO18a rescued expression of genes associated
with oncogenic KRAS-mediated LADs. These data lead us to our central hypothesis that MYO18a acts as a
downstream effector of KRAS to modulate chromatin positioning at the nuclear lamina to silence oncogenic
gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments in parallel to
detect MYO18a associated LADs in in vitro models of PDAC. LAD assembly will then be investigated in the
presence/absence of MYO18a. We will also develop MYO18a genetic engineered mouse models to explore
the role of MYO18a and nuclear MYO18a in PDAC development and progression. Further study into this
mechanism can provide valuable insight into gene regulation in the transformation process and will identify
potentially druggable targets."
10914281,"Project Summary
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a median 5-year survival of only 11%, and early
diagnosis of PDAC is recognized as one of the highest priority areas by the NCI, with a focus on identification of
more sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging strategies in discernible preneoplastic lesions. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the capability of non-invasively detecting advanced pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) precursor lesions in pancreas prior to invasive disease in human subjects using
two magnetic resonance imaging-based tools: a) hyperpolarized metabolic imaging (HP MR) and b) acidoCEST
MRI. Hyperpolarization increases the signal of conventional MRI by over 10,000-fold. AcidoCEST MRI uses a
clinically approved contrast agent to quantitatively measure the extracellular pH (pHe) in the tumor
microenvironment. The application of dual acidoCEST and HP MR is innovative as they interrogate two different
but related biochemical features of PanINs: extracellular pH (pHe) and dynamic metabolic flux (HP lactate-to-
pyruvate and HP alanine-to-pyruvate ratios), respectively. Together, this approach provides an exciting
opportunity to identify and understand early metabolic aberrations and biomarkers associated with these early
lesions, to enable detection of advanced pancreatic preneoplastic lesions as well as pancreatic cancer at the
smallest size, for which no methods of detection currently exist.
 This is a transitional research proposal with multiple sponsors for the F99 phase. Including the
laboratories of Pratip Bhattacharya, Ph.D. in the Department of Cancer Systems Imaging and Florencia
McAllister, M.D. in the Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, both at MD Anderson Cancer Center with the
following two aims. Aim 1, the F99 phase, is to demonstrate and validate the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic
hyperpolarized metabolic biomarkers in the detection and monitoring the progression of pancreatic premalignant
lesions to PDAC and compare these to a chronic pancreatitis model. Aim 2, the K00 phase research direction,
is to demonstrate detection of PanIN with a combination of HP MR and acidoCEST and to determine the efficacy
of immunoprevention on PanIN models. The success of this proposal has the potential for leading to practice
changing recommendations for non-invasively detecting and monitoring advanced PanIN lesions and incipient
pancreatic cancer, as well as to non-invasively assess the immunopreventive measures for cancer prevention.
 Also included in this proposal is a fellowship training plan to be conducted in both the F99 and K00
phases. They include additional training in metabolomic data analysis, research skills in small animal handling,
histological and imaging techniques, public speaking, and scientific writing during the F99 phase. For the K00
phase the training plan include establishing dual-imaging modalities, develop immunopreventative strategies,
mentoring and teaching future scientists, and inter-departmental or institutional networking."

 Vocal fold (VF) hyperkeratosis – an accumulation of epithelial surface keratin resulting in clinical
leukoplakia – is primarily managed using destructive techniques that risk iatrogenic injury, fibrosis, and voice
impairment. Given the potential morbidity of biopsy and lesion removal, there is a compelling need for new
approaches to the workup and treatment of VF leukoplakic disorders that are non-destructive and grounded in
disease pathophysiology. In the current application, we propose translational research that will advance this
goal. Our preliminary data indicate that the essential nutrient vitamin A is a key regulator of epithelial health
and that systemic vitamin A deficiency can directly contribute to hyperkeratosis. Based on evidence of vitamin
A’s importance to VF stellate and epithelial cell biology, and its direct relevance to VF hyperkeratosis, we
propose three Specific Aims that will advance this research area towards greater clinical applicability by: (i)
assessing the systemic vitamin A status and lesion histopathology of patients with VF hyperkeratosis, and (ii)
examining vitamin A trafficking to, and uptake by, normal and hyperkeratotic VF mucosa in a rat model. Our
overarching goal is to determine if there is a pathophysiologic rationale for vitamin A supplementation in the
treatment of VF hyperkeratosis. Such a therapy would be transformative – both as a first-line approach for
patients who require conservative management, as well as an adjuvant therapy in patients for whom surgical
treatment is indicated."

 The molecular mechanisms by which stem cell proliferation is precisely controlled during the course
of regeneration are poorly understood. Namely, how a damaged tissue senses when to terminate the
regeneration process, inactivates stem cell mitotic activity, and organizes ECM integrity remain fundamental
unanswered questions. Uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells in regenerative tissues can result in tumor
formation. The Drosophila midgut intestinal stem cell (ISC) has recently emerged as an attractive model
system to study tissue homeostasis and regeneration. This is due to striking similarities in genetic control
and cellular composition between the Drosophila and mammalian digestive systems, and powerful genetic
tools available in this model. Importantly, Drosophila ISC proliferation is promoted in response to tissue
damage to stimulate tissue repair. Using this model system, a number of studies have been conducted to
reveal the pathways that activate ISC proliferation.
 Despite a wealth of knowledge on the activation of proliferative capacity of stem cells, it is largely
unknown how the tissue properly down-regulates stem cell proliferation at the end of regeneration and how
this process is linked to epithelial remodeling. We recently established the Drosophila ISCs as an excellent
model to study the molecular basis for regeneration termination. Using RNA-seq, we identified sets of
genes and pathways that are up/down-regulated at different phases of regeneration. Among these, we
found that dMOV10, a component of the microRNA (miRNA) gene silencing complex, is required for the
proper termination of the regeneration process. Further analyses identified direct target mRNAs of
dMOV10-containing miRISC, including baboon (the Type I receptor of activin signaling) and two major non-
integrin ECM receptors, Syndecan (a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan) and Dystroglycan (an
integral membrane component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex). In addition to the identification of
dMOV10 as a termination stage-specific gene, this same RNA-seq analysis showed that key components
for septate junctions, and actin regulators are specifically upregulated during regeneration and return to
normal level at a late stage.
 In this proposal, we will define these key molecules in stem cell inactivation and ECM remodeling at
the termination stage of Drosophila midgut regeneration through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1.
Determine the role of septate junction components in midgut regeneration. Aim 2. Define the role of Sdc
and Dg in ECM remodeling. Aim 3. Define the global landscape of the miRNA-mediated network."

established state-based occupational epidemiology efforts.
The WestON meeting aligns with several NIOSH NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Program
goals, including Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing (AFF); Mining; Oil and Gas Extraction; and
Respiratory Health. In addition, the WestON meeting aligns with the goals of the NIOSH Health
Hazard Evaluation Program and Worker Health Surveillance Health. By bringing partners
together to present and discuss topics of scientific and public health importance, the WestON
meeting also aligns with the NIOSH 2019-2023 Strategic Goals to reduce occupational immune,
infectious, and dermal disease; occupational musculoskeletal disorders; occupational
respiratory disease; improve workplace safety to reduce traumatic injuries; and promote safe
and healthy work design and well-being. Within the NORA Sectors noted above, topics at the

Short-term outcomes include participant demographics which help assess the representation by
all western state health departments; general satisfaction with the meeting; usefulness of each
session of the meeting; changes in knowledge/abilities per and post meeting; representation
and participation by all 19 western state health departments; and engagement by regional
ERCs, Agricultural Centers, universities and worker organizations. Intermediate (medium-term)
outcomes include improving occupational injury surveillance in western states; increasing
occupational injury prevention interventions; identifying western occupational health priorities
and issues; increasing completion of Occupational Health Indicators by Western states; and
increasing collaborative publications and presentations at national conferences. The key long-
term outcome of the WestON meeting is to increase the occupational epidemiology capacity in

10769675,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TRANSGENIC
The mission of the Transgenic Shared Resource (TGC) is to provide Salk Cancer Center (SCC) members access
to cutting-edge technologies for creating genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). GEMMs are critical
tools that enable researchers to model human cancer, to analyze and functionally manipulate specific genes,
and to test potential therapeutic interventions. Established in 1994 with CCSG and Institutional funds, the facility
remains relevant to SCC researchers today. On average, the TGC serves 42% (13/31) of SCC members annually
who are responsible for 74% of all TGC services based on recharges. The TGC provides services for state-of-
the-art genome editing and to generate and maintain transgenic mice. These include: 1) the microinjection of
DNA constructs, CRISPR/Cas9, and lentiviral vectors into early mouse embryos, 2) microinjection of gene-
targeted mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into blastocysts, 3) in-vitro fertilization , 4) embryo and sperm
cryopreservation, 5) re-derivation of mouse lines provided from non-standard sources, 6) gene targeting in
mouse ES cells, 7) targeting vector design and construction, 8) de novo derivation of ES cell lines, and 9) ES
cell expansion and preparation for microinjection. In addition, the TGC offers services for the injection of human
ES cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines into immunodeficient mice to assess their ability to
form teratomas. The TGC develops new techniques and applications and provides immediate access to
individuals with prior knowledge of transgenic and knock out mouse models. For those lacking experience, the
TGC provides individual consultations, as well as group meetings, to discuss strategies for model development
and recent innovations in transgenic and gene targeting technologies that may be relevant to the researcher’s
goals. Overall, the transgenic and gene-targeting services provided by the TGC greatly increase the pace at
which mouse models can be generated, and at significantly lower cost, than commercial sources. All activities
of the TGC are overseen by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)."
10769728,"Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is
known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly
encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization,
amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in
various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across
multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal
burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions,
high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition,
they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the
significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of
these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.
 PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how
these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom
measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the
underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult
trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype
data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived,
exposure-based components.
 The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative
symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically
based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and
Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning
based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This
naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative
symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130
treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.
 Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological
markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for
understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation."
10769729,"Project Summary
This project evaluates the efficacy of using biomarkers carried by tumor-derived exosomes and other organelle-
derived extracellular vesicles to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from patients with benign pancreatic
disease. We will use high conductance dielectrophoresis-based technology to simultaneously recover different
types of these cancer-derived nanoparticles from individual samples of volume limited patient plasma. This will
enable access to volume restricted early stage cancer samples. This research will generate new knowledge
supporting the development of a nanoparticle-based biomarker panel for early and late stage pancreatic cancer
detection and will support the rationale to bring nanoparticle-based diagnostics to the clinical setting.
Pancreatic cysts are coincidently discovered with increasing frequency as the use of high resolution CT and MRI
imaging increases, with up to 9.3% of patients having an asymptomatic cyst. An invasive endoscopic ultrasound
guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS/FNA) is traditionally used to determine if the cyst is pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This has a high financial cost and associated health risk where 1/100 patients will
develop acute pancreatitis and 1/10 of these patients will die. Currently 60-76% of patients that undergo
EUS/FNA do not have pancreatic cancer. This signifies the unmet clinical need to develop a blood test to stratify
patients with pancreatic cysts into categories of high-probability and low-probability for having PDAC, where
high-probability would benefit from the EUS/FNA. Currently, no blood based PDAC biomarkers exist. Tumor-
derived nanoparticles offer a new source of potential PDAC related biomarkers. The challenge is that traditional
nanoparticle recovery methods for each nanoparticle type require plasma volumes that are too large to be
supported with currently available PDAC patient plasma samples. Our preliminary data now suggest that high
conductance dielectrophoresis (DEP) techniques can recover sufficient amounts of nanoparticle derived
biomarkers to detect precancerous lesions as well as differentiate early and late stage PDAC from controls and
requires only 30 µl of plasma. Each Aim will translate our DEP validation of individual biomarkers into a panel
that will be evaluated in a blinded cohort study consisting of patients with PDAC and benign pancreatic disease.
We focus Aim 1 on particles actively released by tumors, and Aim 2 on different cellular organelle fragments.
Aim 3 evaluates these biomarkers, and five from our preliminary data, on stage 1 and 2 PDAC samples.
The significance of this research is that the knowledge generated will lead to potential validation of a panel of
nanoparticle-associated biomarkers capable of differentiating PDAC from benign pancreatic disease. The
research proposed here may ultimately support the rationale for the clinical development of a nanoparticle-based
diagnostic blood test to identify patients with pancreatic cysts that would benefit from the EUS/FNA procedure."
10769731,"Ileal fibrosis in Crohn’s Disease (CD) represents a complication in over 30% of CD patients, and leads to surgery
in nearly 75% of this population. While therapies exist to manage CD-related inflammation, no approved
medication exists to prevent or manage fibrosis, with surgery left as the only option. Despite surgical removal of
fibrotic strictures, they often recur, requiring repeated surgeries. Strategies to predict who is more likely to
develop these complications, and identification of targets for therapeutic intervention is needed. Our long-term
goal is to develop a screening process for CD patients that incorporates a patient’s polygenic risk score, gut
microbiota profile, and metabolome to identify individuals at high risk for developing fibrotic disease (for newly
diagnosed patients) and propensity for disease recurrence (in individuals who have undergone surgery for
removal of strictures). In parallel, we hope to identify key microbiota strongly associated with fibrosis and define
their mechanism of action, so that microbially-directed therapy may become a viable therapeutic option for these
patients. Our objective in this proposal is to define the relationship between polygenic risk, the microbiome, and
the intestinal and peri-intestinal environment contributing to the fibrotic sub-phenotype in ileal CD. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that CD patients who develop fibrotic disease and recurrent strictures represent a
sub-phenotype characterized by a hyper-reactivity of ileal immune cells, and fibroblasts in surrounding
mesenteric fat, to certain microbiota. We hypothesize that immune reactivity to these microbiota in both the ileum
and mesenteric fat may be determined by an individual’s polygenic risk score. Our rationale is that the
identification of mechanisms to predict development of fibrosis will offer new therapeutic opportunities. Our
specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) genetic susceptibility to ileal fibrosis is mediated by an
excessive immune response to creeping fat (CrF) microorganisms; (Aim 2) ileal fibroblasts express collagen
matrix genes in the context of inflammation, is microbially-driven, and is related to propensity for recurrent
strictures; and (Aim 3) microorganisms associated with CrF will increase penetrance, severity, and/or shorten
time to disease in a model of spontaneous fibrosis. This contribution is significant because it will add new aspects
to our understanding of CD fibrosis by studying the microbiome, mesenteric fat, and polygenic risk scores to help
define this complicated phenotype. These insights have the potential to offer new targets and points of
intervention before complications occur. This option currently does not exist. Furthermore, this study will provide
the most comprehensive characterization to-date of creeping fat and help answer the mystery of why this
phenomenon occurs. This contribution is innovative because no studies to-date have investigated ileal CD
fibrosis taking into account the contribution of creeping fat to the fibrotic milieu. Insight into the peri-intestinal
environment, combined with microbial targets, and an individual’s genotype represents a combination of
analyses that is both new, clinically relevant, and ultimately, translatable into future patient care."

10769762,"Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative diseases are a major health problem. The tau protein is known to
play a critical role in these disorders. In the disease state tau transitions from a normal, “healthy” three-
dimensional shape to one that is capable of self-assembling into pathological aggregates. Remarkably, these
aggregates, once formed in a brain cell, appear to exit that cell and gain entry into neighboring or connected
cells, where they can serve as disease-causing “templates” to corrupt normal tau protein to an abnormal
conformation. Free tau aggregates can bind the cell surface by interacting with specific proteins called heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are modified in the cell through the attachment of sugar molecules,
which themselves are modified by the addition of sulfate groups. These modifications occur during the
synthesis of HSPGs, and depend on specific cellular enzymes. One enzyme, NDST1, was previously identified
as being very important for enabling HSPGs to be properly modified so as to bind tau protein. Once bound to
HSPGs, tau assemblies get into the cell, where they create more aggregates. The mechanisms by which tau
can cross the cell membrane are unknown. It is also unknown whether the mechanisms that apply to tau are
similar to those that function for other disease-causing proteins. This grant will test the role of NDST isoforms
in a mouse model of tau-induced neurodegeneration to see if the pathway implicated by prior studies might be
targeted to create new drugs for Alzheimer’s. Additionally, the grant will determine how tau assemblies can
cross the cell membrane, and whether mechanisms that apply to tau also apply to other disease-causing
proteins."
10770381,"The USFDA approval of the α particle emitting radiopharmaceutical (RP) radium 223 dichloride (Xofigo®) and the
β-particle emitting lutetium 177 dotatate (LUTATHERA®), and their successful implementation in the clinic,
has contributed to reinvigorated interest in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) of cancer. RPT entails the 
delivery of radioactive drugs to the primary tumor, metastases, and disseminated tumor cells (DTC). Different
classes of radionuclides have been advocated for therapy including α , β , and Auger emitters. The different
ranges of these radiations in tissue, and their differences in relative biological effectiveness (RBE), contribute
to the complexity of predicting therapeutic efficacy. ‐However, like external beam radiation therapy, the future
of RPT will depend in part on our capacity to plan treatments that maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing
adverse effects in normal tissues. Key to the long term success of RPT is to overcome limitations of the
intrinsic nonuniform uptake of the radiopharmaceutical by cancer cells that can impact our capacity to sterilize
tumors, metastases, and DTC. While primary tumors can often be addressed with external beams of
radiation, micrometastases and DTC cannot. While there are commercial tools to assist with calculating
absorbed dose to macroscopic disease based on external imaging and using it to predict response, there is a
dearth of tools that can be used to optimize and plan RPT of microscopic disease. Only MIRDcell V2, developed
in the Howell lab in collaboration with the MIRD Committee in 2014, is widely available. MIRDcell V2 has
strengths and weaknesses. This project seeks to overcome many of the weaknesses by creating MIRDcell V3
with new capabilities to facilitate RPT design and treatment planning of micrometastases and DTC. In addition,
MIRDcell V3 will serve as an indispensable educational tool for dosimetry and radiobiology of
radiopharmaceuticals. Students will be able to operate MIRDcell V3 and learn about how the selection of
different radionuclides and other parameters are expected to affect cell killing. The influence of particle
range, RBE, activity distribution and other parameters can be explored. In view of the new research that
was spurred by its predecessor, MIRDcell V2, this educational element is perhaps one of the most important
aspects of MIRDcell V3."
10770383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Gemcitabine (GEM), a frontline drug, shows limited efficacy due to its rapid metabolism and inefficient delivery
to the desmoplastic pancreatic tumor site. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)
and plays a critical role in the formation of desmoplasia and proliferation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). KRAS is
predominantly mutated in pancreatic cancer (PC), yet KRAS remains a difficult target. Since inhibition of
mTORC1/2 increases ERK phosphorylation, we propose combination therapy of GEM with ONC201, which is
an AKT/ERK dual inhibitor to effectively treat PC. ONC201 inhibits cell proliferation and induces TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis. Further, we have adopted a stroma depletion strategy
by sequentially administrating Hh inhibitor MDB5 for reducing physical barrier of drug delivery to the tumor site.
While sonic hedgehog (Shh)-deficient tumors have reduced stromal content, such tumors are aggressive with
increased vascularity and metastatic potential. Therefore, reduction of desmoplasia by inhibiting Hh pathway will
allow efficient delivery of ONC201 and GEM loaded into EGFR targeted NPs to the pancreatic tumor site. We
have identified an effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, which can be
applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations. In our preliminary studies, (i) compared to free GEM,
mPEG-co-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC NPs increased GEM accumulation in orthotopic tumor by 2.5-fold. To control GEM
release into the tumor, we synthesized mPEG-co-P(Asp)-g-DC-S-S-GEM with GEM payload of 14% w/w. There
was 90% GEM release from the polymer upon incubation with L-glutathione (GSH). Combination of GEM with
ONC201 showed synergy in killing resistant PC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo more effectively
than their monotherapies. We also synthesized 2-chloro-N1-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl) phenyl]-N4, N4-bis(2-
pyridinylmethyl)-1,4-benzenedicarboxamide (MDB5), which inhibited Hh ligands and CSC markers more
efficiently than vismodegib. Targeted NPs were prepared and optimized by decorating their surface with EGFR
binding peptide GE11 at different ligand density. Systemic administration of MDB5 loaded GE11-NPs into PC
tumor bearing mice resulted in higher drug concentration in the tumor at 4h post administration compared to
non-targeted NPs. Therefore, we hypothesize that sequential administration of MDB5 loaded NPs will increase
GEM and ONC201 delivery to the tumor and result in synergistic inhibition of PC by reversing resistance induced
by desmoplasia and CSC proliferation more efficiently. Our specific aims are to i) assess the effects of ONC201
and GEM combination in GEM resistant PC cells in vitro and in vivo, ii) development of targeted redox sensitive
nanomedicine of MDB5, ONC201 and GEM, and iii) nanoparticulate delivery of MDB5, ONC201, and GEM
combination in orthotopic, PDX and spontaneous KPC mouse models. Long-term impact is to develop novel
strategies to reduce desmoplasia-induced chemoresistance in PC using multifunctional nanomedicine of MDB5,
GEM and ONC201."
10756509,"Summary:
Human consciousness and cognitive function are governed by a complex brain circuitry made up of neural
connections regulated by an integrated multicellular network. Glial make up 90% of all cells in the brain and play
dynamic and active roles in neuronal signaling, where astrocytes and microglia regulate synaptic transmission
and plasticity. In the past decade, increasing evidence suggests that the principal co-agonist for N-methyl-D-
Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is the D-amino acid, D-serine, rather than glycine; however, few studies have
examined its role in CNS pathologies. To address this gap, we have recently identified a novel mechanism of
synaptic damage, where glia within the tripartite synapse uniquely synthesize and release D-serine following the
onset of pathological events. We hypothesize that microglia are a key source of pathological D-serine that
hyperactivates extrasynaptic NMDAR subunits to initiate synaptic damage as a result of microglia targeting and
pruning of dendritic spines. Our proposed experiments will examine (1) the mechanisms of D-serine release from
microglia; (2) the mechanisms of synaptic damage and microglia targeting & pruning; (3) transcriptomic analysis
of brain injury in both murine and human models. We will achieve this by employing both genetic and
pharmacological approaches to dissect the mechanism of microglial action within the complexity of brain injury
using state-of-the-art transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic techniques. Our studies will result in a better
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate synaptic damage and dysfunction, but also will start to define
novel therapeutics for patient interventions."
10838538,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The NIAID Clinical Data and Safety Management Center (CDSMC) is a consolidated clinical support service
center conceived to manage NIAID’s portfolio of clinical research in allergic diseases, asthma, autoimmune
disorders, and immune-mediated complications of transplant, continuing programs supported by Rho under
prior awards. Our vision is to advance NIAID’s history of successful clinical research by continuing our
successful collaboration in data management, safety, and specimen tracking with a focus on continuity while
embracing innovation. Over the last two decades, innovation has dramatically changed clinical trial operations,
with the technology revolution advancing trial data systems and advances in biology enabling research to halt
disease processes. The Rho team seeks to continue our support of NIAID’s work to deliver on this promise.
Rho has served as a clinical data, safety event, and biospecimen tracking center since its founding. Rho has
guided NIAID from the age of paper and FAX submissions through the introduction of computer data systems
and into the era of Software as a Service (“SaaS”) hosting of critical research systems. Over this time, Rho has
always focused on gradual evolution of systems to ensure that NIAID-supported research has access to the
current best practices in study management while avoiding the risks of too early adoption.
We propose to provide services by organizing the CDSMC into four cores: an Administrative Management
Core (AMC) that will be led by the Principal Investigator from a scientific perspective and the Program Director
from an operations perspective. The AMC will oversee the CDSMC; manage operational, quality, and
regulatory compliance reporting to NIAID; and coordinate DSMB support with NIAID and other functional work
areas. The Data Management Core (DMC) will provide strategic and operational support for data collection,
management, and processing; support the Rave EDC (Medidata, Inc. New York, NY); develop eCRFs and
build study databases; and manage data quality and the study data lifecycle. The Safety and
Pharmacovigilance Center (SPC) will receive, process, analyze, and report adverse events and provide
comprehensive pharmacovigilance support to NIAID-supported clinical trials. The SPC will provide support for
addressing safety and pharmacovigilance during study design and manage query generation and resolution,
narrative generation, summary reporting, and unblinding. The Specimen Tracking Core (STC) will inform
considerations of specimen handling and tracking during study design and will support tracking and reporting
during studies, leveraging our experience developing the specimen tracking strategy currently used in NIAID
DAIT studies. Based on our long history of supporting NIAID-funded clinical research and our experience
incorporating innovation into clinical research to deliver improvement and avoid risk, we believe we can
effectively support the achievement of NIAID’s research goals."

Mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a dormant state; they are immotile and unable to fertilize
the egg. Upon ejaculation, sperm begin swimming and initiate a process called capacitation, where they
become competent to fertilize the oocyte. An initial event in capacitation and activation of motility is the
bicarbonate-induced stimulation of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC: ADCY10). Men and male mice with the
sAC gene knocked out are infertile, and in vivo administration of sAC inhibitors to male mice prevents
sperm motility and renders the males temporarily infertile. Thus, sAC is a nonhormonal target, genetically
and pharmacologically validated to be essential for male fertility. Besides male-specific sterility, the only
other phenotypes of sAC knockout men or mice are dependent upon chronic loss of sAC for extended
periods of time. We propose to leverage acutely acting inhibitors, whose effects will be transient, to avoid
mechanism-based side effects and limit the inherent perils associated with chronic dosing. The goal of the
Weill Cornell Medicine Contraceptive Research Center (WCM-CRC) is to develop acutely acting sAC
inhibitors into safe and effective nonhormonal, orally available, on-demand contraceptives which men take
only when and as often as needed, shortly before sex. In two Contraceptive Development Research
Projects, we propose to improve binding affinity, pharmacokinetics (including oral bioavailability), drug-like
characteristics, and safety of sAC inhibitors with the expectation that pharmacokinetic parameters can be
optimized to balance efficacy with minimal adverse effects. In Project 1, we focus on a chemical series
validated in vivo in a preclinical animal model, and in Project 3, we propose to develop additional leads
from structurally distinct scaffolds. In Project 2, we will establish a second, non-rodent animal model for
testing contraceptive efficacy; test the in vivo efficacy of optimized sAC inhibitors; and validate sperm
motility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of efficacy for use in early phase clinical trials of an on-demand
male contraceptive. A major goal of the WCM-CRC is to identify a clinical lead candidate (along with
backups) to advance into Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies for a novel oral, nonhormonal
contraceptive for men."
10746757,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vascular calcification is the most significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and is especially prevalent in
individuals with chronic kidney disease. Widespread arterial mineral in these patients disrupts vascular function
and increases afterload on the heart. No therapeutic strategies currently exist to prevent or treat vascular
calcification. Development of therapeutics is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the mineral formation
process. Calcific mineral formation in the vascular wall begins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that promote
interactions between calcium and phosphate ions. Published data show that calcifying EV formation requires the
presence of caveolin-1, a structural component of plasma membrane invaginations known as caveolae.
However, the mechanisms through which caveolae may initiate calcifying EV formation remain unclear. The
proposed study seeks to track the formation of calcifying EVs back to caveolae within vascular smooth muscle
cells. We hypothesize that caveolae trafficking into the cell initiates calcifying EV formation and confers
mineralization potential to the nascent vesicles. We will study the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
as a caveolin-1 interactor and potential novel mediator of calcifying EV formation. Aim 1 of the study explores
the caveolae-dependent mechanisms through which EVs form and promote mineralization. We will analyze the
evolution of calcifying EVs as mineralization progresses both in vivo and in vitro. Aim 2 will test the therapeutic
potential of a clinically-relevant strategy to alter caveolae trafficking and calcifying EV formation to treat vascular
calcification."

10747401,"Project Summary/Abstract
TDP-43 is a common protein found aggregated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies. TDP-
43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that is primarily localized in the nucleus but relocates to the
cytoplasm under conditions of cellular stress, forming stress granules in neurons and myo-granules in skeletal
muscle. Normally TDP-43 returns to the nucleus when the stress is resolved, but through unknown disease
mechanisms misfolded TDP-43 remains in the cytoplasm as phosphorylated insoluble aggregates. Studies
have shown that TDP-43 forms amyloid-like oligomers which are capable of self-templated conversion in which
the misfolded protein causes its native counterpart to become misfolded, leading to propagation of the
aggregate pathology. The misfolded aggregation-prone proteins, referred to as proteopathic seeds, are
capable of cell-to-cell transmission through connected neuronal networks. In some diseases such as
multisystem proteinopathy, patients have TDP-43 aggregation in both skeletal muscle and neurons. In these
cases, myopathy symptoms begin several years prior to the onset of dementia. Therefore, the central
hypothesis behind this proposal is that TDP-43 is capable of self-templated conversion in skeletal
muscle and transmission to the central nervous system (CNS) to cause neurodegeneration. In order to
test this, TDP-43 isolated from human skeletal muscle myo-granules will first be tested for the ability to
undergo self-templated conversion in vitro using a thioflavin assay and a TDP-43 FRET sensor line. Then, the
isolated TDP-43 or recombinant TDP-43 seeds will be injected into the hindlimb muscles of wild type mice and
mice expressing TDP-43 with a mutated nuclear localization signal which causes increased cytoplasmic TDP-
43 expression. Mice will be monitored for motor or cognitive changes and sacrificed at specific time points
following proteopathic seed injection. Skeletal muscle will be examined for signs of local transmission and
pathology to confirm whether seeds can propagate in the environment of a myofiber. Additionally, the spinal
cord and brain will be examined for signs of TDP-43 pathology to determine whether intramuscular injected
TDP-43 proteopathic seeds can lead to transmission of TDP-43 proteinopathy to the CNS. To confirm muscle-
to-neuron transmission of TDP-43 seeds on a shorter timeline, primary mouse myoblasts expressing
fluorescently-tagged TDP-43 will be treated with proteopathic seeds and then co-cultured with primary mouse
neurons. The neurons will be monitored for fluorescent TDP-43, indicating seeding. If successful, the proposed
experiments will significantly improve the understanding of TDP-43 proteinopathy and whether it can spread
from the periphery to the CNS. This has the potential to greatly impact the diagnosis methods and treatment
options for neurodegenerative diseases. The successful completion of these aims as well as the training plan
provided will prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator in the field of protein aggregation
and neuromuscular disease."

Research: In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), neuroendocrine (NE) transformation to small cell lung cancer

LUAD and SCLC admixed in the same tumor. We demonstrated that laser-microdissected LUAD and SCLC
intratumoral components share truncal mutations, confirming NE transformation. SCLC itself is classified as
classical, variant, and non-NE subtypes. Preclinical studies demonstrate that variant and non-NE subtypes have
increased risk for metastasis and chemoresistance. It is poorly understood what gene regulatory mechanism
drives SCLC transformation and SCLC subtype switching. Single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing (scRNA-seq,
snATAC-seq) in samples of combined LUAD/SCLC histology present an ideal platform to characterize the
intratumoral heterogeneity of NE plasticity. As a control reference, we completed scRNA-seq in a cohort of de
novo SCLC (Chan, et al. bioRxiv, under review at Cancer Cell). We performed scRNA-seq in an initial cohort of
combined LUAD/SCLC and found significantly increased intratumoral subtype diversity in transformed SCLC (T-
SCLC). We found Notch suppression in T-SCLC and reactivation with subsequent SCLC subtype diversification.
We observed overexpressed SOX2 and ELF3 in pre-transformed vs classical LUAD, and PHOX2B and ELF3 in
T-SCLC vs de novo SCLC. We hypothesize that under RB1 and TP53 loss, key transcription factors (SOX2,
PHOX2B, ELF3), epigenetic regulators, and modulation of Notch signaling all contribute to NE transformation
and subtype diversification. We will leverage scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq in samples of combined LUAD/SCLC
histology to 1) identify molecular markers of subclonal populations, 2) reconstruct the regulatory network, and 3)
validate transcriptomic and epigenetic drivers of NE plasticity in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, including
an EGFR+ LUAD patient-derived xenograft undergoing NE transformation after osimertinib treatment.
Candidate: Dr. Joseph Chan, MD, PhD is a Medical Oncology Fellow at MSKCC. He aims to become an
independent, tenure-track physician-scientist investigating lineage plasticity in metastasis and treatment
resistance in cancer. His mentors Drs. Charles Rudin and Dana Pe’er are leading experts in lung cancer and
single-cell sequencing, respectively. Dr. Chan proposes a five-year period of mentored training to acquire wet
lab and advanced computational skills. His wet lab training will include 1) single-cell library preparation and 2)
genetic manipulation of preclinical models for functional validation. His computational training will include 1)
snATAC-seq analysis and 2) advanced machine learning. His advisory committee—Drs. Charles Sawyers,
Helena Yu, Ronan Chaligné, and Christina Leslie—will guide his training and research.
Environment: MSKCC is a cancer center renowned for patient care, innovative research, and training for junior
faculty seeking careers as independent physician-scientists. MSKCC houses the Single Cell Research Initiative
that advances single-cell sequencing, which will support this proposal for research and career development."

The placenta, often referred to as the “intestine” of the fetus, is an essential organ that controls the exchange of
nutrients (including vitamins) and xenobiotics (i.e., dietary supplements and FDA approved drugs) between the
mother and her fetus. The fetus can also ingest nutrients and xenobiotics via the digestive tract, so do neonates
and infants through breastfeeding after birth. The fetal, neonate, and infant blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves a
critical role in protecting the developing brain from xenobiotics and supplying nutrients to the brain. Thus, the
placenta, the developing BBB and gut are key organs responsible for nutrient and xenobiotic distribution and
absorption impacting early human development and xenobiotic toxicity. Transporters can play an essential
role in the absorption, systemic exposure, and tissue distribution of nutrients and xenobiotics in the
fetus, neonates, and infants across the placental, intestinal, and blood-brain barriers. Identification and
quantification of transporters in these tissue barriers is important for understanding and predicting fetal or
neonate/infant uptake of, and exposure to, nutrients and xenobiotics, and hence impacting early development as
well as the safe and efficacious use of medications/supplements in these vulnerable populations. While the
expression and function of a few ABC transporters in human term placenta, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), have been well-delineated, such data are sorely missing for
transporters in early gestation placenta, and in the developing gut and BBB during pregnancy and after birth. In
this application, we propose to establish a Transporter Elucidation Center (TEC) at the University of Washington
that addresses the goals articulated in RFA-HD-23-003. Using quantitative global and targeted proteomics,
we will systematically identify and quantify the ontogeny of transporters in the human placenta (from early
gestation to term), the developing gut as well as the developing BBB (from early and mid-gestation and after
birth). Then, through in vitro (transporter-transfected cells, immunohistochemistry, immunolocalization) and ex
vivo (e.g., placental perfusion, intestinal organoids, and iPSC-derived human fetal BBB models) transport
studies, we will determine novel substrates, cellular localization, and transport activity of highly abundant
transporters in these tissues. Combined, these studies will address a critical knowledge gap in our
understanding of transporters that control essential physiological functions and xenobiotic disposition in the
developing fetus and neonate/infant. Consequently, the proposed studies will enhance our ability to predict the
toxicity or efficacy of xenobiotics and physiological efficacy of nutrients (or lack thereof) in these vulnerable
populations."
10897012,"ABSTRACT
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the fifth most impoverished country in the world, and
correspondingly, women and children in the DRC experience poor health outcomes. In the DRC, the maternal
mortality rate is six times the target set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and the
neonatal mortality rate is more than double the SDG. Low-income countries, like the DRC contribute
disproportionately to maternal and neonatal mortality but are often not represented in clinical research. The
Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH) and the University of North Carolina (UNC) have been research
partners since 2005, with the shared mission of improving maternal and child health in low-income countries
through the research of sustainable, cost-effective health interventions. Our partnership includes more than 15
years of experience as a research unit in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Global Network for Women’s and
Children’s Health Research. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in strategic areas in
maternal and newborn health, including obstetrics and gynecology, neonatology, infectious diseases, tropical
medicine. Our team is facile in utilizing a variety of research methodologies, including epidemiology, clinical
trials and implementation science. We have built an extensive research infrastructure in rural, peri-urban and
urban communities to conduct community and facility-based clinical studies in the DRC. Since 2016, we have
published 271 papers, completed 22 studies, and enrolled 90,390 women and 62,117 children in research
studies. The KSPH-UNC Partnership, led by Drs. Antoinette Tshefu (KSPH; iPI) and Melissa Bauserman
(UNC; PI), and has the expertise and resources to address research questions in a variety of areas of maternal
and child health. Our overall goal is to discover evidenced-based strategies to improve health outcomes in low
and lower-middle-income countries. To achieve this goal, we will: execute high-quality studies with early
identification of pregnancies, rigorous tracking of outcomes and follow-up rates >90%, support the Global
Network with innovative trials and trial designs and strengthen research infrastructure in the DRC and develop
the next generation of research leaders. The KSPH-UNC Partnership is uniquely positioned to contribute to the
mission of the Global Network, and we are fully committed to continued support of the Global Network through
collaborative research proposals."

10747952,"Project Summary – Core A
 The Administrative Core (Core A) guides and supervises the overall Program Project research effort. The
Director has ultimate responsibility for supervision of Program Project activities. The Director is assisted by the
Co-Director. An important function of the Core is to organize and schedule bi-monthly meetings of all Program
Project personnel and maintain written records of these meetings. Frequent meetings documented with
reports presented by Project and Core Leaders ensure that all projects are meeting Program goals. Project
and Core Leaders meet separately at least once a month to discuss progress, trouble-shoot scientific or
technical issues and make policy decisions. Electronic records of all group meetings are available to Program
personnel through a Program Project Electronic Group (Teams). Microsoft Teams allows for easy, group
specific communication of text, images, documents, etc. Core A communicates with the Internal and External
Advisory Committees. These committees monitor Program Project research progress and provide evaluations
and critiques of the group effort. They also assist the Director in developing solutions to any research-related
problems that may arise, and they give the Director leverage to help hold the overall Program Project
accountable for the proposed work. Core A is responsible for monitoring Program expenditures, including
travel by Project Leaders, and routine bookkeeping. Publication costs arising from Program Project-funded
research will be processed through individual projects. Finally, Core A handles assembly and submission of
annual progress reports with continual encouragement for investigators to be active at scientific meetings that
helps promote and integrate their findings into scientific knowledge. Core A is overall responsible for the
service to, training of and development of PPG personnel."
10747956,"Project Summary – Core C
 The Informatics and Computation Core (Core C) will play a three-pronged role in this Program Project Grant
(PPG) investigating the role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) as a central integrator of vascular health: i)
service, ii) training and iii) development. Under the service component, Core C will oversee generation of,
analyze, and visualize all bulk and single-cell genomic data required by Projects I-IV. Genes that are altered in
the transition from health to high fat diet-induced hypertension in the principal cell types of the PVAT
compartment will be identified, and trajectories of cellular perturbation along the health to disease continuum will
be mapped. Voluntary training will be provided to all Project and Core personnel and trainees in use of cutting-
edge tools in biological data visualization and network analysis. The development component will focus on
building a predictive computational model of the transition of PVAT from a healthy state to an inflamed state in
diet-associated hypertension, based on critical state transition theory. The model will integrate findings on: i)
mechanisms of communication of vascular pressure to PVAT and the response of PVAT to this pressure (Project
I); ii) the extent of innervation and the role of the nervous system in the functioning of PVAT in health and disease
(Project II); iii) the effect of the PVAT microenvironment on immune function in the vascular neighborhood
(Project III); and iv) the effect of mechanical forces on the adipogenic potential of PVAT (Project IV). This in
silico model will provide a unified quantitative framework to generate and test novel hypotheses about the role
of PVAT in health and under hypertension.
 The aims of Core C will be accomplished using free, open-source computational tools. Models and analysis
scripts will be reproducibly recorded and shared across the PPG and beyond through open online portals like
Github. Core C will also be able to provide significant cost savings to the PPG by centralizing execution and
analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq experiments from all projects."
10772326,"My research goal is to understand the pathophysiology of HFpEF (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction)
and identify its therapeutic targets. Compelling evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of HFpEF in men
and women is distinct, leading to differential phenotypes, responses to treatment, and a potential need for sex-
specific therapeutic intervention. Studying sex differences in HFpEF is an essential step toward establishing a
personalized therapeutic strategy.
Women in HFpEF are typically in their postmenopausal state. Although women comprise the majority of HFpEF
patients, the preclinical study of female HFpEF pathogenesis is limited due to a lack of animal models. Female
mice, both cycling (premenopausal) and non-cycling (induced by ovariectomy), resist HFpEF development. One
of the novelties of my proposed work is to use a new female HFpEF-like model induced by ovary-intact
menopause (by VCD (Vinyl Cyclohexene Dioxide) injection) combined with metabolic stress. The VCD-
postmenopausal differs from the ovariectomized (OVX) model since it retains residual ovarian stroma, analogous
to natural menopause in women. VCD mice subjected to metabolic stress develop robust HFpEF phenotype.
In addition to estrogen deficiency, women with natural menopause also experience relative androgen excess
(RAE) due to the remaining androgen-producing capacity of the residual ovaries. Clinical studies show that a
high androgen/estrogen ratio (not a low level of estrogen alone) is associated with increased cardiovascular risks
in women. Androgens suppress NP (Natriuretic Peptide) production from atrial cells, a critical activator of cGMP-
PKG signaling. Importantly, a deficiency of myocardial cGMP-PKG activity was reported to underlie myofilament
dysfunction in HFpEF.
My proposed work focuses on myofilament-based alterations that are responsible for mechanical dysfunction in
HFpEF. Aim 1 will focus on sex-specific myofilament alterations. The diastolic function will be evaluated at the
in vivo LV, the myocardium, and single cardiomyocyte levels. Diastolic stiffness, relaxation kinetics, crossbridge
kinetics, myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, and Ca2+ release-reuptake kinetics will be investigated. Passive sarcomere
stiffness and the stiffness contribution of ECM (extracellular matrix) will be measured. Myofilament
(phospho)proteomics, transcriptomics, activity assay, protein and RNA studies, etc., will investigate the signaling
pathways associated with these mechanical changes. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of RAE and anti-androgens’
effect on diastolic function in postmenopausal HFpEF. The impact of RAE will be studied in 2 postmenopausal
models: 1) the OVX model (low estrogens and low androgens); and 2) the VCD model (low estrogens and normal
androgens). The contribution of RAE will be revealed through the inhibition of 5α-reductase (by anti-androgens).
I anticipate that this proposed work will advance our knowledge of the sarcomere-based alterations in HFpEF
and provide potential insight to alleviate diastolic dysfunction in a sex-specific manner."
10772885,"Knowledge of CFTR function and cell type expression has advanced greatly since its discovery in 1989.
Indeed, drug therapies such as Ivacafter and Trikafta restore function for most CFTR mutation classes;
however, ~10% of people with CF cannot benefit from these drugs because their CFTR proteins are only
partially produced and there is little the drugs can do to help. Here we use an adenosine deaminase fused to a
CRISPR-Cas9 nickase (termed an Adenine Base Editor (ABE)) that converts an Adenine to a Guanine which
is critical for full length protein production for certain mutations. ABEs do not create double stranded DNA
breaks, do not require homologous recombination templates, and are effective in quiescent cells of the
airways. We recently reported correction of CFTR nonsense mutations using electroporated ABEs in human
airway epithelial cells in vitro as determined by next generation sequencing and correction of chloride current.
However, the lung is a challenging organ to correct using gene editing due to an enormous surface area and
multiple mechanisms to resist vector uptake. Delivery of the ABE to enough of the appropriate airway cells to
be therapeutic is the problem we address in this proposal. Our research group has demonstrated success
using many categories of reagents for modifying the genomes of airway cells. In this proposal, we compare two
ABE delivery tools: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs). They each have their pros
and cons. We will compare AAV-ABEs and VLP-ABEs in multiple in vitro and in vivo models. We will identify
reagents with improved airway progenitor cell targeting. In vivo editing efficiency will be examined in a new
reporter mouse model termed Gene Editing Reporter 14 (GER14) and an established GFP transgenic pig
model. In addition, in vivo CFTR function will be examined in genetically modified mice with the endogenous
mouse Cftr exon 12 replaced with the human CFTR exon 12 with the R553X mutation (termed hEx12R553X).
Lastly, we ask if secreted mucins inhibit AAV or eVLP delivery or editing efficiency in models of advanced lung
disease. Our goal is to provide a life-long gene repair strategy that could be adapted for a great number of CF
causing mutations. The reagents, methods, and data generated by these experiments could be applied to base
editing for other monogenic disorders, thereby significantly advancing the gene therapy field."

as a single medical scientist training program in 1977. The program currently enrolls 218 MD/PhD and 22
VMD/PhD students, 95% of whom are training grant eligible. Program guidance is provided by a committed team
of faculty and staff that has been in place since 2014 and was recently joined by an experienced medical educator
to assist in program evaluation. Our primary goal is to identify, train and mentor a diverse group of outstanding
physician-scientists who will become leaders of biomedical research and translational medicine, as well as being
successful clinicians, role models and mentors. To meet this goal, we have established flexible, evidence-based
training plans that integrate research and clinical training in preparation for careers that use both. Penn's
institutional commitment is reflected in a large annual investment that provides resources, enrichment activities,
and support for program administration, as well as an institutional culture that values physician-scientists,
supports diversity and inclusivity, promotes scientific rigor and a safe learning environment, and expects good
mentorship. Admission is open to recent college graduates and current Penn MD, VMD and PhD students.
Admission decisions are holistic, emphasizing research experience, creativity, and commitment to a physician-scientist
career as well as academic excellence. The average time to degree is 8.1 years. There are 12 affiliated
graduate programs: 7 in Biomedical Graduate Studies plus Engineering, Economics, Chemistry, History &
Sociology of Science, and Anthropology, with protocols to add more when appropriate. The diverse training
faculty includes 161 junior and senior scientists and physician-scientists including 3 NIH intramural investigators
who hold adjunct faculty appointments at Penn. Policies are in place to acquire and maintain training faculty
membership and to resolve conflicts. Each student's individualized curriculum emphasizes the integration of
clinical and research training, responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and
mentorship. It also includes MSTP-directed courses in Years 1 and 2, Clinical Connections during graduate
school, Return to Research in the final year and, because our responsibilities do not end with graduation, the
Hand Over Curriculum, which guides students in the selection of physician-scientist-friendly residencies and
careers. 81% of recent graduates who have completed further training are employed by academic centers,
research institutes, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, the NIH, and federal agencies. Most have
research funding from the NIH and other sources. Our objectives for the next 5 years include: 1) fostering the
next generation of physician-scientists, 2) assisting trainees in exploring physician-scientist career options in
addition to academia, 3) managing upward pressure on total training time, 4) improving mentorship skills for
faculty and trainees, and 5) extending our successful efforts to increase diversity. These objectives are linked to

10800789,"Project Summary/Abstract: Electronic cigarette (e-cig) usage is on the rise, particularly among youths;
however, their potential for harm is not understood, complicating development of informed regulatory strategies.
The lack of data on e-cig related harm is, in part, due to the lack of specific biomarkers for exposure to e-cig
aerosols. We found that e-cig aerosol contains highly reactive free radicals that can cause oxidative damage to
the user. Free radicals can damage numerous cellular pathways possibly contributing to the progression of
cancers and other diseases. Detection of e-cig free radicals can be accomplished by trapping with spin traps
(e.g., DMPO) and analysis by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Preliminary research with
EPR shows that free radicals produced in the e-cig aerosol by e-liquid solvents, propylene glycol (PG) and
glycerin (GLY), common to all e-cigs, display unique structural characteristics. Our objective is to identify these
free radical structures and utilize their unique structure to develop an e-cig specific biomarker of exposure. The
specific aims of the proposed research are: (Aim 1) To determine the structures of the free radicals produced
by PG and GLY in e-cigs; (Aim 2) To determine the primary targets of and adducts formed from free radical
assault in the tissue of e-cig exposures in rodent models and possible metabolites formed from the these radical
adducts in the serum of e-cig exposed rodent. This project represents an important research direction where a
chemical/biological approach can inform tobacco regulatory science. As such, an important aspect of this
application it to extend my background in areas relevant to translational science in addition to providing specific
training in new biomarker-relevant research areas including metabolomics and free radical structural
identification. To this end, my training will occur through a series of courses, relevant mentorship, and practical
experience, each geared to ensure my transition to an independent researcher in the fields of biomarker
development and regulatory science. Coursework, mentorship, conference participation, and practical
training/experience will be completed during the K99 phase. During this phase, Aim 1 of the research plan will
be completed and Aim 2 will be initiated (for completion during the R00 phase of the award). To accomplish the
research aims, advanced pulsed EPR and mass spectroscopy approaches will be utilized for radicals produced
by PG and GLY in e-cig aerosols. In a mouse exposure model, free radical exposure and targets of attack in
the lung will be determined using a novel in vivo DMPO/anti-DMPO antibody approach. This will allow for the
identification of specific protein and DNA adducts by TOF-MS. A post-DMPO exposure study will consist of an
untargeted pairwise metabolomics approach to look at changes in metabolite profiles before and after e-cig
exposure. By leveraging the unique structures of e-cig produced free radicals and their targets of attack in the
lung, biomarkers of exposure specific to e-cig aerosols can be identified and used to develop regulatory
strategies aimed at reducing harm from e-cig exposure."

PROJECT SUMMARY Washington University Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (WUP) is
designed to provide rigorous research training and enrichment activities to recent college graduates from groups
underrepresented in the biomedical sciences to better prepare them to apply, matriculate, and succeed in a PhD
program. This program is based on the understanding that an in-depth mentored research experience
supplemented with diversity and career enrichment activities will provide optimal preparation for graduate studies
in the biomedical sciences. The research experience is complemented by a multi-tiered skill-enhancement
program that integrates comprehensive scientific instruction and professional development to build self-efficacy,
scientific identity, oral and written scientific communication skills, critical thinking and analysis, and ethical
decision-making. Training in such skills is provided by a year-long WUP-specific journal club, numerous career
development workshops, an ethics course, rigor and reproducibility training, academic courses, and other skill-
building activities. Although the training program is highly structured and logically organized, it is also
personalized in that the Individual Development Plan (IDP) and the research interests of each participant are
considered when selecting Mentors for one year of laboratory-based research. Scholars will choose from an
array of mentors working in mechanobiology, biochemistry, cell biology, development biology, and regenerative

of biomedical scientists and conduct rigorous, well-funded biomedical research. The WUP and its components
will be assessed at specific intervals throughout the year, through participant, mentor, and director evaluations.
The ultimate success will be measured by the matriculation of scholars into PhD programs, their completion of
PhD programs, and their long-term success in biomedical science research and research-related careers."
10772858,"Project Summary
 Human transcriptomes are endowed with many intriguing RNA modifications that are dynamic and reversible.
Many of these modifications regulate gene expression and cell-fate decision, while emerging new functions are
also likely to impact human health and disease. However, precise mapping and quantifying modifications
remains a challenge. While the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform of direct RNA sequencing can
detect RNA modifications as basecall errors, a major weakness is the lack of quantification of these errors and
the increased errors near the site of a modification. We hypothesize that using 3Dpol, the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) of poliovirus, to copy each RNA provides a mechanism of “twice reading” of the RNA to
improve accuracy. In this twice-reading mechanism, 3Dpol captures the flexible fold-back of the 3'-end of an
RNA as the primer for replication, producing a double-stranded (ds)-hairpin helix that physically links the template
strand with the copied strand. This physical link is important, allowing each RNA modification to have two reads,
first through nanopore sequencing of the copied strand and then the template strand, such that the two reads
are relatable. Because the read in the copied portion is produced by the high-fidelity 3Dpol, it provides the
“ground truth” for the read in the template portion. In Aim 1, we will determine how 3Dpol copies an RNA
modification by defining its fidelity and signature of nucleotide incorporation. This is to determine how the two
reads are related to each other. Using a synthetic RNA template, we will measure the fidelity and the signature
of 3Dpol readout for abundant modifications in human mRNAs. We will perform the same analysis for processive
reverse transcriptases (RTs) to discern the differences between RNA- and cDNA-replication of an RNA. We will
also generate 3Dpol variants with a different nucleotide-incorporation signature than the native enzyme, which
will provide valuable new tools for quantifying RNA modifications. In Aim 2, we will determine the elongation
velocity of 3Dpol in end-to-end reading of long RNAs. This is to assess the processivity of 3Dpol upon
encountering challenging sequences and diverse structures typical of cellular RNAs. We will use a long non-
coding RNA to measure position-dependent velocity across the template. We will compare the velocity of 3Dpol
to processive RTs to provide new insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each enzyme. In Aim 3, we will
generate synthetic RNA standards, each with a site-specific modification (ψ, m6A, or m5C) for machine learning
and algorithm development. We will also generate a control library of long RNAs, each with a modification, and
determine the improved accuracy from 1-read to 2-read and even to multiple reads upon 3Dpol replication of the
library. We will then determine the improved accuracy upon 3Dpol replication of a human transcriptome. The
deliverable is a nanopore kit consisting of reagents for detecting an RNA modification in twice reading of
transcriptomes in a new strategy that will significantly improve read accuracy for research in all biological areas."
10772571,"The University of Georgia (UGA) proposes a renewal of PREP@UGA that builds on the program’s successes
to date and continues to advance diversity of the biomedical research workforce. Diversity of the biomedical
research workforce is critical to the success of the NIH mission and necessary for research innovation,
translation, and justice. However, ongoing, difficult work is needed to advance diversity within and beyond
UGA. PREP@UGA has a successful record of recruiting, supporting, and preparing postbaccalaureate
students in pursuing further education and careers in biomedical research. To date, PREP@UGA has trained
53 Scholars with 87% matriculating into biomedical research PhD programs at research-intensive universities.
Seven PREP@UGA alumni successfully completed doctoral training and are now in Postdoctoral Fellowships
in academia and government or working in industry or academia. Thirty-three PREP@UGA alumni are in good
standing in their PhD programs. The program is well-positioned to continue this important work because of its
close alignment with UGA’s Diversity and Inclusive Excellence and 2025 strategic plans, which have catalyzed
changes in institutional policies and practices to address systemic issues that have limited diversity. In this
renewal, PREP@UGA will (1) continue to use a multi-pronged approach to recruit diverse cohorts of six
postbaccalaureate Scholars who identify as underrepresented and/or as having a disability; (2) continue to
engage Scholars in intensive research training with quality mentorship; (3) enhance the collective and
individualized professional development for Scholars; and (4) enhance Scholars’ networking in ways that
enable them to bring their whole selves to their research, educational, and career pursuits. We propose three
programmatic enhancements in response to results from evaluation and findings from education research.
First, we will strategically expand the pool of faculty mentors so that Scholars can participate in research that
more fully represents the disciplinary breadth of biomedical research on campus. This change has the added
value of increasing the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of PREP@UGA’s pool of quality research mentors.
Second, we will establish a cadre of career mentors who are diverse in terms of their biomedical research
discipline, career path, and personal characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, ability status) for additional
support and advice for navigating academic research and career pursuits. Finally, we will add value to the
current, effective professional development activities by adding two modules. The first will support Scholars in
building their knowledge and skills to understand and evaluate statistical analyses in published research. The
second will introduce Scholars to notions of community cultural wealth and funds of knowledge to affirm the
strengths they bring to the biomedical research endeavor and support them in using science for social justice."
10900615,"Depression and physical inactivity are leading contributors to cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Low-wage workers, who comprise one-third of all workers in the U.S.
and are essential to many industries, are more likely to be physically inactive and to have cardiometabolic
conditions and depression, yet they are half as likely as higher wage workers to utilize preventive care.
Targeted workplace initiatives have been successful in improving employee health, but low-wage workers are
difficult to engage, in part due to a high burden of social disadvantage (e.g., food and housing insecurity, time
and financial constraints). Currently, to our knowledge, there are no workplace interventions for depression that
specifically target low-wage workers and their unique social risk factors. This study was conceptualized using a
planned adaptation approach that involves low-wage workers in the design of the intervention to increase
engagement and feasibility in this population. The proposed study will adapt an evidence-based 8-session
telephone-delivered depression intervention for working adults, Be Well at Work, and add critical
enhancements for low-wage workers: assessment and referrals for social determinants of health, physical
activity promotion, and personalized text message behavioral support via ecological momentary assessment

interviews to refine the intervention content and delivery (Aim 2); (3) a pilot randomized controlled trial
comparing Be Well at Work-PLUS to a waitlist condition (N=60; Aim 3). This iterative process will yield results
on feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of Be Well at Work-PLUS and provide data to
apply for an R01 efficacy trial. To compliment these research aims, Dr. McCurley has designed a training plan
to gain expertise in (1) implementation science, including planned adaptation of evidence-based interventions
and participatory design methods for improving reach and engagement in low-income groups, (2) mobile
health, specifically, text messaging for increased intervention feasibility and uptake; and (3) randomized
controlled trial design. The career development plan involves regular mentorship with experts in
implementation science, mobile health, randomized behavioral intervention trials, as well as didactic courses
and workshops in these topics, dissemination of results through presentations and publications, and support
for grant writing and additional skill development to advance Dr. McCurley’s career as an independent
behavioral scientist. This K23 proposal will position Dr. McCurley to become an independent investigator
developing interventions that fuse technology and behavioral science to address depression, health behavior,
social determinants of health, and cardiometabolic diseases in low-income populations."
10782467,"ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. The pathogenesis is
partly attributed to compartmentalized oxidative stress inside and outside the immune system. The proposed
studies will focus on a critical gap in knowledge - how metabolic pathways that neutralize oxidative stress control
autoimmunity in SLE. The central hypothesis for this project is based on comprehensive metabolome studies
that have showed a dominant impact of SLE on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in lymphocytes of
patients and T cells of lupus-prone mice undergoing lineage polarization; the results of which mimic the
deficiency of transaldolase (TAL), a rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Lupus-prone mice exhibit activation of the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the liver and antiphospholipid
antibody (aPL) production prior to the onset of nephritis. Similar to lupus-prone strains, mice lacking TAL exhibit
mTOR activation and overexpression of NDUFS3, a subunit of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain (ETC) that triggers the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and aPL, both of which respond
to rapamycin treatment. TAL deficiency blocks the glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver. This is
attributed to carbon trapping in the PPP and depletion of UDP-GlcNAc which are also detectable in SLE patients
and mice. Although PON1 loss in the plasma has been connected to aPL production and demonstrated in SLE,
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and liver diseases, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore,
the Specific Aims will test our working hypothesis that TAL inactivation i) elicits cell type-specific carbon
sequestration in the PPP and limits substrates for NADPH and GSH production and metabolism through the
ETC and thus triggers a compensatory accumulation of oxidative stress-generating mitochondria, mTOR
pathway activation and pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system; and ii) limits the availability of
UDP-GlcNAc for glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver, which in turn trigger aPL production in SLE
and TAL deficiency. Under Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TAL-regulated carbon flux through the PPP
causes cell-type specific accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, depletion of NADPH and GSH, and
redox-mediated mTOR activation to promote the expansion Th17, Tfh, and DN T cells and constriction of CD8
EMT cells and Tregs in SLE patients. Under Aim 2, we will delineate T-cell intrinsic metabolic checkpoints that
control systemic autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice. Under Aim 3, we will determine the role of hepatocyte-
derived oxidative stress in aPL production, pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system and lupus
pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant because it will establish new, compartmentally defined
metabolic checkpoints of autoimmunity with broad translational relevance for the pathogenesis and treatment
of SLE. The approach is innovative as it will employ genetic checkpoints of oxidative stress and high-resolution
stable isotope tracing of metabolic pathways to delineate lupus pathogenesis."
10777186,"Assessing children’s 24-hour movement behaviors (i.e., time spent active, sedentary, and asleep) can reveal
the complex and interdependent ways energy expenditure and sleep are related to health outcomes. However,
assessing energy expenditure and sleep among children in free-living conditions is inherently difficult, and no
single method is without limitation. A combination of heart rate and accelerometry data provides a more precise
estimate of energy expenditure and sleep than either heart rate or accelerometry alone, when compared to a
criterion measure of indirect calorimetry or polysomnography, respectively. Yet, devices that measure both heart
rate and acceleration (such as ActiHeart or Fitbit) were not designed for children and may be distracting or
uncomfortable. Moreover, nearly all devices use proprietary algorithms and do not allow access to raw signal
data, and thus, are fundamentally unverifiable.
Our study team has developed the PATCH, a small, open-source wearable device which integrates multiple
sensors to measure heart rate and acceleration among children. The proposed project leverages the initial
PATCH calibration progress and extends this work to conduct a series of studies to establish the validity of the
PATCH to measure children’s energy expenditure and sleep in both laboratory and free-living conditions. The
objectives of the proposed project are (1) develop estimates of energy expenditure for children aged 3-8 years,
(2) measure sleep, compared to criterion polysomnography and (3) validate PATCH estimates of energy
expenditure and sleep in 24-hour free-living contexts. Our long-term goal is to advance the measurement field
for epidemiologic- and intervention-based studies that measure energy expenditure and sleep in the context of
free-living 24-hour movement behavior.
This project is innovative because it leverages off-the-shelf hardware and open-source processing. This means
that results from this project will enable other researchers to build their own PATCH device and independently
process the data, thereby overcoming issues related to proprietary hardware and algorithms that currently limit
the field of wearable devices. This project is significant because this technology has the potential to substantively
improve measurement of 24-hour movement across development in epidemiological studies and improve wear-
time compliance, given the PATCH’s small, unobtrusive design. Thus, this technology has promise to serve as
a powerful assessment tool for evaluating children’s free-living energy expenditure and sleep in observational
and intervention studies."
10852945,"This project describes a research program to ascertain the functions of the BMP9-BMPR2-ALK1
signaling axis in pulmonary vascular biology, and to determine its contribution to pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH). Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the BMP9 signaling
complex in endothelial cells—BMPR2, ALK1, co-receptor ENG, GDF2, and downstream effector
SMAD9—have been implicated in heritable PAH, while the acquired deficiency of these factors
and of downstream SMAD1/5/9 signaling have been hallmarks of non-genetic forms (PH). The
mechanisms by which BMPR2/ALK1 signaling regulates homeostasis of the pulmonary
vasculature are not known, and the manner in which dysregulated BMP9 signaling may
predisposes to PAH remains incompletely understood. In support of a protective role of BMP9
signaling, treatment with recombinant BMP9 ligand attenuates PH and pulmonary vascular
remodeling in several models of PH, while deficiency of circulating BMP9 is associated with
portopulmonary hypertension. Paradoxically, treatment with ALK1-Fc, a BMP9 ligand trap, also
ameliorates experimental PH, suggesting Janus-like, context-sensitive effects of BMP9
signaling in PAH. Aim 1 of this program includes detailed mechanistic studies to discern how
distinct co-receptors and effectors recruited by BMP9 signaling may elicit disparate functions in
pulmonary vascular cells. Aim 2 investigates the physiologic effects of these signals using in
vitro and in vivo models of pulmonary vascular barrier function. Aim 3 examines how selective
engagement of various components of the BMP9 receptor complex may impact experimental
PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling. These studies leverage the extensive experience in
selective modulation and targeting of the BMP/TGFb signaling pathway, and novel
pharmacologic probes designed to engage various components of the signaling pathway in a
highly selective and translatable fashion. This program is supported by proof-of-concept studies
using human cells, and state-of-the-art models. This project builds upon the demonstrated
therapeutic potential of modulating BMP/TGFb family signaling for the treatment of pulmonary
vascular disease and may generate novel strategies that would overcome the limitations of
current approved and investigational therapies."
10894833,"There is a critical need for rapid translation of novel preclinical data into new treatments for patients with a variety of neurological diseases. The Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT) was established by NINDS in 2011 with the objective to develop and conduct Phase 2 clinical trials and biomarker validation studies. Northwestern University’s (NU) Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) has been an active and effective member of the consortium since inception. This application has been developed in response to the NINDS RFA to continue our participation as a Clinical Site in the NEXT. The NU NEXT Center is a collaborative effort that coordinates faculty and resources of three major NUFSM hospitals: Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) with 11 hospitals in the network, Lurie Children’s Hospital (LCH) and the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab (SRALab). The NCTC faculty is comprised of highly skilled clinician investigators with expertise across all neurological subspecialties and access to a large patient base of diverse and well characterized adult and pediatric populations with a variety of neurological diseases. As we have demonstrated in the prior funding period, the NU NEXT Center is highly qualified to continue to participate in NEXT and to contribute to the development and successful completion of the network clinical trials and biomarker validation studies. The key personnel have extensive experience in clinical and translational research in their respective subspecialties; leadership roles in major research programs (including NINDS-funded projects); track record of cutting edge collaborative projects, importantly, experience in gene delivery and therapy studies; access to large and diverse populations of patients with neurological conditions; and success in enrolling patients and control participants in the NEXT and other clinical trials sponsored by NIH, private foundations and industry sources. The established infrastructures of our Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) supported by NIH funded Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) and our departmental Clinical Trials center will continue to assure timely participants recruitment by our Center. The NU NEXT Center has all required resources, facilities and equipment necessary to continue to support and actively participate in NEXT projects including pediatric population. There is a strong institutional emphasis to increase diversity of the research participants and research teams. There is extensive expertise and track record of success in training the next generation of clinician investigators. Participation in NEXT will enable the NU NEXT Center to continue to contribute expertise and research participants to neurological clinical trials across multiple subspecialties in adult and pediatric populations, consolidate efforts across disciplines, and to further expand training for junior investigators to enable them to develop independent research careers."
10929423,"AAtrium Health Wake Forest Baptist (AHWFB) has been a NeuroNEXT clinical site (“WAKENN”) since 2018. During our initial funding, WAKENN has been a consistently strong contributor to the NeuroNEXT Network (NN). We have rapidly launched the 3 NN studies available during this 5-year period. We have been a high enroller (N=19) – even being asked to stop enrollment in NN110 to “let other sites have the opportunity to enroll”. Diversity of enrolled participants demonstrates our ability to recruit underrepresented populations; 58% were either female, non-white or Hispanic ethnicity (e.g. 36% were women, 21% were non-white, and 5% were Hispanic). Our other performance metrics are also above average compared to other network sites. WAKENN has a vibrant fellowship. A unique success for WAKENN was the launch of the Wake Investigator Network Development (WIND) to support NN fellows in enhanced training and networking for multi- disciplinary collaboration to advance clinical research and clinical trials. Three fellows (to date) have completed the fellowship program; two have secured independent research funding. During this funding period, the WAKENN clinical footprint has grown considerably because of our partnership with Atrium Health (now 40-hospital health system). This offers new opportunities for collaboration, dissemination, and outreach to underrepresented patients and access to multidisciplinary investigators. We now have two children's hospitals, Brenner’s and Levine Children's Hospital (LCH). LCH is the largest children's hospital between Atlanta and Washington DC, with a catchment of more than 3.5 million. We have clinical experience with gene therapy, active participation in gene therapy trials, and preclinical expertise in gene therapy drug discovery. Our success is because of our dedicated leadership (Ezzeddine, Strowd, Duncan, Munger Clary) and committed team (Sissine, Burgos) and is backed with strong commitments from our department, institution, and the entire Atrium Health system which sees WAKENN as an enterprise-wide priority. This is backed with a solid institutional commitment to meet resource needs as they arise. Our established and active organizational structure, our expertise, and institutional commitment will ensure another successful funding period. We will meet the following aims: AIM 1: To continue to leverage our geographically, ethnically, and economically diverse catchment to effectively enroll and retain clinical trial participants from historically underserved populations. AIM 2: To employ and integrate clinical trial outreach infrastructure across our expanded health enterprise to promote rare and ultra-rare disease NN trials. AIM 3: To leverage the clinical research resources of our integrated academic health enterprise to incentivize, coordinate, and transparently track clinical trial creation, growth, and implementation. AIM 4: To continue to recruit and train the next generation of neuroscience researchers to design and implement meaningful and reproducible trials."
10755244,"Project Summary and Abstract
Neuronal chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) is an important determinant of both post-synaptic GABAA-
receptor mediated signaling and cell volume regulation. After injury, neurons swell by admitting water
and chloride salts. The chloride moiety alters the reversal potential for GABA signaling, compromising
inhibition and contributing to early anticonvulsant-resistant seizures that are thought to worsen long-
term outcomes. An important pathway for neuronal entry of water and chloride salts are the reversible
cation-Cl- cotransporters (CCC) NKCC1 and KCC2. We hypothesize that emergent limitation of
neuronal chloride influx after recovery from hypoxia-ischemia by antagonizing NKCC1 activity and/or
KCC2 activity is a uniquely effective therapeutic strategy to reduce acute cell swelling and [Cl-]i
elevation in injured neurons, restore GABAergic inhibition, prevent chronic [Cl-]i elevation, recurrent
seizures and epileptogenesis. We will test these hypotheses in vitro and in vivo using established
models of hypoxic ischemic injury, transgenic chloride imaging, and multiphoton microscopy. The
overall goal of this project is to elucidate the progressive role of cation-chloride transport activity in
hypoxia-ischemia induced neuronal injury and seizures. The results will have an important positive
impact immediately because they will identify an optimal therapeutic window for prevention and
treatment of recurrent seizures in newborns that have suffered hypoxia-ischemia and are at high risk
for developing anticonvulsant resistant seizures, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and neuromotor disabilities."
10756118,"SUMMARY
 Over 37 million people worldwide are infected with HIV and as many as 50% are affected by some form of
neurological dysfunction. Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), treatments to reduce the prevalence of
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) are lacking. Recent findings suggest that increased
mitochondrial activity in reactive astroglia play a causal role in mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons and this may
be a targetable mechanism underlying neuronal dysfunction in virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH). Early
during HIV infection, HIV-infected monocytes enter the brain and spread infection to resident microglia that then
release HIV, HIV proteins, and inflammatory cytokines, all of which stimulate a proinflammatory phenotype in
astroglia. Reactive astroglia are a hallmark of postmortem brain tissues from PWH with HAND even when on
suppressive ART. Astroglia have many homeostatic functions, which are likely disrupted by chronic low-level
HIV infection and long-term exposure to ART. One such function of astroglia is to buffer the concentrations of
metabolic substrates (glucose, lactate, and glutamine) available to neurons in the extracellular space. Despite
this crucial function to maintain bioenergetic homeostasis in the brain and the well-documented evidence of
bioenergetic deficits during HAND, little is known about how these processes are affected in reactive astroglia.
We’ve recently discovered that HIV and ART stimulate a switch in astroglia from being primarily glycolytic and
secreting the byproduct lactate, to relying on oxidative phosphorylation to meet energy demands. To achieve
this increase in mitochondrial activity, reactive astroglia increase levels of the mitochondrial biogenesis factors
(TFAM), which is associated with a reduction in TFAM expression and viability in neurons. Importantly, this
neurotoxicity is blocked by anti-inflammatory compounds that inhibit mitochondrial activity and reduce the
reactive phenotype of reactive astroglia. However, the mechanistic link between increased mitochondrial activity
in reactive astroglia and the reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons is not understood. We will
investigate the role of astroglial metabolism in HAND by testing the hypothesis that increased mitochondrial
activity in reactive astroglia compromises mitochondrial function in proximal neurons. AIM 1 will test in
human brain cells how TFAM knockdown alters mitochondrial activity in and neurotoxicity conferred by reactive
astroglia. AIM 2 will investigate in postmortem brain tissues from PWH with and without HAND and HIV- controls
the location and changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics factors and lactate transporters in reactive
astroglia and neurons. In AIM 3, mouse brains exposed to the HIV protein gp120 and ART drugs will be used to
investigate mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics factors and lactate transporters in astroglia and neurons.
These AIMs address the Office of AIDS Research Priorities to 1) Address HIV-Associated Comorbidities; and 2)
Advance Cross-Cutting Areas of research in the basic and behavioral sciences."
10756123,"Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the
understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes,
substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be
fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the
widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the
increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some
cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success
of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient
privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the
organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the
problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working
solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on
by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop
technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security
considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have
widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is
to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control
that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature
and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed
program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to
fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant
impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available
software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and
distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial
pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general
validate the developed solutions."

 The absence of effective therapies to slow or prevent progression have made Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
a global health crisis. Inflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and eventual neuronal loss are hallmarks of AD.
Cholesterol metabolism is also implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. For example,
accumulation of lipid droplets that store intracellular lipids are observed in AD brains. Cholesterol acts as a
signaling molecules and is an essential component of biological membranes. Notably, cholesterol levels in the
presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments influence synaptic transmission. Thus, changes to cholesterol
metabolism could directly induce neuronal dysfunction and other AD-associated pathology.
 While most research focuses on neurons, non-neuronal glial cells are essential in regulating neuronal
function and maintaining brain homeostasis. Astrocytes are a class of glial cell that interact with synapses, blood
vessels, and other glial cells, playing essential roles in the regulation of synaptic connectivity and function
throughout life. Recent studies suggest that changes to astrocytes are potential drivers of AD pathology.
Astrocytes have decreased physiological functions and release inflammatory factors in disease states. As the
main producers of cholesterol in the brain, cholesterol dysregulations in AD could also be primarily driven by
changes in astrocyte metabolism. However, it is still unclear to what extent cholesterol metabolism is
dysregulated in AD astrocytes and what specific genes could be targeted to reverse these changes.
 The overall goal of my dissertation and post-doctoral research is to characterize cholesterol metabolism
in astrocytes in the context of AD. Preliminary data in Aim 1 demonstrates my ability to use human stem cell
models to study intrinsic changes in astrocytes derived from individuals with AD using multi-omic and
metabolomic approaches. In Aim 1, I propose taking a closer look at how cholesterol is dysregulated in AD
astrocytes and how these dysregulations promote AD-related astrocyte dysfunctions, such as adoption of
neurotoxic properties and loss of the ability to support neurons. During the K00 Phase, I propose expanding
these analyses to in vivo models to probe system-wide contributions of astrocyte cholesterol metabolism.
 The Training Plan integrates scientific and professional development activities that will advance my long-
term career goals of becoming an independent neuroscience researcher and principal investigator of an
academic laboratory. The proposed research provides ample opportunities for developing technical expertise in
astrocyte biology, metabolism, and analytical techniques. My Sponsors will be instrumental in helping me build
skills in experimental design, scientific communication, and grantsmanship. They will also guide me in finding a
postdoctoral training environment that aligns with my long-term research and career goals."
10744181,"Summary
The mammalian olfactory system has the remarkable ability to detect and identify an astronomical number of
volatile chemicals, termed odorants. Odorants are detected by olfactory receptors (ORs) at the cilia of olfactory
sensory neurons (OSNs), which transform chemical information into electrical signals transmitted to the olfactory
bulb (OB). Each one of the ~1000 OR genes is expressed in a monogenic, monoallelic, and seemingly stochastic
fashion in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), yet axons from OSNs with the same OR converge to distinct and
stereotypic neuropil structures at the OB called glomeruli. Because each OR identity is represented by
corresponding glomeruli, odor binding to distinct OR repertoires activates an odor-specific combination of
glomeruli, providing the basis of odor perception. Here, we investigate molecular mechanisms that transform the
random expression of a single OR in the MOE to stereotypic and highly coordinated axon targeting programs in
the OB. Previous work revealed that the OR sequence plays an essential regulatory function in this axon
guidance process, in part, by directing the expression programs of genes involved in axon guidance and cell
adhesion. We reveal that the OR identity may inform this process by eliciting distinct levels of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, which in turn, influence transcriptional programs controlling axon targeting specificity. With
the generation of a translational fluorescent reporter that quantifies the levels of ER stress-induced Perk
signaling, we demonstrate that OSNs have distinct levels of ER stress according to the identity of the OR they
express. Furthermore, by deconvoluting transcriptional networks, we identified transcription factors that
transform ER stress levels into distinct axon guidance outputs. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose
experiments that will decipher the function of ER stress-responsive transcription factors and will identify
extracellular barcodes corresponding to various levels of ER stress. Moreover, we propose experiments that will
untangle the contribution of OR identity and OSN origin to the cellular levels of ER stress and will identify OR
protein sequences with a major role in this process. Our experiments promise to provide novel insight into a
fascinating problem that has remained poorly understood for decades. Moreover, this work will uncover
generalizable mechanisms responsible for converting cellular and molecular identity of neurons into precise axon
guidance specificity, with immense basic and translational ramifications."
10744182,"Project Summary/Abstract
This is a continuation of an existing program funded by an RO1 that seeks to understand fundamental
questions about the nature of the olfactory stimulus and its discrimination by primary sensory receptors, in
order to better grasp the nature of the signal being forwarded to the brain. We supplement the standard
organic chemistry approach to odor classification with one that includes a biological perspective based in
principles of medicinal chemistry pioneered in the pharmaceutical industry and drug development. This allows
us to not only consider physical chemical characteristics of molecules but also how they interact with the many
olfactory receptors. This work, like much of olfactory cellular studies, utilized monomolecular stimuli to probe
receptor function. However the olfactory system is usually confronted with complex stimulus blends of
between tens and hundreds of components. To better understand the complexity of mixture discrimination we
have begun utilizing a novel microscopic technique, SCAPE – that allows us to visualize large numbers of
individual neurons in an intact tissue with single cell temporal and spatial resolution. Preliminary data from that
work showed a remarkable and unexpected degree of inhibition and enhancement of responses by one
component of the mixture on other components of the mixture. This raises a fundamental issue in olfactory
discrimination as there appears to be considerable interaction between stimuli at the primary receptor, raising
crucial questions about how the brain perceives and manages signals that differ depending on the presence of
particular odors in a blend. It appears that many, if not all, odors can act as either an agonist or antagonist at
different receptors. Thus depending on whether or not an antagonist to odor X, for example, exists in the
blend, the signal from odor X will appear different to the brain. This level of complexity is unusual in sensory
systems where signal processing of this sort occurs in the brain not the primary receptors. Understanding
higher brain processing olfactory signals will require a greater understanding of the initial events at primary
receptors. The olfactory code is more than the additive contributions of the olfactory receptors."
10880640,"Project Summary/Abstract
The complexities of heterogeneity, stratification, and staging of sepsis have contributed to the poor
translatability of current molecular models for diagnosis and treatment of human sepsis. The National Advisory
General Medical Sciences Council advised using discovery approaches to characterize sepsis using human
biospecimens. Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to a
bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, is a major cause of death in premature (≤32 weeks) and low birth weight (≤
1500g) infants and occurs in up to 25% of such infants.1-3 The ability to collect microbiome and tissue
biospecimens longitudinally from multiple body sites under extremely controlled circumstances prior to, during,
and throughout sepsis (culture proven), sepsis-like (culture negative critical illness), and ""normal"" growing
premature infant conditions will allow our team to determine optimal sample collection, storage, and processing
protocols using small volume samples to enhance sepsis research rigor, and to develop new strategies for
sepsis detection by discerning pathways that contribute to the pathophysiology of sepsis in the premature
neonatal population.
In the R21 phase we will collect clinical information and stool, blood, and saliva specimens longitudinally from
preterm infants (≤32 weeks and ≤1500g) on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 of life, and additionally
during suspected sepsis events. Standardization and documentation of sample collection, storage, and
processing and sample validation studies will ensure rigor and reproducibility and inform the field.
In the R33 phase we will collect samples from 2 clinical sites providing a test set for machine learning methods.
Utility of the newly collected biospecimens and associated clinical data will be demonstrated by constructing a
multi-omic network for predicting causal mechanisms from genes/metabolites/clinical parameters differentially
expressed between clinically well neonates and those with culture proven sepsis and culture negative systemic
inflammatory illness. We will make establish testable causal inferences and predictive models of microbial/host
gene interactions and biologic mechanisms leading to sepsis that could form the foundation for future
mechanistic studies.
Our team of neonatal providers, immunologists, systems biologists, microbiome specialists, and
bioinformaticians supported by two large Level IV NICUs are uniquely positioned to collect and analyze
biospecimens and clinical data before, during, and after critical illness in patients with extreme prematurity."
10914264,"ABSTRACT
Racial disparities in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment, care, and patient outcomes are
profound, persistent, and pervasive. Despite a large volume of studies linking structural racism to a range of
health outcomes, only recently has there been a surge in attention to the role of racism in driving the well-
documented inequities in CKD. Effective CKD treatment and care can improve quality of life, reduce the need
for deceased donor transplant, decrease the likelihood of allograft failure, and improve long-term patient
survival; yet racial disparities exist at each point along this pathway of care due to structural racism.
The Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) offers a well-established, multi-level framework for organizing
health systems in order to maximize outcomes among patients with chronic diseases such as CKD; however,
alone, it fails to attend to the role of structural racism. We propose multi-level, multi-component interventions
under a new innovative framework to motivate systemic change: we will apply the four foci of Public Health
Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP), a public health framework that addresses change through an anti-racism lens,
to the six components of the CCM to impact CKD care in primary care and acute care access points,
nephrology, and dialysis care settings. In this manner, we propose to redesign structures within Emory
Healthcare to mitigate the effect of structural racism on CKD inequities.
Our long-term goal is to eliminate racial inequities in CKD progression, treatment, and care among patients
within Emory Healthcare by developing a model of care that can be replicated and sustained within health
systems across the country. In the development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of the multi-
component, multi-level interventions we will rely heavily on a community-engaged approach at all stages of
implementation. Our central hypothesis is that with substantial guidance from a Community Advisory Board,
comprehensive systems change implemented through an anti-racism lens will improve access to all steps of
care along the CKD continuum among African American patients, thereby decreasing existing racial inequities.
In close collaboration with the U01 Research Coordinating Center, we propose these aims:
1. Apply PHCRP to develop multi-level, multi-component interventions that target patient & provider outcomes
2. Implement multi-level, multi-component interventions across primary care and acute care access points,
nephrology, and dialysis care using the six components of the CCM and PHCRP as organizing frameworks
3. Using a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design, determine the effectiveness of the interventions
on primary outcomes analyzed at the level of patients and provider type
4. Evaluate implementation and support dissemination of the multi-level, multi-component interventions using
the extended RE-AIM framework to assess Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance/Sustainability from a health equity lens."
10744742,"Meningeal stem cell signals for improving sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes after stroke
Mortality after stroke has decreased. The challenge now is how to deal with the accumulating burden of
sensorimotor deficits and post-stroke dementia in surviving patients. In this proposal, we will investigate the
meninges as a novel source of stem cell signals that may potentially assist with neurovascular unit recovery.
Our pilot data suggest that: (i) meningeal multipotent stem cells (MeSCs) migrate to perivascular space after
focal ischemia, (ii) MeSC response may be significant, accounting for up to 30% of CD271 “total stem cell
response”, (iii) this is an “active process” since inhibiting CXCR4 decreased MeSC migration, (iv) MeSC
response may be a relevant therapeutic target since it can be significantly amplified by blocking CD271-
mediated stem cell death with LM11A-31, whereas blocking SDF-1 signaling with AMD3100 decreased MeSC
migration and worsened blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury; (v) beneficial actions of MeSC may involve
restoration of vascular integrity and upregulation of TGF-β-stimulated macrophages that further promote
neurogenic responses, and finally (vi) models and methods to dissect this phenomenon are feasible including
molecular tools, vasculome mapping, behavioral tests, and in vivo imaging in our collaborating labs.
Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that (a) brain endothelial cells and astrocytes secrete SDF-1 into
perivascular space to attract MeSCs, (b) MeSCs restore damaged BBB and rescue the vasculome, (c) MeSC
crosstalk with perivascular macrophages promotes TGF-β-mediated neurogenesis, and (d) MeSC-mediated
neurovascular unit recovery ameliorates sensorimotor deficits and post-stroke dementia.
We have 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will map the profile of MeSC proliferation, accumulation, and
differentiation in focal cerebral ischemia. In Aim 2, we will investigate cellular mechanisms of crosstalk between
MeSCs and vascular/perivascular cells that underlie MeSC migration, BBB repair, vasculome renormalization
and neurogenesis. In Aim 3, we will use gain and loss-of-function experiments to modify MeSC-mediated
neurovascular remodeling, and assess sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes in vivo. Our experiments will
utilize cell cultures and animal models. Molecular tools include a combination of pharmacologic
activators/inhibitors, CRISPR/cas9, and cre-lox systems to modify specific pathways and genes. Translational
relevance will be assessed with in vivo imaging and long-term outcomes. This project should define a novel
mechanism wherein meningeal stem cells communicate with the neurovascular unit, and hopefully provide new
approaches to improve sensorimotor recovery and ameliorate post-stroke dementia."

Our goal is to investigate the impact of diet and pressure overload on the histone code, and how this influences
changes in gene expression in the healthy and hypertrophied/failing hearts and, in turn, how it impacts
progression of the disease. Deciphering the histone code and how diet can modify it, provides us an educated
means to exploit it to our advantage, especially during pathological conditions. Acetylation and methylation of
histone lysine (K) residues were the first histone modifications discovered and are, therefore, the most widely
studied and understood. However, to-date, there are 11 confirmed modifiers of histone lysine residues, including
the acyl groups butyryl (Bu), crotonyl (Cr), and b-hydroxybutyrate (bHB) 1, whose source, genomic distribution,
and functional relevance, remain largely unknown in the heart, and are the focus of our study. Our recent findings
uniquely show that dietary fat is a major regulator of histone butyrylation, including H3K9-butyryl (H3K9Bu).
Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we show that H3K9Bu is abundant
at all transcriptionally active promoters. Both a high-fat diet and stress accelerated the conversion of butyryl-CoA
to crotonyl-CoA via acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain (ACADS), resulting in a substantial reduction in global
promoter-H3K9Bu. A deletion of ACADS both in the mouse heart and in human cells reversed this effect and
increased promoter and gene-body H3K9Bu. Paradoxically, though, a fat-free diet had the highest levels of
H3K9Bu. Deletion of fatty acid synthetase (FASN), abolished H3K9Bu in cells maintained in a glucose-rich, fatty
acid-free, but not in a fatty acid-rich, medium, proving that fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrates substitutes
for dietary fat as a source butyryl-CoA. In contrast to H3K9Bu, there were minimal dietary-induced changes in
H3K9-acetyl (H3K9ac) levels. Importantly, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed that diet-induced changes in
H3K9Bu abundance in the mouse heart was associated with differential changes in gene expression, but only
when stressed by pressure overload. Moreover, promoter-H3K9Bu levels inversely correlated with the extent of
changes in gene expression levels, as evidenced by the more robust changes seen in the hearts of mice on a,
short-term, high-fat vs a fat-free diet, as well as, after deletion of the ACADS. Interestingly, H3K9Bu abundance
inversely correlated with H3K9-crotonyl (H3K9Cr) and Cdk9. In sum, our data uniquely show that H3K9Bu is
enriched at active promoters, is negatively regulated by high-fat and stress in an ACADS-dependent fashion,
and its abundance inversely correlates with stress-induced changes in gene expression. We are proposing that
histone H3K9Bu, H3K9Cr, and H3K9-b-hydroxybutyryl (H3K9bHB), are products of the b-oxidation
intermediates, butyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, and b-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, or the ketone body, b-hydroxybutyrate,
which serve as substrates for histones modifications. These marks are labile and differentially influence pressure
overload-induced gene expression, but not baseline expression. Specifically, as H3K9Bu decreases it is replaced
by H3K9Cr during a high-fat diet. This exchange exaggerates gene expression and worsens the outcome of
cardiac failure. Conversely, H3K9bHB that increases during a ketogenic diet has the opposite effect, as it is
reported to have beneficial effects on health and aging. This differential influence of the histone marks on gene
expression is mediated by regulating the recruitment of Cdk9 to gene promoters. We hypothesize that 1) A
high-fat diet (60 Kcal% fat, 20 Kcal% carb), or pressure overload, accelerates the conversion of nuclear butyryl-
CoA to crotonyl-CoA in an ACADS-dependent manner, thus, reducing H3K9Bu and increasing H3K9Cr, which
is responsible for exaggerating stress-induced gene expression and worsening the outcome of heart failure (HF).
In contrast, a ketogenic diet (84 Kcal% fat, 0% carb) will produce high levels of b-hydroxybutyryl that will increase
H3K9bHB, which curbs changes in stress-induced gene expression in a b-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
(BDH1)-dependent fashion, improving the outcome of HF. Supplementing a diet with b-hydroxybutyrate will also
increase H3K9bHB, with similar beneficial effects. 2) Therefore, knockdown of ACADS reduces the conversion
of butyryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA, increasing H3K9Bu and improving the outcome of heart failure during a high-fat
diet. Conversely, deletion or inhibition of BDH1 reduces H3K9bHB and worsens conditions. 3) H3K9Cr enhances
the dynamics of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) recruitment to promoters during stress, whereas, H3K9Bu
and H3K9bHB temper it, thus, reducing the extent of changes in gene expression and improving disease
outcome. The specific aims are: 1) Examine the effects of high-fat, ketogenic, and b-hydroxybutyrate-enriched
diets on the genome-wide distribution and changes in H3K9Bu, H3K9Cr and H3K9bHB, changes in gene
expression, and their impact on the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. 2) Investigate the roles of
ACADS and BDH1 in regulating the levels of H3K9Bu, H3K9Cr, and H3K9bHb, and the progression of cardiac
hypertrophy and failure. 3) Investigate the role of Cdk9 in mediating the differential transcriptional regulation
directed by promoter-H3K9Cr vs. H3K9Bu or H3K9bHB during cardiac hypertrophy and failure."
10745274,"Melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of cancers. The major reason for lack of satisfactory management of
melanomas is our poor understanding of the biology of melanoma pathogenesis. Recently, regulation of mRNA
fate in the cytoplasm emerged as a major mechanism controlling gene expression. RNA-binding proteins afford
another dimension of the regulation of pathways involved in tumor progression. IGF2BP1 is an RNA-binding
protein that regulates stability, localization and translation of its mRNA targets. We have previously shown that
RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 is overexpressed in melanomas, however the role of IGF2BP1 in pathogenesis
of melanoma has not been elucidated. Our new preliminary data in different mouse models show that IGF2BP1
affects melanoma metastasis and its high expression in human melanoma correlates with poor clinical outcomes.
Based on our previous studies and new exciting observations we hypothesize that IGF2BP1 plays a key role in
melanoma progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following independent, but highly
interrelated specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To analyze mechanisms of IGF2BP1 function in melanoma
metastasis. This aim is designed to identify IGF2BP1 targets responsible for the function of IGF2BP1 in
melanoma metastasis. To this end we propose several complementary approaches to perform an unbiased
analysis of IGF2BP1 involvement in melanoma metastasis. Our approach will include: i) analysis or RNA
downregulated upon inhibition of IGF2BP1 function in melanoma in vivo; ii) in vivo analysis of cDNAs capable of
overcoming the inhibition of melanoma metastases caused by IGF2BP1 down-regulation; iii) analysis of changes
in half-life and expression of mRNA upon IGF2BP1 inhibition in melanoma; and iv) identification of mRNAs
directly interacting with IGF2BP1 in metastatic melanoma cells. Specific Aim 2. To analyze the role of IGF2BP1
in EV-mediated melanoma progression. This aim is designed to comprehensively evaluate the function of
IGF2BP1 in melanoma EV, especially as it relates to their role in tumor progression. Our analysis will include the
elucidation of the IGF2BP1 in EV-mediated pre-metastatic niche formation; its role in EV uptake by recipient
cells in vitro and in vivo; efficiency of RNA transfer to recipient cells; analysis of EV number, size, composition
and cargo; and validation of our findings in EV isolated from the serum of melanoma patients. Impact: On
successful completion of this study, we will: (a) understand the contribution and mechanisms of IGF2BP1
involvement in melanoma progression; (b) better understand how IGF2BP1 and its target genes are involved in
melanoma metastasis; and (c) establish IGF2BP1 as a novel therapeutic target for melanoma patients. The
proposed studies which combine cellular and molecular biology, bioinformatics, technology development, and
cutting-edge in vivo experimentation will provide insights into the interplay between the IGF2BP1 and its target
molecules and how these contribute to melanoma progression. Ultimately, the data obtained in this study have
a potential to pave the way for new therapeutics in melanoma."
10745641,"Abstract
Substantial evidence suggests that the ability to sense and respond to nutrients in the intestinal lumen can
determine predisposition to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The enteroendocrine cell (EEC)
is responsible for this function despite being the least abundant cell type in the intestine. In response to
intestinal stimulants, EECs synthesize and secrete enteroendocrine peptides (EEPs) that control important
physiological processes including satiety, intestinal contractions, and systemic metabolism. Although EEP
function has been extensively studied, the connection between EEP synthesis and secretion pathways is
poorly understood. Our lab uses Drosophila melanogaster, a genetically tractable model organism, to study
conserved intestinal processes. Preliminary studies in Drosophila established a link between the previously
uncharacterized, EEC-specific G protein-coupled receptor GPRx and lipid homeostasis in the intestine.
Specifically, GPRx mutant flies exhibit lipid droplet accumulation in their intestines despite no changes in the
number of EECs expressing tachykinin (Tk), an EEP that represses lipid synthesis in Drosophila. Published
studies suggest a possible connection between GPRx and calcium (Ca2+)-mediated exocytosis and further
unpublished work in our lab pointed to a downstream role of the calcium response factor CaMKII. CaMKII is
known to promote production and release of neurotransmitters and in related insect species, it was shown to
act in response to the Drosophila steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). The aim of this work is to
elucidate the function of GPRx in the maintenance intestinal lipid homeostasis and assess co-regulation of Tk
transcription and release. First I will test the hypothesis that GPRx modulates Tk release from EECs via Ca2+-
mediated exocytosis. To do this, I will employ live imaging techniques to determine whether GPRx has an
impact on calcium transients in EECs. I will also assess the ability of an exocytosis inducer to bypass GPRx
and rescue the lipid accumulation phenotype observed in GPRx mutant and knockdown flies using
fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, I plan to identify the factor(s) that triggers GPRx stimulation. Of
particular interest are acetate and 20E because in addition to regulating Tk transcription and activation of
CaMKII, respectively, both can rescue the lipid accumulation phenotype observed in antibiotic-treated flies
when added to the fly diet. Thus, I will first determine whether acetate and 20E regulate GPRx expression and
then, through genetic manipulation, assess the impact of acetate availability on the ability of GPRx to maintain
intestinal lipid homeostasis. Lastly, I will test the role of GPRx in acetate- and 20E-mediated rescue of
intestinal lipid homeostasis in antibiotic-treated flies. Collectively, experimental outcomes will 1) elucidate the
role of GPRx in the maintenance of intestinal lipid homeostasis and 2) provide new insights into the regulatory
connection between EEP expression and secretion. Therefore, findings could potentially inform innovative
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disease."

This application is from a coalition of Michigan institutions that participated in the first UG3 and UH3 phases of
the ECHO program. Participants in the ARCH cohort were enrolled at first prenatal visit, largely in Lansing, MI,
between 2008 – 2016, 532 of whom were successfully consented for participation in ECHO, and 85% of whom
are up to date on their annual follow-up visits. In 2016, we expanded recruitment to 20 additional clinics sites.
We again recruited at first prenatal visit and created the MARCH cohort, which is a stratified random sample of
births in the lower peninsula of MI. We aimed for a statewide sample of 1,000 births and then chose to enroll
an additional 100 births in Flint, MI, and our current total MARCH study population consented to ECHO (Level
2 participants) consists of 1,084 pregnancies and 955 births. We anticipate having enrolled 1,100 pregnancies
by the end of 2022, and 1,100 births by August 31, 2023. Our follow-up rates at one year (86%), two years
(75%) and three years (76%) exceed what is commonly found in infant/early child follow up studies. We will
further contribute to ECHO science by completing the following aims in collaboration with other ECHO cohorts:
Aim 1. Using data collected in the ECHO core protocol, we will investigate the effects of a) micronutrient levels
in pregnancy; b) early infancy feeding patterns and the gut microbiome; and c) early life adversity at multiple
intersecting levels of maternal, family, and neighborhood stressors, all in relation to our specialized outcome,
neurodevelopment. Aim 2. Using data collected in a specialized protocol, we will study the effects of mixtures
of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phthalates and heavy metals in pregnancy on child body mass
index, metabolic function, and neurodevelopment. In this aim as well, we will examine the gut microbiome as a
potential effect mediator/modifier. Aim 3. We will follow the more than 1,600 ECHO participants from our
current cohorts and recruit another 540 pregnancies to yield 450 live births consented to ECHO. We also aim
to enroll approximately 225 mothers of the anticipated 450 live births for pre-conceptional data collection from
whom we anticipate enrolling 67 subsequent children to produce a total study sample of some 2,200 Michigan
mother/child pairs. Newly recruited pregnancies will all be from either dominantly African American cities
(Detroit and Flint) or underserved rural communities in northern Michigan to contribute to the size and diversity
of the overall ECHO cohort. Aim 4. We will examine preconception exposures in men that accelerate sperm
epigenetic aging for their effects on offspring neurodevelopment and obesity and test the hypothesis that we
can identify a signature of the extracellular preconditioned secretome in the circulating plasma of pre-
conceptional women that is associated with an increased risk of recurrent preterm birth. When we have
completed our recruitment and detailed assessments of pregnant women, their children, and conceiving
partners where feasible, we will be able to make a very substantial contribution to the overall goals of the
ECHO program, including enlarging the diversity of the ECHO Cohort and contributing to ECHO-wide science."

 There is an unmet need for interventions that address overweight/obesity in pediatric cancer survivors
(PCS) after treatment. Rates of overweight and obesity for off-treatment pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) are
higher than in the general pediatric population, ranging from 40% to 50%, significantly increasing their risk for
concomitant negative health consequences. By the time survivors reach young adulthood they are 10.8 times
more likely to have cardiovascular disease than healthy siblings. Reducing the risk of adult obesity in PCS who
are overweight or obese by promoting healthy dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors may serve an
important preventive function for these survivors. We recently evaluated the feasibility of our intervention,
NOURISH for Healthy Transitions (NOURISH-T), for PCS with obesity by targeting parents as agents for
change. Results demonstrated that NOURISH-T was not only feasible, but showed promise of efficacy. We
further refined our intervention, now referred to as NOURISH-T+, and implement these in this larger, multi-site
RCT, with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of our intervention across diverse pediatric oncology clinics.
 We focus on parents to model healthy eating and PA behaviors to promote PCS behavior change. Topics
relevant to parents of PCS (e.g., transitioning to survivorship and late effects) are discussed. Parents of PCS
with overweight/obesity (BMI > 85th%ile), age 5-11, 1- <5 years off treatment will be randomly assigned to the
NOURISH-T+ intervention or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) comparison. Parents in NOURISH-T+ participate in
a 6-session, manualized intervention, with an additional dietician session and 2 PCS sessions, as well as post-
intervention booster sessions. Sessions are conducted via a videoconferencing platform. EUC consists of a
one-time informational session, nationally available brochures and follow-up check-ins.
 Parents and PCS are assessed on anthropometric measures, PA and dietary behaviors at baseline, 3-, 6-,
and 12-months post-intervention. We will enroll a highly diverse group of 260 parents/PCS dyads from Johns
Hopkins Medical Center (JH), Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, Miami Children’s Health Care System (MC), Johns
Hopkins/All Children’s Hospital (ACH), and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). University of South
Florida (USF) serves as the coordinating center for intervention, data management and analyses.
 • Aim 1a: Evaluate NOURISH-T+ for its impact on the primary outcome of child BMI z-score.
 • Aim 1b: Evaluate NOURISH-T+ on secondary outcomes: PCS waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR), PA and

• Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of NOURISH-T+ on parents, including BMI, WHR, PA and eating
 behaviors, and perceptions of child-family eating and PA practices.
• Exploratory Aim: Evaluate potential moderators of the intervention and examine the dyadic

Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor and one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Recently, we
found that biocompatible matrices significantly improve the transplant of tumor-homing neural stem cells into
the post-surgical GBM cavity allowing them to deliver anti-cancer gene products that suppress tumor
recurrence. Yet, the optimal scaffold figuration that maximizes tNSC transplant, migration, drug release, and
subsequent GBM kill remain unknown. Using clinically relevant human tNSCs, matrices, and mouse models of
GBM resection/recurrence, we have found that 3D architecture and scaffold composition markedly enhance
tNSC persistence in the surgical cavity. Here in, we hypothesize that optimizing features through unique 3D
printing of custom designed scaffolds will achieve superior suppression of post-surgical GBMs by tNSC
therapy. Leveraging Continuous Liquid Interface Printing (CLIP), a novel continuous fabrication method with
high spatial resolution, we propose to fabricate a panel of 3D matrices with different architectural, biophysical,
and mechanical response features design rationally selected to improve tNSC therapy. We will define the
impact of each design feature on tNSC persistence, homing and killing in vitro and in vivo, then test a final
optimized matrix incorporating the most beneficial features into a single matrix using surgical resection models
of patient-derived human xenografts in immune-depleted mice and syngeneic GBM allografts in immune-
competent animals. We propose to undertake the following Aims: 1) Utilize CLIP to fabricate a panel of 3D
printed matrices with varied design features; 2) Define the impact of 3D design features on tNSC efficacy for
post-operative GBM; 3) Investigate the efficacy and safety of 3D matrix/tNSC therapy in immune-competent
models of GBM resection/recurrence. The results of our study will generate a therapeutic tNSC/scaffold
transplant strategy capable of robust GBM killing that can be translated for human patient testing. It will also
uncover the scaffold features that regulate different aspects of tNSCs, allowing us to modulate tNSC cancer
therapy through matrix design."
10769718,"Emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic maintenance factor involved in a wide array of costly and
debilitating psychiatric disorders. Although numerous full-model behavioral health treatments have been
designed to improve patients’ emotion regulation capacities, these treatments consist of multiple components,
making it difficult to discern which are active mechanisms leading to reductions in negative emotion intensity.
Further, it is unclear whether the delivery of these evidence-based components can be tailored to the individual
patient. The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year
plan to support the applicant’s long-term career goal of becoming a clinical scientist with expertise in (1)
identifying active mechanisms of emotion regulation interventions for psychopathology, (2) tailoring these
interventions to individual patients, and (3) developing scalable interventions for wide dissemination. The
applicant’s training and career thus far are aligned with these long-term goals. Throughout his graduate work,
he conducted studies testing emotion regulation mechanisms in transdiagnostic samples and used this
information to explore for whom these mechanisms were most impactful. The immediate goals of the K23
award are for the applicant to become skilled at intensive longitudinal experimental designs to disaggregate
between- from within-person mechanisms of change and enhance his proficiency in conducting and analyzing
multimethod assessments of emotion regulation. This proposal uses a two-phase approach to address these
goals. In line with an experimental therapeutics approach, the goal of Phase 1 is to compare the effects of
teaching one or three emotion regulation skills on daily changes in negative emotion intensity among
participants with elevated emotion dysregulation. The first goal of Phase 2 is to apply a personalization
algorithm based on Phase 1 data to an independent sample to determine which baseline participant
characteristics predict greater reductions in negative emotion intensity in each experimental condition. The
second goal of Phase 2 is to compare the effects of teaching participants emotion regulation skill(s) according
to their optimal or non-optimal delivery condition, based on the personalization algorithm. The training plan
closely matches the proposed research and long-term goals, including (a) developing advanced understanding
in statistical methods to test between- and within-person mechanisms of emotion regulation interventions, (b)
gaining proficiency in applying novel personalization algorithms, and (c) enhancing expertise in the
implementation and analysis of multimethod assessments of emotion regulation skills. The broader aim of this
research and training is to address the need for more efficient, personalized, and scalable interventions for
transdiagnostic psychiatric conditions, in line with the NIMH strategic plan. This study will answer important
theoretical and practical questions about the efficacy of different emotion regulation mechanisms on clinical
outcomes that may promote the development of more targeted and disseminable interventions."
10769794,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this multi-PI project is to understand how Staphylococcus spp. bind to the skin surface. Although S.
aureus has the capability to cause significant disease in humans, most Staphylococcus spp. do not cause
disease but instead act as commensals or mutualists and adhere to the skin surface providing beneficial aspects
to the host. These benefits include inhibition of pathogen colonization by synthesis of unique antimicrobial
compounds in addition to appropriate immune system development. However, we do not know how
Staphylococcus spp adhere to skin. This application hypothesizes that species of staphylococci that colonize
humans do so in a conserved manner via an Aap (or SasG in S. aureus) orthologue that binds corneocytes. Aap
is a rod-like fibrillar protein that functions in initial adherence to corneocytes but also functions to mediate
intercellular accumulation. To address this hypothesis, we have proposed the following specific aims: (1)
understand the dynamics of Aap-mediated corneocyte adherence; (2) define the ligand specificity of Aap and
SasG lectin domains and (3) investigate S. aureus SasG-dependent mechanisms of skin colonization. Overall,
the proposed studies will address how staphylococci bind to skin, what ligand is bound, and thus could uncover
new layers of crosstalk between pathogen and the host, potentially leading to novel therapeutic modalities for
treating staphylococcal infections."
10767400,"The application of quantitative approaches to study biology and medicine is an essential underpinning for the
advancement of biomedical research. This proposal requests support for the Molecular Biophysics Training
Program (MBTP) at Vanderbilt University, which was founded in 1989. The goal of our program is to train
students to work at the interface between quantitative molecular approaches and key problems in biology and
medicine within a diverse, inclusive, and supportive environment. The MBTP operates in a unique niche
compared with typical domain-specific programs, providing both a deeper grounding in the physical sciences
for trainees who have a life sciences background, and a more thorough exposure to the life sciences and
medicine than is usual for students with a physical sciences, mathematics or engineering background.
Although the program draws its training faculty from 9 different departments in the School of Medicine, the
College of Arts & Science, and the School of Engineering, it is rooted in an established network of common
research and training activities. The number of 83 current students associated with the MBTP is > 2.5 times
the number (27) from 15 years ago. Moreover, 13 of the current trainees (16%) are from groups that are
underrepresented in science. Together, our trainees, the 28 Training Faculty, the scientific staff, and our
postdoctoral fellows make for a highly collegial and collaborative community of ~150 members. Beyond their
individually tailored curriculum, trainees meet along with the entire MBTP community for a minimum of three
formal research seminars and one informal gathering each month. The scope of research in the community
spans the range of modern molecular biophysics, from understanding the principles of protein folding, to
structural characterization of membrane proteins, to defining the action of multi-protein cellular machinery, to
investigating the movement of biomolecules into, out of, and within cells. Research projects involve a broad
spectrum of physical, biochemical, and computational approaches, including x-ray crystallography, NMR,
EPR and fluorescence spectroscopies, small angle scattering, cryo-electron microscopy, cell imaging with a
range of light microscopies and molecular/cellular simulations. Most trainees utilize several of these
approaches. Trainees join the MBTP in their first year of graduate training after choosing a thesis laboratory
and are typically supported for two years. This grant support is requested to cover time needed for additional
specialized didactic training, the initiation of thesis research, and professional development for 10 trainees.
Importantly, whether T32-funded or not, all trainees (and their preceptors) will remain active in MBTP program

10770491,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term objectives of this proposal are: 1) to evaluate a biobehavioral model of depressive symptoms
and anhedonia in adolescents, and 2) to leverage sleep and circadian function to promote mental health.
These objectives are consistent with two key priorities of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH): 1)
identify mechanisms of psychopathology, and 2) improve prevention and treatment for psychopathology. The
proposed model of depression posits that sleep duration and/or timing moderate the effects of stressful events
on depressive symptoms and anhedonia by disrupting reward- and stress-related brain function. The research
approach uses two complementary study designs to evaluate the proposed model: 1) an observational study
(n=150) that assesses the degree to which short and late sleep predict reward- and stress-related brain
function and depressive symptoms and anhedonia, and 2) an experimental study (n=100) that assesses the
extent to which sleep duration and timing impact reward- and stress-related brain function and depressive
symptoms and anhedonia. The sample includes high-school adolescents (14-19 years of age) with enhanced
risk for depressive symptoms based on exposure to lifetime stressful events and current depressive symptoms.
Recruitment will be stratified to include adolescents with short and late sleep (weekday sleep duration ≤ 6 h &
midpoint ≥ 4 am; n=100) versus long and early sleep (weekday sleep duration ≥ 8 h & midpoint ≤ 2:30 am;
n=50). Both studies include measurement of daily sleep and stressful events for 2 weeks; laboratory measures
of reward- and stress-related brain function and sleep and circadian characteristics; self-report measures of
lifetime stressful events; and self-report measures of depressive symptoms and anhedonia during daily and
weekly monitoring. The experimental study includes random assignment of adolescents with short and late
sleep from the observational study to 2 weeks of either: 1) 90 min extension and advance of sleep opportunity
and timing (n=50); or 2) typical sleep opportunity and timing (n=50). This research approach is designed to
accomplish three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the extent to which sleep duration and/or timing predict reward-
and stress-related brain function, and moderate the effects of stressful life events; 2) Establish the extent to
which sleep duration and/or timing impact reward- and stress-related brain function, and moderate the effects
of stressful life events; and 3) Determine the extent to which changes in reward- or stress-related brain function
mediate the associations between sleep duration and/or timing and later depressive symptoms and anhedonia.
The investigative team has expertise in the etiology and prevention of depression in adolescents, including
specific expertise in the impact of sleep and stressful life events on the stress and reward systems that
contribute to depression and anhedonia. All four investigators are also licensed clinical psychologists who are
committed to translating research on the mechanisms of psychopathology to preventative interventions."

Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most commonly diagnosed form of focal epilepsy in adults, have
been shown to experience reproductive endocrine disorders at a rate higher than the general population. Notably,
clinical studies have also found disrupted patterns of luteinizing hormone (LH) release in both sexes.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common output in the brain’s control of
reproduction, and they play a key role in the pituitary release of LH. Our lab has shown that both GnRH neuron
firing activity and intrinsic excitability are disrupted in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of
TLE. Upstream kisspeptin neuron populations in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular
nucleus (AVPV) are major sources of synaptic transmission to GnRH neurons. ARC kisspeptin neurons play a
key role in the pulsatile release of LH in both sexes, and AVPV kisspeptin neurons regulate the preovulatory
GnRH/LH surge in females. However, kisspeptin neuron function has never been studied in an animal model of
epilepsy. Thus, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the effects of epilepsy on the hypothalamic kisspeptin-
GnRH circuit. The overall objective of this specific proposal is to elucidate epilepsy-associated changes in the
kisspeptin-GnRH circuit. In Aim 1, patch clamp electrophysiology will be employed to determine epilepsy-induced
changes in kisspeptin neuron function and excitability in relation to estrous cycle stage and sex. A combination
of whole-cell current clamp and loose-patch recordings will be used to analyze epilepsy-associated changes in
kisspeptin neuron intrinsic excitability and firing activity. In Aim 2, two-photon calcium imaging will be conducted
to identify epilepsy-associated changes in GnRH neuron axon terminal activity and response to kisspeptin.
Completion of these aims will provide the foundational information necessary to make continued progress
towards the NINDS Epilepsy Research Benchmarks of controlling epilepsy-related conditions and preventing the
adverse consequences of seizure treatment. The training plan contained within this proposal seeks to facilitate
the development of the primary investigator to better prepare him for a career as an independent researcher.
This training plan places heavy emphasis on laboratory-based learning, with small amounts of additional
classroom-based learning also included to provide the conceptual foundation needed for the technical training.
This research experience will also take place in an intellectual environment that allows for the prioritization of
those experiences that will play key roles in the development of the primary investigator."

We develop novel algorithms in structural molecular biology. To surmount the challenges proposed herein, our algorithms
exploit combinatorial optimization, computational geometry and topology, and integrate advanced machine learning
techniques. We believe software for PS&D must be I) Open-Source and II) Free software. This is the goal of OSPREY. Thus,
we will (C) continue to develop free, open-source algorithms and software not only for challenging problems in the design
of proteins and their interactions, but also to determine difficult protein structures and characterize their dynamics.
We will use structural data and computational models to understand molecular mechanism and the basis of therapeutic
interventions, and perform detailed experimental measurements in vitro and in vivo to confirm, iterate, and improve both
our understanding of protein structure and molecular designs. The resulting models of protein structures and dynamics,
together with our novel design methodology, will illuminate targets of biochemical and pharmacological significance. We
will also advance PS&D by making algorithmic and modeling advances. We will test our methods and predictions by
creating designed protein and inhibitor constructs, solving empirical structures, and performing in vitro experiments to
measure enhanced biophysical properties on purified components, and in-cell experiments to measure biological efficacy.
We will apply our PS&D algorithms to several areas of biomedical importance. We will solve structures of systems under
our investigation and further develop the paradigm of protein structure as a continuous probability distribution. A set of
synergistic research thrusts is proposed, in which, for example, we will (1) predict future resistance mutations in protein
targets of novel drugs, (2) design protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors that target “undruggable” proteins, and (3)
use our PS&D methodology to characterize and design antibody:antigen constructs, with the ultimate goal of creating
pan-neutralizing antibodies for viral targets. Our sustained program in developing novel computational methods to
accurately predict potential drug target mutations in response to early-stage leads should drive the design of more
resilient and durable first-generation drug candidates."

10770388,"Older adults (≥65 years old) constitute about 17% of the US population but account for ~57% of the population
who use ≥3 drugs (polypharmacy). Currently, ~30million US adults use ≥3 drugs which increase their exposure
to high-order drug-drug interactions (HDDIs), i.e. drug-drug interactions involving ≥3 drugs. HDDI is a major risk
factor of serious adverse drug events (ADEs) that result in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization.
Older adults, compared to younger adults, are 7-times more likely to be hospitalized and 2 to 3-times more likely
to visit the ED for ADEs. However, knowledge on how to identify HDDI-ADE associations, data on the
comparative safety of different 3-drug combinations and clinical and pharmacokinetic mechanisms for HDDI-
ADE associations are all critically limited. The current project is designed to address these major gaps by
specifically: (1) applying our state-of-art data mining techniques to discover HDDIs that are associated with
higher risk of ADEs as well as those associated with lower ADE risk; (2) performing a comparative safety
assessment of 3-drug combinations involving anticoagulants, antidiabetic agents and opioids; and (3) validating
and evaluating the clinical validity and pharmacologic mechanisms of HDDI-ADE associations.
 These aims will be implemented by focusing on older patients who had an ED visit based on real-world
data from health insurance claims (MarketScan and Medicare) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. We
will focus on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hypoglycemia and opioid-induced ADEs as the primary ADEs of
interest for all three aims. These three ADEs account for 60% of all ADE-induced ED visits and are a target
priority for prevention and surveillance by the US Health and Human Services. Our preliminary data from the
MarketScan claims data (2012-2018) alone has confirmed that older adults are at higher risk of ADEs and that
the risk of these ADEs increase with the counts of concomitant drugs used by patients. We will apply our mixture
drug-count response (MDCR) and graphical models to identify the specific 3- or 4-drug combinations that have
the highest risk and those with the lowest risk of ADEs in ED settings among older adults (Aim 1). For Aim 2, we
will apply pharmacoepidemiologic study designs and casual inference approaches to assess the comparative
safety of specific high and low-risk 3-drug combinations. We will control for the potential confounding effects of
several patient-level (demographic, clinical, chronic comorbidities, drug characteristics, healthcare utilization, etc)
and provider/healthcare system-level factors to assess the causal associations between high-risk versus low-
risk 3-drug combinations. Finally, we will use a clinician expert team to evaluate the HDDI-ADE pairs and
associations identified from Aims 1 and 2 for clinical validity and utility.
 The identification of high- and low-risk 3-drug combinations is vital knowledge that could guide the
development of new polypharmacy prescribing recommendations to help address the significant public health
challenge created by ADEs."
10770392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For blind people, visual aids like a graphic or a plot are not accessible. Instead, tactile aids are used help render
abstract concepts through an arrangement of physical features, like bumps, lines, and textures. Although useful,
static tactile aids cannot easily render many abstract concepts and still face difficulties when displaying large
amounts of information. A key issue with displaying dense, complex information is that using too many lines or
bumps in a small space creates “tactile clutter”, leading to confusion and misinterpretation by the user. In fact,
the ability of tactile aids to render information by touch is practically at full capacity. While fabrication costs are
lowering with emerging technologies, the core technology of using patterns of bumps and textures to render
information by touch has largely remained the same. Most current research is not focused on addressing this
fundamental limitation and instead sidesteps by using other senses instead, like audio. Therefore, there has
been little progress in tactile stimuli generated by a tactile aid, which has limited their ability to make complex
information accessible for blind people. To address the lack of methods to create tactile sensations in static
tactile aids, this research will increase the variety and density of tactile sensations by using “designer materials”.
Designer materials, unlike physical features like bumps and lines, are surface coatings which use phenomena
from surface chemistry to control adhesion and friction and thereby generate new tactile sensations. By relying
on surface chemistry, it is possible to exert a level of control and spatial resolution not currently possible.
Designer materials will be combined with current physical features to build the next generation of easier-to-read
and more information dense tactile aids. These tactile aids will be demonstrated in a series of everyday activities
with blind subjects. This project combines our team’s expertise in material science, solid mechanics, human
psychophysics, and tactile aid development. Our project is centered around the discovery of new designer
materials, developing next generation tactile aids, and mechanistic studies into the optimal design of tactile aids.
Together, these areas allow us to rapidly iterate new tactile aids, build rationale guidelines for designing
traditional and next generation tactile aids, and provides a much-needed expansion in the toolkit for tactile aid
developers. To maximize impact, all aspects of the project involve close collaboration with members of the blind
community."

Vascular complications associated with lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, contribute to an increased
risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure associated with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF). These vascular complications may involve, at least in part, vascular smooth muscle (VSM) dysfunction
leading to impaired vasomotor function, but mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently identified a
novel AKAP5/P2Y11/AC5/PKA/CaV1.2 nanocomplex that is activated by the release of extracellular nucleotides,
such as ATP. This complex controls VSM contractility, vasoconstriction, and altered blood flow (BF) and blood
pressure (BP) in response to elevated extracellular glucose (e.g. hyperglycemia; HG – a major metabolic
abnormality in diabetes). Yet, whether HG stimulates cellular nucleotide release, the precise molecular entity
underlying this process, and its potential role in diabetes and other diseases (e.g. HFpEF) are unknown. The
overarching goal of this MPI proposal is to provide insight into these issues. Our preliminary data offers a
unique window into these queries and uncover an essential role for the large-pore channel pannexin 1 (Panx1)
as a key member and upstream protein activating the nanocomplex and thus contributing to altered vascular
reactivity during diabetes and perhaps other diseases such as HFpEF. We will address the novel central
hypothesis that Panx1 is upstream and part of the AKAP5/P2Y11/AC5/PKA/CaV1.2 signaling axis that promotes
VSM contractility and altered BF/BP in response to diabetic hyperglycemia. The proposal has high significance
as it defines Panx1 as 1) a key upstream pathway triggering pathological signaling resulting in VSM
hypercontractility during diabetic hyperglycemia and 2) a potential therapeutic target to treat vascular
complications in diabetes (and perhaps HFpEF). The influence of Panx1 in contributing to the ATP release in
response to HG, and in strengthening/weakening the formation of nanocomplexes to mediate functional
responses, which may have broader implications in any Panx1-dependent signaling process, is an emerging
and innovative concept. Our innovative multi-scale approach using state-of-the-art approaches will be
implemented to explore the following aims. Aim 1 is to elucidate the role of Panx1 on HG signaling in VSM. Aim
2 is to determine the impact of Panx1 on VSM dysfunction during diabetes and HFpEF. The impact of the
proposal is in establishing Panx1 as a key contributor to defective VSM function and vascular complications in
diabetes and HFpEF."
10772991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal foster adaptations in brain regions that regulate mood,
learning, and goal-directed behavior. These adaptations are thought to promote heightened anxiety, cognitive
deficits, and craving – hallmarks of alcohol use disorder (AUD) that collaborate to promote compulsive drug-
seeking behavior, increase relapse susceptibility, and impede the development of adaptive behaviors that
could support abstinence. Although treatment options for AUD are limited, preclinical and clinical data have
generated interest in the GABAB receptor (GABABR) as a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at
diminishing craving and reducing alcohol intake. The focus of this project is on an ethanol-induced
adaptation in GABABR-dependent signaling in the basal amygdala – a key substrate of anxiety as well as
learning related to rewards and aversive experiences. Using two distinct ethanol exposure models that yield
repeated cycles of intoxication, we found that somatodendritic GABABR-dependent signaling is suppressed in
principal neurons of the mouse BA, as measured 3-4 days after the last ethanol exposure. The adaptation is
not seen in principal neurons of the lateral amygdala or pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal/prelimbic
cortex, nor is it evoked by repeated cocaine. The adaptation is attributable to a suppression of G protein-gated
inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel activity, a known determinant of anxiety-related behavior and associative
learning. The goal of this project is to understand the salient features and mechanisms, as well as
neurophysiological and behavioral implications, of the ethanol-induced suppression of GIRK channel activity in
BA principal neurons. The two interrelated AIMs are to: (1) Elucidate mechanisms underlying the ethanol-
induced suppression of GIRK channel activity. Proposed studies will employ techniques in ex vivo
electrophysiology, immunoelectron microscopy, and neuron-specific viral manipulations to test the hypothesis
that the ethanol-induced suppression of GIRK channel activity in BA principal neurons is mediated by the
GIRK3 subunit-dependent internalization of GIRK channels. (2) Understand the downstream
neurophysiological and behavioral implications of GIRK channel plasticity. Proposed studies will probe the
implications of the suppression of GIRK channel activity in BA principal neurons, testing the hypothesis that it
is sufficient to provoke adaptations in glutamatergic neurotransmission in discrete BA projections. In parallel,
the consequences of the adaptation to anxiety-related behavior, associative (fear) learning, and voluntary
ethanol consumption will be evaluated in ethanol-naïve mice, following viral genetic suppression of GIRK
channel activity in BA principal neurons. Summary: This project leverages the complementary expertise of an
experienced team, and the availability of custom research tools, to investigate a previously undescribed
ethanol-induced neuroadaptation involving a known influence on anxiety-related behavior and associative
learning. Successful completion of this project may yield new targets for interventions designed to treat AUD."

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS; DiGeorge syndrome) is a rare birth defect disorder affecting 1/4000
live births. This condition is fully penetrant, but expressivity varies, providing the opportunity to identify genetic
modifiers. Our main interest is to understand the developmental and genetic basis of congenital heart disease
(CHD) in 22q11.2DS patients by taking human and animal model genetic approaches. Approximately 60% of
patients with 22q11.2DS have CHD. Among affected patients, most have cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects,
thereby disrupting the formation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk during embryogenesis. The malformations in
patients vary from mild to severe and approximately half require surgery for survival after birth. Typical findings
include tetralogy of Fallot, persistent truncus arteriosus or right sided aortic arch with a ventricular septal defect.
The OFT derives from cells that migrate from the embryonic pharyngeal apparatus to the heart. The TBX1 gene,
encoding a T-box transcription factor is expressed in the pharyngeal apparatus. Our hypothesis is that
haploinsufficiency of TBX1, mapping to the critical deleted region on 22q11.2, along with modifiers elsewhere in
the genome contribute to the overall phenotype in patients. To identify genetic modifiers of CHD, we obtained
whole genome sequence (WGS) from 1,182 subjects with 22q11.2DS. Recently we were awarded a contract
from NIH CIDR for WGS of 895 additional subjects with DNA in hand. We further initiated a collaboration with
the G2MH Network to obtain WGS for another 500, all at no cost to this program, for a total of WGS from 2,577
subjects with 22q11.2DS. Our goal for Aim 1 is to investigate rare single nucleotide coding, non-coding and
structural variants to identify genetic modifiers of CHD. We propose to take a gene-set based approach focusing
on genes in the TBX1 network identified from our recent single cell transcriptomic experiments on control and
Tbx1 loss of function mouse embryos. We will also investigate gene-sets used for genetic studies of sporadic
CHD in the general population to determine whether modifiers for 22q11.2DS may also serve as risk factors for
general CHD. We are utilizing a novel Bayesian prioritization approach to weight genes in gene-sets based
upon their functional importance. As preliminary data we identified chromatin regulatory genes that might
increase risk to CHD in subjects 22q11.2DS and for sporadic CHD. In Aim 2, we will perform functional and
mechanistic studies of genes discovered in this program using mouse models. We will further perform biological
validation studies of DNA variants identified in this program using gene editing in the zebrafish model system.
This program will elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of CHD in 22q11.2DS that might also be risk factors for
sporadic CHD in the general population. Understanding these should improve diagnostics and help in the future,
for understanding the basis of varying outcomes in affected patients."
10772996,"Liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has become a most deadly
malignant disease worldwide. So far, pharmaceutic inhibition of major oncogenic pathways
has achieved little therapeutic benefit to liver cancer patients. We believe this is due to under-
appreciation of the complexity in mechanisms of hepato-oncogenesis. In recent experiments,
we and others have identified paradoxically anti-oncogenic effects of classical oncogenic
molecules, such as c-Met, EGFR, β-catenin, Ikkβ, Jnk, and Shp2, in the liver. Ablating these
molecules in hepatocytes enhanced HCC induced by chemical carcinogen DEN. To test a
theory that loss of the oncogenic molecules generates an oncogenic microenvironment that
promotes DEN-induced HCC, we have established another mouse HCC model, by
transfection of oncogenic β-catenin (CAT), c-Met (MET) and PIK3CA (PIK), oncoproteins
frequently detected in human HCCs. As expected, MET/CAT-driven HCC was aggravated in
β-catenin-deficient liver, due to tumor-promoting factors induced by β-catenin removal. In
contrast, Shp2 deletion dramatically suppressed HCC driven by MET/CAT or MET/PIK,
despite a similar pro-tumorigenic environment in Shp2-deficient liver. Based on these novel
unanticipated data, we propose a new hypothesis that although removal of Shp2 or β-catenin
generates cell-extrinsic tumorigenic factors in the hepatic environment, the endogenous Shp2
is indispensable for oncogenic signaling in hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, we propose
three specific aims on this project. Aim 1 is to determine the cell-intrinsic role of Shp2 in
hepato-oncogenic signaling. Aim 2 is to determine the cell-autonomous effect of β-catenin in
liver tumorigenesis. Aim 3 is to search and identify cell-extrinsic factors induced by loss of the
oncoproteins in hepatocytes. The results are expected to be instrumental for design of novel
therapeutic strategies for liver cancer by inhibiting both cell-intrinsic oncogenic signals and
the secondary environmental factors."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US, with more than 135,000 deaths
expected in 2020. Based on the National Lung Screening Trial, which showed that low-dose computed
tomography (lung screening) vs. chest X-ray reduced mortality due to lung cancer by 20%, the US Preventive
Services Task Force recommends annual lung screening for asymptomatic high risk individuals. Despite this
recommendation, utilization is poor (3%-14%). Lung screening may be particularly beneficial for African
Americans (AA), because they are more likely to have advanced disease, lower survival, and lower screening
rates compared to whites. The causes of low uptake of lung screening are multifactorial and consistent with
evidence from other cancer screening disparities. For example, provider-initiated discussions about cancer
screening tests are low overall, and AA and other racial/ethnic minorities are less likely than whites to have
these discussions. Another key driver of screening disparities is patients’ lack of knowledge about early
detection. Evidence points to the need for multilevel interventions that simultaneously address multiple barriers
to increase screening rates and decrease lung cancer morbidity and mortality in minority populations. The
proposed study will target two key levels of influence in the healthcare setting: provider and patient behavior in
order to address disparities between AA and whites in lung screening awareness and utilization. Guided by
NIH’s Health Disparities Research Framework, in the K99 phase, I will receive didactic and mentored training
in research methods to address disparities occurring in the healthcare system. I will conduct feasibility studies
and formative research to strengthen the content and delivery of the quasi-experimental study (pretest-
posttest, with a nonequivalent control group) to be conducted in the R00 phase. The specific aims are to:
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a healthcare provider prompt in a primary care
network (K99). Aim 2: Develop and pre-test the patient education component (K99). Aim 3: Test the impact of
the multilevel intervention on primary (provider-patient communication, screening intentions, and knowledge)
and secondary (screening referrals and completion) outcomes (R00). I will explore whether Health Disparities
Framework factors (e.g., race, health literacy) moderate these relationships. The proposed multilevel
intervention targets important barriers to lung screening that will provide preliminary data to inform a future R01
application designed to measure the independent and overlapping contributions of the provider and patient
interventions. This award, along with the institutional environment, training, research resources, and mentoring
team available to me through the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, will provide the
necessary training to develop approaches to reduce disparities that arise in the clinical setting and will launch
my career as an independent cancer control scientist focused on eliminating cancer disparities."

Pain is the most common complication for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD suffer from
intense acute pain that is associated with vaso-occlusive episodes and chronic pain which frequently has no
obvious pathology. Opioids are the main therapy used to treat SCD pain, despite their negative long-term side
effects, lack of efficacy, and associated treatment barriers. In order to develop better therapies for SCD pain, a
more mechanistic understanding of the neurobiological basis of SCD pain is needed. Very few studies have
characterized the role of the brain in SCD pain, despite patient reports of central sensitization and affective co-
morbidities, both of which are correlated with increased SCD pain intensity and frequency. The central nucleus
of the amygdala (CeA) is a limbic brain region activated by acute pain, chronic pain, and affective disturbances;
increased CeA activity is noted in transgenic SCD mice. Our long-term goal is to identify SCD-related factors
that increase CeA neuronal activity and pain-like behaviors in order to develop novel SCD pain therapies. This
proposal will examine how the gut microbiome influences CeA activity in SCD. Data from germ-free mice show
that an intact gut microbiome is critical for normal amygdala function. The gut microbiome of patients and mouse
models with SCD differs from that of healthy controls (i.e. exhibit dysbiosis). Anti- or probiotic manipulation of
the gut microbiome changes pain-like behaviors and CeA signaling in SCD mice. The specific aims of this
proposal will examine the neuronal mechanisms underlying these changes. In Specific Aim 1, we will use fiber
photometry to measure background and pain-evoked CeA activity in the following conditions: (A) pseudo-
germfree mice recolonized with SCD fecal material, (B) SCD mice that received longitudinal penicillin treatment,
and (C) SCD mice that underwent vagotomy surgery. These experiments will allow us to determine the extent
and mechanism through which SCD gut dysbiosis affects CeA activity. In Specific Aim 2, we will directly
manipulate select populations of CeA neurons to determine how each is involved in dysbiosis-related pain. We
will first use optogenetics to inhibit activity of select CeA neurons in pseudo-germfree mice recolonized with SCD
fecal material. We will then determine if 5HT2A receptor activity in the CeA contributes to SCD dysbiosis-related
pain. Finally, we will identify novel neuronal signaling pathways through which the SCD gut microbiome could
be driving pain. These experiments will be the foundation for my independent research laboratory which will
study the anatomical and chemical basis of nociception in order to develop personalized therapeutics for
individuals suffering from SCD and other chronic pain disorders."

The objective of the Administrative Core is to link together the various elements of the Weill Cornell
Medicine Contraception Research Center (WCM-CRC). This center, titled “On-demand nonhormonal male
contraception via ADCY10 inhibition,” has a singular scientific theme; to identify the safest and most
efficacious means for blocking soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC; ADCY10) in vivo to achieve an on-demand
contraceptive pill for men. To achieve this goal, the WCM-CRC leverages the established inter-disciplinary
team comprised of expertise in sAC physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, reproductive biology,
structural biology, enzymology, computational modeling, medicinal chemistry, and drug development. This
team, which has been effectively and efficiently working together for the past 4 years, successfully
advanced sAC inhibitors into potent, specific, drug-like leads that demonstrated proof-of-concept for on-
demand male contraception in vivo in mice. This administrative core mirrors the successful administrative
core from the previously funded WCM-CRC; all personnel and operational resources are maintained. Due
to the advancements made over the past four years, the WCM-CRC investigative team joined forces with
an expert in reproductive biology and an expert in contraceptive marketing and end-user preferences to
form Sacyl Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SACYL), a biotech company established to further develop and market
sAC inhibitors as nonhormonal, on-demand birth control pills for men. SACYL will provide `Pharma-quality'
drug development expertise to augment the work proposed in this application. In addition to ensuring that
the established group of collaborators comprising the WCM-CRC functions as a single entity, the WCM-
CRC Administrative Core will be responsible for maintaining complementarity between the WCM-CRC and
SACYL as well as fostering interactions between the WCM-CRC and NICHD program personnel,
investigators in other CRCs, and regulatory agencies. The Core's administrative responsibilities include
planning, flow of information, developing resources, outreach, and overall administration for the WCM-

measuring potency, efficacy, and specificity, we successfully developed a series of potent, specific, and
drug-like sAC inhibitors suitable for in vivo interrogation of sAC pharmaceutical potential. In preclinical
proof-of-concept experiments in mice, a `tool' compound rendered male mice temporarily infertile and
identified long residence time on sAC protein as an essential efficacy-defining feature. Thus, we now
augment our established workflow with biophysical studies directly assessing binding kinetics. We
centralize these biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic studies examining potency, selectivity,
binding kinetics, and molecular interactions of sAC inhibitors into a `closed' technical core. This in vitro
Target Engagement core will support all three Projects in the WCM-CRC. While characterization of newly
designed analogs in Projects 1 and 3 will constitute its major use, it will also be used to confirm the in vitro
efficacy of advanced leads synthesized in larger quantities for the studies in Project 2."
10746794,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises 10-20% of all breast cancers and is characterized by rapid
growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Furthermore, human TNBC often regrows after primary treatment, leading
to poor prognosis in patients with TNBC. The standard cytotoxic chemotherapies for TNBC have the poor clinical
benefit and severe side effects. Targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug
conjugates (ADCs), chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells and small molecule inhibitors, have been
developed to treat solid tumors while minimizing the side effects on normal cells, but none of these therapies
has been applied to treat TNBC. Thus, targeted therapy remains an unmet medical need to effectively treat
TNBC. Our preliminary studies identified the targeting surface receptors (such as CD276 and CD47) in TNBC,
developed novel tumor-specific mAbs that target TNBC but not to normal cells, tested multiple small molecules
showing high toxicity, established the construction and evaluation procedures of anti-CD276/CD47 ADCs, and
evaluated the potential safety and anticancer efficacy of our ADCs in vitro and in vivo. Our central hypothesis is
that the ADCs-based therapy can effectively eliminate TNBC with a limited side effect via integrated anti-cancer
mechanisms. In this study, we propose to develop targeted therapies for curative treatment of TNBC. In Aim 1,
we aim to build an effective platform of ADC therapies to treat CD276+ TNBC, and identify the most efficient
treatment strategy by investigating the targeting specificity, ADC payloads-mediated anti-TNBC efficacy, and
anti-CD276 mAb-induced immune cell activation and suppression of tumor angiogenesis. In Aim 2, we will
develop anti-CD47 ADC-based targeted therapies to eliminate CD47+ TNBC, especially chemotherapy-induced
CD47+ TNBC, and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. We will investigate the anti-tumor efficacy using
multiple TNBC cell lines and xenograft tumors, and delineate the anti-TNBC mechanisms, including ADC-
mediated drug cytotoxicity, anti-CD47 mAb-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and synergistic action of ADC drug
and anti-CD47 mAb. In Aim 3, we plan to use our established protocols of maximal tolerated dose,
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and anti-tumor efficacy to evaluate the therapeutic values of our combined dual
CD276 and CD47 targeting ADCs in our metastatic syngeneic TNBC xenograft models after surgery and/or
chemotherapy. If the anti-cancer efficacy is confirmed in the preclinical models, this will be the first combined
ADCs-based targeted therapy for TNBC treatment, which may overcome drug resistance, enhance cytotoxicity
to tumor cells with low dose, limit systemic toxicities, and prevent antigen-loss relapse. Importantly, our designs
will model clinical therapies for potential translational application, which would improve life quality and the
survival rate of TNBC patients in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy."
10746796,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transformation-associated changes in regulating cell growth and proliferation result in specific nutrient or
metabolic enzyme dependencies that are absent in non-transformed cells. Thus, nutrient dependency has
recently been shown to be therapeutically exploitable in cancer. On the other hand, cancer cells frequently face
nutrient limitation resulting from environmental variations, such as poor vascular supply, enhanced local
consumption, dietary restriction and response to therapeutics. As a result, cancer cells become increasingly
dependent on adaptive responses to mitigate metabolic stress. Therefore, defining the metabolites and the stress
response pathways on which cancer cells depend will facilitate development of better therapeutic strategies that
can improve management of cancer patients. For example, glutamine, a versatile biosynthetic substrate in
cancer cells, is frequently found depleted in tumor environment when compared to normal surrounding tissues.
We recently demonstrated that asparagine, a nonessential amino acid, plays a critical role in regulating tumor
cells' adaptation to glutamine depletion, raising the potential to target asparagine bioavailability to treat cancer.
However, little is known about how tumor cells sense and respond to asparagine deficiency. In this proposal, we
will use lymphoid malignancies as models to explore the role of adaptive amino acid response in tumor cells'
response to asparagine availability and its implication in cancer therapy. Our central hypothesis is that: neoplastic
lymphocytes rely on de novo biosynthesis to produce asparagine when environmental asparagine becomes
limiting. This adaptive program requires both the expression of key biosynthetic enzyme and the availability of
glutamine-derived biosynthetic substrates, which can collectively affect oncogenic signaling beyond their roles
in biosynthesis. Using biochemical, genetic and translational approaches, we will: (1) determine signaling and
chromatin-modifying components regulating cellular adaptation to asparagine deprivation in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) and (2) determine impact of glutamine/asparagine metabolism on oncogenic MYC function in
ALL and MYC-driven B cell lymphoma."
10814335,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microbiome dysbiosis has been increasingly recognized to be associated with colorectal neoplasia, including
colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer (CRC). Disturbances of the gut microbial community, as well as the
presence of specific gut microbes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, have been
linked to the initiation and progression of colorectal neoplasia. Meanwhile, aberrant DNA methylation and gene
expression patterns are hallmarks of colorectal neoplasia. Hence, to establish a direct and causal link between
the gut microbiome and colorectal neoplasia, it is crucial to determine whether and how the gut microbiome
affects the DNA methylome and transcriptome in colon tissues. A well-designed population-based study
investigating microbiome-host interplays would shed new light on the etiology of colorectal neoplasia. During
the past ~20 years, my mentor's team has established two large population-based studies, the Tennessee
Colorectal Polyp Study (TCPS, part of the P50CA95103, PI: Zheng) and the Southern Community Cohort
Study (SCCS, U01CA202979, PIs: Blot, Zheng and Shrubsole). Herein, I propose a multi-omics study
leveraging the unique resources from these large studies to systematically evaluate the impact of the gut
microbiome on DNA methylome and transcriptome in human colorectal neoplasia. In the K99 phase, for Aim
1, I will investigate the associations of microbiome with DNA methylation and gene expression in colorectal
adenoma tissues (N=200). For Aim 2, I will evaluate the mediatory roles of microbiome on the associations of
known CRC risk factors, such as obesity and unhealthy dietary patterns, in association with DNA methylation
and gene expression in colorectal adenoma tissues (N=200). In the R00 phase, for Aim 3, I will further
evaluate the findings from the K99 phase in additional colorectal adenoma tissues (N=439) and search for
novel associations and mediations through combining all data of colorectal adenoma tissues (N=639). In
addition, the findings in colorectal adenoma tissues will be investigated in CRC tumor tissues (N=96). For Aim
4, I will prospectively investigate the relationship of the pre-diagnostic gut microbiome with DNA methylation
and gene expression in colorectal adenoma tissues (N=139) and CRC tumor tissues (N=96), as well as with
risks of colorectal adenoma (139 cases and 139 matched controls) and CRC (96 cases and 96 matched
controls). Finally, these results will be integrated to identify potential pathways through which the microbiome
might impact colorectal neoplasia. The findings will improve our understanding of how the microbiome-host
interactions impact colorectal neoplasia development and have translational potential to develop new tools for
CRC prevention. The proposed career development award will help me gain advanced knowledge of
epidemiology, CRC biology, microbiology, advanced bioinformatics and biostatistics, as well as skills in
mentoring and educating students and junior fellows, for my transition to a successful independent investigator."
10927429,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dr. Tikvah Hayes is a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Matthew Meyerson at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. Her long-term career goal is to reduce cancer-associated mortality and
suffering by determining the mechanisms of cancer development and identifying attractive therapeutic strategies
for better patient care. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Hayes uniquely leverages both functional genomics and
molecular biology methods to answer fundamental questions related to cancer biology.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is frequently altered
in cancer. Targeted panel sequencing of patient tumors has revealed a number of activating alterations in both
EGFR and HER2. As a consequence, several generations of molecularly targeted EGFR and HER2 therapies
have been designed and have proved efficacious for some patients with either EGFR- or HER2-mutant cancers.
However, a subset of patient-observed HER family variants lacking a reported function persist and in the absence
of functional data are classified as variants of unknown significance. It remains unknown whether all EGFR and
HER2 missense mutations are oncogenic drivers and are sensitive to clinical EGFR or HER2-targeted therapies.
This proposal aims to functionally and mechanistically characterize the role of EGFR and HER2 missense
variants in promoting oncogenesis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. Aim 1 will seek to
nominate alternative strategies for patients harboring rare EGFR mutations where no clinically approved EGFR-
targeted therapy exists. Aim 2 will evaluate the oncogenic capacity of rare EGFR variants. Finally, in Aim 3,
HER2 variant oncogenic capacity and TKI sensitivity will be interrogated. The proposed research will greatly
improve our understanding of how RTK missense variants promote cancer development and resistance to
targeted therapies.
Dr. Hayes will learn new techniques which will include organoid culturing, in vivo cell line xenografts, intrathoracic
lung injections, tumor imaging and tissue processing/staining, while simultaneously enhancing her career
development through training in grant-writing, science communication, and leadership. During the K99 phase,
Dr. Hayes’ research and training will be carried out under the primary mentorship of Dr. Matthew Meyerson, a
leader in cancer genomics, and will be additionally complemented by collaborations with experts in high-
throughput genetic screening, clinical genomics, structural biology, and in vivo mouse modeling, as well as
mentoring from an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Michael Eck, William Hahn, Pasi Janne, and Carla Kim."

Core B (Animal Core) serves as a central resource for all animals used by all investigators in the Program Project.
Core personnel are responsible for maintaining up-to-date assessments of animal requirements for all Projects.
They ensure timely ordering, delivery, and proper husbandry of animals. All animal surgery is conducted and/or
supervised by Core B personnel. This includes production of mid-thoracic aorta coarctation rats and mice,
thymectomized rats, and appropriate sham-operated controls, most routine tissue removal and preservation for
in vitro analysis, and instrumentation of rats for chronic hemodynamic monitoring. Most animals used in the
Program Project have their blood pressure carefully and reliably quantified by Core B personnel either directly
(radiotelemetry transmitter) or indirectly (systolic pressure by tail-cuff sphygmomanometry) as part of each
experimental protocol. Daily animal husbandry, health surveillance and record keeping also are the responsibility
of Core B personnel, in association with the staff of Campus Animals Resources (CAR) of Michigan State
University. Core B personnel also are responsible for implementing new physiological techniques for evaluating
cardiovascular function and developing new transgenic animal models that support the goals of the Program
Project. A major advantage of Core B is that it facilitates the most efficient use of animals by Program
Investigators. Our in vivo protocols also are designed to maximize the amount of data collected from a single
animal. This is achieved through use of long-term repeated measurements of cardiovascular parameters where
possible, rather than studying separate groups of rats at each time point of interest. At the end of chronic in vivo
protocols, tissue samples from the animals are distributed to one or more Program investigators for further study."

10747961,"Project Summary – Project I
 PVAT has been narrowly viewed as a tissue that communicates with the blood vessel through secretions
and homing of immune cells. This is `outside-in' communication and is a passive function of PVAT. We
hypothesize that to maintain the homeostasis so critical to tissue health, there must be an `inside-out'
communication from the formally accepted vessel layers – intima, media, adventitia – to the PVAT that is
mechanical in nature. This allows the blood vessel to inform PVAT of its status, such that PVAT can respond
appropriately to maintain homeostasis. Thus, if secretions are made by PVAT, this may not be
uninformed/passive, but rather in response to messages received from the blood vessel it surrounds. Project I
overall hypothesis is that PVAT mechanically coordinates with the blood vessel in control of vascular
tone, contributing to (patho)physiological function.
 We propose investigation of two (2) functions of PVAT that have not been previously considered and which
exert profound effects on vascular function. Our first hypothesis is that pressure is transmitted to PVAT
through mechanosensitive elements (Aim 1). Of all the adipose tissues in the body, PVAT is primed to be
mechanoresponsive because it is exposed to constant pressure. Second, we hypothesize that PVAT has a
dynamic mechanical stiffness of its own that reduces vascular stiffness in health (Aim 2). Further, changes in
this dynamic stiffness occur with disease (e.g. increased stiffening). We share preliminary data that support
both hypotheses. PVAT, in healthy tissue, is integral to the vessel reduced vessel tone and stiffness. Thus,
this understudied vessel layer must be considered as a clinically relevant tissue. Two aims focus individually
on these new parameters. We will integrate information from other projects in how innervation and
neurotransmitters (Project II), immune cells (Project III), and direct influence of stretch on adipocyte/SVF
function (Project IV) impact PVAT mechanotransduction (Aim 1) and stiffness (Aim 2) in health. Core B
provides high fat (HF) diet-induced hypertension (Dahl S with non-hypertensive Dahl R control) as well as a
novel mid-thoracic aorta coarcted model to impose elevated pressure independent of diet. Core C has and will
continue to provide RNA sequencing analysis for determination of specific cell types within PVAT that support
mechanotransduction. Core D will be of marked assistance in measuring non cellular contributions made by
collagens and elastin. When these gaps are filled, our work will justify that PVAT should always be considered
an active partner of the formal blood vessel. We stand to redefine what is the formal blood vessel with
this new knowledge."
10747965,"Project Summary – Project II
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and encompasses multiple disorders including
atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. There is a direct positive relationship between blood
pressure and cardiovascular disease risk in humans, but the factors that contribute to abnormal blood pressure
regulation in disease are incompletely understood. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has recently emerged
as a key regulator of vascular tone and blood pressure. PVAT surrounds the majority of blood vessels and
releases anticontractile factors. The production of anticontractile mediators is driven by the sympathetic
neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), but the source of NE that drives this effect remains unknown. The
overall goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms that mediate neurotransmission in PVAT in
health and disease. Potential mechanisms that drive adipocyte activity include local production of mediators by
non-neuronal cells, neural innervation, or circulating neurotransmitters. This proposal tests the central
hypothesis that autocrine signaling mediated by the uptake and release of NE by adipocytes is the primary
regulator of PVAT adipocyte activity, while neural innervation and circulating factors play minor roles. Further,
we propose that the presynaptic functions of PVAT adipocytes are altered in conditions that produce vascular
disease. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims that will study mesenteric and aortic PVAT in male
and female animals during health and disease. Experiments will utilize targeted genetic tracing and tissue
clearing to identify physical interactions between nerves and adipocytes, genetically encoded calcium
indicators to study adipocyte activation, chemogenetics to test the functional relevance of adipocyte activation,
fluorescent false neurotransmitters to study the dynamics of NE uptake and release in adipocytes, and RNA
sequencing to understand how specific mechanisms and pathways are regulated during disease. Specific Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that the stimulation of PVAT adipocytes by NE involves autocrine signaling mediated
by adipocytes rather direct neural innervation or circulating neurotransmitters. Experiments in this aim include
anatomical studies in genetic reporter lines, calcium imaging with genetically encoded indicators,
chemogenetics in functional assays of vascular tone, and measures of fluorescent false neurotransmitter
uptake and release. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that presynaptic functions of PVAT adipocytes are
impaired in conditions that produce vascular disease. This aim will use the high fat diet model of vascular
dysfunction and will study candidate mechanisms with RNA sequencing. Effects on adipocyte neurotransmitter
uptake, release, and responsiveness will be studied using fluorescent false neurotransmitters and genetically
encoded calcium indicators. The results of this study will identify novel mechanisms that regulate the functions
of PVAT. New insight into mechanisms that drive the release of anticontractile factors will facilitate the
development of therapies for vascular dysfunction in common disorders, such as hypertension."

 Heart failure (HF) is a global health crisis that impacts 26 million adults worldwide. Ejection fraction (EF)
remains the predominant measure used to categorize patients with HF. Approximately half of those with HF
have an EF that is reduced to <50% (HFrEF) and half have an EF ≥50%, known as HF with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFrEF have benefited from the numerous advances in HF treatment over the
last decade. These advances have failed to achieve similar results for patients with HFpEF in part because
HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome, and we have limited understanding of the HFpEF pathophysiology or
consensus on subphenotypes. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to refine the subphenotypes of
heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by assessing patient-reported outcomes,
cardiovascular (CV) variables, and cytokine profiles leading to personalized diagnostics and treatment
strategies for these patients. To achieve this objective, we will address the following specific aims: 1.
Quantify patient-reported outcomes and CV variables, 2. Evaluate and link patient-reported outcomes to
cytokine profiles, and 3. Examine stress-induced patterns in cytokine profiles. We will recruit 150 patients with
HFpEF from Nebraska Medicine to complete instruments measuring patient-reported symptoms and quality of
life, undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing, provide plasma samples for cytokine profiling pre- and post-
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and consent to access to their medical records for demographic, clinical, and
echocardiographic data extraction.
 By gaining a comprehensive understanding of HFpEF, we will be poised to substantially contribute to HF
research. This training and research project will provide preliminary data and skills to allow the project leader to
submit a competitive R01 to validate project findings and further evaluate the longitudinal patterns in HFpEF
subphenotypes. The long-term goals of this project are to provide the project leader with a strong foundation in
interdisciplinary team science, to develop knowledge in connecting biology with clinical research, and identify
objective measures reflective of patient-reported outcomes and inflammatory biomarkers of HFpEF at rest and
during provocative testing."
10771129,"Abstract
Currently, the brain-computer interface (BCI) field has demonstrated two distinct device strategies - macroelectrodes
(e.g., surface grids and depth) versus microelectrode arrays, and some are even pushing the field to
smaller, higher density arrays hoping to address the general signal degradation. Both approaches have been in
development for decades. However, BCI devices to treat aphasia, dysarthria, or locked-in syndrome also need
to access deeper brain regions given the very large, parallel networks involved in speech. Consider that two-thirds
of the cortex is buried beyond the reach of most state-of-the-art technologies.
We have designed a novel approach to brain recordings to address the challenge of multi-scale recordings at
any desired depth. Our team presents a novel device whose form is based on the proven safety and utility of the
stereo-EEG (SEEG). We created a directional and scalable local field potential array (DISC) using the
phenomenon of ""substrate shielding"". This is not the first combination micro/macro device but is the first to
demonstrate stereo-local field potentials using a patent pending design. Our preliminary in vivo data
demonstrates significant improvement when using DISC in many critical factors predictive of future BCI
performance: (i) signal amplitude, (ii) signal-to-noise ratio, and (iii) source separation in classification tasks. This
project will allow us to safely test word decoding performance both offline and online in epilepsy volunteers from
speech regions.
The project's first aim is to develop a robust DISC hybrid assembly with 128 or more recording channels per
implant. Each implanted device will be a commercially available SEEG combined with microelectrodes without
any modification to the clinical function of the device. Aim 1 will include verification, validation, biocompatibility,
and electrical safety testing. Aim 1 will also include functional and safety studies in animals to complete our effort
to provide a safe, reliable system prior to human feasibility studies.
After all milestones are met, including receiving an FDA investigational device exemption, this novel recording
system will demonstrate the effect size and variance of word and speech decoding in humans as compared with
conventional ring electrodes. Typically, 12-20 depth arrays are used in epileptogenic monitoring and we will
replace two depth electrodes with a DISC hybrid assembly in 8 experimental patients and compare decoding
performance to the within-patient controls and with a separate 8 patients having SEEG electrodes only. Enrolled
volunteers will conduct overt and covert speech tasks. Positive results will inform and enable a word and speech
decoder for persons suffering from locked-in syndrome and eventually non-fluent aphasia."
10805498,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genetic diseases impact over 1 in 50 newborns worldwide and yet there are no approved therapies
capable of correcting the underlying genetic defects. As a result, most patients continue to suffer throughout
their life and require frequent interventions to ameliorate symptoms. I aim to develop in vivo genome editing
therapeutics that correct the underlying disease mutation in relevant tissues by a single injection into the
patient. Base editors can efficiently correct transition point mutations, the most common form of disease-
causing genetic mutation, without undesired editing outcomes such as indels. With one dose and no
subsequent enrichment, over 95% of cells in tissue culture can be edited, and editing in over 60% of non-
dividing cells in targeted adult mammalian tissues has been demonstrated in early in vivo work. Prime editors
can correct any genetic perturbation of up to at least ~50 nt in length (encompassing ~89% of human disease
mutations). I will develop and assess both precision genome editing technologies (base and prime editors)
using suitable in vivo delivery tools in mouse models to develop therapeutics for genetic disease.
 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a frequent form of genetic heart disease, affecting an estimated
300,000 people in the United States, and can lead to heart failure. Common causes of DCM are
haploinsufficiency of important genes in cardiomyocytes including TTN and LMNA. I will employ screens to
identify new editing strategies to treat haploinsufficiencies by enhancing transcription of the healthy allele. I will
characterize the mechanism of identified edits to understand the associated changes in transcription factor
occupancy and chromatin states. Simultaneously, I will use fluorescent reporter mice to characterize the in vivo
delivery of base editor and prime editor tools in order to find the best method for editing cardiomyocytes. This
work will include characterizations of tissue- and cell-specific editing following delivery via adeno-associated
virus, lipid nanoparticles, or polymer nanoparticles. I will then combine the identified therapeutic editing
strategy with the best vehicle for delivery to cardiomyocytes to treat a mouse model of TTN haploinsufficiency.
I will measure on- and off-target editing as well as any improvement in the contractility defect that defines this
model. Base editors and prime editors can be readily reprogrammed to correct one or even multiple
simultaneous mutations by altering the co-delivered guide RNA. Future work will expand this screening
methodology to additional haploinsufficiency disorders, and applying identified delivery methods to new models
of genetic disease. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop in vivo genome editing therapeutics that can be
readily adapted to treat even rare or one-of-a-kind disease variants."
10771092,"Project Summary
Genome sequencing has implicated novel candidate tumor suppressors, including DAXX and ATRX which are
mutated in 43% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Despite this strong disease association, our
understanding of the physiological functions of DAXX and ATRX remains limited. Biochemical and cell
biological studies have demonstrated that together they regulate the epigenome as a chaperone complex for
the histone variant H3.3, depositing H3.3 in heterochromatin. Additional non-histone chaperone functions have
been reported for both genes. We recently developed a conditional mouse model for Daxx and demonstrated
that Daxx loss creates a permissive state that cooperates with environmental stress (inflammation) and other
genetic lesions (Men1 loss) to affect the transcriptional profile and impact cell state, which ultimately impairs
pancreas recovery and regeneration in vivo. The transcriptional changes are associated with dysregulation of
ERVs, thereby expanding our understanding of the somatic regulation beyond DNA and histone methylation in
vivo, and implicating ERV dysregulation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. Importantly, we also
demonstrated that dysregulation of endogenous genes near ERVs is also observed in human PanNETs with
DAXX mutations. This proposal expands on these studies to better understand how mutations in DAXX
contribute to tumorigenesis. We will first use our robust physiological mouse models to obtain a comprehensive
understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie ERV dysregulation downstream of Daxx loss. We
will conduct an integrative analysis of H3.3 incorporation, DNA methylation, and histone methylation. We will
complement these genomic studies with genetic experiments to directly interrogate the Daxx:H3.3 and
Daxx:Atrx interactions in vivo using newly generated mouse alleles. Finally, we will extend our studies to an
innovative human pluripotent stem cell model that can be differentiated to an endoderm lineage and
subsequent pancreas and endocrine cell states. This will reveal context-dependent effects of DAXX loss and
illuminate the specific downstream changes that contribute to tumorigenesis. The K22 Career Transition award
will not only advance these research objectives, but it will also help achieve my long-term career goal of
directing a productive and impactful independent research program focused on the molecular mechanisms that
underlie tumorigenesis. Specifically, it will support the establishment of my independent laboratory at a new
sponsoring institution. It will further allow for the submission of my first senior author manuscript and provide
the foundations and preliminary data to rapidly apply and be competitive for R01 funding. In summary, this
proposal supports both research and career development in the epigenetic regulation of cellular homeostasis
and how dysregulation contributes to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis."
10775796,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This NIH K08 proposal describes a five-year career development training program in neurodegenerative
disease genomics research. Dr. Michael Miller has completed clinical residency in Anatomic Pathology and
fellowship in Neuropathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH)
at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and will embark on this research program to train for an independent
academic research career to investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease.
 In this training program, Dr. Miller will develop expertise in single cell genomics, next-generation
sequencing data analysis, biologic interpretation of non-neoplastic human somatic mutations, and application
of genomic approaches toward neurodegenerative disease mechanistic inquiry. His mentor, Dr. Christopher
Walsh (a Professor of Neurology at HMS and HHMI Investigator at BCH), is a leader in human neurologic
disease genetics and genomics. His laboratory has extensive experience in human genetics, neurologic
disease gene mapping, single cell genomics, and analysis of large data sets. Dr. Walsh has established a long
track record for mentoring other trainees to successful careers in biomedical research. In addition, Dr. Miller
has assembled a group of collaborators with complementary expertise, and an Advisory Committee with
extensive experience in mentoring physician-scientists to develop independent research programs. He will
supplement this training with didactic courses and presentation of work at international and national meetings.
 The primary scientific objective of the proposed research plan is to study the role of neuronal somatic
mutation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dr. Miller provides pilot data indicating that neurons in AD show
substantial genome damage in the form of elevated somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNV) compared to
control neurons. The proposal will examine the disease context for this finding, by studying its distribution in
the AD brain and relationship to known key events in AD cellular pathophysiology: oxidative stress and Tau
misfolding. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that aberrant Tau and oxidative damage drive somatic
mutation in AD, constituting a cascade of cellular damage that underlies disease pathogenesis.
 Single cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) will be employed to address three independent but related
questions about the role of somatic mutation in AD: (1) sSNV burden will be compared in 3 areas of the brain
affected at different stages in AD, to assess sSNV relationship to disease pathologic advancement; (2)
Somatic mutational signatures will be determined for AD, to identify the proximate causes of sSNV, along with
direct testing for a putative candidate in oxidized DNA; and (3) neurons with greater Tau accumulation will be
examined for sSNV to assess the relationship between cellular pathologic burden and somatic mutations.
These studies will examine a novel pathogenic event in AD etiology, significant for the fields of
neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis and genomics."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life-changing event that sets in motion profound alterations in motor output,
sensory processing, and reflex activity. Immediately following injury there is a depression of motor activity
mediated by a lack of descending drive. In the weeks and months following injury, a reorganization of spinal
neurons (both motoneurons and interneurons) occurs in response to this altered milieu. This includes changes
in the excitability and reorganization of remaining pathways through strengthening of latent connections and
neuronal sprouting. SCI induced changes in the excitability of spinal motoneurons have a profound effect on
their discharge characteristics and ultimately on the generation of muscle force for functional movements. The
reorganization of spinal interneurons is less well understood, even though the overwhelming majority of
synaptic drive to motoneurons is mediated by spinal interneurons. Therefore, this project will explore how
spinal interneurons regulate the discharge of spinal motoneurons. We will combine intraspinal microelectrode
arrays with arrays on the muscle to record the individual discharges of spinal interneuron and motor unit
populations. On these data, we will bring to bear advanced statistical modeling to electrophysiology dissect the
organization of spinal neurons through the quantification of the strength and directional effects of these
excitatory/inhibitory connections. We will use this approach to quantify the organization of spinal neurons in the
intact cord and following either chronic or acute SCI. Further, we will explore the effects of neuromodulation by
targeting specific serotoninergic receptor subtypes. The expected outcome of this work is a new understanding
of the function of the mammalian spinal cord and the capabilities for reorganization of spinal neurons following
both chronic and acute spinal transections. This approach will be a platform for characterizing the synaptic
input from spinal interneurons to motoneurons and how this ultimately produces movement. Our combined
motor unit and interneuron approach will directly quantify the neural substrate underlying motor unit discharge
patterns and will provide a strong basis for motor unit discharge patterns to be a detailed biomarker for
quantifying the state of spinal interneurons in humans with SCI."

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is estimated to affect 1 in 6 U.S. adults and results in significant morbidity and
health care utilization. Studies over the last decade have highlighted proteases as important peripheral
mediators in the pathophysiology of IBS, especially in inducing barrier dysfunction and visceral
hypersensitivity. Post-infection IBS (PI-IBS) is a defined subset of IBS where an acute injury results in
subsequent development of long-standing gastrointestinal symptomatology. Twenty percent of those suffering
from intestinal infection may be at risk for PI-IBS as shown in our study from a large cohort of prospectively
followed Minnesota residents. Our studies have demonstrated that impaired inactivation of luminal proteases
due to absence of specific intestinal microbes is critical to the pathogenesis of PI-IBS. Our preliminary studies
in humanized mouse models of PI-IBS associated high proteolytic activity (PA) have demonstrated that fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a donor that has low PA and presence of key microbes like Alistipes
putredinis can reverse the high PA state. Based on these and other findings from PI-IBS patients, we
hypothesize that targeted FMT where recipients have high PA and donors are specifically selected based on
their microbiota composition and low PA, will be safe and efficacious for improvement of symptoms in PI-IBS.
We propose a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial where PI-IBS patients will be
administered either a single FMT from the donor or from their own stool (autologous control). In Aim 1, we will
determine efficacy defined by a ≥50-point improvement in IBS symptom severity score at 12 weeks post-FMT.
We will determine microbiota engraftment at 12 weeks and assess predictors of successful response to the
FMT. In Aim 2, we will determine effects of autologous and donor FMT on fecal metabolome and in vivo
colonic permeability. We hypothesize that successful FMT will be associated with changes in fecal
metabolome that support inhibition of PA as well as improvement in colonic permeability. This trial will provide
robust pilot and feasibility data to support larger trials investigating PA-based FMT approaches in broader
cohorts of IBS patients. In addition, the microbiota assessment will provide additional supportive data for
commensal microbes that support suppression of PA. In future, these data can allow development of simplified
microbial consortium for treating high PA states. The study team has the expertise in translational studies and
clinical trials for neurogastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, an investigational new drug approval from the
FDA as well as IRB approval have been obtained."

 Understanding how the brain stores and accesses information is one of the fundamental goals of
neuroscience. This question has been addressed across many scales, spanning detailed genetic analyses of
expression patterns of key molecules supporting neuronal communication to functional recordings of intact brains
in behaving animals. Over the past 50 years, synaptic plasticity has emerged as a leading cellular pathway
underlying learning and memory. During synaptic plasticity, dynamic regulation of AMPA-type glutamate
receptors (AMPARs) bidirectionally tunes synaptic strength, leading to long-lasting changes in the efficacy of
chemical communication between neurons. Synaptic plasticity is active in nearly every region of the brain and
plays a role in diverse processes, from innate fear behaviors to high-level cognition and memory. Despite the
prevalence and importance of synaptic plasticity, we still lack basic knowledge regarding how information is
distributed in synapses across the brain during learning and behavior, and even less regarding which specific
synaptic changes are necessary for long-term memory, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the
immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks
through these barriers. Our approach leverages transgenic labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins and in vivo
two-photon microscopy to enable visualization of synaptic plasticity in real time in behaving mice. Using deep
network learning, we will develop algorithms to automatically detect and track how the strength of millions of
individual synapses changes during learning. This will enable exploration of circuit-specific learning mechanisms
within discrete cell types and specific presynaptic inputs. Ultimately, this pioneering approach has the potential
to provide an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how
dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory."
10777730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a costly clinical problem that
affects millions of women worldwide. With a rise in antibiotic resistance among UPEC strains, there is a great
need to develop alternative strategies for effective UTI treatment and prevention. This effort relies on
understanding what factors modify UTI risk, and how. One of the strongest risk factors for UTI is frequent and/or
recent sexual activity. It is likely that vaginal bacteria are commonly introduced to the bladder in sexually active
women. Indeed, vaginal genera—most frequently Gardnerella or Lactobacillus—have been frequently isolated
from urine collected directly from the bladder. Gardnerella is present at high levels in the vagina in women with
the dysbiosis called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Women with BV are at increased risk for UTI and recurrent (r)UTI,
but the mechanisms driving this BV-UTI link are unknown. Our new mouse model showed that when Gardnerella
gains access to the urinary tract, it triggers apoptosis and exfoliation of the bladder epithelium and enhances
UPEC UTI in multiple contexts. Gardnerella increased the level of acute bacteriuria and persistent bladder
infection achieved by a subsequent UPEC UTI, and also increased the rate of rUTI by triggering UPEC
emergence from quiescent intracellular reservoirs that were formed during a prior infection. Importantly,
Gardnerella was rapidly cleared from the host, and was absent by the time UPEC UTI was enhanced. These
data and suggest that vaginal bacteria influence UTI outcomes in women in ways that have not yet been
appreciated because of the transient nature of their interaction with the bladder – a model we term “covert
pathogenesis.” In this proposal we will use our innovative mouse models to specify mechanisms by which
Gardnerella enhances UPEC UTI, determine whether this effect extends to other uropathogens (Aim 1), and to
utilize genetically diverse Gardnerella strains to define the genetic features of Gardnerella strains that correlate
with covert pathogenesis activity in the bladder (Aim 2). Finally, we will specify the association between
Gardnerella abundance in the vagina, uroepithelial exfoliation, and rUTI in women, using multiple existing sample
banks (Aim 3). This work will fundamentally change the way clinicians and scientists think about, treat, and
prevent UTI. Our results could lead to the development of new screening strategies to identify women at risk for
rUTI and new approaches to UTI treatment and prevention by targeting vaginal bacteria."

A comprehensive assessment of early exposures requires a multidimensional assessment of the exposome,
including community-level environmental factors (such as air pollution), chemical exposures (such as
endocrine disruptors), social factors (cultural and family context), and the genome and its responses to the
environment (inherited epigenome, genomic expression, and the proteome). The Utah Children’s Project
(UCP) has been the Utah site contributing to the ECHO Cohort consortium for 7 years. The UCP follows the
exposure and outcome status of up to 2 children and at least 1 biological parent in 493 family units as well as
enrolls couples planning pregnancy and pregnant people. In the UG3 Phase (the first two years),
preconception and pregnancy enrollments will continue during the development of the cohort-wide
preconception protocol in partnership with the other consortium sites. The UCP will also continue with retention
and follow-up of families previously enrolled. Exposure assessment during the preconception and pregnancy
periods is a specialized site focus area. In the UH3 Phase, preconception and pregnancy enrollments will
continue with particular emphasis on Utah families from underrepresented minority populations (eg, Native
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic), with a goal of up to 600 new enrollments with implementation of
all aspects of the ECHO 3.0 protocol while maintaining a historically high cohort retention. Research questions
to be investigated include (1) the relationship between subfertility, maternal metabolic status, fertility treatment,
breastfeeding, and asthma in offspring, (2) the relationship between indoor air quality and perinatal outcomes,
and (3) longitudinal preconception exposome mixtures and perinatal outcomes. A process-related aim is to re-
enroll and retain at least 95% of currently enrolled children throughout the UG3 Phase, and 90% through the
UH3 phase while implementing the ECHO 3.0 protocol with high fidelity and response rates."

The NIH Environmental influences on Child Health outcomes (ECHO) Program seeks to understand the impact
of early environmental influences on child health and development – with a special emphasis on Pre-, Peri-,
and Postnatal Health, Upper and Lower Airways, Neurodevelopment, Obesity, and Positive Health – and to
enhance these areas of health and development. The Rochester-Magee award in the first phase of ECHO
(UG3/UH3 OD023349) was a pregnancy cohort that followed children through age 4 years. In this proposal,
which is responsive to RFA-OD-22-018 for the second phase of ECHO, we will recruit an additional pregnancy
cohort of 375 pregnancies (across the first 5 years) and conduct a pediatric follow-up of our existing ECHO
cohort (12601) and two Rochester-based ECHO cohorts that were part of other multi-site awards in first phase
of ECHO: PROP/PRISM and TIDES-Rochester. Including these two additional cohorts in our pediatric follow-
up plans increases the number of ECHO cohorts that are carried forward from the first to the second phase of
ECHO and creates economies of scale and efficiencies for our pediatric follow-up. Collectively, we aim to
follow 375 children across the three consolidated Rochester-based ECHO cohorts.
In response to the RFA, we propose two areas of specialized outcomes, Neurodevelopment & Upper and
Lower Airways/Asthma, and two areas of specialized exposures, Chemical exposure & Prenatal Immune
Activation/Inflammation, that reflect expertise of the research team and measurement concentration and in-
depth data related to the pregnancy and pediatric cohorts. Throughout the UG3 and UH3 phases of the
second phase of the ECHO program we will institute practices to maximize retention of existing participants,
ensure recruitment of diverse new pregnant/preconception participants, and implement the established ECHO
Cohort Protocol with high fidelity. We will also lead novel and solution-oriented research that capitalizes on the
data already on the ECHO platform and research that takes advantage of our specialized areas of expertise to
understand how pre-conception, perinatal, and early postnatal exposures shape child health outcomes."

Dominance is one of the most fundamental concepts in genetics and has many key implications in population
genetics, as it ultimately determines how selection manifests in a population. However, despite its unarguable
importance, dominance is also one of the least characterized quantities in genetics, especially in humans, with
the major challenge being current methods cannot distinguish dominance from the fitness effect of genomic
variants. This proposed K99/R00 work will systematically address this longstanding problem from a dual-
perspectives, by inferring dominance in humans and quantitatively model its role in shaping the phenotypes of
complex traits and diseases. Specifically, in Aim1, I will develop a powerful machine learning-based method to
infer the realistic distribution of dominance on the human genome in megabase-scale, leveraging archaic
introgressed ancestry in non-African populations that is sensitive to dominance variation in genomic regions. In
Aim 2, I will develop non-additive polygenic models accounting for dominance in full genomic regions to identify
complex traits profiled in UK Biobank that deviate from additive models, improve the accuracy of phenotype and
disease risk predictions, and contribute to an in-depth understanding of complex trait biology. Finally, in Aim 3
(R00 phase), I will extend these approaches to infer dominance variation in worldwide populations and
investigate how dominance, combined with selection and admixture, determines complex trait phenotypes in
diverse human populations. The mentored phase of this work will take place at the Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology at UCLA, where Dr. Zhang will have access to rich training opportunities and be supported
by active scientific communities, including numerous seminar series, journal clubs, and networking activities. Dr.
Kirk Lohmueller (primary mentor) and Dr. Sriram Sankararaman (co-mentor) will train Dr. Zhang in computational
and statistical methods in population genetics, machine learning applications, and large-scale disease
association data analysis. The research trainings, collaborations, and professional development during the K99

10755252,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current approaches in repairing craniomaxillofacial (CMF) defects possess several limitations and the
reconstruction of CMF defects seamlessly is highly challenging, as precise layer-by-layer stacking of multiple
tissue compartments is not trivial. Such compartmentalization necessitates the precision and effective use of
stem cells and differentiation factors, and differentiating stem cells into multiple lineages is crucial in order to
recapitulate the native tissue anatomy. With the advances in three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, reconstruction
of composite tissues in situ for CMF repair has recently become feasible as 3D bioprinting enables complex
tissue heterogeneity in an anatomically accurate and cosmetically appealing manner. Intraoperative
bioprinting, which can be defined as bioprinting directly into the defect area for repairing injuries in a surgery
setting, is a highly effective process for CMF reconstruction, where the defect information can be rapidly
acquired with minimum manual interventions, enabling accurate personalized reconstructions immediately after
characterization of the defect. In this project, we hypothesize that intraoperatively bioprinted multi-layer
composite tissues loaded with differentiation factors including microRNA(miRNA)-transfected human
progenitor cells and adipose-derived extracellular matrix components (adECM) induce compartmentalization of
soft and hard tissues that recapitulates CMF tissue anatomy on an athymic rat model. In order to test our
hypothesis, Specific Aim I will use intraoperative bone tissue bioprinting to reveal the impact of miR-148b-
transfected human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) at respective dosages on bone tissue regeneration. In
Specific Aim II, we will intraoperatively bioprint multi-layer skin tissues, including adipose and dermis layers, in
order to explore the impact of localized delivery of human ADSCs and adECM components at different
dosages and concentrations on skin tissue regeneration, respectively. Particularly, we will observe if ADSCs
differentiate into adipocytes and also understand the impact of the presence of adipose layer on dermis
regeneration. In Specific Aim III, we will intraoperatively bioprint three-layer composite tissues, including
cranium, adipose and dermis layers, in order to understand the role of a vascularization on soft and hard tissue
regeneration. In addition, we will explore the role of miR-210 in vascularization. In this regard, we have formed
a complementary collaboration that merges essential domain knowledge in bioprinting, regenerative medicine,
CMF surgery, plastic surgery, gene therapy, gene delivery, bone mechanics, and bone and skin biology with
the depth necessary to propel the proposed work towards meaningful advances that would otherwise not be
possible. Successful completion of the proposed work is anticipated to give rise to an advanced bioprinting
technology revealing the complex interactions between stratified layers of engineered tissues in an
immunodeficient rodent model and thereby provide a novel understanding of how localized delivery of
differentiation factors impacts craniomaxillofacial reconstruction."

Non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma represent four of the five
most common forms of cancer in Veterans. In the metastatic setting, immunotherapy has emerged as a
powerful oncologic treatment modality capable of producing durable control in all of these diseases.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of Veterans do not benefit from this therapy, and thus, our long-term goal is to
develop integrated treatment strategies with radiotherapy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The
overall objective of this proposal is to define the importance of cell death induced by radiotherapy on
immunotherapy efficacy. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that enhancing immunostimulatory
radiation-induced ferroptosis will enhance immunotherapy efficacy. The rationale for this proposal comes from
our published and unpublished data revealing that radiotherapy induces tumoral ferroptosis and the
observation that radiotherapy and immunotherapy synergize to promote tumor control through ferroptosis.
Beyond this, our results suggest that ferroptosis may be an immunogenic form of cell death. This hypothesis
will be assessed and leveraged therapeutically to design rational combinatorial strategies using radiotherapy
and immunotherapy in 3 aims. Aim 1 will define the molecular mediators (Aim 1A-C) and signaling pathways
(Aim 1D) by which radiation-induced lipid oxidation and ferroptosis modulates anti-tumoral immunity. Aim 2 will
determine the innate (Aim 2A, B) and adaptive (Aim 2C) cellular mediators by which radiation-induced lipid
oxidation and ferroptosis regulate anti-tumoral immunity. Aim 3 will develop therapeutic strategies for
modulating radiotherapy-induced ferroptosis to systemically augment immune checkpoint blockade efficacy
(abscopal responses) in primary (Aim 3A) and metastatic (Aim 3B) melanoma tumor models. Furthermore, we
will develop pharmacodynamic biomarkers (Aim 3C) of efficacy. The research proposed is innovative because
the immunogenicity of ferroptosis has yet to be characterized. The completion of these aims is significant
because it will establish a novel mechanistic link between ferroptosis, cytotoxic oncologic treatment modalities,
and immune polarization, which can be leveraged therapeutically to improve immunotherapy efficacy in
Veterans."
10768547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD with Ab-dependent and Ab-independent effects on
disease pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic nature of APOE4 in AD
are not fully elucidated. In previous funding period (07/01/2017-present), we have made significant progress
toward understanding micro-RNA (miRNA) regulation of APOE4-induced brain phospholipid dysregulation in AD.
We have uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism of miR-195 targeted at APOE4-associated cognitive deficits
and lysosomal defects in AD. Notably, we identified miR-195 as a top miRNA candidate involved in the APOE-
regulated brain phosphoinositol biphosphate (PIP2) pathway using human ROSMAP and mouse microarray data.
Levels of miR-195 are significantly lower in APOE4+ human and mouse brains, and in human inducible
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes when compared to APOE4- counterparts. Over-
expressing miR-195 reduces expression levels of its top target synaptojanin 1 (synj1), the brain PIP2 degrading
enzyme. Elevating miR-195 ameliorates cognitive deficits and AD pathology in APOE4+ mice and rescues
lysosomal defects in APOE4+ iPSC brain cells. Furthermore, our preliminary results support the role of miR-195
as an anti-inflammatory miRNA in regulating microglial function. Our single cell (sc)-RNA seq. analysis of E4FAD
mouse brains with miR-195 over-expression suggests that miR-195 alters molecular signatures of microglia sub-
clusters. APOE4+ microglia with lower miR-195 levels and higher synj1 expression at baseline, manifests with
impaired phagocytic activities and lysosomal defects when compared to APOE3+ microglia. Down-regulation of
synj1 or over-expression of miR-195 can rescue these phenotypes. Beside synj1, inflammatory genes pdcd4
and smad7 are predicted targets of miR-195 as well. Over-expression of miR-195 in microglia inhibits
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in smad7 and pdcd4 expression, attenuates LPS-induced
proinflammatory cytokine release and augments anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, exosomes derived
from APOE4/4 astrocytes (ADEs) contain less miR-195 than those in APOE3/3 ADEs, and over-expression of
miR-195 in APOE4/4 astrocytes increases miR-195 levels in ADEs which can attenuate LPS-induced pro-
inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-195 may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects
through down-regulation of microglial synj1 to regulate lysosomal function, direct target at microglial inflammatory
gene expression and responses, and modulation of neuro-inflammation and tau spread by exosomal miR-195.
We propose to characterize the regulation of microglial function by miR-195 during AD pathogenesis in this
renewal application. We will: 1) determine the impact of miR-195 on microglia function and APOE-regulated
neuro-inflammation in AD in vivo (Aim 1) using cuprizone (CPZ)-induced inflammation in male and female EFAD
mouse models (human ApoE4 knock-in at 5xFAD background); 2) to characterize the molecular mechanisms by
which miR-195 regulates AD-associated neuro-inflammation (Aim 2) using microglial culture and 3-D co-culture
system of mouse brain cells from EFAD and APOE KI mice, as well as from synj1-/-, APOE-/- and TREM2-/- mice
(with manipulations of miR-195 levels); 3) to perform high resolution multiscale network modeling using scRNA-
seq dataset from mouse brains (Aim 1) and RNA-seq and miR-seq datasets from microglia and 3-D co-culture
system (Aim 2) to identify microglia-specific molecular signatures driven by miR-195; and 4) to validate identified
microglial signature driven by miR-195 in postmortem human brain samples and investigate their correlation with
the development of AD-associated neuro-inflammation during disease progression (Aim 2). The goals of this
application aim to elucidate novel pathways and molecular signatures driven by miR-195 protective against
APOE4-induced microglial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, which will facilitate identification and development
of a more personalized targeted therapeutic approach to AD-associated neuro-inflammation."
10768548,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are among the most prevalent
and debilitating psychiatric disorders in U.S. Veterans. They are highly comorbid and have shared genetic
susceptibility. Treatments for PTSD or AUD are ineffective in many patients, and comorbid PTSD and AUD are
often more difficult to treat and associated with more severe symptoms, higher suicide risk, and poorer
outcomes. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to identify brain proteins predisposing to PTSD, AUD,
or both as potential promising drug targets to support the development of novel treatments for these disorders.
 Our proposal builds on insights into the complex genetic architecture of PTSD and AUD gained through
large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS tests allele frequency difference between cases and
controls for individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify SNPs associated with disease. A
genetic locus may have tens to dozens of SNPs associated with the disease. Disentangling which SNPs are
important in predisposing to the disease versus those coincidentally associated because they are physically
close to important genetic variant sites (i.e., due to linkage) is the next great challenge of human genetics.
 To address this challenge, several analytical approaches have emerged to integrate information about
genetic control of mRNA expression with GWAS results to identify potentially causal genes. To date, these
approaches have focused on mRNA expression, but there are two major advantages gained by focusing on
protein expression. First, the vast majority of drug targets and biomarkers are proteins. Second, studying brain
proteins directly will provide more confidence on the nominated therapeutic targets because mRNAs may not
frequently be optimal surrogates for proteins given the complex post-transcriptional, translational, and post-
translational regulation. Thus, we propose to leverage human brain proteomes to test the hypothesis that some
genetic variants are associated with PTSD or AUD because they modulate brain protein expression in a way
that predisposes to PTSD, AUD, or both.
 To test this hypothesis, we will integrate PTSD and AUD GWAS summary statistics, respectively, from
participants of the Million Veteran Program and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with human brain proteomes
using the state-of-the-art analytical techniques to identify genes that modulate brain protein expression to
predispose to PTSD, AUD, or both. We aim to identify genes with evidence consistent with being causal in
PTSD or AUD, which means that they meet the following three conditions. First, the gene has one or more
alleles strongly associated with the disease. Second, the brain protein expression regulated by proximal
genetic variants (referred to as cis-regulated brain protein level) is associated with the disease. Third, the cis-
regulated brain protein expression mediates the effect of the gene on the disease. The causal inference of this
integrative strategy has been experimentally tested and shown to be robust.
 The first aim of the proposal will focus on merging all available human brain proteomic and genetic data
available from our own work and that of our collaborators to estimate effect of SNPs on human brain protein
expression. In the second aim, we will integrate PTSD or AUD GWAS summary statistics with the brain protein
expression data to identify potentially causal genes for PTSD, AUD, or both. Finally, in the third aim, we will
test whether genetic regulation of protein expression for the causal genes identified in Aim 2 is similar in
multiple specific brain regions relevant to PTSD or AUD (amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex,
and nucleus accumbens).
 Findings from our proposed studies will identify specific genes and brain proteins as potential promising
targets for further mechanistic study to support novel therapeutic development for PTSD, AUD, or both and will
have important and long-lasting impact on the mental health and well-being of Veterans."

The goal of this project is to break fundamentally new ground by investigating the molecular basis of vision in
the daytime mosquito vector, Aedes (Ae.) aegypti. This mosquito is a major disease vector, which transmits the
viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever, Zika and other diseases that affect many tens of millions of people
each year. Due to climate change and travel, this invasive species is spreading to new locations, including
multiple areas in the United States. Therefore, innovative strategies to control mosquito borne disease are
urgently needed. Female Ae. aegypti detect and integrate multiple sensory cues to locate human hosts. Once
they sense CO2 odor plumes emanating from human breath at distances of up to 10-15 meters, their visual
attention to potential hosts is greatly increased. They then rely on visual information along with other human-
derived cues, such as organic olfactory stimuli, to home in on people. Despite the important contribution of
vision in promoting the ability of Ae. aegypti to find humans, there has been no comprehensive approach to
apply molecular genetics to define the mechanisms underlying vision and odor-stimulated vision-guided host
attraction. The objective of the proposed research is to address this gap. Aim 1 is to define the roles of the
TRP and TRPL channels in Aedes vision. We have recently used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mutations that
disrupt the trp and trpl genes. We propose to examine the roles of these channels for the light response in
photoreceptor cells. We also outline experiments to investigate potential roles for these channels in several
vision- and light-driven behaviors, including CO2-stimulated vision-guided target attraction. The goal of aim 2 is
to test the idea that the two phospholipase C genes expressed in the eyes of Ae. aegypti (NORPA and
PLC21C) have distinct roles in visual transduction and in multiple vision- and light-driven behaviors, including
circadian rhythms. We will also address the impact of mutations disrupting norpA and plc21C in combination
with mutations that disrupt cryptochrome, which encodes a light sensitive protein in the insect brain. Ae.
aegypti are most active and bite primarily after sunrise and before sunset. Therefore, understanding the
regulation of circadian rhythms in this organism is important, and the contributions of retinal proteins to this
behavior represents another major gap in our understanding of the biology of Ae. aegypti. Aim 3 focuses on
testing an iconoclastic role for the Gaq in the light response. In addition to its classical role as an effector
protein for rhodopsin, we will test the idea that Gaq directly regulates the TRP and TRPL channels. To
accomplish our goals, we propose to employ a multidisciplinary approach, including electrophysiology,
molecular genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and a wide diversity of behavioral assays. We propose that these
studies will provide the conceptual framework for devising innovative strategies to limit the ability of these
mosquitoes from efficiently locating hosts and spreading disease."

 Cost estimates for CNS, pulmonary, cardiac, and renal complications following medical assist devices
requiring blood pumps, for example on pump cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is estimated at $80 million per
individual states in the US over a ten-year period. Because of the need for extended CPB (> 4hours) use in
complex surgeries, hemolysis, and the subsequent release of hemoglobin (Hb) into the circulation – which is
known to be multi-organ toxic and vasoactive – is a relevant contributor to more intensive management of
patients. To date, no effective strategy to remove toxic by-products of Hb are available. The burden caused
by kidney injury alone accounts for approximately $9 billion/year, 300,000 deaths/year and an average
increase in hospital stay of 3.5 days/patient This project focuses on understanding the contribution of
hemolysis, Hb and heme associated with secondary end organ injury following extended on pump
cardiopulmonary bypass (typically lasting up to 4 hours). To understand medical device related red blood cell
lysis in this setting, we propose a strategy that is focused on sequentially understanding the contributions of
Hb and heme and a therapeutic strategy to attenuate the end organ pathophysiology of these toxins. We will
prospectively determine the levels of Hb, heme and iron as well as the concentrations of each toxin in
plasma and urine of cardiac surgery patients. Simultaneously we will determine the concentrations of
Hb, heme and iron binding and clearance proteins, haptoglobin, hemopexin and transferrin, respectively.
Further we will determine plasma and urinary markers of end organ injury. We will use this data to construct
a biokinetic model that determines the limits of Hb toxin concentrations that associate with end organ injury
markers. The goal of this effort will be to define the need and timing for therapeutic interventions. To this
end we have bioengineered a novel Hb, heme and protein scavenger based on our extensive experience
with studying Hb toxicity. The novel protein construct is prepared by generating apo-Hb in multi-step process,
while simultaneously isolating haptoglobin from Cohn fractionation paste IV. Finally, the two proteins are
complexed and further purified to generate the apo-Hb-haptoglobin complex. This novel protein construct
binds heme in high heme exposure states, secures iron in the heme ligand and safely clears the complex to
monocytes and macrophages. Alternatively, in high Hb exposures apo-Hb exchanges binding sites on
haptoglobin clearing Hb dimers to monocytes and macrophages, while released apo-Hb dimers are degraded
by proteolysis and harmlessly cleared from circulation. To test the effect of the novel complex we have
planed a range of proof-of-concept studies in animal models of on pump CPB to define the ability of apo-
Hb-haptoglobin dosing to prevent end organ injury."

 T2R bitter taste receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) originally identified on the tongue,
but which also serve diverse roles in other tissues. “Extraoral” (outside the tongue) taste receptors are likely
important in airway infection, asthma, pre-term labor, and even cancer. In airway epithelial cells, T2Rs 4, 14,
16, and 38 recognize quorum-sensing molecules produced by gram-negative bacteria, including the
opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Stimulation of these receptors modifies production of
antibacterial molecules, including nitric oxide and defensins. Some polymorphisms reducing the functionality
of T2Rs increase patient susceptibility to upper respiratory infection and chronic rhinosinusitis. Targeting T2Rs
as therapies requires better elucidation of their expression and downstream effects. This must be studied in
primary human cells, as mouse T2Rs differ in number and agonists that activate them.
 We identified several T2R receptors in primary human monocytes and macrophages. Macrophages
are important innate immune cells that phagocytose and kill bacteria as well as secrete pro- or anti-
inflammatory cytokines to modify immune responses. Stimulation of these receptors activates calcium release
and nitric oxide production that acutely (within 5-15 min) enhances phagocytosis of bacteria. Preliminary data
suggest that T2Rs may be targets for stimulation of innate immune responses to kill bacteria without the use of
conventional antibiotics, reducing pressures for antibiotic resistance. This may be especially useful in upper
respiratory diseases. Acute and chronic rhinosinusitis account for >20% of all antibiotic prescriptions in the
US, and thus are important drives of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms. Chronic rhinosinusitis and
associated nasal polyps also cause dysosmia, hyposmia, and/or anosmia in many patients.
 We will further define the signaling pathway that increases macrophage phagocytosis and test how it
affects bacterial killing (Aim 1). As bacteria such as P. aeruginosa can invade cells and live as intracellular
pathogens to evade further immune detection, we will test how T2Rs affect macrophage bactericidal activity.
This work will also be among the first to use live cell imaging and fluorescent biosensors to study macrophage
GPCR signaling in real time. Next (Aim 2), we will examine how T2R activation reduces inflammatory
responses to toll-like receptors (TLRs). Our preliminary data suggest novel pathways of T2R-TLR crosstalk
possibly involving Akt. Finally (Aim 3) we will compare phenotype, T2R expression, and T2R function in
macrophages from inflamed chronic rhinosinusitis nasal polyps with naïve serum-derived macrophages from
the same patients. We will examine if macrophage infiltration of polyps is altered with T2R polymorphisms or
bitter taste perception. We also examine if increased macrophage numbers in nasal polyps affects chronic
rhinosinusitis disease phenotypes."
10757023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our prior work focused on understanding mechanisms that contribute to the development of a
stable, mature myotendinous junction (MTJ). Results obtained during the past funding cycle
identified essential roles for evolutionarily conserved proteins not just in the formation, but also in
the maintenance, of muscle-tendon interactions. Interestingly, continued maintenance of MTJ
formation is intimately linked to muscle homeostasis. The overall goal during the next funding
period is to understand how proteostasis is regulated in the context of cell homeostasis. The
inability to remove protein aggregates in non-dividing cells such as neurons or muscles is a key
factor in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies and
is a cellular hallmark of aging cells. While protein aggregate diseases share common features, it
is widely assumed that the molecular pathways that lead to protein aggregation cannot be
explained by a single mechanism. In protein aggregation disease that cause myopathies, a
general trend has emerged in which aggregated proteins and organelles accumulate in regions
devoid of muscle tissue. However, the cellular and mechanical triggers that initiate Z-disk
disintegration and myofiber displacement are unclear. Here we employ mutations in conserved
Drosophila genes as an entry point to uncover cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to
protein aggregation and ultimately cellular degeneration using muscle as a model cell type.
Overall, we expect to uncover unrecognized aspects of, including, but not limited to: uncovering
novel components that contribute to proteostasis; identifying muscle targets of kinase activity; and
determining how autophagy cooperates in the clearance of protein aggregates. A powerful
combination of genetic analysis, biochemistry, cell biology, and live imaging approaches will
address these questions. We expect that this project will fundamentally advance our
understanding of how protein degradation is regulated to prevent cellular degeneration and to
provide fresh insights into how protein aggregates can be effectively cleared to reduce disease
states."
10757024,"Effect of natural and engineered variations on structure and biophysics of SARS-CoV-2 spike
 COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has devasted global health and economics. Vaccines are being
deployed worldwide to gain control of the pandemic, although emergence of fast-spreading “variants of
concern” (VOCs) have caused concern. Mutations in the spike (S) protein are under scrutiny due to its
essential role in the virus life cycle, and being the dominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Widespread
vaccine hesitancy and the current spread of the Delta variant provide fertile ground for emergence of vaccine-
resistant variants. We and others have shown that variants use a plethora of strategies to modify antibody and
receptor interactive surfaces, and spike conformation, resulting in antibody evasion and greater infectivity.
Over the last two years, utilizing urgent supplement funding from the NIH, we studied the structures of SARS-
CoV-2 S proteins and have established workflows spanning structure, biochemistry, biophysics and
computation. Here we propose to continue the essential work of detangling the effects of variant S protein
mutations, and to enhance our understanding of spike structure to further efforts to predict where the virus is
heading and to inform novel vaccine designs. The scientific premise of this grant is that understanding spike
structure and allostery will provide insights into its function, inform vaccine development, and provide
mechanistic information essential for relating spike structure to beta-CoV replication, evolution, and immune
evasion. The innovations in this grant derive from technologies we have developed for structural analyses of
the S protein: an integrative structural biology pipeline combines cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), Negative
Stain Electron Microscopy (NSEM) and X-ray crystallography, with computational methods, and biochemical
and biophysical analyses to study structural and functional properties of the spike, including furin cleavage,
receptor binding, and antigenicity."

 Against the background of major efforts to alleviate the adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy (LtOT)
for chronic pain, there is great concern about the risk of unintended harmful consequences among those
tapering opioid dosage or discontinuing LtOT. For this reason, a 2020 National Academy of Medicine
discussion paper and multiple other recent commentaries have highlighted the urgent need for real-world
evidence regarding the benefits and harms of LtOT tapering. The overall objective of this proposal is to
leverage large-scale healthcare data and rigorous pharmacoepidemiologic designs to strengthen the evidence
base concerning the extent to which LtOT tapering affects risk of 4 substance-related outcomes: overdose,
opioid use disorder (OUD), other substance use disorder (SUD), and intentional overdose/other self-harm. The
central hypothesis is that there are minimal adverse effects of tapering compared with maintaining LtOT—and
that the effects are limited to certain clinical contexts and subgroups. The proposal’s rationale is that combining
design-based and statistical control of confounding with rigor in measurement of LtOT, tapering, and
substance-related outcomes is essential to strengthening evidence on LtOT tapering. The project will evaluate
its central hypothesis in 2 specific aims: (1) estimate the effects of LtOT tapering on serious substance-related
outcomes, and (2) identify patient groups more vulnerable to the estimated effects of LtOT tapering. Both aims
will involve the analysis of patients receiving LtOT in nationwide, longitudinal data from commercial and
Medicare Advantage healthcare insurance claims. In aim 1, the project will estimate the extent to which LtOT
tapering is associated with risk of substance-related outcomes (overdose, OUD, other SUD, and intentional
self-harm). The primary analytic approach will be a within-individual design that rules out confounding from all
time-stable factors by capitalizing on intra-individual variability over time, complemented with statistical
covariates to help account for time-varying confounding. Aim 2 will employ this within-individual approach in
subgroups to determine whether tapering-related harms are greater among individuals (a) with longer-duration
LtOT, (b) with higher-dose LtOT, (c) experiencing more rapid tapering, (d) with pre-existing SUD or other
mental health conditions, or (e) from marginalized (Black or Hispanic/Latino/a) racial and ethnic groups. The
innovation of the proposal is in its (a) rigorous research designs to reduce confounding and other biases, (b)
consideration of heterogeneity in tapering effects, and (c) interdisciplinary, international research team. The
proposal is significant because it will guide harm-benefit calculations and best practices (e.g., tapering rates)
for policy, as well as for individual patients. Without this information, tapering recommendations must still be
made using evidence that has been repeatedly described as inadequate. Thus, the proposed research has the
potential to enhance decision-making to maximize pain relief, safety, and equity in LtOT tapering."

Addressing the persistently high rates of severe maternal morbidity among Black women is an urgent public
health priority. Of the 3.8 million U.S. births each year, nearly a third occur via cesarean delivery, which is a
risk factor for severe maternal morbidity, and cesarean rates are higher among Black women than among
White women. For women giving birth after a prior cesarean, maternal morbidity is lowest with a vaginal birth,
but higher with an unplanned (vs. planned) repeat cesarean. There are racial and ethnic disparities in birth
mode among women with a prior cesarean, with Black women more likely to have unplanned repeat cesareans
compared to White women, but these disparities are poorly understood. The most common indications for
primary cesarean are subjective and differ by race – suggesting potential differences in care quality and
processes of care by race – but little is known about indications for unplanned cesarean among women with
labor after cesarean. Prior work has also established that hospital characteristics are related to hospital rates
of labor after cesarean utilization and vaginal birth after cesarean success, and that there is substantial
hospital-level variation in maternal morbidity rates and racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity rates.
However, it is unclear how hospital characteristics and quality of care contribute to racial disparities in birth
mode among women with a prior cesarean, and how Black women with a prior cesarean perceive their care.
This mixed-methods study will use combined vital statistics and hospital discharge data and data from semi-
structured interviews with Black women with a prior cesarean. The specific aims are: 1) To characterize the
association between hospital characteristics and racial disparities in birth mode among women with a prior
cesarean; and 2) To explore the experiences of perinatal care among Black women with a prior cesarean.
Despite the higher risk of unplanned cesarean birth among Black (vs. White) women with a prior cesarean,
little is known about why this occurs. Identifying factors and processes that contribute to these outcomes is
particularly urgent given persistent racial disparities in severe maternal morbidity. Results from this study will
contribute to a better understanding of the circumstances associated with labor after cesarean ending in
cesarean delivery, and help to identify potential interventions to improve the quality of care for women with a
prior cesarean."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy featuring early metastasis, late onset of
symptoms, and notorious resistance to existing therapies. A critically elusive aspect of this disease relates to
the tumors which are often hypovascularized relative to other solid cancers, manifesting in poor perfusion and
impaired drug delivery. In preliminary studies, we discovered that endoglin, normally an endothelial-specific
TGF-beta coreceptor required for angiogenesis, is expressed as two variants in pancreatic cancer cells- the
wildtype, which supports tumor-intrinsic growth and chemoresistance; and a novel splice variant with distinct
structural features that gets secreted to inhibit tumor vascularization. To understand their interplay in the
tumor microenvironment, we have generated a variety of cellular and pharmacologic reagents to interrogate
the underlying mechanisms and their therapeutic potential. We propose to define novel paracrine
mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling that suppress PDAC vascularization (Aim 1); and identify tumor-intrinsic
endoglin pathways as critical therapeutic targets in PDAC (Aim 2); and determine the endoglin variants as
distinct spatiotemporal targets during disease progression (Aim 3). Results from these studies will define TGF-
beta-based mechanisms critical for PDAC tumor growth and vascularization and deliver clinically relevant
data for improved patient-based therapeutics."

Uninsured patients are subject to catastrophic health expenditures, have higher rates of mortality, and far more
limited access to important healthcare resources (e.g., preventative or specialist care, rehabilitation, mental
health) compared to insured patients. Uninsured individuals often defer care until treatment is urgently
required, which can lead to debilitating disease, job loss and high medical bills. With more than 70% of
uninsured patients unable to pay for their healthcare, U.S. hospitals and states are left to bear the brunt of
uncompensated care ($42 billion). Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE), a hospital-based emergency
Medicaid program, is a successful solution to these problems. Patients enroll in temporary HPE healthcare
coverage (up to 60 days), with an opportunity to sustain insurance by applying for Medicaid full coverage.
Although HPE is a national Medicaid requirement, California is among the more inclusive in terms of HPE
eligibility. Among the 31 million remaining uninsured Americans, 10% are in California, the world’s 5th largest
economy.
During our previously funded R21 through the NIMHD, we collaborated with the California Department of
Healthcare Services (DHCS) to create an innovative new dataset that tracks HPE enrollees across the state
and follows them longitudinally to evaluate for Medicaid sustainment. Over 100,000 previously uninsured
Californians enroll in HPE annually, up to 64% of whom sustain Medicaid at six-months. Inpatients, those
requiring surgery or post-discharge health services are more likely to sustain insurance, with minority groups
less likely to sustain. Across hospitals, Medicaid sustainment ranges from 33-97%. Our preliminary data
suggests that patient socio demographics, availability and training of hospital personnel and county-level
engagement contribute to success of Medicaid sustainment after HPE enrollment. In response to PAR-20-310,
investigation of modifiable predictors of Medicaid sustainment will guide our development of a DHCS, hospital
and county-stakeholder informed “best practice” toolkit intervention for dissemination across hospitals, with the
goal of increasing reducing insurance-based disparities.
We will pursue 3 specific aims: (SA1) quantitatively characterize distribution of sustainment across hospitals
and identify patient and hospital-level factors associated with Medicaid sustainment after HPE, (SA2)
qualitatively identify hospital and county practices that promote or limit success Medicaid sustainment across
diverse settings, and (SA3) develop a stakeholder-informed best practice “toolkit” aimed at increasing Medicaid
sustainment across hospitals and counties.
Our goal by developing strategies for increasing sustained insurance coverage is to improve access to care,
clinical outcomes and financial health among disadvantaged and uninsured patients."

Diagnostic imaging is a standard part of trauma assessment, but access to imaging is often extremely limited
in low and middle-income countries, where most injury deaths occur. Trauma death rates in Cameroon are
higher than surrounding countries. Failure to diagnose hemorrhagic shock has been implicated in death
analysis of the Cameroon Trauma Registry and by the National Trauma Quality Improvement Committee as a
key root cause of preventable deaths. Currently, fewer than half of trauma patients in Cameroon receive
diagnostic imaging. Development of a provider-performed smartphone-based ultrasonography (SBU) program
for trauma could increase diagnostic access and facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment of injuries but only if it
is feasible and effective for the Cameroonian context. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the
burden associated with injury in Cameroon. This study’s overall objective is to expand diagnostic capacity to
facilitate timely diagnosis of injury and reduce injury burden. The study hypothesis is that implementation of a
provider-performed SBU program is a feasible and effective method of expanding access to diagnostic imaging
for trauma patients in Cameroon. To accomplish the objective, this study will pursue three specific aims for the
R21 phase: 1) Evaluate the educational efficacy of a SBU training curriculum in short- and medium-term skill
and knowledge acquisition among Cameroonian trauma providers; 2) Evaluate the feasibility of a provider-
performed SBU pilot in Cameroon; 3) Assess the acceptability of an SBU pilot among Cameroonian trauma
stakeholders. If the R21 transition milestones are met, the R33 phase will pursue three specific aims: 1)
Assess diagnostic accuracy of provider-performed SBU on trauma patients; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of a
provider-performed SBU program in expanding diagnostic capacity for trauma; 3) Test associations between
SBU program implementation and trauma outcomes. Validating SBU as a feasible and effective method to
expand diagnostic capacity will remove a major roadblock to prompt trauma care and provide a critical target
for reducing the detrimental impact of injury on this population. Embedded in the study approach is the training
of clinicians in health systems research and strengthening of mHEALTH capacity in Cameroon which will
support development and research across health sectors. A standardized SBU training and implementation
protocol could be rapidly scaled-up for wider implementation throughout Cameroon and validated in other
LMIC contexts."
10862706,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Adolescent substance use is one of the strongest predictors of drug overdose and death during adulthood.
However, most individuals who initiate tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use do not report
problematic substance use at later points in the life course. To promote healthy substance use trajectories and
prevent the social contagion of substance use, it is necessary to identify key factors that increase young
people’s odds of problematic use in adulthood. In previous research, peer characteristics and relationships
have emerged as important predictors of substance use and misuse in the short term. However, this line of
work has yet to consider how adolescent peer network structures, as well as their stability over time, carry
implications for patterns of substance use and misuse throughout the life course. The proposed research aims
to address this gap by leveraging data from the Promoting School-Community Partnerships to Enhance
Resilience (PROSPER) study. PROSPER is a large longitudinal study that followed individuals from
adolescence to adulthood in rural US communities, a population that remains understudied in substance use
research. Through a data matching initiative with the PROSPER data, the proposed project will develop a
friendship network dataset across a uniquely long period of time from early adolescence to young adulthood.
The resulting linkages will allow for the analysis of new research questions about substance misuse, network
structure, and tie stability during the transition to adulthood. In addition, we will be able to examine how these
relationships vary according to individual demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, sexuality) and the network
processes that define a youth’s school-community context (e.g., the popularity of substance users), which will
be quantified through state-of-the-art statistical methods. We will achieve these goals through two specific
aims. Aim 1 evaluates a theoretical-informed model that examines the extent to which direct adolescent
friendship ties impact substance use and misuse in young adulthood. Aim 2 considers whether young adults
are more likely to report substance use and misuse according to macro-structures of indirect ties and the
broader contexts of their adolescent friendship networks. Across both aims, we will also consider how these
relationships vary according to whether young people maintain or dissolve their adolescent friendships after
leaving high school. Results from these secondary analyses will enhance our understanding of the risk factors
associated with substance use and misuse throughout the life course. Additionally, our findings will help guide
the identification of optimal network targets for future interventions that aim to reduce long-term, problematic
substance use in young adult populations. Informed by our results, prevention programs will be able to
leverage healthy social ties and discourage the formation of high-risk relationships, which will enhance their
ability to prevent future epidemics related to substance use behaviors."

Transgender youth in the United States have unique health needs but often face barriers to accessing and
receiving health care services which contribute to disparate health outcomes including high vulnerability to HIV
and other sexually transmitted infections. Emerging evidence has begun to document HIV-related sexual risk
among young transgender men (YTM), as well as low uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis among those with
indications, suggesting high vulnerability to HIV infection. Despite the high prevalence and increased risk of
HIV in YTM who have sex with cisgender men, only one prior HIV prevention intervention has been developed
to address the specific sexual health needs of YTM, which indicates a critical gap in HIV prevention science. In
response to this need, and building off our strong preliminary work, we propose to develop a mobile
intervention for YTM building on MyPEEPS Mobile, which was originally developed for very young sexual
minority men. Central to this intervention is the premise that it will be delivered to youth during a developmental
period that precedes or coincides with sexual debut, an important time for intervention, prior to or concurrent
with initiation of high-risk behaviors. Given both the gap in HIV prevention science and the lack of current
targeted interventions, and building upon our multidisciplinary team’s extensive experience in HIV prevention,
mHealth, behavioral interventions, randomized controlled trials, and transgender health, we propose the
following specific aims: 1) Using qualitative methodology, expert feedback, and usability assessments, develop
MyPEEPS Mobile for YTM, 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the revised MyPEEPS Mobile App in a sample of 80 YTM (15-19
years) and refine the study methods for a future efficacy trial, and 3) Assess predisposing, enabling, and
reinforcing factors for MyPEEPS Mobile among YTM through theoretically-guided in-depth interviews. The
proposed MyPEEPS intervention for YTM is a novel and evidence-driven intervention using mobile technology
to deliver HIV prevention information to high-risk youth. This will be the first study to develop and pilot a scaled-
up, mobile HIV prevention intervention designed by, and piloted for, a diverse group of YTM. The final product
of this study will be the basis for an R01 application to conduct a large-scale efficacy study for this population.
The proposed MyPEEPS Mobile intervention for YTM is a novel and evidence-driven intervention using mobile
technology to deliver HIV prevention information specifically developed for YTM. Consequently, we are
confident that the proposed intervention will be of high impact intervention for improving HIV prevention
behaviors in YTM and have long-term implications for overall improvement in the public’s health."
10744746,"Heart failure (HF) is a major health epidemic in developed countries, however, its underlying pathology is not
well characterized. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem zinc finger protein that binds to AU-rich elements (ARE) in
the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA molecules, and induces their degradation. Global TTP knockout
(KO) mice display systemic inflammation, since TNFα mRNA is normally degraded by TTP, and deletion of TTP
leads to elevated TNFα levels. Thus, very few studies have assessed the role of TTP in metabolism despite its
original discovery as an insulin-inducible gene, and genetic studies linking TTP to metabolic syndrome. We are
addressing this fundamental gap in knowledge, and our strong preliminary data suggest critical activities by TTP
in cardiac metabolism and the development of HF. Specifically, we have shown that TTP inhibits fatty acid (FA)
and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism (independent of its effects on inflammation), and reduces
the mRNA levels of key proteins in these processes, i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α
and branched-chain α–ketoacid acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC)-E2 subunits. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that TTP inhibits cardiac FA and BCAA metabolism by binding to and degrading
PPARα and BCKDC-E2 mRNAs, and that TTP exacerbates the development of HF by impairing FA and
BCAA metabolism. In Aim 1, we will assess whether TTP inhibits cardiac FA metabolism by binding to PPARα
mRNA and promoting its degradation. We will assess whether TTP binds to PPARα mRNA by performing RNA
co-immunopreciptation (co-IP) and deletion studies of PPARα 3’-UTR AREs. We will also measure FA uptake
and metabolism in the hearts from cardiac-specific TTP KO (csTTP-KO) mice, and will determine whether these
changes are through PPARα using TTP/PPARα double KO mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether TTP
decreases BCAA catabolism through binding and degradation of BCKDC-E2 mRNA. We will first determine
whether TTP binds BCKDC-E2 mRNA by performing RNA co-IP and deletion studies on BCKDC-E2 3’-UTR
AREs. We will also measure BCAA levels and BCKDC activity in heart tissue from csTTP-KO mice. To
demonstrate whether the reduction in BCAA catabolism with TTP KO is through BCKDC-E2, we will perform
similar studies with knockdown of TTP and BCKDC-E2. In Aim 3, we will determine whether TTP has detrimental
effects on the heart under stress conditions, and whether this depends upon impaired FA and BCAA metabolism.
We will subject csTTP-KO mice to pressure overload and ischemia, then assess their cardiac function and
metabolism. To determine the role of PPARα and BCKDC in this process, we will use csTTP/PPARα double KO
mice and will cross csTTP-KO with protein phosphatase 2Cm KO mice (which have reduced BCKDC activity),
and assess cardiac response to stress. We will also show our studies to develop novel drugs that target TTP
without inducing inflammation, providing potential clinical implications for Aim 3. These studies will improve our
understanding of cardiac metabolism, and may lead to new avenues for treatment of HF."

The recent development of highly multiplexed subcellular resolution tissue imaging promises to accelerate
research into tumor initiation, progression, and immune surveillance and ultimately aid in the discovery of new
biomarkers usable in a clinical setting. In parallel, spatially resolved measurement of transcript and small
molecule abundances is achieving near single-cell resolution. NCI programs such as the Human Tumor Atlas
Network (HTAN) are capitalizing on these developments to create public data repositories (“Tissue Atlases”)
similar in scope and ambition to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The greatest barriers to making such data
routinely accessible to basic and translational cancer biologists lie not in data collection but rather data
visualization and analysis. Existing software tools designed for cultured cell experiments or hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) based digital pathology are inadequate for high-plex data applications, and emerging tools do not
meet the needs of either low-cost and efficient data sharing or sophisticated multi-modal machine learning from
diverse data. This Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) project will therefore develop, harden,
and test standards-compliant software tools that make it possible to visualize, annotate, and quantify features of
the tumor microenvironment spanning a 105-fold range in length scale (from ~100 nm to 1 cm) by building on a
suite of interoperable, cloud-based MINERVA tools that also work well with existing commercial and open-source
software. Key user communities include cell biologists, microscopists, pathologists and oncologists with
expertise in imaging and tissue biology and computational biologists and bioinformaticians who process and
integrate image and ‘omic data into atlases. These users work closely together in our laboratories but have
distinct needs. Our tools will therefore support three phases of research: (i) initial data exploration via intuitive
and easy-to-deploy web-based tools; (ii) hypothesis generation and testing via sophisticated ML-enabled visual
analytics; and (iii) data publication and integration with existing knowledge, databases, and atlases. Our
innovations will include the latest advances in visual encoding, ML/AI, and human-computer interfaces that
enable human-in-the-loop analysis and explanatory and exploratory data visualization.
Aim 1 will establish light-weight methods for low-cost visualization and communication of multiplex IF, H&E, and
spatial omics data collected by HTAN and similar international consortia. Aim 2 will develop new ways for deeply
exploring and analyzing the spatial data for hypothesis generation and testing, with a focus on quantifying
morphology and cell-cell interactions in 2D whole-slide and high-resolution 3D images. Aim 3 will expand our
MINERVA platform to enable collaborative analysis and data sharing across different audiences and data types
to better understand how tumor architecture changes with disease progression and treatment. Together, our
software will promote efficient hypothesis generation and testing from complex, multi-modal datasets as well as
their annotation and distribution in accordance with FAIR data principles."
10745676,"Abstract
The environmental obesogen hypothesis posits that lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) accumulate
in adipose tissue (AT) and can disrupt metabolic systems. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of
these toxicants on AT function remain poorly understood. As the most studied POP, dichlorodiphenyl-
dichloroethylene (DDE), a persistent metabolite of the insecticide dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT),
provides a model for assessing the metabolic health impact of lipophilic POPs. Almost all U.S. children and
adolescents have detectable DDE blood levels. Despite abundant evidence from experimental studies showing
that DDE disrupts metabolic homeostasis, mechanisms underlying metabolic disruption by DDE in humans are
unclear. We therefore propose a novel study design for investigating mechanisms of DDE metabolic effects in
humans, based on a remarkable archive of clinical data and visceral AT samples from the Teen-Longitudinal
Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study and an in vitro human adipocyte experimental model. We
hypothesize that the large metabolic changes after bariatric surgery provide a “natural experiment” that will
magnify effects of the prototypical obesogen DDE, and that DDE in visceral AT will attenuate the reduction in
body mass index and insulin resistance after bariatric surgery in a concentration-dependent manner (Aim 1).
Although we know that high doses of DDE impair thermogenesis and insulin signaling in animal models, we still
do not know whether these mechanisms underlie metabolic disruption by DDE in humans. We will assess effects
of DDE on these pathways in a human primary adipocyte cell line, an experimental model that will be free from
the potential for uncontrolled confounding in human observational studies and that may also identify new
pathways (Aim 2). We will then test these pathways in metabolome and transcriptome profiles of human AT
from Teen-LABS study participants, using a hierarchical modeling approach (Aim 3). Finally, we will integrate
results from the DDE omics analyses in human AT and in the adipocyte cell line, using a novel latent variable
modeling framework, to identify subgroups of adolescents who have less weight loss and less improvement in
insulin resistance after bariatric surgery, based on their DDE exposure and multi-omics profile in AT (Aim 4).
The proposed research will be the first human study to examine mechanisms of DDE toxicity to AT in humans,
using adipose tissue-specific exposure and omic measures, and clinically relevant metabolic outcomes such as
BMI and insulin resistance. A strong interdisciplinary team of investigators brings expertise in environmental
epidemiology, bariatric surgery, toxicology, omics, and biostatistics. Our study, integrating in vitro and human
observational approaches, has the potential to establish a new paradigm for the study of lipophilic obesogenic
chemicals and to advance our understanding of environmental contributions to obesity and type 2 diabetes."
10745678,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of cardiovascular death in people less than 50 years of
age, and most of the premature cardiovascular deaths occur in people with complex CHD. Although the Fontan
operation is an effective palliation for complex CHD, it creates a unique physiology characterized by systemic
venous congestion and end-organ dysfunction, which leads to premature death from circulatory failure (median
survival ~40 years). One of the mechanisms leading to this suboptimal outcome begins with impaired nitric
oxide signaling, leading to endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), and in turn, end-
organ dysfunction and death. The therapeutic benefits of chronic pulmonary vasodilator therapy for PVD in
people with Fontan palliation have not been consistent across trials, and this may be related to the lack well-
defined criteria for PVD diagnosis in Fontan physiology, and lack of understanding regarding the underlying
mechanisms. Recent data show that assessment of pulmonary vascular reserve during exercise improves
detection of PVD, and that impairment in pulmonary vascular reserve correlates with severity of endothelial
dysfunction and end-organ dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether pulmonary vasodilators can
improve pulmonary vascular reserve in these patients, or what the mechanisms might be. Such data will be
critical for the development novel therapies for prevention and treatment of end-organ dysfunction due to PVD,
an important risk factor for mortality in the Fontan population. The long-term goal is to delay the onset of end-
organ dysfunction and mortality from systemic venous congestion, through early diagnosis and treatment of
hemodynamic derangements in Fontan physiology. The overall objective for this application is to determine the
mechanisms by which enhancement in nitric oxide signaling might improve pulmonary vascular reserve and
end-organ function in Fontan physiology. The central hypothesis is that enhancement in nitric oxide signaling
through treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition (PDE5i) will improve pulmonary vascular reserve, and
endothelial and end-organ function. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Determine
the mechanism of response to pulmonary vasodilator therapy in Fontan physiology; (2) Determine the
mechanism of improvement in end-organ function, aerobic capacity and quality of life (QOL) outcomes after
pulmonary vasodilator therapy. For the first aim, 80 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to PDE5i or placebo, and
invasive exercise test and peripheral artery tonometry will be performed before and after 52 weeks of therapy.
For the second aim, multi-domain outcome assessment (liver, kidney, gut, aerobic capacity, and QOL metrics)
will be assessed before and after therapy. This proposal is innovative and significant as it will delineate the
mechanism of response to pulmonary vasodilators, and in turn, enable targeting of these mechanisms with
current and novel therapies to delay the onset of end-organ dysfunction and circulatory failure."
10745691,"The diversity of information encoding by neuronal circuits is regulated by the magnitude and
location of Ca2+ entry though voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV). In the mammalian central
nervous system, the CaV2.1 channel is the critical subtype for CNS function since it is the most
efficient CaV2 subtype at triggering synaptic vesicle (SV) release. At the majority of synapses,
CaV2.1 is present at higher levels and in closest proximity to SVs. During development synapses
become progressively more dependent on CaV2.1 due to selective reduction of CaV2.2 and
CaV2.3. Neurons that signal with rapid and temporally precise action-potentials use Cav2.1
exclusive synapses that have fast SV release kinetics. Additionally, CaV2.1 is the dominant CaV2
isoform associated with human CaV2 channelopathies that manifest in migraine, epilepsy, and
ataxia. Consistent with these findings, dysregulation of SV release is a cause of these and several
other neurological disorders.
Despite the importance of CaV2.1 in CNS function, we know little about the molecular mechanisms
that regulate these CaV2.1 functions at the synapse. The calyx of Held, a glutamatergic
presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem utilizes rapid and temporally precise action potential
signaling for encoding information. The calyx undergoes a developmental change from having
multiple CaV2 subtypes to CaV2.1 exclusively. Since it is the sole input to drive post-synaptic
action potential spiking and due to the ability to directly measure presynaptic Ca2+ currents and
correlate them to SV release rate, the calyx is an exceptional model for gaining mechanistic
insights into the presynaptic regulation of SV release and neuronal circuit output. We will use
transgenic mouse models and novel viral vectors to manipulate CaV2 subtypes at the calyx during
different developmental stages. With these tools and proposed experiments, we will determine
how the CaV2 α1 subunit regulates CaV2 subtype levels, organization and proximity to SVs thereby
controlling synaptic transmission and neuronal circuit output. Given the importance of CaV2
channels in regulating synaptic transmission, as well as the pathological consequences of
aberrant SV release, we envision that our findings will provide fundamental insights into how
information is encoded by the nervous system, facilitating the development of treatments for a
wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10745721,"Project Summary. Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is metastatic, understudied sarcoma, which
predominantly affects women, and manifests as proliferation of tumor smooth muscle-like cells within the
lungs. LAM is caused by TSC1/2 loss of function mutations that lead to mTOR hyperactivation, therefore,
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is approved for LAM. However, although rapamycin stabilizes the lung function,
after therapy cessation the progressive decline in the lung function resumes leading to respiratory insufficiency
and there are no other drugs approved for LAM. Thus, the discovery of new therapeutic targets for LAM is
critically needed.
The objectives of this project are: (1) determine a role of extracellular vesicles (EV) in LAM metastasis and (2)
provide the proof-of-concept for targeting EV for LAM.
A role of EV in LAM has not yet been explored, however, our published and preliminary studies indicate that
(a) EV cargo contribute to LAM metastasis via enhancing cancer stem-cell (CSC) characteristics and survival
of circulating LAM cells and lung remodeling and (b) rapamycin affects EV, possibly, leading to enhanced
seeding of the lungs by LAM cells.
These data lead to our central hypothesis that TSC1/2-null-cell-derived EV cargo, containing SOX-10,
integrins, and c-Src, increases LAM metastasis via increasing CSC plasticity and survival of circulating LAM
cells and via lung extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by resident lung fibroblasts, which enhances
lung seeding by LAM cells. Rapamycin enhances EV production by TSC1/2-null cells and their quality, which
may explain faster clearance of LAM cells from the circulation of patients treated with rapamycin analogs but
simultaneously and adversely enhances LAM lung metastasis. A key translational corollary of this hypothesis is
that LAM will be sensitive to inhibition of the EV pathway and targeting EV may improve outcomes in
rapamycin treated patients.
To test this hypothesis we will determine: Aim 1. The effect of EV-cargo on CSC plasticity and survival of LAM
cells; Aim 2. Impact of EV-cargo on lung remodeling and lung seeding by LAM cells; and Aim 3. The effect of
inhibitors of EV uptake or EV biogenesis, individually or in combination with rapamycin, on lung remodeling
and LAM metastasis in vivo.
Our approaches include: the culture systems to test impact of EV-cargo on circulating LAM cells, novel LAM
mouse models in conjunction with longitudinal non-invasive live imaging, and studies with patient samples to
corroborate in vitro and mouse data and establish EV cargo as biomarker of LAM progression.
This project will impact the filed by establishing EV is a new therapeutic target for LAM and providing
foundation for repurposing approved EV-targeting drugs for LAM."
10745722,"Project Summary
My primary hypothesis is that GAS6/MERTK signaling is upregulated in the setting of inflammation, leading to
enhanced platelet activation responses, increased platelet-leukocyte interactions, and subsequent thrombosis.
Therefore, we believe inhibition of this pathway will decrease thromboinflammation. MERTK is a receptor
tyrosine kinase expressed on the platelet surface that, when stimulated by its plasma-based ligand GAS6,
leads to augmentation of platelet activation responses. I have shown that inhibition of this signaling axis, either
by anti-MERTK small molecule inhibitor (UNC2025) or a novel soluble MERTK splice variant (iMer) decreases
in vitro platelet activation in functional assays and in vivo thrombosis in murine models. I also recently
demonstrated that plasma GAS6 levels were elevated in children with thrombosis compared to healthy
controls, suggesting that GAS6 may also mediate thrombosis (potentially through its ability to bridge
membrane-bound phosphatidylserine and MERTK).
In this proposed project, I will rigorously investigate the role of inflammation in platelet activation and
thrombosis, as well as the specific mechanisms by which inhibition of GAS6/MERTK signaling impacts
thromboinflammation. Though I already have a strong research base in platelet activation response assays
and murine models of thrombosis, this proposal provides the experimental skills and knowledge base needed
to evaluate the contributions of the inflammatory system in this particular context. This additional training will
allow me to continue developing as a physician-scientist and execute the transition to an independent basic-
translational research career in thromboinflammation.
Herein, I propose three specific aims to 1) characterize the effect of inflammation upon GAS6/MERTK
signaling and subsequent platelet activation in vitro and thrombosis in vivo, 2) define the mechanism through
which GAS6/MERTK signaling impacts thromboinflammation, and 3) determine the role of iMer in regulating
GAS6/MERTK signaling in platelets.
My mentorship team consists of recognized leaders in functional assays of platelet activation and murine
models of thrombosis (Dr. Jorge Di Paola, primary mentor), and cell-cell interactions in the setting of
inflammation (Dr. Sean Colgan, co-mentor). The training plan clearly outlines how I will advance my research
career development by building upon my previous studies and experience using the proposed research aims,
didactic course-work, attendance at local and national meeting, and guidance from my mentorship team and
scholarship oversight committee. I specifically designed the proposed project and associated career
development plan to facilitate my transition to independent investigator with the long-term goal of developing
novel strategies to decrease inflammation-related thrombosis."
10769774,"Clinical guidelines often recommend providing supplemental education to patients. However, there is
limited evidence to support this recommendation, nor is there implementation guidance. Existing patient
education interventions have been shown to impact outcomes such as knowledge, medication adherence,
and satisfaction with care, but few have been associated with improvements in clinical outcomes such as
mortality or preventable adverse drug events. Effective learning strategies grounded in established
learning theories are available but are rarely incorporated into patient education tools. No guideline for
developing patient education tools currently exists that utilizes best educational practices and is evidence
based, widely available, and easily implementable across health care settings. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to support my development as an independent investigator specializing in developing effective
patient educational and shared decision making (SDM) tools that support optimal patient-clinician
interactions and meaningful clinical outcomes. The overall objective of this study is to create and test a
practice guide for developing patient education tools grounded in educational theory. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that patient education tools based on effective learning strategies will be
more effective than tools that are not. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) create an evidence-
based practice guide for developing patient education; 2) design a new patient education tool for patients
receiving anticoagulant therapy using this practice guide; and 3) pilot test the feasibility of incorporating a
patient education tool and testing it within a randomized controlled trial. Aim 1 will utilize clinical guideline
creation methodology to identify evidence-based learning techniques and theories to guide creation of the
aforementioned practice guide. A web-based education tool for anticoagulation therapy patient education
will be developed in Aim 2 using the practice guide, supported by inclusive user-based design. Finally, the
education tool will be piloted tested in Aim 3 in order to prepare for a randomized control trial. This career
development award will be mentored by leaders in education and anticoagulation research including: Dr.
Daniel Witt, a leader in anticoagulation therapy, Dr. Angela Fagerlin, a leader in Shared Decision Making,
Dr. Kirsten Butcher, an expert in educational technology and user-based design, Drs. Geoffrey Barnes
and Mark Crowther, international leaders in anticoagulation research, and Dr. Thomas Delate, an expert
in statistics and health research. Combined with my mentoring team, this training program will provide
skills in 1) clinical guideline methodology, 2) inclusive instructional and user-based design, 3) randomized
controlled trial conduction, and 4) leadership skills and grantsmanship. In summary, this project will create
an evidence-based practice guide for developing patient education tools as well as lay the groundwork for
a randomized controlled trial for evaluating patient education interventions."
10769781,"Metabolic Imaging of Targeted Therapies in Cancer
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given the paradigm shift in cancer therapy including the ever-growing increase in the use of targeted
therapies, foremost small-molecule kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy, there is an urgent need to develop
reliable imaging techniques to detect and monitor the efficacy of such inhibitors in cancer patients. Because
direct evaluation of cell signaling is practically not feasible and changes in tumor volume occur late after
treatment initiation given the predominantly cytostatic effect of the inhibitors, we are proposing an alternative
approach to monitor changes in tumor metabolism induced by kinase inhibition. This will be achieved in three
stages: 1) analysis of gene expression/proteomic/phosphoproteomic to identify metabolic pathways perturbed
by inhibition of the signaling pathway performed both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse xenotransplant models
using patient derived cultured and primary cells (PDX), 2) metabolomic and metabolic fluxomic analysis of
effect of kinase inhibition on metabolic pathways, also done in in vitro and in vivo settings, 3) analysis of
biomarkers of inhibitor response validated by the above “-omics” studies by imaging techniques, preferably
non-invasive, such as 1H MRS or chemical exchange saturation-transfer (CEST) with standard FDG PET
imaging serving as control. In these proof-of-principle studies, we will focus on mTOR, the serine/threonine
kinase hyperactive in the majority of cancer types, and employ direct and indirect inhibitors of mTOR,
rapamycin/rapalog and Torin2, respectively, as index kinase/kinase inhibitor system. We will use diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as experimental cancer model. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that
rapamycin decreased concentrations of lactic acid in patient-derived lymphoma cell lines, both cultured in vitro
and xenotransplanted into mice, as detected by unique 1H MRS imaging-based detection pulse sequences
developed by us and our collaborators. The rapamycin-induced decrease in glycolytic metabolism correlated
with and, importantly, markedly preceded inhibition of tumor cell growth, strongly supporting the notion that
image-based evaluation of the key metabolic response is predictive of biological tumor cell response to the
inhibition. The response also correlated with and, hence, was at least in part attributable to decreased
expression of hexokinase II, other glycolytic enzymes and enzymes from other key metabolic pathways
including phosphoribosyl-amidotransferase and other enzymes involved in glutaminolysis. Utilizing 13C MRS
and 13C LC-MS, we have confirmed mTOR control of glycolysis and also noted decreases in fatty acid and
sterol metabolism as well as inhibition of the pentose phosphate shunt and the TCA cycle. We anticipate that
the proposed studies will extend our knowledge of the impact of mTOR inhibition on malignant cell metabolism
and, ultimately, set the stage for future clinical evaluation of MRS or other imaging method(s) for monitoring
response to inhibitors of mTOR and other cell-signaling kinases in DLBCL and other types of cancer."
10769868,"BRAFV600E-papillary thyroid carcinoma (V600E-PTC) is particularly aggressive, and as it deregulates iodine metabolism, its victims are unresponsive to radioiodine treatment, and suffer high rates of metastasis and recurrence, and low survival rates. BRAFV600E inhibitors such as vemurafenib (vemu), which at first showed clinical promise, are the only therapeutic option, but resistance to these drugs is widely reported. Our premise is that the epigenetic silencing of the first identified thyroid-specific long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), Xloc001313 (Xloc13) deregulates iodine metabolism, sustains tumor cell survival, and promotes progression and drug resistance. Xloc13 is active downstream of the coding gene for TPO, a key enzyme for iodine metabolism, and its expression is far lower in V600E-PTC than normal tissue. Our project is designed to determine the cellular mechanisms behind these effects, and use these findings to better target clinical trials of new treatments. Vemu treatment induces Xloc13 expression, indicating it is silenced by BRAFV600E, and its inactivation by CRISPR in normal thyroid cells reduces TPO levels and iodine uptake, while increasing TSP-1 levels (extracellular matrix protein) and cell proliferation. Xloc13 RNA enhancer maps to DNA-binding motifs on the TSP-1 promoter, leading to down-regulation of TSP-1, which inactivates TGFβ1 to inhibit PTC cell and pericyte viability. We recently demonstrated that V600E-PTC samples are enriched in pericytes that co- express TSP-1 and TGFβ1 to sustain V600E-PTC cell survival. Xloc13 silencing correlates with high pericyte
density, linking its action to pericyte biology. We also identified regulatory motifs in the Xloc13 promoter for EZH2 and E2F1 as transcriptional repressors up-regulated in vemu-resistant V600E-PTC cells and ChIP- enriched at these DNA-binding motifs. Critically, combining inhibitors of BRAFV600E+EZH2+CDK4/6 durably rescued Xloc13, and reduced PTC cell and pericyte viability. Xloc13 down-regulation therefore plays a key role in V600E-PTC, and our central objective is to determine its mechanisms of regulation and their impact on tumor progression and resistance. We hypothesize that BRAFV600E synergizes with EZH2 and the CDK4/6 (upstream of E2F1) pathway to down-regulate Xloc13, which deregulates iodine metabolism, enhances tumor viability, and increases invasion signaling through pericyte action, which leads to secondary drug resistance and tumor progression. Using cutting-edge technologies (CRISPR, ChIP, ATAC, RAP) and new cancer mouse model, our specific Aims are: 1) To identify the mechanisms regulating Xloc13 in V600E-PTC and their impact on tumor aggressiveness; 2) To determine the role of Xloc13 in the regulation of TPO in V600E-PTC and its impact on iodine metabolism and PTC cell survival; 3) To assess the efficacy of anti-BRAFV600E-EZH2-CDK4/6 combined therapy on human V600E-PTC in vivo. Our studies will have high clinical significance by supporting new clinical trials of trimodal combined therapies for advanced V600E-PTC patients, and identifying new mechanisms in PTC and its microenvironment which could serve as drug development targets for this tumor."
10769870,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, enabling cancer cells to rapidly proliferate, invade, and
metastasize. Several key enzymes have been identified that modulate cancer metabolism. These include
enzymes in glucose, amino acid, nucleic acid, and lipid metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase A,
glutaminase 1, thymidylate synthase, and choline kinase alpha, to name just a few. Ubiquitous mitochondrial
creatine kinase 1 (CKMT1) is emerging as a novel key enzyme in creatine metabolism of cancer. Few studies
to date have investigated the role of CKMT1 in cancer, and the specific role of CKMT1 in breast cancer
migration, invasion and metastasis remains largely unknown. To close this knowledge gap, we seek to
investigate reprogramming of creatine metabolism in breast cancer. Our preliminary data show that CKMT1
drives cellular creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentrations and activates glycolysis in breast
cancer cells. We consistently show in cell lines, mouse models, and patients that creatine metabolite levels
along with CKMT1 expression are downregulated in metastatic breast cancer cells and metastatic tumor
tissues. Overexpression of CKMT1 in metastatic breast cancer cells reduces migration, invasion, and
metastasis, while increasing proliferation and primary tumor growth. Silencing of CKMT1 in nonmetastatic
breast cancer cells increases migration and invasion, which occurs through generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that upregulate adhesion and degradative factors, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
and signaling pathways. In Aim 1, we will rigorously investigate the cause-and-effect relationships between
reprogramming of creatine metabolism, related molecular pathways, and metastasis-driving cancer cell
properties. In Aim 2, we will assess if genes/enzymes and related molecular pathways responsible for
reprogramming creatine metabolism drive primary tumor growths and metastasis in mouse models of breast
cancer. Our preliminary data show that CKMT1 expression was significantly decreased in clinical breast cancer
metastases as compared to primary breast tumors. In Aim 3, we will further investigate in unique single-patient
tissue microarrays (TMAs) from our rapid autopsy program how creatine metabolic enzyme expression levels
and creatine metabolites, as well as related molecular pathways, are affected when breast cancers
metastasize in patients. In our three Aims, we will test our overall hypothesis that reprogramming of creatine
metabolism participates in driving breast cancer metastasis. Our preliminary findings provide evidence that
creatine metabolism, and in particular CKMT1, holds promise as prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic
target for metastatic breast cancer. Our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of
reprogramming of creatine metabolism in tumor progression and metastasis. We will develop integrated
multiplex matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging and immunohistochemistry approaches to detect
creatine enzymes and metabolites in breast cancer specimens for future use in pathology workflows."
10769871,"Mechanisms of myocarditis and progressive cardiac fibrosis in chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection
Abstract:
Chagas disease, caused by infection with the vector borne intracellular protozoal parasite Trypanosoma cruzi,
affects approximately 6.5 million people worldwide. Chronic infection with T. cruzi results in persistent low grade
myocarditis and progressive fibrosis, which results in significant cardiac dysfunction called Chronic Chagasic
Cardiomyopathy (CCC). Patients with CCC have higher levels of cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and circulating
inflammatory and fibrotic markers that correlate with disease severity. The antiparasitic drug benznidazole fails
to ameliorate the chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of CCC. Our long term goal is to define the
mechanisms of host inflammation, fibrosis and metabolic dysregulation in CCC in an effort to identify targets for
therapeutic interventions. T. cruzi induces host inflammatory and fibrotic pathways through multiple mechanisms.
Based on our knowledge of these mechanisms, we developed an immunotherapy consisting of the T. cruzi
derived antigen Tc24-C4 and a TLR4 agonist adjuvant. We previously showed that the immunotherapy, either
alone or combined with benznidazole in a vaccine-linked chemotherapy strategy, modulates host inflammatory
immune responses and results in reduced myocarditis and fibrosis. Additionally, we have shown that similar to
mouse models of lung, skin and liver fibrosis, inhibiting STAT3 activation with the small molecule TTI-101
significantly reduces cardiac fibrosis in a mouse model of CCC. This work led to our central hypothesis that
targeting host inflammatory and fibrotic pathways will synergize with anti-parasitic treatment to reduce cardiac
inflammation and fibrosis and improve cardiac health in CCC. Building on our preliminary data, we propose three
Specific Aims to evaluate efficacy of this combined treatment scheme: 1) Determine the effect of targeted
interventions (immunotherapy, benznidazole and TTI-101) on modulating parasite-induced inflammatory
immune responses; 2) Determine the effect of targeted interventions on modulating parasite-induced pro-fibrotic
response; and 3) Determine the effect of targeted interventions on modulating parasite-induced metabolic
responses. Through these aims, we will better define the pathogenesis of CCC, specifically the relative
contribution of host inflammatory, fibrotic, and metabolic dysregulation to disease progression. Targeted
interventions that restore the inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic pathways to normal, and preserve cardiac
health, will help us identify key host response mechanisms that contribute to CCC. Additionally, these studies
will provide important proof of concept for developing multi-modal treatment strategies that target both the
parasite and underlying tissue pathologies of CCC to preserve cardiac health and ultimately improve clinical
outcomes."

Swallowing problems in Parkinson’s disease (PD) affect 90% of patients, with significant
consequences for quality of life and morbidity, and are resistant to current dopamine
deficiency targeting treatments for movement impairments caused by PD (Coelho et al., 2010;
Plowman-Prine et al., 2009). The treatment resistant nature of swallowing problems
implicates neurological damage outside the substantia nigra and striatum. Most cases of PD
result in part from exposure to toxic substances, resulting in widespread brain pathologies (de
Lau & Breteler, 2006). PD affects multiple components of feeding and their coordination,
which are controlled by different parts of the brain (Kwon &Lee, 2019). The overall goal of this
project is to identify treatment resistant components of feeding and their neuropathological
correlates in PD. The central hypothesis is that specific components of the feeding process are
differentially impaired by neurodegeneration inside and outside the substantia nigra resulting
in an overall treatment resistant phenotype. Three related specific aims will test this
hypothesis. Specific aims 1 will compare behavioral, biomechanical, and neuromuscular
differences in chew-swallow-breathe coordination in a generalized model of PD, the rat
rotenone injection model (Cannon et al., 2009) versus a 6-OHDA induced targeted
nigrostriatal lesion model (Russell et al., 2013) to identify feeding dysfunction not related to
nigrostriatal deficits. Specific aim two will examine how differences in behavioral and
sensorimotor complexity between solid food eating and liquid drinking affect severity of
behavioral, biomechanical, and neuromuscular oropharyngeal discoordination in a rotenone
injection rat model of PD. Specific aim 3 will test the behavioral, biomechanical, and
neuromuscular impact of levodopa-induced rescue of chewing function (Karlsson et al., 1992)
on feeding coordination in a rotenone injection rat model of PD to identify pathophysiological
mechanisms of dysphagia that are resistant to treatments targeting dopamine deficiency. The
approach is innovative in combining complimentary lesion models, behavioral models, and
neuropharmacological approaches, with a detailed analysis of feeding to find the
pathophysiological basis of dysphagia treatment resistance in PD. The approach is significant
in targeting the underlying mechanism of treatment resistance in a common, understudied
symptom of PD. The neuromuscular, neuropathological, and biomechanical findings of this
from this work will lead to further research into the neurological basis of treatment resistance
of dysphagia in PD, with the ultimate goal of developing targeted therapeutic interventions."

primary aims for UNC EDGE are to (1) expose early career freshmen and sophomores to the breadth of careers
available in basic genome sciences, genomic medicine, and genomics and society; (2) provide the foundational
research skills & knowledgebase required to make an informed career decision; and (3) help students develop
a supportive multi-tiered community mentoring framework to guide their career trajectory. Our central objective
is to provide students with the tools, knowledge, and support to build self-efficacy and informed decision making
required for sustainable advancement in a career in genomics. North Carolina (NC) has a high level of ethnic
diversity [10.1 million people, ~33% from underrepresented communities], a large proportion of rural regions
(80%), a low rate of completion of higher education among underrepresented groups (14-20%), and increasing
disparities in health and healthcare. NC is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology enterprise and the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), a global leader in genomics research and Precision Medicine. Both
entities have historically low proportions of people from underrepresented, underserved, and disadvantaged
backgrounds working in genomics. Over the course of this 5-year project, UNC EDGE will use a tailored
curriculum to bridge the gap between the stellar genomics research environment at UNC and underrepresented
(UR) undergrads from surrounding NC communities, as well as students across the United States. Our primary
objective for long-term outcomes is to increase the number of these UR students that choose and are stably
retained in a genomics research career. This will increase access to lucrative job opportunities in academia and
biotechnology, and increase inclusion and innovation in research & healthcare. In addition, increasing entry of
well-trained underrepresented professionals into the genomics workforce gives them the opportunity to become
stakeholders in the research and healthcare decisions that affect their community; an outcome that we hope will
ultimately help improve disparities in healthcare as genomics becomes a greater consideration in Precision
Medicine."

hepatitis C. The co-occurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and fatty liver is associated with more rapid
progression to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and results in worse outcomes than either
condition alone. We will assemble a cohort of AN people diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), including AN people with and without a current or previous diagnosis of HCV, to determine how
infection with HCV modifies liver fibrosis, liver disease risk markers, and liver-related health outcomes among
AN people with NAFLD.
Aim 1: Assemble a well-characterized cohort of AN people with NAFLD to investigate differences in clinical
characteristics, risk factors, self-reported symptoms, and liver-related outcomes based on HCV status. We will
stratify participants by HCV status for comparisons of baseline clinical characteristics, risk factors, self-reported
symptoms, and liver-related outcomes including liver cancer and liver failure.
Aim 2: Compare fibrosis stage and progression by HCV status among AN people with NAFLD. Fibrosis increases
the risk of liver failure and creates a permissive environment for liver cancer. We will use vibration-controlled
transient elastography (VCTE) to measure the presence and amount of liver fibrosis at time of study enrollment.
We will also evaluate annualized change in fibrosis using available historic VCTE measurements. We will stratify
on HCV status to compare VCTE measurements at time of enrollment as well as annualized rates of change.
We will also investigate associations between these measures and clinical characteristics, risk factors, self-
reported symptoms, and liver-related outcomes.
The long-term goal for this research program is to reduce the burden of disease among AN people with NAFLD
by improving secondary prevention of adverse liver-related outcomes. A critical barrier to preventing these
adverse outcomes is knowing which AN people with NAFLD are most likely to progress to advanced fibrosis or
cirrhosis. This initial project focuses on the interaction between NAFLD and HCV in AN people. Better
understanding the interaction between NAFLD and HCV is crucial because they are the two most common types
of chronic liver disease in the U.S. and the two leading indicators for liver transplant. Furthermore, recent studies
suggest that NAFDL and HCV may have an additive or synergistic effect on liver injury."
10770979,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Effects of Sex on the Elastogenesis of Vascular Elastic Fibers
Elastic fibers and laminae are responsible for compliance and elastic recoil in many tissues, including arteries.
The production of mature elastic structures occurs during late fetal and early neonatal periods and is thought to
cease in adulthood. Though these structures are mechanically and chemically stable, long human lifespans
subject elastin to cyclic mechanical stress and proteolytic destruction that increase arterial stiffness and lead to
a myriad of cardiovascular events, including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, kidney disease, and peripheral
arterial disease, that are often delayed in women compared to men. Elastin regeneration could help avoid arterial
stiffening but has not been described in adult human tissues. Our recent analysis demonstrates that elastic fibers
in the external elastic lamina (EEL) of human femoropopliteal arteries (FPAs) often contain long breaks filled by
thinner continuous fibers that have a different pitch than the rest of the EEL. These breaks are present in both
young healthy arteries with no vascular pathology or inflammation, and in old diseased arteries. Elastic fibers
filling these breaks are autofluorescent, and stain positive for Verhoeff-Van Gieson and periodic acid-Schiff
stains, indicating the presence of an elastin core and a higher proportion of microfibrillar structure typical of a
newly synthesized fiber. In combination with animal model findings suggesting that pregnancy incites a burst in
elastic fiber synthesis in the vaginal tissue, these data allow hypothesizing that the production of continuous
vascular elastic fibers occurs in maturity and that the female sex has a positive effect on this process,
which may partially explain the sex-related vascular health disparities. To test this hypothesis, we will first
determine whether the elastic fibers filling EEL breaks in healthy arteries are newly synthesized or are
undergoing degradation using human FPAs from tissue donors and performing biaxial mechanical
characterization, constitutive modeling, multiphoton microscopy, histological/immunohistochemical analyses,
and mass spectrometry to compare the biomechanics, microstructure, and molecular characteristics of segments
with and without the breaks. Second, we will determine if women have a greater proportion of filled EEL breaks
than men using an existing histological biobank from >1,000 human FPAs available in the Tissue Analysis Core
(TAC). Statistical modeling and machine learning will help determine ethnic and risk factors contributing to filled
EEL breaks in women and men of different ages. This project will leverage the unique resource of human arteries
and TAC’s expertise to challenge the existing paradigm that the production of continuous elastic fibers does not
occur in maturity. It will determine if the elastin modification process is different in women than in men, which
could help explain the frequently delayed onset of vascular disorders in women. Proving or disproving this
hypothesis will open numerous research avenues to investigate either the mechanisms of functional
elastogenesis or elastic fiber degradation without inflammation, which can both be harnessed for the
development of novel therapies and drug-coated materials and devices to aid with vascular regeneration."
10768238,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
Recent epidemiologic evidence highlights the significant unmet behavioral health needs of cancer patients in the
United States. A strong evidence base now supports the use of digital health technologies to effectively extend
the reach and impact of the cancer clinician and to improve the quality of care. However, training in the integration
of these solutions into practice is essential to overcome barriers, ensure best practices, and successfully address
the top concerns of cancer patients with digital versions of long-proven treatments. The proposed R25 program
will train frontline cancer clinicians (physicians, advanced practice providers, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses,
and social workers) in the best-practice implementation of technology in cancer supportive care. Our overall goal
is to promote effective integration of evidence-based digital health and telehealth solutions with established
clinical interventions and care approaches for cancer-related fatigue, insomnia, pain, depression and anxiety.
We will achieve this goal through three specific aims: 1) To implement a multimodal training curriculum to educate
600 cancer clinicians in technology-augmented care. Training will be provided through online webinars, skills-
based workshops with both didactic and experiential learning, and post-workshop interactive online support both
directly from program faculty and also from a learning community of trainees’ peers and colleagues. 2) To
increase trainees’ ability to successfully implement and use digital health solutions in clinical practice. Trainees
will learn to evaluate digital health interventions in terms of their empirical foundations and clinical utility;
determine how to match interventions to specific populations; obtain and effectively use patient information from
digital devices (e.g., sleep quality, physical activity, vital signs) to enhance clinical outcomes; and address
challenges related to increased availability of patient data. 3) To assess the effectiveness of the training program.
Formative and summative annual and five-year evaluations will assess trainee knowledge gained, confidence in
technology implementation, and satisfaction with the overall program as well as its specific components. This
proposal is supported by the success of our four prior R25 initiatives and is responsive to a high level of interest
expressed by potential trainees, as identified through a recently-conducted needs assessment. In addition to
online offerings, in-person workshops will be offered in New York City, Denver, and Pasadena to facilitate trainee
attendance from across the United States. Program faculty are professionally, culturally, racially, and
geographically diverse, and trainees who are from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine will receive
priority access to program enrollment. CME credits will be provided for all eligible participants. To keep cost from
being a barrier to participation, support will be provided to trainees who report financial need with preference to
given to those underrepresented in medicine. To our knowledge, there are no other training programs that
address our mission."
10769047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The characterization of the full spectrum of genetic variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is
essential for genome research and precision medicine. Recent technological advances have led to substantially
improved sensitivity in detecting and characterizing structural variants (SVs) and the generation of highly
contiguous phased genomes; however, some genomic regions (e.g., short arms of acrocentric chromosomes,
pericentromeric regions and regions containing complex SVs) remain extremely difficult to accurately assemble
and genotype. The Investigators of this project are well qualified to tackle this problem. They have worked
together for well over a decade to make substantial advances toward comprehensive SV discovery and improved
genome assemblies by combining data from multiple technologies and developing new tools for analyzing and
integrating these data.
This competing renewal for a community resource has four aims. In Aim 1, computational methods will be
developed to optimize SV discovery through accurate genome assembly - in the absence of parental sequencing
data - and will be applied to 426 samples from all 26 diverse populations of the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP)
where long-read sequencing data are available from both the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium
(HGSVC) and Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) efforts. Aim 2 will develop pipelines that will
provide the most comprehensive, rapid and low-cost genotyping of SVs in short-read datasets. This will be made
possible from the incorporation of pooled Strand-seq data and inversions in 1000 individuals from the 1kGP. Aim
3 will develop pipelines and resources for SV imputation, genotyping, and functional characterization that can
be used for future association studies. Proof-of-principle studies will be conducted on the 1kGP, and an autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) cohort. Aim 4 will develop a fine-resolution SV resource containing precise breakpoint
information and biologically relevant annotations. New visualization and analytical tools will be built into the
International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR), making the data and tools acquired from this project widely
available and in a manner that preserves the complexities of SVs. As a part of Aim 4, we also outline a plan to
provide dedicated user training for our tools and datasets in different geographical locations and multiple times
a year to maximize research community awareness and adoption. Taken together, our community resource
project will provide valuable methods and tools for benchmarking SV discovery and genotyping across WGS
datasets in the human genomic research and clinical domains."

There is a marked gap between our ability to treat neurologic diseases and our rapidly increasing
understanding of normal nervous system function, disease pathogenesis, and disease pathophysiology.
Improving treatment of neurologic diseases requires considerably improved integration of burgeoning basic
neuroscience with clinical practice across the translational spectrum from basic discovery through translational
and clinical research. An obstacle to improved integration of disease-oriented neuroscience research activities
and more efficient translation is a deficit of appropriately trained clinician-neuroscientists. American medical
schools graduate significant numbers of physicians with substantial research experience, including MD/PhDs
and individuals with significant experience with and formal training in clinical research. The traditional clinical
training structure, however, impedes the ability of these talented and well-trained individuals to efficiently
initiate productive, independent research careers. We propose continuation of a residency-fellowship based
training program integrating residency-fellowship based clinical training with mentored research training to
move talented and experienced trainees in Neurology, Pediatric Neurology, Neurosurgery, and
Neuropathology to the initial stage of an independent career. The University of Michigan Clinical
Neuroscientist Training Program (UMCNTP) prepares talented clinician-neuroscientists for independent
research careers across the full spectrum of disease-oriented neuroscience research. The UMCNTP is an
integrated residency-fellowship program preparing talented early-career clinician-neuroscientists for
successful applications for initial independent career support. The UMCNTP melds productive mentored
research experience under the guidance of experienced senior investigators with focused didactic and handson
career training to prepare UMCNTP trainees for successful career development applications such as K08, K23,
VA CDA, or equivalents. Our residency programs matriculate talented individuals without significant prior
research experience. For those individuals, the UMCNTP offers an integrated residency-fellowship-PhD
training program in Neuroscience and other relevant disciplines. The UMCNTP features a strong roster of
mentors in the Depts. of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Pathology, and the Division of Pediatric Neurology,
access to other suitable mentors in the large University of Michigan Neuroscience community, a training
program based on highly successful prior experiences with training clinician-neuroscientists, and utilizes
excellent career development resources available at the University of Michigan."

The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic potential of cytokine therapy and vaccination to
restore/enhance function of anti-viral immunity that will lead to sustained viral remission following anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) interruption against HIV using the SIV/Rhesus macaque (RM) model. Dysfunctional anti-HIV immunity and
persistence of viral reservoirs represent two major obstacles that must be addressed to achieve sustained viral remission in
the absence of ART. ART is highly effective in controlling virus replication but does not significantly improve T cell
function and reduce viral reservoirs. It is clear that anti-viral CD8 T cells are critical for the control of HIV/SIV replication.
Similarly, recent studies have highlighted the role of NK cells in controlling HIV/SIV infections. The majority of HIV
replication occurs in secondary lymphoid organs and a significant fraction of viral reservoirs during ART are concentrated
in T follicular helper cells (Tfh) that reside in B cell follicles and germinal centers (GC). However, B cell follicles are
largely devoid of anti-viral CD8 T cells and NK cells during chronic HIV/SIV infection. Thus, novel therapies that
restore/enhance function of both anti-viral CD8 T cells and NK cells, and promote follicular homing of these cells will
significantly enhance clearance of viral reservoirs within lymphoid tissues there by contribute to sustained viral remission
following analytical ART interruption (ATI). Our preliminary data demonstrated that combination of IL-12 plus IL-15/IL-
15Ra treatment markedly enhances the magnitude, cytokine production and cytotoxic potential of SIV-specific CD8+ T and
NK cells that was markedly superior to either cytokine treatment in vitro. In addition, combination cytokine treatment during
chronic SHIV infection was safe and resulted in expansion of anti-viral CD8 T cells and NK cells with follicular homing
potential that was associated with viral control. Interestingly, the combination cytokine therapy, unlike IL-15 monotherapy,
did not induce proliferation of CD4 T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Given these highly encouraging results, here we propose
to comprehensively test the effects of IL-15 and IL-12 either alone or in combination on different T and NK cell subsets
during chronic SIV infection and ART (Aim 1), and investigate how these changes influence viral reservoirs under ART
and viral control after ART interruption (Aim 2). In addition, we will combine the optimal cytokine therapy with vaccination
to further enhance the magnitude and breadth of SIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses that we hope will further
improve the therapeutic benefit (Aim 3). These studies will advance our knowledge about how IL-15 and IL-12 cytokines
differentially influence the function of different subsets of T and NK cells during chronic SIV infection and ART, and what
immune mechanisms induced by cytokine therapy and vaccination contribute to control of chronic SIV/HIV infections."

10773099,"Regulation of Osteocyte Survival by Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling Pathways
Summary
 Osteocyte death, one of the hallmarks of skeletal aging, contributes to the age-related decline in bone strength
and the increase in age-related fractures. In addition to aging, many other factors also lead to osteocyte death,
including unloading, sex hormone deficiency, glucocorticoid excess, inflammation, and osteoarthritis. Although
osteocytes function as master regulators of bone remodeling, the underlying molecular mechanisms that sustain
osteocyte viability are poorly understood. Our studies aim to fill a gap in knowledge on endogenous factors that
maintain osteocyte viability and bone quality in adult bone, as this is paramount to maintaining bone health.
 This proposal examines a novel role for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signaling in the
maintenance of osteocyte viability and skeletal homeostasis. In a recent publication, we identified a novel
requirement for FGFR signaling for osteocyte survival. We showed that conditional knockout of FGFRs in mature
osteoblasts and osteocytes led to osteocyte death in juvenile (3-week-old) mice and secondarily, increased bone
mass as these mice aged. In a preliminary follow-up study, we temporally inactivated FGFRs in osteoblasts and
osteocytes in adult (12-week-old) mice to bypass any effects on developing or actively growing bone. This also
resulted in osteocyte death after several weeks and increased bone mass after several months. These
observations form the basis of our hypothesis that in mature adult bone, FGFR signaling is required for
maintaining osteocyte viability and bone homeostasis.
 Our proposed studies will address the mechanisms by which FGFR signaling maintains osteocyte viability
and skeletal homeostasis in adult mice. Using lineage tracing and anabolic loading we will determine whether
existing osteocytes vs newly formed osteocytes are sensitive to loss of FGFR signaling. In vivo analysis will
identify the primary mode of cell death and determine whether remodeling of the osteocyte lacunocanalicular
system is a cause or a consequence of loss of osteocyte viability. In vitro analysis of osteocyte cell lines will
determine if FGFR signaling pathways are required cell-autonomously for osteocyte viability.
 Our preliminary data also suggests potential clinically relevant circumstances for either gain- or loss-of-
function of FGFR signaling in bone. Two FDA approved FGFR inhibitors (Erdafitinib, Pemigatinib) have a median
treatment period of 5 months for cancer. Our studies suggest that prolonged treatment with FGFR inhibitors
could affect bone homeostasis. We will thus test the effects of Erdafitinib on osteocyte viability and biomechanical
properties of bone in adult and aged mice. Finally, we will determine whether activation of FGFR signaling in
mature osteoblasts and osteocytes is protective under conditions that promote osteocyte death.
 Completion of these studies will establish a role and identify mechanisms for FGFR signaling in the
maintenance of osteocyte viability and bone homeostasis in adults, they will evaluate potential adverse effects
of FGFR inhibition on bone, and will identify new genes that could be targeted to promote skeletal homeostasis."

The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) of our NC State SRP Center proposal is designed to integrate 
results from all data streams into a true synthesis that advances environmental and public health related to per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The first activity (Specific Aim) of the DMAC in establishing Center-wide 
data management and integration was the development of a Comprehensive Data Management Plan (cDMP). 
The cDMP was designed to instantiate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in 
managing Center data and was used for the coordinated development of individual project/core DMPs. A key 
element of our cDMP is the derivation of an ontology of data types, which recognizes that data have common 
elements that cross disciplinary (as well as project-specific) boundaries. This formalization of connections 
between nominally different data streams and assignment of individual points-of-contact for each type will 
establish the DMAC as a resource for operationalizing data integration. Subsequent DMAC Specific Aims 
establish processes for monitoring data analysis, coordinate analysis through shared data structures and 
associated software, provide means for visualization and sharing of results, and coordinate data-centric training 
activities. Thus, the DMAC will enable synthesis not possible from singular Projects/Cores alone, through 
coordination amongst projects and cores, fostering data sharing and interoperability, and providing formal data

Uncoupling protein 1/Ucp1-mediated adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue/BAT is essential for

since brown fat activity gradually declines with aging and metabolic diseases.
Our previous work identified a unique phenomenon that brown adipocyte-specific Lrpprc knockout mice can
trade off mitochondria-fueled Ucp1-dependent thermogenesis in BAT for systemic metabolic fitness. This

underlying mechanisms of the ATF4-driven thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Aim 2 will determine the

Immune checkpoint blocker therapy has recently greatly improved survival of patients with late- stage
melanoma. However, about 2/3 of patients do not benefit from this therapy. One of main hurdles is that many
melanoma tissues lack effector CD8+ T cells. The immature and dysfunctional blood vessels actively limit T
cell infiltration. Recently vascular normalization has been demonstrated to be able to facilitate effector immune
cell infiltration and to improve cancer immunotherapy. a novel pathway in the
IGFBP7/CD93 interaction, both of which are selectively upregulated in tumor vasculature. Our preliminary
study indicates that disrupting this interaction in vivo normalizes tumor vessels to reduce hypoxia and improve
tumor perfusion in mouse melanoma models. Our examination of tumor tissues reveals that blockade of this
pathway could reinvigorate tumor blood vessels to promote T cell infiltration while limit myeloid-derived
suppressor cells in the tumor. Here we hypothesize that upregulation of this pathway contributes to the tumor
vascular abnormality and targeting this pathway will offer a novel approach to facilitate melanoma
immunotherapy. We will dissect how this pathway is induced in the tumor and consequently leads to tumor
vascular dysfunction and then tumor outgrowth. The mechanisms by which CD93 regulates immune cell
infiltration, as well as its expression causing resistance to anti-PD1 therapy, will be evaluated. By the
completion of these studies, we will gain insight into the biological role of this pathway in the cancer
microenvironment of melanoma and, more importantly, provide a new strategy of promoting immunotherapy in
melanoma.

The biomedical workforce suffers from a lack of diversity among the research workforce: the number of
investigators from underrepresented backgrounds who enter academia is disproportionately low, and
subsequently, there is a high attrition rate among these investigators due to numerous significant challenges
related to being from an underrepresented group. Lack of diversity in biomedical research is harmful because
diversity improves the research community and our scientific output and because investigators from
underrepresented backgrounds are more likely to conduct research in diverse populations. Thus, recruiting
and retaining underrepresented investigators is critical to achieving equity in biomedical research and clinical
care. Two key factors that improve retention and career advancement for investigators from underrepresented
backgrounds are the availability of faculty role models with similar backgrounds and access to robust
mentorship. This award aims to provide such mentorship and role modeling through a comprehensive
mentoring and career development program: the MPIs, Drs. Stanford and Stanley are physician-scientist
colleagues with multiple previous and existing collaborations who have expertise in mentorship and promoting
diversity. They will lead a comprehensive program that achieves three aims for underrepresented scholars: (1)
providing comprehensive, multi-level mentoring that includes both robust faculty mentorship and peer and
near-peer mentorship; (2) providing guidance and skill-building for research advancement, including
preparation of R01 or equivalent grant applications at the end of the mentoring experience; and (3) preparing
scholars to be mentors and academic leaders. Critical components of the program include monthly peer-
mentoring meetings, monthly individual meetings with one of the MPIs, quarterly meetings with a near-peer
mentor, participation in a curriculum with multiple faculty speakers that ensures the skills required for grant
writing, scientific communication, and academic advancement, and participation in the larger group of scholars
supported by this grant mechanism. During the 2–3-year mentoring experience, scholars will gain a supportive
group of peers, close mentoring relationships with the MPIs and a near-peer mentor; skills to overcome the
many challenges of academia, including those unique to investigators from underrepresented backgrounds;
skills in grant and manuscript writing through both groups and individually mentored activities; skills in
mentoring and leadership; and a vision and strategy for moving forward in their careers. This proposal serves
the mission of NIDDK by supporting and promoting scholars from underrepresented backgrounds who are
already NIDDK funded, substantially increasing the chances of their retention and success in the biomedical
workforce."

significant morbidity and mortality. Several scientific advances have the promise to accelerate CKD research,
but many of these advances are not accessible to the kidney research community due to limited expertise
and/or the need for expensive equipment. Thus, this NRC will address the fundamental challenge of providing
better access to cutting-edge techniques in single cell omics, genetics, and metabolism to the kidney research
community to facilitate advances in CKD research. Dr. Ben Humphreys is the overall program director, and this
Center will consist of four Cores: an Administrative Core, two Biomedical Resource Cores, and a Resource
Development Core. The Administrative Core will oversee distribution of funds across the Cores, communicate
with the National O’Brien Consortium, manage the Summer Student Enrichment Program, and promote the
involvement of early stage investigators and a diverse workforce. The Variant Validation Core, one of the
Biomedical Resource Cores, investigates the pathogenicity of genetic variants of uncertain significance using
CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing, in silico approaches, and tailored in vitro assays. The Metabolism Core, the other
Biomedical Resource Core, provides consultation for users and access to a number of metabolic assays to
interrogate changes in kidney metabolism relevant to CKD. These assays include Seahorse bioflux analysis,
radioactive substrate oxidation assays of tissue ex vivo, untargeted metabolomics, and stable isotope tracer
studies. The Metabolism Core will also work with the O’Brien Consortium to provide validated protocols for
assays commonly performed (e.g. Seahorse assays on primary cells) and provide hands’ on training using
these protocols. The Single Cell Omics Research Evolution (SCORE) Core is the Resource Development
Core, which develops protocols and bioinformatics pipelines for cutting-edge techniques like split pool
barcoding for single nuclei multi-omics and high resolution in-situ sequencing-based spatially resolved

accomplished through the personnel and equipment that comprise this core. Core D will assist PPG investigators
with routine optical imaging and image analysis of slides, as well as more sophisticated analysis such as co-
localization, deconvolution and 3-D reconstruction. Time-lapse imaging of living, cultured cells; dynamic, real-
time imaging of intracellular Ca2+ and intravital microscopy also will be accomplished in Core D. By centralizing
core techniques, Core D will enable cost efficiency because a portion of technical help and laboratory
facilities/equipment will be provided, avoiding a duplication of efforts and expenditure of money by the
investigators. In addition, by providing services, training and development for all Project personnel, Core D will
provide PPG investigators with a degree of quality-control, rigor, and reproducibility in experiments as well as
additional time with which PPG investigators can follow scientific pursuits."

Cardiomyopathies are the most common genetic cardiovascular disease worldwide. The presence of cardiac
troponin variants accounts for at least 15% of all familial cardiomyopathy cases. Cardiac muscle contraction is
regulated by free intracellular Ca2+ concentration via two thin filament regulatory proteins – tropomyosin and
troponin complex. Ca2+ binding to troponin displaces tropomyosin from myosin-binding sites and allows formation
of myosin cross-bridges, which on their own contribute to thin filament activation. Troponin complex is composed
of Ca2+ sensing troponin C, actin-binding troponin I, and Tm-bound troponin T. For decades, the helical approach
to electron microscopy reconstruction of the thin filament eliminated information on the structure of the Tn
complex. Hence, the complex interactions among components of the thin filament remained unknown. We
developed cryo-EM non-helical algorithm to the reconstruction of native cardiac thin filaments to reveal the
structure of the whole troponin complex at physiological Ca2+ levels. We show that the thin filament is comprised
of an array of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound non-equivalent troponin complexes with short-range cooperativity
between adjacent units. Troponin variants associated with inherited cardiomyopathies affect thin filament Ca2+-
dependent activation. We hypothesize that: (1) dilated (DCM) or hypertrophic (HCM) cardiomyopathy variants in
troponin affect thin filament regulation by: (a) altering the equilibrium between Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound troponin
complexes via conformational changes in Ca2+-sensing troponin C unit; and/or (b) altering the distribution of
Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound troponin complexes by changing communication between the adjacent troponins
along and across the thin filament. To test our hypothesis we chose 4 strategically located mutations. In Aim 1
we will utilize pathogenic variants in troponin C located in distal parts of Ca2+-sensing troponin N-lobe to evaluate
how they affect the equilibrium between Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound troponin complexes, and if they affect
communication between troponin units that may curb activating effect of rigor myosin-S1. In Aim 2 we will focus
on highly penetrant pathogenic variants in troponin T located in N-terminus of troponin T, which stabilizes the
interaction between tropomyosin cables belonging to adjacent troponin units. We will evaluate how these
mutations affect the communication between neighboring troponins and activation by myosin-S1. To reveal how
distal parts of the troponin complex (Ca2+ sensing troponin C and N-terminus of troponin T) communicate, we
will use a Ca2+ sensitizer, which binds to troponin C to revert effects of a troponin T variant. Our multidisciplinary,
multi-PI approach with collective expertise in structural, functional and computational methods will reveal how
the complex interactions between components of the thin filament make heartbeats possible. Successful
execution of the aims may set the ground for the development of tailored therapies that could potentially modulate
the structure of the thin filament to treat various forms of heart disease."

Formaldehyde is a known environmental and occupational chemical carcinogen. The molecular mechanisms of
formaldehyde-induced carcinogenesis are largely undetermined. The DNA damage and associated
mutagenesis induced by DNA adducts and DNA-protein crosslinks have been the focus of formaldehyde
carcinogenicity research. However, recent studies showed that exogenous formaldehyde caused only a
modest increase in DNA adducts above levels caused by endogenous formaldehyde. This suggested the
possibility that epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to formaldehyde-induced carcinogenicity. We and
others have demonstrated that formaldehyde reacts with lysine residues on histone proteins to form a labile
Schiff base or the more stable N6-formyllysine, and that both Schiff bases and N6-formyllysine residues are
refractory to acetylation. These findings indicated that formaldehyde-histone lysine adducts might interfere with
important cellular process regulated by histone lysine acetylation. However, it remains unknown which process
is affected by this mechanism. Our preliminary data from cellular fractionation analyses demonstrate that
formaldehyde exposure dramatically decreases lysine acetylations of the cytosolic histones H3 and H4. This
finding is very intriguing, given that these modifications are critical for histone nuclear import and chromatin
assembly. Our preliminary results further show that formaldehyde reduces the total amount of histone in the
chromatin fraction and the levels of histones at genomic loci, suggesting inhibition of chromatin assembly.
Defective chromatin assembly causes dysregulation of gene expression and genomic instability and was
directly linked to different types of cancers. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the formation of
formaldehyde-histone adducts compromises histone nuclear import and/or chromatin assembly, thereby
contributing to formaldehyde-induced carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will examine
whether the nuclear import of newly synthesized histones and their assembly into chromatin are compromised
following formaldehyde exposure and determine the underlying mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will determine the
impact of aberrant chromatin assembly on formaldehyde-induced changes in gene expression, formation of
DNA adducts and DNA-protein crosslinks, and chromosome instability. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether
formaldehyde exposure compromises chromatin assembly in vivo. The proposed concept that a chemical
carcinogen reacts with newly synthesized histones to regulate chromatin assembly is novel. This study has the
potential to reveal a new mechanism for chemical carcinogenesis."

Zimbabwe is a resource-constrained country with a high burden of HIV and cervical cancer (CXCA).
Zimbabwean women with CXCA present with advanced disease and two-thirds die within a year of diagnosis.
CXCA screening has low coverage (13%), and is conducted largely through visual inspection with acetic acid
(VIA), with plans to migrate to human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. Precancer
treatment is mostly cryotherapy or thermal ablation but is only accessed by 53% of women screen positive. To
meet the WHO 2030 target of eliminating CXCA by 2120, Zimbabwe needs new interventions that are
acceptable, affordable, point-of-care, scalable, and clinically proven. To optimize CXCA screening and the pre-
cancer treatment cascade for women living with HIV (WLWH), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
and the University of Zimbabwe–Clinical Trials Research Centre (CTRC), in collaboration with local PEPFAR-
funded implementation partners Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development (OPHID) and
the Zimbabwe Technical Assistance, Training and Education Center for Health (Zim-TTECH) (collectively,
ZIM-CASCADE) propose to serve as a LMIC CASCADE UG1 Clinical Site. ZIM-CASCADE draws on
extensive experience in conducting clinical research and CXCA screening and treatment among WLWH, with
access to 95,000 WLWH, of whom >44,000 are currently receiving comprehensive CXCA screening and
treatment through the OPHID and Zim-TTECH programs located in Zimbabwe’s high-density population
centers of Harare and Chitungwiza. ZIM-CASCADE will be led by 2 gynecological oncologists with globally
recognized expertise in CXCA screening and treatment and will utilize research personnel and infrastructure
from dedicated clinical research sites and community-based primary care clinics, whose experience has been
developed over nearly 3 decades of continuous research activities. ZIM-CASCADE will participate in all 4
scientific focus areas of the CASCADE Network, and will complete the following Specific Aims: (1) Provide
insight as to clinical significance and feasibility of planned trials by drawing on extensive clinical expertise in
CXCA prevention among WLWH; (2) Utilize the expansive pluripotent infrastructure and research management
systems developed over 28 years to conduct high quality pragmatic clinical trials; (3) Accrue and retain eligible
WLWH through effective and equitable engagement with community partners; and (4) Ensure compliance with
all protocol procedures and applicable research regulations. Completion of the Aims will contribute critical
evidence to inform optimization, implementation, and scale-up of effective cervical cancer prevention
interventions for WLWH in resource-limited settings, and the multi-modal CASCADE data will inform public
health policy in Zimbabwe and globally."

 Targeted proteolysis is essential for regulating meiosis, the specialized program that produces haploid
gametes from diploid progenitor cells. Although the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in meiosis has
been well-described, the potential of autophagy to mediate distinct steps during the meiotic divisions
remains unexplored.
 My laboratory recently made the novel discovery that autophagy, a conserved pathway to lysosomal
degradation, is essential for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation and meiosis completion in budding
yeast. We further identified a major target of this meiotic autophagy activity — Rim4, a meiosis-specific RNA
binding protein (RBP) that adapts an amyloid-like state and sequesters mRNAs encoding specific proteins
involved in meiotic regulation, chromosome segregation and sporulation (cytokinesis). Importantly, during
meiotic and early embryotic cell development, gene expression is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally
using maternal mRNAs that are selectively bound by RBPs. The temporal translation of meiotic proteins,
which control meiotic cell progression, is regulated by these RBPs through largely unknown and varied
mechanisms [10]. Our finding reveals a novel link between autophagy and meiotic translation. In
addition, we discovered that autophagy degrades a set of proteins that are associated with spindle pole body
(SPB, the yeast centrosome) structure and function, which is essential for both meiosis and sporulation. We
propose that autophagic degradation of specific proteins, e.g. Rim4 amyloid-like aggregates, Spc42
and Spo74, at multiple meiotic stages contributes to meiosis-programed translational control and
meiosis-coupled SPB dynamics. These novel roles of selective autophagy converge to coordinate meiosis
and sporulation.
 The major goals of this proposal are (1) to mechanistically dissect how autophagy regulates Rim4
degradation and what effects this has on meiotic gene expression of Rim4 mRNA targets; and (2) to reveal the
role of meiotic autophagy in restraining the number of SPB per cell. Such understanding will reveal new principles
underlying mRNA-specific translational control and meiotic regulation and, if autophagy is involved in human
meiosis as well, inform strategies for prevention of chromosomal disorders, e.g. Turner syndrome (monosomy
X, frequency: 1/2,500 newborn girls) [11] and Down syndrome (trisomy 21, frequency: 1/800 newborns) [12].
This study will also shed light on the design of therapeutics to clear deleterious amyloid-like aggregates
associated with neurodegeneration (e.g. amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease). This grant proposes to: (1)
Elucidate how autophagy promotes Rim4 degradation to regulate meiotic translation; and (2) Investigate
how autophagy regulates yeast centrosome dynamics during meiosis."

Dyslipidemia and insulin resistance predispose individuals to development of diabetes, cancer, myocardial
infarction, and stroke. A large body of evidence suggests that a class of toxic lipids, termed ceramides,
contribute to these metabolic impairments and the ensuing development of these metabolic disorders.
Understanding the role of these lipids in the events that drive metabolic diseases holds great promise for
developing new therapies to treat these debilitating conditions. We conducted a series of studies ablating the
enzymes required for their production in different body locales to discern which tissues were most sensitive to
ceramides. These studies revealed that the lipid has strong and unanticipated effects in adipose tissue. In
particular, whole-body, adipose and brown adipose tissue-specific inhibition/deletion of serine
palmitoyltransferase (Sptlc), the first enzyme in the enzymatic cascade that drives sphingolipid biosynthesis, in
mice markedly altered adipose morphology and metabolism, particularly in subcutaneous and brown adipose
tissue. We subsequently excised another gene in the pathway (i.d. dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (Degs1)) from
adipose tissue, determining that it elicited a similar spectrum of metabolic improvements. These data indicate
that ceramides serve as signals of nutrient excess that alter the metabolic activity of mature adipocytes and
subsequently the entire organism. Using microarray screens, we sought to identify ceramide-regulated genes in
adipose tissue. The candidate obesity gene Fgf13 was one of the only two transcripts that met the following
criteria: (a) increased in mouse subcutaneous white adipose (sWAT) and epididymal white adipose (eWAT) after
high fat feeding (HFD); (b) decreased in these depots when the mice were treated with the SPT inhibitor myriocin;
(c) decreased in these depots following WAT-specific Sptlc2 depletion; and, (d) decreased in primary adipocytes
following myriocin treatment in vitro. We then investigated the function of this protein in vitro and in vivo.
Preliminary data using knockdown or knockout approaches suggested that Fgf13 had cell-autonomous,
adipocyte-specific, diet-regulated effects on mitochondrial function and thermogenesis. Moreover, mice lacking
Fgf13 in adipocytes were resistant to obesity. These data support our hypothesis that FGF13 is a ceramide
effector that controls the metabolic activity of mature adipocytes. We will test this idea with the following Specific
Aims: 1] to determine the role of FGF13 as a modulator of adipose tissue metabolism and thermogenesis in
vivo; 2] to determine the molecular mechanisms linking FGF13 to adipocyte metabolism; and 3] to determine
the molecular mechanisms by which b-adrenergic agonists regulate ceramide production and FGF13 expression
in primary adipocytes. The findings obtained from these studies could reveal a novel ceramide effector that
influences metabolic rate."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The overall 5-year
survival of patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 18%, and outcomes for advanced stage patients treated with
standard chemotherapies have plateaued. Recent discoveries of genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine
kinases such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) have led to development of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors as lung cancer therapies. However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibitors is currently a major
problem in the clinic, making development of novel therapies for lung cancer imperative. Histone modifications,
including lysine acetylation, play crucial roles in transcriptional activation and elongation, gene silencing and
epigenetic cellular memory, and aberrant epigenetic changes are associated with oncogenesis. Among
epigenetic modifiers, aberrant activity of several lysine (K) acetyltransferases (KATs) is implicated in cancer
development. To assess the function of one of those acetyltransferases (KAT5) in lung cancer, we generated
conditional Kat5 knockout mice and found that lung-specific Kat5 deletion suppressed tumor formation induced
by EGFR-L858R-T790M. We also showed that mutant EGFR bound to and tyrosine-phosphorylated KAT5 at
two tyrosine residues in the catalytic domain, increasing its acetyltransferase activity. Thus, we hypothesize
that KAT5 is required for lung tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic kinases such as EGFR mutants. In Aim 1,
we will investigate how KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation increases its acetylase activity and whether oncogenic
kinases such as mutant EGFR induce KAT5 activation in lung cancer. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether
KAT5 regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for lung tumorigenesis by activating EGFR mutations.
In addition, we will identify KAT5 effectors potentially responsible for tumorigenesis using biochemical analysis
plus a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. In Aim 3, we will ask
whether KAT5 is required for tumor initiation, maintenance of established lung tumors, or both, using
transgenic mouse models. Aim 3 also addresses a potential function for KAT5 in proliferation and self-renewal
in lung cancer stem/initiating cells. Experiments proposed here should lead to development of novel epigenetic
therapies and significantly impact care of patients with lung cancer, particularly those with unfavorable
prognosis, in the near future."

Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by fungi have the highest morbidity and

(Cn), Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp., Mucor, Coccidioides spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum
are the most common cause of fungal brain infections resulting in a chronic instead of an acute
or subacute meningoencephalitis. The long-term goal will investigate the spatio-temporal
organization and molecular basis of Cn trafficking across the BBB and investigate a cross-talk
between a transcellular mechanism and the opening of a paracellular path in response to Cn
infection. Given our preliminary data and published studies, we propose that Cn represents an
excellent model pathogen with which to determine the mechanisms that pathogenic fungi use to
breach the BBB and enter the CNS. In our efforts to understand the molecular basis mediating
the Cn-brain endothelium interactions, we identified a tyrosine kinase receptor (EphA2-TKR) as
the central player. The central hypothesis states that fungal cells penetrate the BBB by engaging
EphA2-TKR in order to access a binary path into the CNS. To test our hypothesis, we will
investigate the interplay between fungal cells, EphA2-TRK and its downstream signaling
components in mediating the translocation of Cn from blood-to-brain. The following specific aims
will test the hypothesis: SA1 will investigate a Cn-induced CD44-mediated transactivation of
EphA2-TKR activity and the interactome of EphA2-TKR. SA2 will examine the role of EphA2-TKR
in upregulating vesicular traffic of Cn and resolve whether Cn-induced activity of EphA2-TKR
promotes a co-regulation of a transcellular and paracellular pathway. SA3 will resolve the
contribution of EphA2-TKR activity to the translocation of Cn from blood-to-brain in vivo and
examine the molecular basis of changes in the permeability of the BBB when challenged by Cn.
The proposed research is innovative because it will for the first time, detail the key players that
promote the internalization and trafficking of fungi across the BBB. The innovation extends to our
published studies that identified EphA2-TKR in the brain endothelium as a central element in
mediating the migration Cn from blood-to-brain. This along with the notion that crossing of the
BBB is initiated by a fungal-induced CD44-transactivation of EphA2-TKR to trigger a pathological
use of endocytosis (and possibly a secondary paracellular path) in brain endothelial cells is a
paradigm shift from our current understanding. We have proposed experiments that will use
multiple complementary approaches to tease apart the molecular interaction between Cn, EphA2-
TKR and CD44 while also using proximity-dependent labeling to identify the interactome of
EphA2-TKR. The knowledge gained from our studies will make a significant contribution to fungal
pathogenesis of the CNS, because it remains significantly understudied, and this work will
spearhead the development of molecules that could block fungal entry and thus serve as pre-
emptive or prophylactic therapy in patients at risk for developing fungal meningoencephalitis."

This proposal focuses on the fundamental question of how neuronal growth cones are guided to their targets. It
has long been established that growth cone navigation depends on regulated changes in both F-actin and
microtubule (MT) dynamics in response to guidance cues. However, the mechanisms by which these cues
bring about specific changes in growth cone MT dynamics are unresolved. This proposal takes aim at that
void, by investigating the function of the MT polymerase and ‘plus-end tracking protein’ (+TIP), XMAP215,
along with its regulatory mechanisms. Our recently published data identified an ability for XMAP215 to bind
directly to F-actin and promote MT extension into the growth cone. This is complemented by unpublished data
that kinase signaling modulates the ability of XMAP215 to promote MT-F-actin interaction. Our data support a
model in which XMAP215 mediates MT-F-actin coupling through structural domains distinct from those
regulating MT polymerization, and that XMAP215 converts signals from upstream guidance cues into changes
in cytoskeletal coordination, ultimately directing growth cone motility. We will test this in Xenopus laevis using
an array of complementary cell-based and biochemical approaches. The specific aims are: Aim 1 – Identify the
mechanism by which XMAP215 interacts with F-actin in vitro. We will determine the specific domain of
XMAP215 that binds to F-actin as well as identify how the binding is regulated. We will produce a variety of
deletion and phosphomutant XMAP215 proteins, and we will use a series of biochemical techniques including
F-actin/MT co-sedimentation binding assays, multi-wavelength TIRF microscopy with in vitro cytoskeletal
reconstitution assays, mass spectrometry, as well as EM experiments, to dissect the mechanism by which
XMAP215 binds to F-actin in vitro. Aim 2 - Determine how regulation of XMAP215 interaction with F-actin
modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and growth cone behaviors in cultured neurons. We will use structured
illumination microscopy (SIM), spinning disk confocal microscopy, and quantitative imaging analysis of +TIP
dynamics in cultured neurons, after expressing various XMAP215 mutants, to uncover new mechanistic
insights into how XMAP215 regulates MT-F-actin interactions in growth cones during axon outgrowth. Aim 3 -
Define how XMAP215 interaction with F-actin contributes to accurate axon guidance. We have discovered that
normal XMAP215 levels are required for cultured growth cones to be repelled from the axon guidance cue,
Slit2. We will use a combination of ex vivo and in vivo axon guidance assays to determine how growth cone
steering is impacted by the ability of XMAP215 to facilitate MT-F-actin interactions. The results of these Aims
will reveal the direct links between guidance cue signaling, kinase regulation of the only well-characterized MT
polymerase (XMAP215), and cytoskeletal coordination, within the context of growth cone steering. As such,
this proposed work has the potential to bring a long-needed mechanistic understanding to the question of how
extracellular cues govern cytoskeletal dynamics to effectively steer growth cones during neurodevelopment."

Age-related dysfunction of cerebral blood flow regulation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of
brain aging and likely renders the aging brain more susceptible to the damaging effects of comorbid conditions,
such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Impairments in two key mechanisms that regulate
cerebral blood flow at the local and systemic level (i.e., cerebral autoregulation and baroreflex sensitivity,
respectively) may promote cerebral hypoperfusion in the course of normal activities of daily living, thereby
setting the stage for repeated ischemic insults, progressive cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (ADRD). Thus, measuring cerebral autoregulation and baroreflex sensitivity may provide
early biomarkers of neurodegeneration in ADRD studies, particularly those focused on prevention. The U.S.
study to PrOtect brain health through lifestyle INTErvention to Reduce risk (U.S. POINTER) is an ongoing
multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to investigate whether randomization to one of two lifestyle
interventions that differ in format and intensity alters cognitive trajectory over 2 years in 2,000 older adults aged
60-79 years who are cognitively normal but at increased risk for dementia due to first degree family history of
significant memory impairment, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and suboptimum cardiometabolic health. The
proposed ancillary study POINTER-NV will comprehensively assess autonomic function, cerebral
autoregulation, and vascular structure and function by evaluating aortic, carotid, and cerebral hemodynamics
using complementary techniques (i.e., ultrasound, tonometry, and continuous blood pressure and heart rate
monitoring) under a variety of conditions (i.e., at rest, during orthostatic stress, and during carbon dioxide
inhalation). These neurovascular outcomes will be assessed at baseline, Year 1, and Year 2 in 500 POINTER
participants across 5 clinical sites (~100 per site; 250 per intervention arm). The primary aim is to assess the
effects of the POINTER lifestyle intervention on cerebral autoregulation and baroreflex sensitivity; we will also
assess intervention effects on aortic stiffness, carotid stiffness, and cerebral vasomotor reactivity. In addition,
POINTER-NV will examine whether these neurovascular outcomes are associated with cognition (assessed
every 6 months as part of the parent trial) and brain structure and function (assessed every 1-2 years as part of
a Brain Imaging ancillary study). By leveraging the rich resources and infrastructure of U.S. POINTER, this
innovative and cost-effective ancillary study presents an unprecedented and time-limited opportunity to expand
the scope and impact of the parent trial and address key research priorities in the field."

program. It is based on the concept that an in-depth mentored research experience, along with enrichment
activities that help develop identity as a scientist, is the optimal preparation for graduate studies in the
biomedical sciences. The background and research interests of each participant are considered when
selecting Mentors who have outstanding records of promoting the training, education, and career advancement
of biomedical scientists, for one year of laboratory-based research. The research experience is complemented
by a multi-tiered skill-enhancement program for improving oral and written communication, critical thinking and

numerous workshops, a writing course, an Ethics course, an RCR course, academic courses, and other skill-
building activities. Although the Program is highly structured and logically organized, it is flexible in that an
Individual Development Plan (IDP) serves as the roadmap for each Scholar's course over their tenure in the
University of Chicago PREP. The Program and its components are assessed at specific intervals throughout
the year, including both internal and external evaluations. The ultimate success is measured by the

Background. Buprenorphine (BUP) is an effective medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) but dropout rates
are high during the stabilization phase (months 1-3). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in
individuals with OUD and makes retention in treatment even more challenging because of hyperarousal and
intense negative affect that greatly increase risk for urges to “self-medicate”. Transcutaneous auricular
neurostimulation (tAN) of the vagus nerve has shown promise for alleviating symptoms of PTSD and opioid
withdrawal symptoms (OWS) but its effects have yet to be tested in a sample starting BUP therapy with these
co-occurring concerns.
Aims. We will conduct an open-label trial (Aim 1; 2-year UG3; N = 20) of the Sparrow Ascent System—a
patient-administered, ear worn device that delivers electrical stimulation to branches of the vagus and
trigeminal nerves—to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability, and feasibility of tAN for patients with co-occurring
PTSD/OUD in the context of BUP initiation. We anticipate that more than 50% of the sample will be retained in
BUP. Using data from the UG3 study, we will complete FDA pre-submission for the proposed UH3 study to
support a PTSD/OUD indication for Sparrow (Aim 2). Then, we will conduct a randomized, intent-to-treat,
sham-controlled Phase II clinical trial (Aim 3; 3-year UH3; N = 60) testing the effects of tAN on BUP retention
among PTSD/OUD patients to obtain realistic estimates of tAN’s effect size and inform development of a
subsequent full-scale clinical trial. We anticipate that active tAN will improve BUP retention relative to sham.
Methods. For both studies, we will recruit patients initiating BUP treatment in a community-based clinic and
confirm their PTSD/OUD diagnostic status using gold-standard measures. Patients will begin using the
Sparrow Ascent device within one week of BUP induction. Participants in the open-label (UG3) study and
active tAN (UH3) conditions will receive therapeutic stimulation from Sparrow; those in the sham condition
(UH3) will not. During the open-label trial, we will collect self- and provider-reported tolerability and feasibility
data. For both studies, we will obtain self-reported and UDS-confirmed substance use, BUP and Sparrow
compliance, and self-reported PTSD and OWS severity at weekly research visits over the 3-month active study
period.
Outcomes. The primary outcome in the UG3 and UH3 studies will be 3-month BUP retention (retained/not
retained) as defined by current BUP prescription at the time of data extraction. Key secondary outcomes for
the UG3 trial include the acceptability, tolerability, and feasibility of the Sparrow device as an adjunct
intervention alleviating symptoms of PTSD and OWS for patients initiating BUP. Key secondary outcomes for
the randomized Phase II clinical trial will include weekly substance use with timeline follow-back and UDS
results, PTSD symptom severity, opioid withdrawal and craving, and quality of life."
10778455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The loss of endogenous tumor suppressors is an obligatory step in tumor onset and progression, but the
underlying mechanisms are elusive and the breadth of their targets mostly unknown. We have now discovered
that Parkin, a mitochondria-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase biallelically altered in early-onset Parkinson’s
Disease, functions as a novel, dual mode tumor suppressor. This involves inhibition of intrinsic tumor traits of
cell motility and metabolism but also reprogramming of an antitumor immune microenvironment. In this
pathway, Parkin recruitment to mitochondria “primes” immunogenic cell death, controls the release of Damage-
Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), and activates kinase cascades for transcription of interferon genes and
inflammatory cytokines, independently of mitophagy. The result is enhanced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T
cells, reduced myeloid immunosuppression, and inhibition of primary and metastatic tumor growth. Because
Parkin is epigenetically silenced in all human cancers, dual mode tumor suppression is a universal barrier
against malignancy. Therefore, the hypothesis that Parkin tumor suppression bridges mitochondrial
activation of interferon signaling to immune reprogramming of the microenvironment can be
formulated and will constitute the focus of the present application. Three complementary and
multidisciplinary specific aims will elucidate the role of Parkin innate immunity in tumor suppression. In the first
specific aim, we will characterize how Parkin “primes” immunogenic cell death, elucidate the role of ER stress
and autophagy in mitochondrial necroptosis, and map the cellular and biochemical requirements of DAMP
release. The second specific aim will dissect the signaling requirements of Parkin activation of innate immunity
with respect to cytosolic cGAS-STING and inflammasome activation, mitochondrial RIG-I-MAVS sensing and
assembly of a STAT1-regulated ISGF3 transcriptional complex for T cell activation and dendritic cell function.
In the third specific aim, we will test the impact of Parkin innate immunity in preclinical orthotopic and
transgenic models of primary and metastatic tumor growth, in vivo, modulation of antitumor vaccination
strategies, and differential sensitivity to conventional and immune therapies. The application builds on
expansive preliminary data, a novel concept of dual mode Parkin tumor suppression, and the redirection of
mitochondrial innate immunity, previously known in viral infections, for antitumor responses. The results may
be practice changing. As proposed here, the elucidation of Parkin innate immunity will identify new strategies
to restore an antitumor immune microenvironment, dampen myeloid immunosuppression and enable broader,
more durable patient responses to conventional and immune therapy, including in late-stage disease."
10782470,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that costs the US healthcare system US$5 billion annually. It primarily affects preterm infants and there are no effective targeted strategies for prevention or treatment. The pathogenesis remains poorly understood but prematurity is the most significant risk factor and an altered microbiota and premature immune response are important in the pathogenesis. The risk for prematurity increases in babies born to mothers whom are obese/overweight (50% of childbearing age women in the US), and our maternal high fat diet model (mHFD) results in increased susceptibility to NEC mediated by altered bacterial colonization and innate immunity. Our objective is to utilize this model to unravel how mHFD alters neonatal colonization and immunity to increase susceptibility to NEC. This proposal utilizes a novel murine mHFD model, now established in our lab. We have recently shown with this model that mHFD exposure results a unique post-natal colonization pattern (microbiota) in offspring. This altered microbiota subsequently increases inflammatory type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), resulting in increased susceptibility to NEC-like injury. We have preliminary data that strongly suggests that exposure to bacteria-dependent ligands in-utero that signal via toll-like receptors (TLR) are responsible for the altered microbiota in mHFD offspring. In addition, introduction of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) ligand-producing bacteria (L. murinus) expands these ILC3 in neonatal offspring. L. murinus is specifically increased in mHFD offspring. We therefore hypothesize that exposure to mHFD results in altered in utero TLR signaling and subsequent post-natal colonization with Ahr-ligand producing bacteria that expand ILC3, resulting in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation in offspring. To test this, we have 2 specific aims: (1) Determine how in utero TLR-mediated signaling regulates mHFD alteration of post-natal colonization in offspring and (2) Determine how ligands of mHFD microbiota modulate Ahr signaling to educate ILC3 in offspring. We will test specific aim 1 by utilizing germ-free mice, conditional MyD88 knock-out mice (no TLR signaling via MyD88) and specific TLR deficient mice placed on mHFD. Specific aim 2 will be examined utilizing in vivo and in vitro (sort-purified ILC3 and intestinal explants) introduction of known Ahr ligands and antagonists. Adoptive transfer experiments will also be performed with pre-treated ILC3s in neonatal mice exposed to our NEC model. At the completion of these studies, we will dramatically advance our knowledge of how maternal nutrition affects post-natal colonization in offspring and further identify generalizable and novel in-utero and post-natal approaches to altering the microbiota in neonates and modulating ILC3 function to prevent NEC."

Different cell types, each with unique composition, properties, and functions, are essential to
sustain life in an organism. Bulk analysis of such heterogeneous mixtures of cells does not
distinguish the characteristics of a given cell type or differences between cells within the same
type, missing information that is key to understanding molecular mechanisms foundational to
the rational design of therapies for disease and ailments. The goal of this proposal is to develop
single-cell and imaging methods using metal-bearing probes to monitor metabolic processes in
live cells such as siRNA delivery, protein synthesis, and post-translational modification. The
cells will then be fixed and processed for subsequent detection of protein and mRNA markers.
There are three aims: (1) Delivering molecular probes to viable cells to explore molecular
pathways in single cells by CyTOF. (2) Barcoding prenylation probes to explore molecular
pathways in mixed samples of single cells. (3) Exploring the effect of aging in murine primary
cells by CyTOF and murine tissue by MIBI-ToF. The proposed work will expand the use of multi-
parametric capabilities of mass cytometry (i.e. cytometry by time-of-flight, CyTOF, and
multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight, MIBI-ToF) in the biotechnological and
biomedical fields. The development of these methodologies will explore the causal relationship
between autophagy and senescence in murine liver models, exploring the hypothesis that the
mevalonate pathway provides a link between the two. The ultimate goal is to understand the
relationship between autophagy, mevalonate, and senescence pathways in aging and inform
emerging treatments to counteract the detrimental effects of senescent cells."
10930954,"Abstract
People with disabilities (PWD) are an overlooked health disparity population who routinely experience
stigma, discrimination, ableism, and lower socioeconomic status. Barriers to health care are generally high for
PWD, and despite over three decades of the Americans with Disabilities Act, many health care settings
including addiction treatment are not fully accessible for PWD. Recent studies have found that PWD abstain
from alcohol more frequently than people without disabilities (PWoD); however, among current drinkers, PWD
have elevated rates of at-risk alcohol use. Furthermore, PWD have greater risk for addiction, given
higher rates of mental and physical health comorbidities, social isolation, trauma history and adverse social
determinants of health. Despite this constellation of risk factors, very little is known about risk for alcohol use
disorder (AUD) or alcohol-related morbidity or consequences among PWD, or whether disparities exist for
PWD in accessing or engaging in AUD treatment compared to PWoD. We will use rigorous quasi-experimental
methods to compare PWD to PWoD, using household survey data (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)
and complementary medical claims datasets (Medicaid in 13 states; commercial insurance in MarketScan) to
examine alcohol use, AUD indicators, morbidity and consequences, AUD treatment services, quality measures
and outcomes by disability status. Disability status is defined by functional limitations in survey data and by
diagnoses of disabling conditions in claims. Because disability is not homogeneous, analyses will consider any
disability and types of disability. Analyses will be replicated to investigate outcomes for women with
disabilities, an understudied and further stigmatized population.
Our approach is organized by the cascade of care framework, and informed by intersectionality, critical
disability theory, and the Institute of Medicine definition of health care disparities that separates needs-related
differences from true disparities. The proposed specific aims are to: 1) identify differences in alcohol use,
alcohol-related morbidity, and AUD diagnoses, by disability status; 2) among people with AUD, investigate
disparities by disability status in alcohol-related morbidity, consequences, and access to AUD treatment; and
3) among people receiving AUD treatment, assess disparities by disability status in receiving quality-aligned
AUD treatment and experiencing acute alcohol-related outcomes. Our multifaceted approach to data source
selection and focus on disparities between PWD and PWoD will allow a more comprehensive picture of
how the disability community is affected by alcohol problems. Findings are expected to provide policy
makers, researchers, and clinicians with critical information to address disparities in access to, engagement in,
and outcomes of AUD treatment for PWD, helping to reduce alcohol-related morbidity and improve the health
of this commonly overlooked health disparity population."

The aim of the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test if an evidence-based home visiting model
Promoting First Relationships® (PFR), that improves caregiver-sensitive and responsive care, delivered within
a primary care setting (PFR-PC), will protect young infants from the effect of stress on accelerated cellular
aging. During the first years of life, children are particularly vulnerable to adverse events, with lifelong
consequences for physical- and mental-health outcomes. These adversities are disproportionately placed on
minoritized populations and can lead to health disparities. One mechanism that has not yet received systematic
exploration in young children, in the context of an RCT, is the study of telomere length and epigenetic age
clocks, both are unique markers of cellular aging, including in pediatric samples. This RCT will focus on a
sample of minoritized and under-resourced families receiving PFR through their primary care provider. The
setting for this study is unique. We have partnered with WakeMed primary care in North Carolina, a busy
pediatric practice that utilizes an integrated care model to serve a high-need patient population. We will recruit
a low-income, community sample of 250 Spanish- and English-Speaking mothers and their infants receiving
supportive primary care from WakeMed. Mothers will be randomized to Usual Care or to PFR-in Primary Care
(PFR-PC) 10-week home visiting with follow-up PFR-PC content during well child visits. We will measure
mothers’ telomere length at baseline and child telomere length and epigenetic age clocks at baseline and one-
year post-intervention. Aim 1 will evaluate three under-studied heritability and intergenerational predictors of
cellular aging in young children, namely maternal telomere length at baseline (i.e. heritability), and maternal
Adverse Childhood Experiences, and paternal age at conception (i.e., intergenerational factors). Aim 2 will
evaluate the impact of adversity on change in cellular aging. We will test if current maternal adversity
(depression, discrimination, violence, difficult life events) predicts child cellular aging between baseline and
12-months post-intervention, controlling for heritability and intergenerational effects. Aim 3 will test whether
PFR-PC reduces accelerated cellular aging, improves parenting sensitivity and child outcomes one-year post-
intervention. Finally, an exploratory aim will evaluate PFR-PC implementation (dosage, quality,
acceptability, satisfaction, and provider fidelity). The current proposal moves the integrated care model one
step further and addresses families that need more than what is currently offered and targets prevention in an
underserved population. Early interventions are key approaches to addressing the lasting consequences of
early adversity, which represent a key public health crisis, especially when integrated into primary care settings
that are low cost, disseminatable, and grounded in strong theoretical premises related to biological pathways
through which early-life adversity is embedded within and across generations."

10873669,"Asthma is more common in children than adults, with approximately 6.2 million children under age 18
diagnosed with asthma in the US alone. Persistence of childhood asthma has been now conclusively linked to
chronic lung function deficits that track into adult life. Understanding the natural course of childhood asthma
and preventing its persistence into adult life are tasks of paramount importance. While a significant proportion
of children with asthma overcome symptoms after the onset of puberty, the factors that confer this resilience to
persistent asthma remain largely unknown. At present, there are neither established prediction models nor
available biomarkers for early risk stratification of long-term sequelae of childhood asthma.
Recently, in a multi-cohort study we reported for the first time that serum levels and whole blood gene
expression of creatine kinase (CK) are decreased in childhood asthma. CK is an enzyme that – by catalyzing
the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP to phosphocreatine and ADP – plays a vital role in cellular energy
homeostasis and buffering. Further, we conducted experimental studies in a mouse model of allergic airway
disease induced by the common allergen, house dust mite (HDM) in the presence and absence of a
pharmacological inhibitor of CK-B. We discovered that CK-B expression significantly decreased 24 hrs after
HDM challenge, yet recovered by 5 days post challenge, suggesting its importance during the resolution
phase. Most notably, we found that HDM challenged mice in which CK-B was inhibited displayed a prolonged
period of airway hyperresponsiveness and had a major impact on the presence of mucin in the airways.
While these studies indicate for the first time a potential protective role of CK in childhood asthma, multiple
elements of this association remain to be elucidated. This proposal addresses our overall hypothesis that
factors in the asthmatic lung milieu lead to the down-regulation of CK isoforms, which in turn results in
prolonged and worse asthma phenotypes. We will investigate 3 areas of interest regarding the CK isoforms
and asthma that will lead us down the path of further mechanistic understanding: 1) expression of CK in
specific respiratory epithelial cell populations and the impact on CK levels in circulation and in the lung during
asthma, 2) the impact of specific factors in an asthmatic lung environment that may regulate CK expression
and 3) if chronically low CK in early life impacts the severity of adult-onset asthma in mice."

Despite the fact that multiple different treatments for depression have been available for decades, the global
burden of the illness has grown steadily. Depression is now one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.
Current treatment strategies for depression remain largely trial-and-error, and fewer than 40% of patients
respond to a given treatment and sustain that response for a year, even when treatment is continued. A central
barrier to improving these outcomes is the need to characterize better phenotypes of depressive illness that are
more closely aligned to modifiable neurobiological targets than are current symptom constellations and
diagnostic codes. Findings from our group, and from others, suggest that one such phenotype involves the
propensity to experience anger, hostility, and irritability following negative experiences and to respond in an
aggressive, overly hostile manner (hereafter denoted Angry Hostility). Our preliminary data suggest that the
Angry Hostility phenotype is associated with a particular pattern of altered functioning in neural regions that
support emotion processing and emotion regulation. Furthermore, Angry Hostility appears to be strongly
associated with hostile, aggressive behaviors following provocation and with real-world interpersonal and work-
functioning impairments that can exacerbate depressive symptoms. The primary goal of this project is to test a
novel model through which higher levels of Angry Hostility among adults with depression are associated with
specific patterns of abnormal neural function and behavior, leading to poor functional outcomes and future
symptoms. To achieve these goals, 150 adults (18-45 years old) with at least mild symptoms of depression will
be recruited, as will 100 demographically matched, psychiatrically healthy individuals. Participants will complete
clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory behavioral assessments, as well as 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-up
assessments and four 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocols. The project will examine 1) whether
Angry Hostility is associated with abnormal neural function in emotion processing and emotion regulation
regions; 2) whether Angry Hostility is associated with aggressive behaviors in the laboratory and in real-world
settings; and 3) whether abnormalities in a-priori neural systems and behaviors prospectively predict poorer real-
world functioning and psychiatric symptoms over the 12-month follow-up. The aims of the project match well with
the strategic goals of the National Institute of Mental Health. Moreover, the results of this study have the potential
to describe the neurobiological bases, behavioral mechanisms, and real-world consequences of elevated Angry
Hostility among adults with depression. Future work will aim to develop personalized treatments to target the
neural mechanisms identified in this study in order to reduce symptoms and improve functional outcomes for
adults with depression who have higher levels of Angry Hostility."

Asthma affects approximately 10% of US children and is a leading cause of respiratory morbidity and
hospitalization. Asthma disproportionally affects parent-identified Black and Caribbean Hispanic children, and
the large and diverse population of the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) study is
ideal for identifying early-life causes for asthma disparities. The Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC) is a birth
cohort of underserved rural families and children. This population would bring unique data to ECHO related to
exposures (animals, microbiome), neighborhood factors (low population density, clean air), and health outcomes
(reduced rates of respiratory diseases). Our scientific goals focus on how environmental factors and hormonal
influences in adolescence regulate molecular responses of nasal airway cells (NAC). We will analyze DNA
methylation (DNAm) and gene expression from NAC samples in mid-childhood and early adolescence and
combine these data to identify “molecular phenotypes.” We hypothesize that these phenotypes relate to specific
environmental exposures in early life and asthma-related outcomes at ages 6-10 and during a three year follow-
up period. We therefore propose the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. To leverage ECHO Protocol 3.0 core data, we will analyze NAC gene expression and DNAm in
children ages 6-10 years to identify airway cell molecular phenotypes and then test for associations with prenatal
and early postnatal environmental exposures, personal factors (sex, parent-identified race/ethnicity, age,
polymorphisms of candidate genes), and clinical outcomes (asthma, rhinitis, lung function).
 Aim 2. We will reassess asthma outcomes and nasal airway cells three years later (ages 9-13 years) to
determine how asthma disease activity and changes in severity relate to: a) the molecular phenotypes at 6-10
years, b) potential asthma modifying factors such as sex hormones, insulin resistance, and allergy, and c)
changes in DNAm and gene expression.
 Aim 3. We propose to update and adapt existing WISC protocols and adopt new ECHO systems to
maximize retention of existing participants, contribute diversity related to rural and farming exposures and
lifestyles, and implement the ECHO Cohort Protocol with high fidelity.
These proposed studies will link modifiable environmental exposures to molecular regulation of airway cells and
allergy and asthma clinical outcomes. The results will yield a treasure trove of information that could inform new
strategies to prevent asthma and, in affected children, enable innovative approaches to promote disease control
and remission."
10904753,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The effect of early environmental exposures on child health and development is an important area of public
health that no single cohort, or even a few, can answer alone – particularly when coupled with social
determinants of health (SDOH) that may influence these exposures and modify their effects. Determining this
effect becomes more challenging when considering that these exposures influence multiple interrelated health
outcomes such as obesity, neurodevelopment and reproductive development. The ECHO-PROTECT Cohort
Site in Puerto Rico (PR) will focus on these health outcomes, taking advantage of the rich and large sample
size, diversity, and longitudinal nature of the national ECHO Cohort and multi-disciplinary expertise across the
ECHO consortium. ECHO-PROTECT will contribute innovative research to (Aim 1) examine the influence of
SDOH on maternal diet and obesity during pregnancy, child diet and obesity during early to middle childhood,
and the relationship between maternal-child diet and onset of puberty and (Aim 2) determine the relationship
between in utero and early childhood exposure to environmental chemicals, individually and as mixtures, and
neurodevelopment and reproductive development, across early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence.
Most importantly, ECHO-PROTECT will build upon the ongoing ECHO-PROTECT cohort in PR (Aim 3) to
follow up and collect data and biospecimens from the 1,100 children that are participating in the current ECHO-
PROTECT cohort, as well as recruit an additional 1,200 pregnant participants, yielding 1,000 more children, for
a total of 2,100 children contributing data and biospecimens to the ECHO Cohort from Puerto Rico – an
underserved, highly-exposed population. The proposed 1,200 new pregnancies will include at least 125
completed pregnancies with preconception data (Aim 4), tracked from a cohort of 500 potential preconception
participants and, if available, their conceiving partner.
ECHO-PROTECT research will contribute meaningfully to ECHO’s mission, offering (a) an important cohort
that will enrich consortium wide data, (b) significant, innovative science on the influence of SDOH and
exposure to multiple chemicals on multiple interrelated health outcomes such as obesity, neurodevelopment,
and reproductive development, and (c) expertise to lead and participate in additional new scientific directions
involving biomarkers of exposure or biologic response, child brain or reproductive development, and statistical
methods in collaboration with the ECHO consortium, to answer impactful and cutting-edge research questions.
Results from our study will inform future clinical intervention, risk assessment and policy-setting efforts, with
direct relevance to both the underserved population of Puerto Rico and the U.S. general population."

Chronic low back pain (LBP) imposes tremendous burden on affected individuals, healthcare systems, and
society. LBP has been identified as the most common cause of disability globally and in the United States (US).
LBP is also the largest driver of US healthcare spending ($135 billion in 2016) and the most common diagnoses
associated with opioid prescription and consumption. For patients with chronic LBP, physical therapy has been
shown to be a cost-effective method for improving pain and disability. In addition, physical therapy has been
shown to decrease the risk of advanced imaging, injections, surgery, and opioid use in patients with chronic LBP.
Despite available evidence in support, only 7-13% of patients with LBP, including those with chronic LBP, go on
to receive physical therapy services, with patients reporting barriers accessing physical therapy, such as
transportation, provider availability and missed work time. Access is especially limited in rural communities where
there are approximately 40% fewer physical therapists available per capita compared to metropolitan regions. In
addition, patients living in rural communities likely need to travel longer distances to receive physical therapy,
requiring additional missed work time and transportation costs. This lack of access to physical therapy in rural
communities likely contributes to the greater rates of LBP-related disability and opioid consumption that have
been observed in rural communities compared to metropolitan areas. Innovative methods for improving access
to physical therapy are urgently needed to address disparities in outcomes for patients with chronic LBP living
in rural communities in the US. Telehealth has rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes
policy changes that have allowed physical therapists to begin providing care remotely, also referred to as
telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation stands to improve access to physical therapy for patients with chronic LBP
living in rural communities and may serve as a means of improving outcomes of these patients.
We will conduct a single-blind prospective randomized clinical trial addressing key questions to understanding
the effectiveness of a risk-stratified telerehabilitation to reduce opioid use and LBP-related disability and to
improve physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic LBP. Additionally,
we will explore implementation outcomes using a mixed methods approach consisting of electronic surveys and
semi-structured interviews with patients, physical therapists, practice managers, and outpatient services
administration focusing on perceived quality and impact on barriers to care. We will enroll 434 patients with LBP
presenting to primary care clinics serving rural communities (TidalHealth, Salisbury, MD). Eligible patients will
provide informed consent and be randomized to either an educational control or risk-stratified telerehabilitation
(low-risk, remote therapeutic monitoring; medium-risk, physical therapy telehealth visits; or high-risk,
psychologically informed physical therapy telehealth visits). Primary effectiveness outcome is difference in
change in LBP-related disability (Oswestry Disability Index) and in opioid use after 8 weeks of treatment."

The proposed study is to explore novel strategies to prolong disease control of cancer targeted therapy.
Oncogenic KRAS (KRAS*) is the key driver of pancreatic cancer, and pharmaceutical inhibition of KRAS using
chemical and other approaches is extensively developed in recent years. Utilizing a doxycycline inducible
KRASG12D mouse model with conditional p53 knockout in pancreas (iKPC), our previous publication indicates
that 70% PDAC tumors relapsed 0.5-1 year after KRAS* depletion. I identified that the crosstalk between tumor
cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes KRAS* depletion resistance in PDAC. My
unpublished data shows that forced expression of HDAC5 in iKPC cells leads to upregulation of Ccl2 and Ccl7
and recruitment of TAMs. S100A8+ TAMs express abundant TGFβ that enables KRAS*-independent tumor
growth. I hypothesize that the HDAC5-TAMs-TGFβ axis may serve as a general mechanism for therapy
resistance after KRAS* depletion in PDAC. In this proposal, I will evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting
HDAC5, TAMs and TGFβ pathway in several human and mouse PDAC models by loss-of-function study.
Specifically, In Aim 1, I will determine the essentiality of HDAC5 in KRAS* bypass, and the regulation of TAM
recruitment by endogenous HDAC5. In Aim 2, I will utilize multi-dimensional analysis to illustrate the phenotypic
dynamics and heterogeneity of TAMs after KRAS* depletion, and demonstrate the essentiality of TAMs for
tumors to bypass KRAS* dependency. In Aim 3, I will utilize SMAD4 deficient models to access the essentiality
of TGFβ/SMAD4 pathway activation in KRAS* bypass, and delineate the molecular mechanisms of TGFβ-driven
KRAS* bypass. The proposed research program will help me to launch an independent faculty position in an
academic/medical research institution. Meanwhile, I will keep expanding my research skills in bioinformatics,
immunology, epigenetics and translational studies. In terms of my career development, I will devote to improve
my skills on managing lab, mentoring postdocs and students, scientific writing and presentation, and seeking for
collaborations, among others. MD Anderson Cancer Center and Dr. Ronald DePinho’s laboratory provide an
excellent environment for me to achieve these goals. I have also formed an extraordinary advisory committee
composed of Drs. Giulio Draetta, Raghu Kalluri, and Anirban Maitra. They will not only provide me technical
support for my proposed study, but also assist me to seek a faculty position and succeed as an independent
investigator. With the help of K22 award, I will have a good start to achieve my long-term goals, which are to
continue basic and translational studies in pancreatic cancer as a lab head, including but not limited to targeted
therapy resistance, and to contribute to developing novel cancer therapies with other scientists, physicians and
pharmaceutical companies as a team player."

Wnt5a-Ror signaling is an evolutionarily conserved developmental signaling pathway that controls
morphogenetic cell and tissue behavior. Misregulation of the pathway in vertebrates results in profound tissue
elongation defects, including shortening and widening of the body axis, limbs, and face. In humans, mutations
in key nodes of the pathway, including the WNT5A ligand, the ROR2 and Frizzled (FZD2) co-receptors, and the
cytoplasmic signal transducers Dishevelled (DVL) 1 and DVL3, give rise to Robinow syndrome, a congenital
disorder with highly similar tissue elongation phenotypes. Notably, bulldogs exhibit similar physical
characteristics and carry a mutation in DVL2, analogous to the human mutations in DVL1 and DVL3, that reduces
its capacity to respond to Wnt5a-Ror signals. Despite its physiological and clinical importance, the biochemical
steps and cytoskeletal mechanisms that mediate Wnt5a-Ror signaling remain largely uncharacterized;
consequently, insights into the disease mechanism(s) driving Robinow syndrome are unknown. The overarching
goal of our research is to dissect Wnt5a-Ror pathway function and regulation at the biochemical, cellular and
organismal levels. Specifically, we ask in this proposal: 1) How does the Ror/FZD co-receptor complex transmit
Wnt5a signals at the cell surface, and how do pathogenic mutations in ROR2 alter receptor complex function?
2) How do Dvl scaffolding proteins relay Wnt5a-Ror signals in the cytosol, and how do mutations in human DVL1
and DVL3 and canine DVL2 disrupt DVL function? 3) How does the Wnt5a-Ror pathway engage the cytoskeleton
to alter cell behavior and biomechanics, and how do disease mutations in the pathway perturb these processes?
To address these questions, we have developed novel reporter assays that enable quantitative measurement of
Wnt5a-Ror signaling activity in live cells. We have also developed a highly physiological cell culture system in
which we can readily knock out and re-express proteins of interest at near-endogenous levels to rescue signaling.
Using this approach, we will conduct detailed ROR2 and DVL structure-function analyses to identify the structural
elements and mechanisms required for these proteins’ respective functions. These experiments will be
complemented by protein binding studies to define ROR2 and DVL protein interaction networks and how their
disruption contributes to disease pathogenesis. To elucidate the cell biological function of the pathway, we have
optimized 2D and 3D culture systems for cell behavioral analyses and identified a critical role for Wnt5a-Ror
signaling in controlling cell migration, stress fiber stabilization and actomyosin-based contractility. These
observations coincide with biochemical and subcellular localization changes in the RhoA-MLC-actomyosin
regulatory network. We will conduct pharmacological and genetic perturbation experiments to dissect the
function of this network in normal and pathogenic Wnt5a-Ror-directed cell behaviors. The successful completion
of this project will yield the first detailed mechanistic portrait of the Wnt5a-Ror signaling network and illuminate
the pathogenic mechanisms of Wnt5a-Ror-driven diseases."

Tennessee Health Science Center at Memphis, has devised a research development plan that will provide
mentorship, training and research experience to expedite her development into an independent clinician scientist
in the field of genetic epidemiology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of becoming an expert in genomic
contributions to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with sickle cell disease,
the candidate and her mentorship team have devised the following development plan: 1) intensive, personal
mentorship from an experienced team; 2) focused training on techniques in epidemiology and genomic analysis
methods; and 3) an innovative research plan using a large and extensively phenotyped patient cohort with
genomic data to study kidney disease manifestations. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a
focused route to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to make a lasting impact in the field
sickle cell disease-associated kidney disease.
Compared with whites, African Americans have an increased risk for chronic kidney disease, resulting in
irreversible end stage kidney disease and increased mortality. This racial disparity in kidney disease raised the
possibility of genetic contributors and drove studies showing an association between the apolipoprotein L1 gene
(APOL1) and development of CKD. Although APOL1 is a significant risk factor for the development of kidney
disease in SCD, it does not fully account for the increased risk. This proposal will further address the role of
APOL1 as well as other known genetic variants associated with CKD in SCD. The candidate will test two related
hypotheses: a) -a3.7, HMOX1, BCL11A and APOL1 alleles act independently to modify the onset and
progression of kidney disease in SCD and will have improved predictive power when considered together in a
genetic risk profile (GRP) and analyzed longitudinally; and b) known genetic modifiers of CKD discovered in
the general African American population also influence the development of kidney disease in SCD. This
proposal will generate a multi-gene genetic risk profile to identify patients at increased risk for development
and progression of kidney disease and will set the stage for future clinical studies investigating novel disease-
modifying therapies."
10757025,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related
mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder,
which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain
underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower
access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower
retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care
system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a
critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in
care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable
structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in
care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine
learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records,
corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will
empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient
satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of
buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or
interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black
Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the
overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is
complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and
biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical
treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3)
machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the
applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel
interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders."
10757027,"A Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Psychological Distress Symptoms among Black Gender Minority
Women Experiencing Chronic Stigma
PROJECT SUMMARY: Black gender minority (GM) women in the United States face a nearly universal
experience of chronic stigma (i.e., enacted, anticipated, and structural stigma), associated with a
disproportionate prevalence of psychological distress symptoms compared to cisgender peers. Psychological
distress symptoms, specifically post-traumatic stress (PTS) and depressive symptoms, can be highly debilitating
and traditional pathways to care are impeded by widespread barriers to healthcare access and engagement for
Black GM women. Such barriers include underprepared healthcare providers, lack of health insurance, medical
mistrust, and high rates of discrimination and victimization within healthcare settings, which have been
associated with increased PTS and depressive symptom severity among Black GM women. Conversely, coping
and GM community connection have been shown to decrease psychological distress symptom severity among
Black GM women. Thus, culturally informed community-based interventions are needed to offset the high burden
of barriers to healthcare and address psychological distress symptoms among this population. The research
objectives of this application are to first, develop a culturally informed community-based intervention with
guidance from community members (via focus groups and theater testing; N=20) to reduce the effect of chronic
stigma exposure on psychological distress symptoms (PTS and depressive symptoms) among Black GM
women. Second, we will conduct a proof-of-concept trial (N=40) to determine the feasibility and preliminary
efficacy of the resulting intervention. Findings will inform intervention optimization to improve symptom
management for this group. The proposed study plays an essential role in developing and evaluating evidence-
based interventions to improve psychological distress symptom management among Black GM women. To
accomplish the proposed research, I propose a research and training program facilitating my transition to an
independent, patient-oriented research career, specializing in symptom science and culturally appropriate
interventions for symptom management that are easily implemented in real-world settings. Research and training
aims will be accomplished through close interdisciplinary mentorship and carefully selected didactic activities,
conference attendance, applied research experiences, and manuscript and grant proposal preparation (i.e., R-
series). Additionally, I will achieve these goals by obtaining clinical and research training in intervention design,
implementation, and evaluation; psychological distress treatment among GM people; and research ethics and
management specific to engaging vulnerable populations. The training plan leverages the well-supported
infrastructure at Emory University, as well as national and institutional opportunities to ensure didactic,
experiential, and specialized individual instruction.

T cell immunotherapy have revolutionized cancer treatment, underscoring the ability of these cells in controlling
tumor growth. Notwithstanding, T cell immunotherapy, heretofore, has only exploited effector T cells. Naïve T
cells are the primordial substrate of T cell-mediated immunity. We and others have recently discovered that naïve
T cells exist in distinct transcriptionally heterogenous states including clusters displaying a quiescent phenotype
or expressing type I interferon response genes or IL-4 response genes or TCR pathway genes or memory-like
genes. Naïve T cell heterogeneity is not fixed, but rather sensitive to genetic or environmental signals. Notably,
changes in cluster composition induced by mutations or pathogen experience can have significant and, in some
cases, diametrically opposite effects in the ability of naïve T cells to respond to cognate antigen. Here we put
forward the innovative concept that naïve T cells are a repository of microbial experience. This in turn, establishes
their future activation potential during cognate antigen encounter, including during anti-tumor immune response.
We propose to: (1) test the effect of pathogen exposure on the transcriptional heterogeneity of naïve CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells and (2) correlate these antigen-agnostic transcriptional changes intrinsic to naïve T cells for their
effect on anti-tumor immune responses. Our approach will include testing a spectrum of microbial experiences
(i.e.: bacterial, viral, and helminth infection) to comprehensively profile the effect of different types of infections.
To establish the relationship between experience-moulded transcriptional states of naïve T cells and their ability
to mount an anti-tumor immune response, we will test pathogen-conditioned naïve T cells in implanted and
authoctonous tumor models. Our proposal has the potential to transform our understanding on how the
environment shapes the immune state at the level of naïve T cells and the consequent impact on immunity,
including anti-tumor immunity."
10744188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alternative splicing allows multiple gene products to be generated from a single gene, and contributes
to transcriptomic diversity across tissues, development, and individuals. Given that most genes undergo
alternative splicing, the disruption of splicing is a common contributor to disease. Pathology can result through
mutations affecting the splicing of particular genes as well as broad splicing defects that affect many genes.
Advances in sequencing technology have greatly simplified the problem of identifying the splicing products
present in a given tissue and determining how splicing is perturbed in diseases states. But the problem
remains to extract actionable interpretations from the hundreds or thousands of splicing changes that even a
single sequencing experiment might reveal.
 The goal of this project is to understand how perturbations of splicing regulators connect to the resulting
changes in splicing. I will consider both variation at RNA-binding protein target sites and disruption of the RBPs
themselves. I will first consider the connection between short tandem repeat (STR) variation and splicing.
Given that many of the most abundant STRs in the genome match the sequence preferences of important
splicing factors, I will leverage sequencing data spanning hundreds of individuals to determine whether these
highly mutable sequences represent a frequently ignored source of splicing variation. I will then consider the
regulatory characteristics of RBPs themselves. I will first reframe the approach commonly used to integrate
RBP binding and splicing data as a flexible linear model which can incorporate additional information and
confounders. I will then apply this to recent ENCODE panel of RBP binding and knockdown data to infer the
networks of splicing events regulated by a given RBP. I will then seek to use these networks to interpret
patterns of altered splicing in disease states.
 I will carry out this work under the mentorship of Christopher Burge at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), a leader in the field of alternative splicing. Given the Burge lab’s long track record of strong
computational and experimental work, this will provide an ideal environment for both carrying out this research
and developing the skills I will need for an independent career as a computational biologist. The proposed
training will involve frequent interaction with experts in the study of RNA binding proteins and splicing, including
the research groups that generated many of the datasets I will study, such as the Graveley and Yeo labs.
Through this work I will develop further technical expertise in a number statistical and computational
approaches and be immersed in the biology of splicing. I will have access to the experience and expertise I will
need to transition from the evolutionary genomics of my PhD to the study of RNA processing and its regulation"
10901993,"Summary
Immunological regulation of mucosal barrier development and maintenance is a critical process for infant health,
as imbalances in immune sentinel activity can lead to lung, skin and gut inflammatory diseases. Central to the
mucosal tissue homeostasis are Type 3 cytokine producing lymphocytes (T3L). In mice, fetal-origin γδTCR+ T3L
called Tγδ17 cells dominantly regulate skin homeostasis and mediate protective immunity to influenza infections
soon after birth. Tγδ17 cells are classified as innate lymphocytes as their effector function is programmed in the
thymus before they migrate to populate the lung and skin. There, Tγδ17 cells respond rapidly to environmental
cues to fortify the tissue barriers and coordinate pathogen clearance. Tγδ17 cells are representative of the class
of innate T3L (iT3L) that include multiple cell types, whose major distinctions are how they recognize
environmental cues and at what age of tissues they functionally dominate. SARS-CoV-2 infections are
particularly dangerous for the elderly, while children are resistant to severe COVID-19. This exploratory proposal
will test the hypothesis that neonatal lung Tγδ17 cells, or other iT3L, confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.
Rationale for the hypothesis is built on four foundational observations: 1. SARS-CoV-2 infected children generate
T3 responses while the aged only show muted responses, if at all; 2. Murine lung Tγδ17 cells protect against
sepsis, a disease with similarity to severe COVID-19; 3. Neonatal Tγδ17 cells protect lung tissues against
Influenza in mice; and 4. Attrition of Tγδ17 cells occurs with aging. It follows that the severe COVID-19 in elderly
are in part caused by compromised lung iT3L protection with age. This project will establish T3L composition
and activation status pre- and post- SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates and adults, identify lung iT3L subset(s)
that dominantly confer resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates, and determine how diet and infection
history impacts Tγδ17 cell-mediated lung protective responses to respiratory infections. By understanding how
the young successfully respond to SARS-CoV-2 new insights into why the aged succumb to COVID-19 can be
obtained. This in turn will provide leads into novel therapeutics against COVID-19."

Due to human encroachment on the fragile ecosystems of the Congo basin forest perimeter, spillover of zoonotic
pathogens into border communities have proliferated and resulted in worldwide implications. The region of the
Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, located in the southwestern corner of Uganda bordering the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) is a biodiversity hotspot harboring among the largest number of primate and bat species of any
forest in Africa. It is also situated in one of the most densely human populated regions of Africa. Healthcare
facilities in this region remain vigilant for an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) or Marburg hemorrhagic fever
(MHF). This is especially timely given the recent confirmed outbreaks of EVD in neighboring districts. Utilizing a
One Health approach, this project will build an essential surveillance infrastructure for investigating ebolavirus
and other zoonotic disease spillover events by developing an integrated mHealth system that allows healthcare
providers to monitor outbreaks of disease in both humans and wildlife simultaneously. The goal of this
surveillance system is to improve detection of zoonotic spillover in the Bwindi region and help to answer decades
long questions about the ecological scenarios supporting ebolavirus emergence, enabling forecasting that could
help prevent future outbreaks. Specifically, during the R21 phase of this project we will: (1) develop a Village
Health Team (VHT) data collection system to capture AFI and wildlife morbidity / mortality information in remote
forest settings using a One Health smartphone based APP and community-based SMS system; (2) develop a
passive geo-location system using cell-phone tower triangulation with machine learning optimization that can be
implemented across smartphone and non-smartphone-based technologies to improve accuracy in localization
of outbreaks; and (3) create an integrated One Health AFI outbreak alert system operational in the Bwindi region,
optimized for rapid and accurate detection of outbreaks. During the R33 phase of this project we will: (1) refine,
expand and evaluate the tiered mHealth surveillance platform for improved longitudinal AFI case identification;
and (2) utilize the Bwindi mHealth surveillance system to investigate the epidemiology of ebolavirus exposure
associated with wildlife contact in the region. This project is well integrated with existing NIAID funded AFI
surveillance programs and collaborates closely with the Ugandan Ministry of Health. This project will provide an
optimal scenario for rigorously evaluating the benefits of adding an mHealth component to long term zoonotic
disease monitoring, benefiting the sustainability of all developed platforms."

 The skin is the primary interface between animals and their external
environment. The skin maintains its structural integrity throughout the life of an organism
while providing passive and active defenses against external challenges. While
understanding of skin development has advanced rapidly in recent years, less is known
of how the mature skin is maintained in adult life, including how it heals wounds. More
broadly, the mechanisms that maintain mature tissues are still relatively poorly
understood. The overall goal of this research program is to understand at the molecular
level how a simple skin layer is repaired and maintained during adult life. The system of
choice is the skin of the nematode C. elegans, a relatively simple and experimentally
tractable model for skin layers. The C. elegans skin comprises a simple epidermal
epithelium and associated basal and apical extracellular matrices, the basement
membrane and the cuticle. Previous studies have how the mature skin responds to injury
and repairs itself. This work led to the discovery of genetic regulators of adult skin
maintenance; loss of function in such genes does not affect skin development but results
in progressive adult-onset degeneration of the adult skin. Future studies will extend
these approaches to dissect how the mature epidermis is maintained in normal and
perturbed conditions. The epidermis and extracellular matrices of the skin function as an
integrated unit in biogenesis, maintenance and repair. The proposed work will also
investigate how the epidermis and extracellular matrix communicate in tissue
maintenance and wound repair. These studies will also address the roles of an
extracellular matrix lipid layer in formation and repair of the skin permeability barrier. The
resulting insights should advance knowledge of skin biology relevant to several aspects
of human health, including normal wound healing, chronic wounds, and skin fibrosis in
hypertrophic scarring."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by resistance to therapy and is often diagnosed at
a late stage, limiting treatment options. A contributing factor to therapeutic failure is profound desmoplasia and
a well-documented hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In PDAC, several
therapeutic approaches, including chemotherapy and radiation alone or combined with immune checkpoint
inhibitors, have shown minimal therapeutic success. Endoscopic ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation
(EUS-RFA) is a promising local ablative, stromal and immunomodulator therapy for PDAC. We have established
a comprehensive research program to evaluate therapeutic benefits of EUS-RFA in patients with resectable
PDAC. In tandem, we have published a preclinical model to test how RFA treatment alters the TME in the local
ablation site or systemically through evaluation of contralateral tumors (abscopal effect). Successful
amalgamation of our clinical and murine data will reveal mechanistic understanding of RFA-mediated immune
stimulation, immune inhibitory checkpoints, and RFA-immunotherapy combination strategies to improve PDAC
survival outcomes. We recently established the safety and feasibility of a minimally invasive, repeatable
technique that can be used with systemic chemotherapy: EUS-RFA. Our phase II clinical trial (PANCARDINAL-
1), with 12 enrolled patients, demonstrates the tolerability, safety, and feasibility of repeated EUS-RFA with
standard chemotherapy for resectable PDAC. We further found CD40 in patient serum is elevated post EUS-
RFA, indicating immune activation and anti-tumor immunity. Using our preclinical model, we have also shown
CD73 or PD-L1 inhibition augments RFA-mediated tumor growth reduction. Given these findings, we
hypothesize that a multipronged approach that targets immune checkpoint blockade and immunosuppression in
combination with RFA will improve future clinical trial design with EUS-RFA and improve PDAC survival
outcomes. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Evaluate effects of chemotherapy with repeated
EUS-RFA on tumor growth, long-term outcomes, and anti-tumor immunity mechanisms in resectable PDAC
patients (PANCARDINAL-1 Trial) and Aim 2: Determine impact of repeated RFA treatment in sustaining anti-
tumor immunity and improving drug delivery with and without novel combined immunotherapies. Impact and
Innovation: This proposal is the first to execute a clinical trial examining EUS-RFA for improving chemotherapy-
based treatment of PDAC. Through complementary incorporation of clinically relevant animal models, we will
identify novel therapeutic strategies for future studies. This funding will solidify establishment of a
PANCARDINAL Network to serve as a pipeline for ongoing bench-to-bedside approaches to establish a new
standard of care for the treatment of PDAC."

Persistent quadriceps muscle dysfunction following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction
(ACLR) is a critical clinical concern impacting the success of postoperative rehabilitation and prognosis of long-
term joint health. Our novel working hypothesis is that worse quadriceps muscle quality, caused by a progressive
increase in non-contractile tissue within the muscle, post-ACL injury and ACLR is a critical and understudied
mechanism underlying poor clinical outcomes. There is a significant scientific gap in our understanding of the
mechanistic pathway linking changes in quadriceps muscle quality to poor clinical outcomes. Our preliminary
work using ultrasonography to assess changes in muscle quality supports our working hypothesis, in that
patients with an ACL injury demonstrate muscle tissue image signal changes consistent with increased non-
contractile tissue makeup in the first 3 months post-ACLR. Furthermore, ultrasonographic muscle tissue signal
changes are associated with lesser knee extensor strength and worse physical performance (i.e., hop testing).
Unfortunately, rigorous studies to test our working hypothesis have not been conducted to comprehensively
evaluate the effect of ACL injury on muscle quality and the impact of poorer muscle quality on clinical outcomes.
Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) innovations now allow for high-precision and rapid evaluation of
muscle quality throughout the entire muscle volume and in individual quadricep heads. We can be opportunistic
and leverage an ongoing rehabilitation-based parent clinical trial already collecting critical clinical outcomes of
knee extensor strength, gait biomechanics, physical performance and patient-reported outcomes (PRO), and
tibiofemoral cartilage composition at preoperative, and 1-, 6-, and 12-month post-ACLR timepoints. We are
proposing to test our working hypothesis with an ancillary R21 by conducting the following specific aims: 1)
determine longitudinal changes in quadriceps muscle quality following ACL injury and ACLR preoperatively and
at 1-, 6- and 12-months post-ACLR; and 2) determine the associations between changes in muscle quality and
a) knee extensor strength; b) gait biomechanics; c) PRO and physical performance; and d) tibiofemoral cartilage
composition. Our study is innovative as: 1) we are testing a novel hypothesis that quadriceps muscle quality
changes early post-ACL injury and that it is a critical mechanism associated with poor clinical outcomes; 2) we
are utilizing a novel MRI technique capable of collecting highly-sensitive measures of muscle quality in individual
heads of the quadriceps throughout the entire muscle volume; and 3) associations between muscle quality and
a comprehensive host of clinical outcomes (i.e. knee extensor strength, gait biomechanics, physical performance
and PRO, and tibiofemoral cartilage composition) can be evaluated as part of the ancillary R21. The proposed
R21 is significant as identifying the association between deleterious changes in muscle quality and poor clinical
outcomes is the first critical step in developing the next generation of interventions to address the underlying
mechanistic muscular changes leading to poor outcomes following ACL injury and ACLR."

Metastatic prostate cancer (PC) typically manifests in the skeleton. The lesions arise from disseminated
tumor cells (DTCs) that often persist in a dormant state for months to decades after initial primary tumor
treatment. Despite our knowledge that DTCs give rise to incurable bone metastatic PC, there remains
gaps in our understanding as to the molecular mechanisms underpinning entry and reawakening from
the dormancy program. Insight into those mechanisms could yield new therapeutic approaches that
would prevent the metastatic relapse and ultimately death of almost 34,500 American men each year.
To address this, we have developed a novel model of PC dormancy in agreement with published
markers in the literature in vitro and optimized a surgical technique to study dormancy in vivo. We next
performed transcriptomic sequencing on PC cells growing under normal, dormant, or reawakening
conditions. Bioinformatic analysis of transcript expression and transcription factor (TF) activity revealed
positive regulatory domain zinc finger region protein 16 (PRDM16) to significantly increase during entry
into dormancy and decrease during exit across mouse (RM1) and human sensitive / castrate resistance
cell lines (LAPC4, 22Rv1). Further, we validated PRDM16 upregulation in dormant cells on the protein
level both in vitro and in vivo. Genetic silencing of PRDM16 led to a significant reduction in the ability
of PC cells to enter dormancy concomitant with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
including BCL-2 and increased pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM & Noxa. Preliminary data shows
that PRDM16 expression in PC cells can be induced by BMP-7 and conversely decreased by the BMP
signaling antagonist, noggin, factors with known critical roles in regulating bone homeostasis. Based
on our findings, we hypothesize that BMP7 induces PRDM16 expression in early skeletal DTCs,
which is critical for the initiation of the dormancy program.
 In the F99 phase, we will identify PRDM16 transcriptome in PC dormancy and confirm BMP
signaling control on its expression using genetic approaches and validation of findings in pre-clinical
models. In K00 phase, we will study how aging contribute to the reawakening of dormant cancer cells
in the bone microenvironment. We will identify biological and molecular determinants of cancer
dormancy using Cherry-niche technology and comprehensive fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), high dimensional mass cytometry, and single cell RNASeq experiments. We will then validate
our findings in pre-clinical models and patient tissue sections. Findings from this work will advance our
understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating the cancer dormancy program in skeletal
metastasis in the context of aging, which is relevant to most prostate cancer patients."
10887618,"Title: “AddBiomechanics: Automatic processing and
sharing of human movement data”
Abstract:
Movement related injuries and disorders affect most people at some point in their lifespan. Treatments are
difficult to develop because we have limited ability to predict how a proposed treatment will change the
neuromusculoskeletal dynamics of a patient. Machine learning approaches to predict patient responses to
hypothetical treatments would radically shorten the development time for novel treatments, but we lack
sufficient clean public data to apply these methods. Biomechanics data is too heterogeneous, decentralized,
and small to be useful for modern machine learning techniques.
This proposal describes a novel collaborative approach to create a large biomechanics dataset. The main
bottlenecks preventing the sharing of biomechanics data are the very large time cost to manually process the
data, and the lack of incentives for sharing. We propose to address both of these problems with a cloud-based
data processing automation tool, which researchers can use for free if they agree to share the resulting
de-identified data.
To demonstrate the social viability of our approach, we have developed a prototype to partially automate the
processing of biomechanics data, saving researchers some of the time they spend collecting and processing
data. We have hosted this tool as a cloud application called AddBiomechanics, available for free if users are
willing to share anonymized versions of any data they upload. Despite minimal advertising and including only
an initial set of features, since our launch in early July 2022 researchers from over 130 universities already use
the tool to process and share data, and have already collectively shared 10,000 motion capture trials totaling
more than 80GB of data now in a unified, ML-ready format.
The first aim of our proposal is to develop methods to automate more of the processing of biomechanics data,
saving researchers up to 90% of the time they spend collecting and processing data. To further encourage
sharing of data, our second aim is to improve our cloud-based tools, provide more support to our users, and
advertise the tools more broadly within the community.
This project has broad support in the biomechanics community, evidenced by letters of support from
researchers at 8 institutions in 5 countries, and the resulting dataset will lay the foundation for machine
learning breakthroughs in the analysis of human movement and prediction of treatment outcomes by reducing
friction to share and aggregate movement data. This will increase innovation and improve the treatment of
movement related injuries and disorders, enhancing quality of life for millions of people."

Treatment for neuropathic pain is typically ineffective or associated with side effects, and there is no treatment for peripheral neuropathy. To remedy this, it is essential that the mechanisms responsible for both are understood and targets identified that could be amenable to development of novel therapeutics. My goal is to dissect out at an individual neuron level the transcriptional and functional changes that occur over time in response to physical axonal injury, ion channel mutations and exposure to neurotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and explore the extent to which hyperexcitability and axon degeneration are linked. This will involve combinations of several different approaches: correlating single cell profiles and disease related functional changes, identifying disease susceptibility in patient stem derived neurons, high content phenotypic screens, population imaging in intact animals, genetic editing, and interrogation at high temporal and spatial resolution of behavioral surrogates of pain and sensory loss. The project will focus on neuropathic pain due to physical disruption of peripheral sensory axons, small fiber neuropathies due to voltage-gated sodium channel mutations and chemotherapy- induced peripheral neuropathy, and will examine if these syndromes are distinct or part of a spectrum of sensory neuron pathologies with overlapping risk factors and mechanisms."

10871840,"Over the past 15 years, our studies have established O-glycans as crucial components of the colonic mucus
barrier. Our recent publication demonstrates that the colon mucus is mainly formed from secretion of O-glycosylated
Muc2 by goblet cells (GCs) in the proximal colon, where it encapsulates the fecal materials including the microbiota.
These findings represent a paradigm shift from the current model of the colon mucus system and provide new insights
into host and microbiota symbiosis. However, whether the proximal colon contains a distinct subset of goblet cells
(pGCs), and the significance of proximal colon-derived mucus in inflammatory bowel disease is unstudied.
 To address these questions, in our preliminary studies, we created a new surgical model in mice named cecal-
distal colonic anastomosis (CDA) with removal of the proximal colon. Our preliminary data showed CDA mice exhibited
impaired mucus layer and developed spontaneous albeit modest inflammation in the distal colon, highlighting the
physiological importance of the pGC-derived mucus for whole colon homeostasis. In parallel, we have adopted study
of the neo-colon mucosa created by ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis patients and its
intermittent acquisition of inflammation (pouchitis) as a human “cellular observatory”. Our preliminary data
demonstrated the feasibility of mucus characterization, single cell molecular methods, and cohort genetic variation
analytic methods in this model, to determine cell biologic and genetic contributions to gut homeostasis.
 Built on these preliminary data and the importance of the proximal colon-derived mucus we recently discovered,
we hypothesize that loss of pGC diversity and plasticity contribute to defective colon homeostasis and inflammation.
We propose two Aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 is to determine how proximal colon-derived mucus governs the
colonic mucus barrier function. We will determine the unique cellular and molecular identity of the pGCs through single-
cell RNA sequencing, MERFISH spatial transcriptomics, glycomics, and functional analysis. We’ll also use the CDA
model to determine how lack of pGCs affects colon mucus function and the plasticity of the GCs in the distal colon.
Aim 2 is to identify human genes involved in GC programming and mucus production and their relation to inflammatory
bowel disease phenotypes. The ileal neo-colon created by IPAA in at-risk patients offers a temporal cellular
observatory of the initially unaffected ileal neo-colon, as adaption of mucosal GCs heterogeneity and plasticity ensues
with perturbations of inflammation and altered microbiome community states. We will conduct biopsy-based single-cell
RNA and chromatin analysis of GCs populations in the pouch mucosa as it adapts to inflammatory and microbiome
changes. We will also test for gene variants affecting this adaption by IPAA cohort genomic association analysis.
 Successful completion of the project will 1) establish that pGCs are a unique subset of mucus secretion cells;
2) demonstrate the importance of proximal colon-derived mucus in maintaining homeostasis between microbiota and
host mucosa; and 3) provide new insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease such as pouchitis,
which may lead to new diagnostic and/or therapeutic options."
10745724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Complex gene-environment interactions underlie the incidence and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Our work in pesticide-exposed mice and PD patients indicates that cellular stress associated with environmental
toxicant exposure activates the intracellular inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein
complexes containing pattern recognition receptors that initiate and propagate inflammation. Inflammasomes
have emerged as key mediators of inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases in part because they can sense
non-microbial “sterile” inflammatory triggers commonly observed in chronic, age-related disorders like PD.
Inflammasome triggers identified in models of PD include pesticides, heavy metals, mitochondrial and oxidative
stress, and proteinaceous insults like misfolded synuclein. Our original aims determined that long-term exposure
to the PD-associated pesticide rotenone activated the NLRP3-inflammasome and that Nlrp3-/- mice were
protected from rotenone-induced nigral cell loss. In parallel studies, we identified elevated NLRP3 expression in
degenerating mesencephalic tissues and plasma in PD patients compared with healthy volunteers. These
findings and rapidly advancing efforts to target NLRP3 in the clinic provide a compelling backdrop for continued
analysis of the activities of the NLRP3-inflammasome in the central nervous system. We propose to extend our
studies based on our findings of both microglial and neuronal origins for NLRP3-inflammasome activity and the
concept that plasma borne inflammasome-related proteins may be a novel class of biomarkers for toxicant
exposure and PD. We’ve developed innovative mouse models based on CRE-driven dopamine neuron and
microglial specific Nlrp3 gain-of function. We will utilize our established rotenone exposure model to dissect the
contributions of cell-type specific NLRP3 inflammasome activity to neuroinflammation and nigral
neurodegeneration. In a second aim, we will work to understand the cellular mechanisms that underlie our
detection of plasma-borne inflammasome related proteins in PD patient plasma. These studies will validate LC-
MS/MS studies in which we identified Nlrp3-dependent release of the exocytosis mediators Bruton’s Kinase
(BTK) and Coronin1A (CORO1A). We propose systematic NLRP3, BTK, and CORO1A gain-and-loss of function
studies in genetically modified pesticide-exposed microglial, neuronal, and monocytic cell lines to characterize
novel secretory mechanisms and define brain-cell-type specific NLRP3-dependent secretomes. Studies will
provide mechanistic data and define molecules secreted specifically by distressed brain cells providing a
foundation for the development of diagnostic tools to detect, stratify, and monitor PD. Our study is important
because we work to combat the rapidly increasing global burden of age-related neurodegenerative disorders by
characterizing a pathway common to multiple diseases that can be targeted with already existing or emerging
small molecule therapeutics."
10745742,"Summary/Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) adversely
impact our large and growing aging population. An estimated 5.8 million American’s 65 years and older are
suffering from AD, with that number projected to hit 13.8 million by 2050. Aging African American and Latinx
populations are particularly hard-hit by AD/ADRD, as are rural communities due to lack of access to clinical
trials and medical care. A broad range of symptoms are associated with these diseases and each patient’s
progression is unique and clinically quite variable. During a clinical trial, when longitudinal studies are
conducted over months to years, much of the patient’s lifestyle and function goes unmonitored as they are at
home with their partner or alone and without contact with professional providers. Infrequent data collection
relies on the ability of patients to accurately retrieve relevant details about their lives since the last checkup,
which is inherently inaccurate or incomplete due to the challenges of self-report and recall. Thus, there is a
critical need in clinical trials for more frequent, accurate, and complete patient monitoring especially in
communities that are currently underserved. To meet this need, Life Analytics is furthering the development of
an at-home monitoring platform, called Life Analytics Monitoring Platform (LAMP). LAMP is based off of the
NIH and VA funded Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative system. CART is an
end-to-end (hardware and software) platform, which provides high-frequency monitoring of geriatric disease
progression by measuring real-world data, thus providing a digital remote assessment model to the academic
research community. The CART system was built by, and has been further developed by, our research team in
the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH). Through these efforts a highly functional
generalizable infrastructure for support and deployment of these systems for academic research has been
established. To date, the ORCATECH/CART platform has been installed in more than 1000 homes across
North America and is currently collecting and transmitting data back to ORCATECH servers for analysis.
Additionally, the LA team has shown through publication that high-frequency in-home monitoring data allows
clinical studies to be appropriately powered with fewer patients. Therefore, this platform has the high potential
to change the way that clinical trials are conducted – if such a system can broadly disseminated. This Fastrack
will assist with the critical research and development required to improve the existing ORCATECH/CART
platform into the commercialized LAMP platform through the following Aims: SA 1 (Phase I): Migrate
ORCATECH/CART system to secure and scalable cloud operability. SA 2 (Phase II): Optimization of LAMP for
data transfer, storage, and analysis. SA 3 (Phase II): Demonstrate LAMP usability with Alpha-testing with a
third party, off-site location."

The Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) aims to conduct multiple; scientifically sound, possibly biomarker informed, exploratory clinical trials of the most promising therapies. This proposal outlines the University of Miami's willingness and desire to continue to serve as a clinical trial site in the NeuroNEXT consortium. The experience and expertise of the investigative team at the University of Miami (UM), the commitment, infrastructure and investment of the Department of Neurology and the Miller School of Medicine in clinical and translational research, and the ethnic and racial diversity (69% Hispanic, 17% Black) of the south Florida community uniquely position us to contribute to the mission of NINDS to reduce the burden of neurological disease that is borne by every segment of society. In addition to serving as an efficient and productive member of the NeuroNEXT consortium, we have the capacity and expertise to make a significant contribution to the enrollment of Hispanics and Blacks in NeuroNEXT trials, a demographic that has historically been underrepresented in NINDS sponsored trials. The specific goals of our NeuroNEXT team are to continue service as an effective site in the NeuroNEXT network, leveraging our unique strengths and expertise for the benefit of the broader network; and to continue development our clinical-translational workforce, providing young investigators and research staff with educational, training and career growth opportunities. Specific components of the research strategy focus on the efficiency of the process of clinical research implementation, the use of a culturally sensitive approaches to recruitment of the Hispanic population, education and training of new clinical investigators, recognition of the pivotal role that research coordinators play in the clinical trials process and a commitment to provide expertise and assistance to investigators engaged in other NINDS sponsored trials."
10756955,"ABSTRACT: Advanced training in Community Based HIV Research
In Zimbabwe with one of the highest HIV burdens in the world, data and samples collected in community
based research can contribute valuable information to improve prevention and care. Building new skills and
capacity for molecular epidemiology and genomics focuses on the best use of these resources. Training in
the interdisciplinary continuum of basic lab research skills, bioinformatics, modeling and data science for
relevant, ethical research will address Zimbabwe's National and NIH/Fogarty goals. We propose a 3-
pronged approach:
To develop research skills: We will conduct short course training for students and post-graduates to
develop the skills underpinning contemporary community based research, to design innovative studies
integrating geolocation, epidemiologic and molecular research methods to interpret data on HIV transmission
and prevention. We propose to introduce and promote the use of bioinformatics, to develop skills in
phylogenetic, host and viral genetics that can be applied to address the ongoing epidemic.
To promote research at doctoral level: We request support for 5 PhD students, from biologic, social
science or medical disciplines. Students registered with universities in Zimbabwe will identify suitable projects
and mentors to conduct HIV research relevant to Drug resistance, Genomics and Pathogenesis of HIV in
community based studies. Support will include payment of fees and a modest stipend; academic supervision
and mentoring from local and/or international experts will be compensated to ensure interdisciplinary scientific
development and quality of postgraduate outcomes.
To develop future research leadership. This can be achieved by supporting postdoctoral fellows to conduct
research in a mentored environment to develop research management, mentoring and grant writing skills to
sustain their research career. The position of “Postdoctoral Fellow” is uncommon in African academic circles.
As a research institution, the BRTI will permit Postdoctoral fellows to focus on developing leadership skills,
implementing and analyzing ongoing projects. Fellows will design and manage their own projects and
research teams, interpret data, articulate and present findings to peers under the guidance of mentors and
complete applications for a research grant during their tenure.
This 3-pronged approach will effectively build advanced health research capacity filling critical gaps in
current HIV research in Zimbabwe. The activities and training will be directed towards combining new
scientific methods to address the public health priorities of key populations: children, adolescents and young
women, in community settings. The evaluation strategies will include formative and summative evidence of
activity and output. Outcome assessment will encompass through evaluations of student and fellow
achievements, presentations and publications, and their impact on policy and stakeholders."
10756956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dyspnea is one of the most common and distressing symptoms associated with cancer, occurring in up to 70%
of patients. The vast majority of patients with dyspnea experience frequent episodes of breathlessness triggered
by daily activities, such as walking and bathing. Understandably, dyspnea with exertion can significantly limit
patients' daily function and negatively impact their quality of life. If uncontrolled, these highly distressing dyspnea
episodes can result in costly emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Because exertional dyspnea is under-
researched, few effective treatment options are available.
 The long-term goal of our group's research is to develop effective, evidence-based therapies for dyspnea in
patients with cancer. Exertional dyspnea is particularly difficult to treat because of its rapid onset, short duration,
and high intensity. This raises the possibility that rapid-onset opioids that are currently approved for breakthrough
cancer pain may be effective as prophylactic treatment to reduce exertional dyspnea and maximize function. On
the basis of our preliminary data from recent clinical trials, we hypothesize that fentanyl sublingual spray (FSS)
is effective in relieving exertional dyspnea. The overall objective of the proposed 3-arm, double-dummy, parallel-
group randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of FSS, morphine sulfate, and placebo in exertional
dyspnea. The primary specific aim of this study is to compare the effect of prophylactic FSS, morphine sulfate,
and placebo on the intensity of exertional dyspnea at the end of a shuttle walk test (SWT). In the second specific
aim, we will compare their effects on SWT distance, average daily dyspnea, personalized daily activity, symptom
burden, and quality of life. The third aim is to explore their effects on neurocognitive function, addictive potential,
adverse effects, and pattern of opioid use. After obtaining written informed consent, we will monitor patients
closely on usual opioids for 5 days before randomly assigning them to receive FSS, morphine sulfate, or placebo
prophylactically once daily for 14 days.
 The proposed study is innovative in that the indications (i.e., exertional dyspnea and prophylactic
management), intervention (i.e. FSS, proportionally dosed), patient population (i.e., patients with cancer),
patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. personalized dyspnea activity, Patient-Reported Outcomes version of
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events instrument, and Drug effects Questionnaire), and study
design (i.e. home setting) that it will address are novel. The expected outcome of the proposed study is that FSS
will be established as a treatment option for exertional dyspnea in patients with cancer while a rich dataset will
be provided on the neurocognitive effects and addictive potential of opioids to inform safe opioid use during this
era of opioid crisis. Successful completion of this adequately powered trial will have a positive effect on patient
care by alleviating the intensity of exertional dyspnea, enhancing patients' ability to function in their daily lives,
and improving the quality of life of these highly distressed patients."
10756957,"In 2007, we received a Fogarty ICOHRTA grant award to launch an HIV and tuberculosis research
training program at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH). In 2014, our current “PARACAS”
(Program for Advanced ReseArch Capacities for AIDS in Peru) allowed us to further integrate HIV
research into the culture of UPCH and mature collaborations with the University of Washington (UW) and
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Through closely mentored research, along selected
course work, outstanding young and mid-career health researchers are reaching the scientific proficiency
and leadership that will allow them to jointly address emerging HIV challenges.
In alignment with research priorities of the NIH, the Peruvian Ministry of Health and UNAIDS targets, this
renewal application for our PARACAS strengthens the focus upon implementation science to improve HIV
retention in care, expanding efforts towards the care of maternal HIV and elimination of pediatric HIV. In
the context of high-quality mentoring, we aim to: 1) stimulate the critical research career development and
scientific production of selected top candidates through masters (3), doctoral (2) and postdoctoral (2)
scholarships; 2) consolidate as a hub for early entry of promising medical undergraduates (8) into long-
term advanced HIV research training; and 3) to influence on policy change for HIV care by enhancing
knowledge brokering with government stakeholders.
The essence of our PARACAS’ research training program - ""transformative, collaborative learning"" -
leverages its impact beyond the benefits to individual trainees. To stimulate and boost long-term careers
in HIV research, this renewal application (a) integrates competitive coursework at collaborating US
institutions with implementation of research in Peru under co-mentoring of US and Peruvian PARACAS
faculty (long-term “sandwich” training), with (b) practical mentored research electives. These training
efforts will be complemented by mentorship training through the Global Health Fellows Program and novel
long-term research-career grants for candidates with doctoral degrees obtained abroad recently launched
by the Peruvian Government. Even if our trainee selection process will continue to target candidates with
high potential to succeed in research, we will reinforce the individualized mentoring and flexibility of
training formats that benefit recruitment, performance and retention of trainees underrepresented in
science, particularly women.
By this time substantially enriched with alumni of the prior ICOHRTA and PARACAS grants who are
established within UPCH and the Peruvian Ministry of Health, our PARACAS renewal offers the extensive
mentoring capacities and breadth of faculty expertise, continued access to a vibrant, talent pool of new
Peruvian trainees, to effectively contribute to the goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation."
10769613,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – OVERALL
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths of men in the United States and places a
significant health burden on society. The overarching goal of the UCSF Prostate Cancer SPORE is to address
this burden by reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, through leveraging a deep
understanding of the disease to translate biological findings into clinical impact. The SPORE team will approach
this mission with transdisciplinary research that is highly collaborative and translational, through four specific
aims: A) Investigate molecular drivers of aggressive prostate cancer; B) Develop biomarkers to guide treatment
of patients with advanced prostate cancer; C) Target therapeutic resistance in metastatic castration resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC), which is the lethal manifestation of advanced disease; and D) Accelerate translational
research across the spectrum of prostate cancer.
To address these aims, the UCSF Prostate SPORE proposes three scientific projects, each investigating
aggressive prostate cancer from a mechanistic, biomarker, and therapeutic perspective:
Project 1: Combination immunotherapy with radioligand therapy for metastatic prostate cancer
Project 2: Investigating Clinical and Biological Implications of a Novel Hypermethylated Subtype of mCRPC
Project 3: Deciphering the Role of the Translational Oncogenic Program in Prostate Cancer
These proposed studies will be aided by horizontal collaborations with other Prostate SPORES, NCI initiatives,
and molecular diagnostics companies, as well as vertical collaborations with the National Clinical Trials Network
(NCTN), DOD Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC), and pharmaceutical companies, among
other organizations. Additionally, these projects will be complemented by strong, ongoing institutional
commitments of money and space, well-resourced Career Enhancement and Developmental Research
Programs, and three cores: Administration, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics, and Pathology/Tissue.
The infrastructure outlined under this SPORE application is designed to encourage and promote translation of
innovative, impactful ideas by supporting promising new projects, providing access to critical resources for
bench-to-bedside transitions, sponsoring interdisciplinary collaborations, and providing an effective framework
for mentoring/nurturing the next generation of translational scientists. By bringing together a diverse and multi-
disciplinary group of investigators, this Prostate Cancer SPORE will accelerate highly impactful translational
research with the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for men with aggressive prostate cancer."

researchers and clinicians in the field of translational prostate cancer research."
10769615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1 (FONG): COMBINATION IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH
RADIOLIGAND THERAPY FOR METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have limited single agent activity in metastatic castration resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC), in part related to the low number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) relative to more
responsive tumor types. Radiation therapy (RT) may enhance immunotherapy by either enhancing priming of an
immune response and/or resetting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance effector
function. Understanding the mechanisms by which RT can enhance immunotherapy in mCRPC is a significant
unmet need.
 Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we have found that external beam RT induces the
wholesale replacement of preexisting T cell clones with novel clonotypes in the prostate cancer tumor
microenvironment consistent immunologic priming. This treatment, however, also induces novel myeloid states
within the tumor microenvironment that may mediate immunosuppression and dampen the newly primed T cells.
We hypothesize that molecularly-targeted radioligand therapy may induce immunologic priming without
inducing the concomitant immunosuppression seen with external beam radiation. In prostate cancer, the beta-
particle emitting 177Lu-PSMA-617, which targets prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), represents an
emerging treatment of mCRPC. However, the optimal schedule and form of radioligand therapy to achieve an
optimal immunogenicity remains to be elucidated. In Aim 1, we will use multi-omic single cell analyses
(scRNAseq, T cell receptor sequencing, and single cell proteomics), to dissect the treatment induced changes
in immune effectors and regulatory cell states both within the TME and circulation of mCRPC patients treated
on our phase 1b trial with pembrolizumab and one dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617. In Aim 2, we will perform a
prospective investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial combining pembrolizumab with repeated dosing of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 where subsequent doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 are triggered at the time of PSA progression to rescue
anti-tumor immunity. In Aim 3, we define the immunogenic impact of beta- (177Lu) vs. alpha- (225Ac) particle
emitting therapy and external beam radiation therapy to help guide future trials of radioimmunotherapy.
 With this proposal, we seek to advance the field of immunotherapy in prostate cancer in several important
ways by: 1) determining the optimal schedule and form of radiation to prime anti-tumor immunity, 2) developing
a novel approach to functionally and quantitatively visualize immune response through granzyme B PET, 3)
understanding the role of treatment-induced myeloid cells in modifying T cell states, 4) developing biomarkers
that will enable patient selection in future trials, and 5) identifying novel therapeutic targets on myeloid and/or T
cells to enhance the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy."

The goal of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic Resistance is to apply innovative advanced
technologies to developing new strategies for treating leading causes of multidrug resistant
hospital-associated infection caused by staphylococci and enterococci. This multi-investigator
project brings together experts from fields ranging from mathematics and systems biology to
infectious disease clinicians, and the Administrative Core creates an infrastructure for them to
work collaboratively and synergistically, bringing new insights and capabilities to bear in solving
the leading public health crisis of antibiotic resistant infection. The Administrative Core functions
as a central resource for facilitating interaction among Subproject and Core Investigators, to
ensure program synergy, executing and tracking subcontract expenditures to ensure efficient
project performance, recording and compiling records to track and manage progress, connecting
the Program Project to other initiatives to leverage its resources, and for ensuring the timely
reporting of results and financial status to NIAID Program staff. The Administrative Core will
continue to strive to foster the existing synergy in attainment of project goals and milestones. To
do this, the Administrative Core will provide program management and oversight, facilitate
interactions between participants, provide critical infrastructure for fiscal management of the
program, provide connectivity to and leverage from other Harvard-wide initiatives, including the
Microbial Sciences Initiative (MSI) and Catalyst Clinical and Translational Sciences Center, and
provide a single point of contact and active coordination for on-going communication with NIAID

and external synergies, the impact of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic Resistance is much
greater than would otherwise be possible through individual research efforts."
10769875,"SUMMARY
The Mother Machine is a microfluidics-based high throughput imaging and analysis system for
measuring the properties and behaviors of single cells in a large population (thousands to millions
of cells). It is capable of identifying rare stochastic variants in a population, such as spontaneous
persister cells, and tracking the properties of those rare cells over time, or in response to various
treatments. It is equally capable of identifying phenotypically-altered genetic variants in a large
pool of mutants, such as a transposon insertion library typically used for high throughput genetic
screens such as Tn-seq. However, rather than relying on indirect inferences based on counts of
sequences of particular transposon insertion junctions following several cycles of PCR
amplification, the Mother Machine allows direct observation of the mutant over time. Moreover, it
allows comparison to about 10 other cells of that genetic lineage in the same trench, providing
extremely rigorous and precise measurements. Additional advantages over conventional Tn-seq
approaches include the ability to identify phenotypes that do not necessary translate to changes
in chromosome abundance (and hence sequence counts), such as the formation of multinucleate
filamentous cells, or other irregularities in cell growth or division. Finally, direct imaging of single
clonal lineages allows direct assessment of the phenotypic consequence for that particular
transposon insertion in that particular orientation, rather than summing the effects of all insertions
across a gene. This allows phenotypic differences that depend on the precise insertion location
of a transposon, and its orientation to be assessed, for individual comparison to other different
insertions within the same gene. The Core Director is a pioneer in this field who has made
advancements in the technology not available anywhere else, including the ability to image more
than 1 million trenches, and the ability to retrieve cells from trenches of interest. This specialized
advanced technology cannot now be recreated in individual laboratories, and is not available
commercially, providing a tremendous, unique resource for the important investigation of antibiotic
resistance and susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci. Additionally, the Core Director’s
field-leading expertise in stochastic variation within bacterial populations provides an important
intellectual resource for subprojects investigating the properties of antibiotic persister
subpopulations – the effects of antibiotics on them as well as the contribution of variation in efflux
expression to their genesis. These capabilities are highly complementary to those of the research
subprojects, and significantly enhances both their throughput and the rigor and richness of the
data that cannot otherwise be obtained."
10757368,"Abstract
The most deadly characteristic of cancer cells is their ability to invade local tissues and metastasize.
Current evidence suggests that carcinoma cell proliferative, invasive and metastatic potential are
regulated in a cancer cell-autonomous fashion as well as by the surrounding cellular and acellular
microenvironment. Using MT1-MMP conditional knockout mice, in combination with human patient-
derived cancer xenografts, we have recently reported that carcinoma cell-derived MT1-MMP plays a
dominant role in driving local tissue invasion and metastasis. Unexpectedly, however, we find that
targeting carcinoma cell MT1-MMP alone in vivo triggers large scale changes in the transcriptional
program of the cancer cells that extend far beyond the regulation of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
interactions. These results suggest that MT1-MMP exerts a more global effect on carcinoma cell function
than previously appreciated. Indeed, we provide new evidence that MT1-MMP controls carcinoma cell
gene expression by regulating a novel mechanotransduction cascade that centers on the regulation of
nuclear lamin A/C level with attendant effects on the co-transcriptional activators, YAP and TAZ and the
MRTF-SRF transcriptional network. Furthermore, preliminary studies indicate that MT1-MMP exerts
these effects in a proteinase-dependent fashion by effecting the remodeling of the type I collagen-rich,
interstitial ECM. Finally, while monitoring the trafficking of MT1-MMP to invadopodial structures during
ECM remodeling, we have uncovered a heretofore undescribed process wherein MT1-MMP translocates
from promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-rich nuclear invaginations to ECM-degradative sites at the
cell surface in association with the cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, UNR/CSDE1. Given these findings,
we outline plans for a combination of molecular and cellular studies that seek to i) define MT1-MMP as a
master upstream regulator of the mechanotransduction-linked carcinoma cell transcription programs
required for invasion and metastasis, ii) characterize the role of the MT1-MMP/type I collagen axis as the
key determinant responsible for controlling carcinoma cell behavior in vivo and iii) establish the role of a
novel, nuclear budding-initiated, MT1-MMP-PML/UNR interaction network in controlling proteinase
delivery to matrix-degradative invadosomes. Together, these studies seek to identify MT1-MMP as the
dominant proteolytic effector of tumor progression in vivo by virtue of its ability to control the behavior of
cancer cell populations embedded within the type I collagen-rich 3D ECM encountered at primary and
metastatic sites in vivo."
10757369,"Project Summary
Genomic data are vital for advancing medical research and achieving breakthroughs. However, disclosure of
genomic data has serious privacy implications that can lead to a loss of trust from data contributors and restricting
researchers’ access to data. To facilitate data-driven genomic research, it is crucial to address the privacy risks
in data sharing and to develop privacy-preserving solutions to protect study participants. This project will study
the privacy risks in realistic attack models and develop privacy methods that balance individual privacy and the
utility of shared data. Overall, the proposed solutions will enable institutions to share high utility data while
providing strong privacy assurance to data contributors, facilitating data collection and improving data usability.
In the first aim, a privacy-preserving data publication framework will be developed to “safely anonymize” genomic
data and optimize the released data toward application needs. The framework will protect individuals from re-
identification and also prevent inference attacks that may be conducted using publicly available phenotypes (e.g.,
eye/hair color). In the second aim, customizable privacy solutions will be developed against realistic adversarial
models when data statistics are released. Building on recent privacy models, the proposed solutions will account
for the adversary's external knowledge and customizable sensitive information to effectively strike a balance
between privacy and utility, improving data usability compared to standard differential privacy models. This
project will advance current solutions for genomic data anonymization and improve the usability of differential
privacy and its variants, with the goal of facilitating highly usable and privacy-preserving data sharing. This work
will widen the access to genomic data, promote transparency, and facilitate reproducibility for genomic
applications. This project is in line with the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),
as the proposed techniques enhance data sharing and promote collaborative genomic research.
The applicant’s career goal is to become an independent investigator with a primary appointment in a biomedical
informatics program, with a focus on genome privacy technologies, at a major US research university. His long-
term objective is to develop new privacy-preserving technologies for data sharing and data analytics, in order to
facilitate collaborative research efforts in genomics and precision medicine. The applicant proposes a carefully
designed career development plan, which includes a variety of training activities to complement his computer
science skills with additional biomedical knowledge and smooth his transition into an independent researcher.
The UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics will serve as an exceptional platform for his career
development, given the experience of several faculty in privacy technologies, computational biology, genomic
medicine, and close collaboration with other institutions worldwide."
10757372,"ABSTRACT
 The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in critically ill
patients, with nearly 200,000 cases per year in the US alone and mortality rates of 30-40%. Clinical trials of
novel pharmacotherapies in ARDS have met with nearly ubiquitous failure, a dismal track record which has
been attributed at least in part to the considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity within this syndrome.
With this strong evidence of significant clinical and biological heterogeneity and a major need for new therapies
to improve poor clinical outcomes, ARDS is a ripe target for the application of precision medicine, yet little has
been done to move from our current one-size-fits-all approach to ARDS clinical care and trials to a more
targeted and personalized approach.
 We recently identified and validated the presence of two distinct subphenotypes (also known as
“endotypes”) of ARDS in four large randomized controlled trials. In an independent analysis of all four
datasets, there was strong evidence for two different endotypes within ARDS: a hyper-inflammatory endotype
and a hypo-inflammatory endotype. These endotypes had strikingly different (1) clinical characteristics, (2)
biomarker profiles, (3) clinical outcomes, and (4) treatment responses. Most notably, significant endotype-
specific treatment responses were identified within three clinical trials previously thought to be “negative.”
While these data are highly promising, we have only a basic understanding of the biology of these endotypes,
of the full range of differential treatment responses they exhibit, of the impact of environmental exposures on
endotypes, and of how best to translate this growing knowledge base into practical tools for application at the
bedside and in clinical trials. In this application, we describe a research program that brings together expertise
in molecular phenotyping of critical illness, environmental exposures assessment, advanced statistical
approaches to analysis of complex multi-dimensional data, an experimental human lung model of ARDS, and
access to clinical trial networks and diverse heterogeneous patient cohorts, in order to determine the optimal
approach to applying precision therapeutics in human ARDS.
 This program has the potential to be paradigm-shifting by developing practical models for personalized
medicine for patients with ARDS, targeted to the biology of an individual patient's disease, with a significant
impact on both clinical trials and ultimately clinical care. In addition, these studies will have a high impact via
identification of endotype-specific therapeutic responses in completed and ongoing ARDS clinical trials and by
improving our understanding of the diverse biology of human ARDS, enhancing the likelihood that successful
new therapeutics will be identified for each endotype. Finally, this program will develop a framework by which
the principles of precision medicine can be applied to the fast-paced, rapidly evolving setting of critical care
medicine."
10757374,"We recently showed that serum levels of apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) predicted incident cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in CACTI, a prospective study of subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In complementary
mechanistic studies, we found that reducing APOC3 levels with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) prevented
lesion progression in a mouse model of T1DM and that apolipoprotein B (APOB)-containing lipoproteins were
driving accelerated diabetic atherosclerosis. These observations are important because they strongly support
the proposal that APOC3 promotes atherosclerosis in the setting of T1DM in both humans and mice. This is
particularly important because ASOs to APOC3 are under investigation in humans, raising the possibility that it
may be possible to reduce CVD risk in T1DM patients by lowering APOC3 levels.
 Our preliminary data strongly support the hypothesis that APOC3 accumulation in APOB100-containing
lipoproteins, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL, makes these particles atherogenic in T1DM. To
test this hypothesis, and to lay the groundwork for a clinical trial of APOC3 ASO therapy in the prevention of
CVD in T1DM patients, we propose two specific aims.
 First, we will determine whether levels of APOC3 in IDL and/or LDL predict incident CVD risk in the
Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study, a large prospective study. Our proposed study is
well powered with ~550 T1DM patients and >30% rate of incident CVD. These studies will take advantage of a
state-of-the-art method we developedtermed calibrated ion mobility analysisthat quantifies molar
concentrations of APOB100-containing lipoprotein particles in blood. Our primary analysis will be to determine
if i) IDL-APOC3 and/or ii) LDL-APOC3 predict incident CVD.
 Second, we will perform detailed metabolic studies to determine how T1DM alters hepatic APOC3
production and VLDL turnover rates, and how this impacts the accumulation of APOC3 in LDL and IDL in
humans with and without T1DM. Based on our mouse studies, we hypothesize that T1DM promotes increased
levels of hepatic APOC3 production that impairs TG lipolysis, resulting in increased levels of IDL-APOC3
and/or LDL-APOC3. We will complement these analyses with comprehensive analyses of the metabolic factors
(e.g., body fat composition, liver triglycerides, hepatic sinusoidal insulin concentration) that might regulate the
concentration of APOC3 in LDL, IDL and VLDL.
 Identifying patients at increased risk for CVD should provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of
accelerated atherosclerosis in T1DM. Moreover, it would lay the groundwork for a clinical study of APOC3
lowering therapy in T1DM because it could target patients at high risk of CVD."

The goal of this NIAID Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate,
Gwenyth O. Lee, with the training and protected time to build an independent, interdisciplinary research program.
This program would bridge computational modeling methods and community-based research to address key
questions in the field of enteric disease epidemiology. Stunted growth is a significant negative outcome of
frequent enteric infection among children under five years in low and middle- income countries (LMICs). A major
obstacle to the development of impactful interventions to prevent stunting has been methodological. Growth
faltering in children is the cumulative result of complex interactions between infectious exposures and dietary
inadequacies. Conventional statistical approaches are capable of, but not well-suited to, disentangling these
interactions to identify those modifiable factors with the greatest potential impact. On the other hand, systems
approaches are explicitly designed to capture complex interactions between multiple causal relationships.
Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic model that captures patterns of
feedback between infection, diet, and short-term growth dynamics and predicts how an individual infant might
grow, given different patterns of infection experienced in the first two years of life. This model will be used to test
whether feedback between infection and undernutrition has the potential to result in a ‘tipping point’, such that
enteric infections impact stunting only when the negative effect of these infections outpaces the infant’s biological
capacity for catch-up growth. The model will also be used to investigate mechanisms by which dietary
inadequacies modify the relationship between enteric infections and growth and to compare enteropathogen-
specific growth impacts. The model will be empirically based in 1) data from three Ecuadorian birth cohorts,
sampled across rural-urban gradient with variable burdens of enteric exposures but relatively homogenous infant
feeding practices and 2) data from six birth cohorts from multiple LMIC contexts (‘MAL-ED’ study), where enteric
exposures but also dietary and social conditions are heterogeneous between cohorts. To match the proposed
scientific work, the candidate will seek to integrate her experience in community-based enteric disease research
with the following training areas: computational modeling, including 1) system dynamics and 2) agent-based
modeling, and 3) the nutritional regulation of child growth.
This training will be augmented with 4) career-building
activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth. Experts have emphasized the need
to better integrate computational modeling into applied epidemiology research, thereby creating models that can
better predict contextually-tailored intervention strategies. The project builds upon the unique resources and
mentoring available to the candidate through the University of Michigan to provide advanced methodological
training, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings across the wider research community
and attain research independence."
10769816,"Cell-based therapies, where naturally or artificially engineered cells secreting therapeutic
proteins are grafted onto the body to act as biological drug factories, are an attractive
approach for long-term treatment of chronic diseases such as hemophilia, diabetes and liver
disorders. However, ‘off the shelf’ therapeutic cells are immunogenic to the host and must be
protected from the host immune system. Cell-encapsulation has emerged as an attractive
strategy to transplant these cells without chronic immunosuppression. Here, cells are placed
in an immune-isolating device which physically separates the cells from the components of the
immune system while providing access to oxygen and nutrients. Retrievable macroscale cell-
encapsulation devices (macrodevice), are attractive in this context as they provide a safer
path to clinical translation. Unfortunately, a standalone macrodevice that remains functional in
humans over long-periods (>6 months) is yet to be realized due to two core challenges: 1) a
foreign-body reaction to the implanted device causing inflammation and fibrosis, and 2)
inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the encapsulated cells. Here, we propose to
build on several promising recent advances in biomaterials design, microfabrication,
bioelectronics and cell engineering from our team to develop an advanced “smart”
macrodevice platform with integrated electronic components which overcomes the major
limitations of current device designs. First, we will develop an engineered cell line which is
amenable to long term encapsulation and suitable for clinical translation. Landing pads within
these cells will ensure stable transgene expression, allowing for broad control of therapeutic
protein secretion (Aim 1). Separately, we will develop a bioelectronic macrodevice as a
platform for long- term transplant of these cells in vivo. Our device will incorporate novel
membranes with uniform/controlled pore-sizes and enhanced oxygen transport properties. In
parallel, we will develop new surface coating techniques to minimize fibrosis and ensure long-
term graft survival. We will integrate proton exchange membranes and optoelectronic
components to allow a) in-situ oxygen generation, and b) optical gene activation to allow for
triggerable control of protein production by the encapsulated cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will test
the device in B6 mice using a model protein (SEAP) to test for long term survival of cells and
external control of protein delivery. We will develop the device as a platform to delivery of
Factor VIII for the treatment of Hemophilia A (Aim 3) as a model disease. If successful, the
platform will represent a qualitative technological advancement in the field of cell therapy."

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating and poorly understood illness. Its burden exceeds $202 billion a year in
direct treatment, societal and family costs. With no known cure and limited therapeutic options, 50% of patients
attempt suicide at least once; up to 30% of patients do not respond to first-line treatment - even with the latest
medications and psychosocial therapy - yet bipolar disorder has only received a small fraction of the amount of
research attention that goes into serious non-psychiatric illness. Differentiating BD from major depression is
crucial for understanding BD pathophysiology. Advances in imaging are beginning to offer the first detailed,
reproducible, and reliable data on brain changes in BD and how they progress, but the lack of global initiatives
in bipolar disorder has stalled research. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than a hundred
patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate, cannot adequately model
confounds, and often lack power to identify factors that modulate disease progression or recovery. Our ENIGMA
Bipolar Initiative offers a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach - a new source of power to unblock this
logjam by merging resources, capital infrastructure and talents of leading BD centers including data from
48 cohorts across the world. ENIGMA’s Global Alliance for Worldwide Imaging Genomics in Bipolar
Disorder - builds on our thriving ENIGMA Consortium. ENIGMA’s approach merges data from tens of thousands
of individuals and “gives us a power we have not had”, and is “breaking the logjam in neuroscience” (New York
Times). The Lancet hailed ENIGMA as “Crowdsourcing meets Neuroscience”. In designing the ENIGMA-Bipolar
initiative, we identified the most productive activities in the ENIGMA Bipolar working group, and organized them
into 3 themes - imaging, genomics, and cross-disorder comparisons. This global initiative tackles key
questions in BD: how does the illness affect the brain? What imaging and genomic biomarkers assist diagnosis,
monitor treatment, and predict outcomes? How do BD genetic susceptibility loci affect the brain? With global
data and expert teams from 15 countries (see Support Letters), we tackle imaging, genomic, and predictive
questions about BD with unprecedented power. Across Brazil, Japan, the US, Canada, Norway, The
Netherlands, Germany, France, Australia, and South Africa - what brain differences do we reproducibly
detect in BD (with structural/diffusion MRI, connectomics and resting state fMRI)? How do they vary across life,
with illness duration, by demographics, in women versus men, by age of onset, subtype and treatment? Using
ENIGMA’s harmonized protocols, we will analyze the largest collection of multisite neuroimaging data in BD -
diverse in age, ethnicity, treatment response - to track disease worldwide. In a new Cross-Disorder partnership
of ENIGMA-BD and MDD, we use ENIGMA’s data-driven models to detect imaging and genomic biomarkers to
distinguish the 2 disorders and identify subtypes. After harmonizing data elements across disorders, we will
create a ranked list of actionable factors that affect prognosis in BD."

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive challenges for health care systems and for global
economics. The surge in cases which occurred abruptly strained the existing resources to care for
the volume of patients, leading to a shortage of supply in many medications, personnel and equipment.
The mechanical ventilator became a particular problem as one newly published study reported that 18
out of 24 patients with COVID-19 in the study (75%) required mechanical ventilation. During the early
months of the pandemic many providers decided to intubate early on the assumption that patients
would eventually need mechanical ventilation so as to avoid ‘crash intubation’ and potential
contamination. A recent observational study of intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 suffering
from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure revealed that early invasive mechanical ventilation was
associated with an increased risk of day-60 mortality. One central problem in this context was
caregivers’ inability to predict which patients may need mechanical ventilation since existing methods
using clinical parameters are often subjective and inconsistent across different institutions. We have
thus applied machine learning algorithms to commonly available data in electronic health records
(EHR) to develop and validate a predictive model for 24-hours ahead prediction of respiratory failure.
This novel predictive model has demonstrated AUCs in the range of 0.90-0.94 in our internal and
external COVID-19 datasets. That is, we have a robust ability now to predict which patients may need
mechanical ventilation and which will not. We are now planning to deploy clinically and to improve
iteratively on our model by adding other data streams such as imaging to not only improve our
predictive ability but also to make the predictions more ‘actionable’, so that clinicians can pursue timely
interventions rather than just being told a prognosis. We are further addressing the many barriers to
implementation by addressing ‘clinician buy-in’ which involves making the underlying reasoning of our
algorithms more transparent, making the predictions seamlessly integrated into clinical workflow, and
finding actionable parameters that will allow both predictions and therapeutic interventions. Such an
algorithm will enhance the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk for respiratory failure, and ideally, to
anticipate and respond to patient needs in a timely fashion. Moreover, given a long enough prediction
horizon (48-72 hours) such systems can facilitate triage and optimization of related resources
(ventilators and personnel) within a given hospital and across healthcare systems. Finally, while the
COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for optimizing the timing of mechanical ventilation, the
techniques developed under this proposal are broadly applicable to other causes of respiratory failure
and to other types of organ support technologies."
10769822,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) adapt to local conditions, maximizing their potential to perpetuate and
emerge as health threats. The adaptive potential of arboviruses is driven by error-prone replication, which
creates a genetically diverse pool of competing virus genotypes within each host. This proposal examines
some of the ways that temperature may impact arbovirus evolutionary biology. Our previous research has
allowed us to make clear predictions about the outcome of each proposed aim, and generated molecular and
computational tools, and methodological approaches that we propose to combine in this project.
Global temperatures are changing at an unprecedented rate, and RNA viruses such as WNV continue to
emerge at a frightening pace. Our preliminary studies have shown quite clearly that temperature is a key factor
that dictates how natural selection affects arboviruses within mosquitoes. Therefore, Aim 1 will address how
temperature, both constant and fluctuating, with varying means and amplitudes, alters natural selection on
WNV within mosquitoes and the strength of bottlenecks. Our predictions (in general) are that fluctuating
temperatures will increase the strength of purifying selection, that diversity will be maximized at optimal
constant temperatures, and that bottlenecks will become wider as temperature increases.
Our results have demonstrated that flavivirus infections are most frequently initiated by aggregates of virus
particles. Aim 2 will address the extent that this occurs in a host- and temperature-dependent manner, bringing
our previous work into a more ecologically relevant, realistic context. In the second phase of Aim 2, we will ask
whether these genome aggregates can help to facilitate the maintenance of genetic diversity in the WNV
population.
Birds that generate high WNV viremia and are highly infectious to mosquitoes have significantly more unique
WNV genomes per cell than those that have lower viremias. Aim 3 will assess whether something similar may
occur in mosquitoes. We will use barcoded WNV to infect mosquitoes with a range of vector competence and
assess the number of unique WNV genomes per cell. As above, we also will assess the degree to which this
phenomenon may allow for the maintenance of low fitness viral genotypes while preventing those of high
fitness from gaining dominance.
This work will provide comprehensive data on the ways that changing environmental conditions may alter the
fundamental population biology of arboviruses. Our work is also significant because it will provide mechanistic
data on how viruses may maintain genetic diversity in the face of both selective and stochastic reductions in
genetic diversity. The proposed studies are technically and conceptually innovative because of the ways that
we can combine realistic transmission systems in the lab with barcoded viruses, single cell approaches, and
other new molecular tools."
10769800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a form of IBD that commonly involves small intestine, where the majority of Paneth cells
reside. As a great number of CD patients show no response or refractory to standard treatment, there is an
unmet need for new therapeutic options based on new mechanisms of action. Recent studies suggested that
defective Paneth cells may play the key role in initiating inflammation in ileal, and maybe ileocecal CD. Paneth
cells in CD patients or mouse IBD models often exhibit granule phenotypes characterized initially by Dr. Ta-
Chiang Liu, where several Paneth cell-enriched antimicrobial factors, instead of being packed into secretory
granules, are dispersed to the cytoplasm. Hypotheses relating to defective ER stress, autophagy, and secretion
have been developed to interpret these CD Paneth cell defects, however the cause-and-effect relationship
remains obscure. To date, existing studies has been treating Paneth cells as a homogeneous population. Based
on a newly developed temporally controlled Paneth cell reporter mouse model, we establish single cell
transcriptomic maps for ileal Paneth cells in homeostasis, dysbiosis, infection and inflammation conditions. We
found that there is a profound change in Paneth cell heterogeneity in response to microbiota alteration, infection,
and potentially genetic risk factors. Analyzing Paneth cell populations across different conditions revealed an
immunologically activated Paneth cell subset that has distinct antimicrobial peptide profile, enriched cytokine
receptor, and heightened innate immune and degranulation activities. Paneth cells carrying the signature
markers are found in ileal CD and UC metaplastic lesions. We will test the hypothesis that a dynamic Paneth cell
heterogeneity regulated by interactions of genetic, gut microbiota, and environmental factors such as pathogen
infection is critical for activation of Paneth cell-mediated innate protection against inflammatory induction and
aggravation. Aim 1 will determine the function and disease relevance of these Paneth cells by examine their
innate immune function, degranulation capacity, chromatin and epigenetic profile, in vivo role of specifically
secreted mucosal pentraxins, and relevance to CD Paneth cell defects and clinical outcomes. Aim 2 will test how
two Paneth cell intrinsic pathways and CD dysbiotic microbiota affect Paneth cell heterogeneity, by performing
Paneth cell specific genetic ablation and overexpression, as well as fecal microbiome transplantation in newly
developed germ-free Paneth cell reporter mice. This proposal addresses a significant and innovative hypothesis
relating to Paneth cell heterogeneity that may contribute to the causality and mechanism of Paneth cell-driven
CD pathogenesis. Once a new mechanism regulating proper Paneth cell activation and inflammatory protection
is identified, it may be leveraged for IBD intervention."
10769801,"Prior research and the 2018 NIA-Alzheimer’s-Association framework emphasize that novel insights into
the complex biology and heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are needed to develop efficient
interventions that can be tailored to persons’ unique risk profiles. These profiles are likely a result of an
interplay of many genetic and non-genetic risk and protective factors for AD, including those of vascular
origin, which are difficult to disentangle. Emerging evidence suggests also that ADs and vascular
diseases tend to cluster together. This project addresses an objective of PAR-17-054 on disentangling
heterogeneous interactions of genetic and AD/vascular risk factors in risk and resilience to AD, including
age-specific effects, by leveraging existing resources and engaging in activities that will improve
statistical power. Our approach, combining thorough methods of genome-wide association studies and
the rigor of the candidate-like methods in large samples, is built on: (i) core principles of evolutionary
biology in genetics of AD and other age-related traits characteristic of post-reproductive life, which deals
with an inherent heterogeneity in genetic predisposition to such traits, (ii) insights from prior studies of
such traits (including our own work), and (iii) promising results of our large-scale studies proving its
significance, feasibility, and potential to substantially improve power using the existing resources. This
research contributed to better understanding of weaknesses in the rigor of prior studies and provided
compelling evidence that our approach is a natural and critical strategy to advance the progress in
dissecting the inherently heterogeneous mechanisms of AD and vascular traits. The goal is to identify
personalized (i.e., more homogeneous, group-specific) mono/polygenic profiles of risks and resilience
to AD and vascular diseases in the disease-specific and pleiotropic contexts in prioritized loci leveraging
information from the AD-centered pleiotropic meta-analysis planned in this project and previous
analyses by our and other research groups, and identify the role of AD risk and other factors in these
profiles. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1. Identify specific and pleiotropic loci for AD
and vascular traits from new analyses and the existing studies. Aim 2. Dissect heterogeneity leveraging
the analysis of molecular signatures defined as differences in linkage disequilibrium structures in
affected and unaffected subjects. Aim 3. Identify personalized genetic profiles of AD-specific and
pleiotropic risks and resilience. Aim 4. Characterize the functional roles of SNPs from the identified
mono/polygenic variants and biological roles of genes for these SNPs. Characterize transcription
pathways for SNPs using individual-level gene expression and epigenetic data and summary statistics
from the available expression and methylation quantitative trait loci studies."
10769802,"Abstract
Early events in HIV-1 lifecycle, such as post-fusion trafficking of viral cores across the cytoplasm, through
the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and into the nucleus, remain poorly understood due to limited information
about virus-host interactions. Interactions of the core’s surface, which is composed of the capsid protein
(CA) arranged into large hexameric lattices and exactly 12 pentamers, with a variety of host cell proteins
that aid infection (dependency factors) are crucial for this journey. However, their full identity and molecular
mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Our preliminary studies resulted in the following two
principal discoveries. 1) We have identified SEC24C as a new, crucial HIV-1 host dependency factor.
SEC24C is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that employs a phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-motif to
specifically interact with the hexameric CA lattice at the hydrophobic pocket comprised of two adjoining
subunits. These novel findings, coupled with the known roles of other CA-binding FG-motif containing
cellular factors NUP153 and CPSF6 in nuclear import and integration site selection of HIV-1, suggest that
these proteins collectively provide a dependable platform for continuous HIV-1 journey throughout different
cellular compartments during the virus ingress to ensure productive infection. 2) We discovered a prion-
like domain (PrLD)-mediated mechanism for avid binding of SEC24C, NUP153 and CPSF6 to hexameric
CA lattices. Our preliminary cryo-EM and HDX-MS studies provide novel structural information indicating
that, in addition to known CPSF6 FG peptide binding to the cognate CA hydrophobic pocket, PrLD-PrLD
interactions enable polyvalent assembly of CPSF6 molecules along the extended lattices of adjoining CA
hexamers. Our virology experiments further support an essential role of CPSF6 PrLD in functional virus-
host interactions in infected cells. To extend these exciting, paradigm-shifting preliminary studies we
propose the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will define a role of SEC24C in HIV-1 infection; Aim 2 will
elucidate interplay between SEC24C and other CA-binding host factors; Aim 3 will determine the structural
basis for avid recognition of hexameric HIV-1 CA lattices by FG-motif and PrLD containing cellular factors
SEC24C, NUP153 and CPSF6. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a highly collaborative team
with complementary expertise in virology, proteomics, biochemistry and X-ray crystallography
(Kvaratskhelia), cryo-EM (Asturias), live cell microscopy (Melikian) and HDX-MS (Griffin). These studies
are expected to uncover novel virus-host interaction mechanisms crucial for HIV-1 infection. Furthermore,
elucidating structural determinants for functionally relevant interactions of SEC24C, NUP153 and CPSF6
to hexameric CA lattices will provide a new frontier in HIV-1 structural biology and improve our
understanding of these virus-host interactions as an important therapeutic target."

Abstract
The Hematology Research Training Program (HRTP) at the University of Pennsylvania was established in the
mid-1970’s. It has received NHLBI T32 funding since 1978 and to date it has provided support for 179 predoctoral
and postdoctoral trainees. The program’s mission is to sustain the hematology workforce by providing basic and
translational research experiences, training, career advising and mentorship to a diverse group of physician-
scientists and scientists. Our goals for the next 5 years include 1) providing the training and mentorship that will
allow our graduates to become successful investigators in settings that include academia, industry, federal
agencies, and the NIH and other research institutes, 2) helping to grow the research workforce in areas related
to hematology, blood cells and blood disorders, and 3) working with other T32-funded hematology research
training programs to exchange best practices and allow individual trainees to benefit from a wider network. The
current program directors are Lawrence Brass, MD PhD and Ivan Maillard, MD PhD, both of whom are members
of Penn’s Hematology-Oncology Division, where Dr. Maillard is the Vice Chief for Research and Dr. Brass directs
the MD/PhD program. The diverse participating faculty includes 47 trainers of all academic ranks. Policies are
in place for adding or removing trainers from the roster. Participation in mentorship training is expected by all.
NHLBI T32 support for the HRTP currently includes 8 clinical fellows and postdocs plus 4 MD/PhD and PhD
predocs. Renewed funding is requested at the same level. Participating graduate programs are primarily those
within the Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS) umbrella program, but some trainees will be in the Chemical &
Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) program. Key features of the HRTP include formal and informal advising,
workshops, attendance at national conferences, and training in the responsible conduct of research and methods
to enhance reproducibility. There is a well-received annual presentation and feedback session attended by our
Internal and External Advisory Boards, whose membership includes the directors of 5 other T32-funded research
training programs. Program outcomes. 143 postdocs (31 MD/PhD, 65 MD and 47 PhD) and 36 predocs (23
MD/PhD and 13 PhD) have been supported to date. Of the 153 who have completed all subsequent stages of
training, 76% have positions that we consider appropriate outcomes for alumni of this training program, including
71 (46%) who have full-time appointments at academic institutions or the NIH, and 31 (20%) who are employed
in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. In this proposal we present a plan for attracting, training and
mentoring a diverse group of individuals, monitoring their progress during training, and tracking their journeys
afterwards. A logic model and rubric have been developed to allow us to combine outcomes data with trainee

10788358,"As a hallmark of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), sleep disruption often precedes the onset of the severe memory and 
cognitive deficits associated with the clinical phase of AD by decades. It is estimated to affect 30-66% of AD 
patients, and its effects are debilitating and stressful for both the patient and the caregiver. However, the neural 
mechanisms underlying the association between sleep and AD are still poorly understood. Rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep, a sleep state that is associated with vivid dreaming and obvious cognitive processing, plays an 
important role in the regulation of learning and memory. Its disturbances manifest as decreased REM sleep 
duration and increased REM latency and are positively correlated with impaired cognitive functions in AD 
patients. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons are exclusively located in the lateral hypothalamus 
(LH) and project broadly throughout the brain. They are thought to play a critical role in the generation and 
maintenance of REM sleep and are maximally active during this state. Remarkably, these REM-active MCH 
neurons also mediate memory impairment by their projections to the hippocampus CA1 region. In clinical phase 
of AD, tau pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, can be observed in the LH. Furthermore, MCH levels are 
significantly elevated in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and are positively correlated to CSF tau 
level, REM sleep disruption and severity of cognitive impairment. These pieces of evidence suggest a role for 
MCH neurons in neuropathology of AD. In the proposed project, we will test the central hypothesis that LH MCH 
neurons become dysfunctional in the tauopathy condition of AD. Accordingly, using in vivo microendoscopic 
calcium imaging, ex vivo slice recording and PS19 mouse model of tauopathy, we will determine whether and 
how tau pathology affects the firing patterns of MCH neurons across the sleep-wake cycles in Aim 1. Using 
chemogenetic approaches, we will further determine whether manipulation of their neuronal activities improves 
sleep quality and enhances cognitive performance in Aim 2. The results of this project should help open the door 
to the development of circuit-based therapeutic interventions for AD-related sleep disorders and cognitive 
impairments."
10773201,"Lysosomes play a critical role in cellular metabolism, acting not only as catabolic hubs but also as the site 
of nutrient sensing and metabolic signaling. Lysosomal dysfunction has been implicated in the blinding 
disease retinitis pigmentosa. Mutation and deletion of lysosomal arginine transporters, including solute 
carrier family 7 member 14 (SLC7A14), have been reported as causative genes for autosomal recessive 
retinitis pigmentosa. However, it is currently not known how dysregulation of lysosomal arginine 
metabolism causes vision loss. Our long-term objective is to determine how SLC7A14 mutations cause 
blindness and the role for SLC7 A 14 in vision. The objective of this application is to determine the function 
of SLC7A14 in endosomes/lysosomes and how mutation of SLC7A14 causes retinitis pigmentosa. The 
significance of these studies includes resolving current fundamental questions on cellular 
compartmentalization of metabolism as well as development of strategies for therapeutic approaches 
targeting dysregulated metabolism in diseases. Our central hypothesis is that SLC7 A 14-dependent 
lysosomal storage of cationic amino acids is essential for photoreceptor health. We will test this hypothesis 
by determining and validating the cell type responsible for SLC7A14-mediated retinitis pigmentosa (Aim 1) 
and by investigating the function and regulation of cationic amino acid transport by SLC7A14 (Aim 2). In 
Aim 1, we will use mouse models to determine the cell type responsible for the pathogenesis of SLC7 A 14- 
dependent vision loss, which is currently not known but is critical to understand disease pathology and 
progression. We will test our hypothesis that loss of expression of SLC7 A 14 in horizontal and/or bipolar 
cells causes retinitis pigmentosa. In Aim 2, we will use elucidate SLC7A14 transport kinetics and regulation 
using cell lines and recombinant protein. We hypothesize that SLC7A14 aids in lysosomal storage of amino 
acids to buffer cellular levels of cationic amino acids in times of amino acid scarcity. The outcomes of 
studies will provide mechanistic insight into SLC7A14 function, which is essential to understanding the 
function of SLC7A14 in the cell and how its dysregulation contributes to vision loss."
10770366,"ABSTRACT
Yuma County is a large agricultural hub of the United States and provides over 90% of the winter leafy greens
consumed in the U.S. To maintain high agricultural output, more than 2.6 million kilograms of agrichemicals are
used in Yuma County each year. These agrichemicals represent a significant exposure source of toxic
chemicals for residents, especially the migrant and seasonal farmworkers and those living near agricultural
lands. Previous research focused on organic based pesticides and lead exposure sources, but inorganic
metals-based pesticides have not been examined in this area. I performed quantitative metal(loid) analysis of
human (n = 323) and rodent (Peromyscus eremicus, n = 300) hair samples and found concentrations of
neurotoxic metals (especially Cu and Mn) at levels known to be associated with adverse health outcomes.
Following these findings, preliminary transcriptomic analyses demonstrated disrupted genetic pathways,
including those associated with lipid metabolism and muscle contraction, in the brains of rodents that I
captured from agricultural sites, compared to non-agricultural sites, from Yuma County. Cu and Mn are
naturally occurring elements and are essential micronutrients in enzymatic reactions, but both are toxic at high
concentrations. Cu causes non-specific oxidative damage in tissues, while Mn accumulates in the basal
ganglia and dopaminergic neurons and is linked with behavioral issues in children and motor dysfunction in
adults. Farmworkers and communities near agricultural areas with high agrichemical application are an
understudied population regarding excessive Cu and Mn exposure. This proposal expands upon my
preliminary work that identified elevated concentrations of Cu and Mn in human and rodent hair collected in
Yuma County by using the P. eremicus rodent model to investigate transcriptomic and lipidomic responses to
exposure. Additionally, I am developing a similar approach in collaboration with the Cocopah Tribe in Yuma
County to assess the risk of contaminant exposure in their people. Under the guidance of a multidisciplinary
team, I aim to: Aim 1) assess effects of mixed metals exposure on brain gene expression in rodents collected
from agricultural vs. non-agricultural regions of Yuma County, using both non-targeted Nanostring and targeted
qRT-PCR approaches; Aim 2) assess effects of mixed metals exposure on brain metabolic profiles in rodents
from these two exposure regions, using liquid chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry;
and Aim 3) gather P. eremicus samples on Cocopah Tribal Lands to conduct preliminary exposure risk
assessment. This project will provide information on the neurological effects of exposure to metals used in
agriculture and aid in developing models that assess health impacts in the underserved population of
farmworkers and tribal members in Yuma County."
10916458,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this project is to advance the care of pediatric patients (up to 21 years of age) during
medical ground or air transport from one hospital to another within a regional network. The project will build on
our previous experience with neonatal patient transport and use a five-stage innovation cycle, including:
problem analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation to identify and address the salient
issues and risks of regional neonatal transportation for which new and innovative approaches are needed.
In collaboration with transport providers and other stakeholders, we will analyze current workflow processes,
transport records (local and statewide databases), and facilities at referral and receiving facilities to develop a
complete understanding of system issues and to define the current and ideal states. This detailed problem
analysis phase will enable the integration of real-time data into a transport “digital twin” model to optimize
regional consultation, triage, and transport of pediatric patients to facilities with the appropriate level of care
and availability of space and staffing.
With the input of clinical transport team staff and stakeholders, the project team will work with collaborators
from the University of Washington Industrial and Systems Engineering Department to integrate machine
learning into the Transport Monitoring and Communications (T-MAC) system to support the analysis of data
feeds while on transport. The machine learning augmented T-MAC system will undergo repeated testing and
revision to ensure that it can functionally and efficiently facilitate information flow between the medical control
physician, referring facility and transport team.
In addition, we will develop robust processes to support information flow to patients and families in the peri-
transport period. To accomplish this, we will work with families to identify gaps in communication and
connection to local and receiving facility resources and identify transport-specific needs.
The efficacy of the T-MAC system will be evaluated in a realistic in situ simulation and clinical settings. We are
confident that the lessons learned through this study will improve pediatric patient safety on medical transports
and will be transferable to patient populations that undergo both short and long-range interfacility transports."

Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and the second leading cause of death in the United
States. Molecular oncology is an interdisciplinary medical specialty at the interface of medicinal
chemistry and oncology that refers to the investigation of the molecular basis of cancer and tumors and the
development and application of targeted therapies. The field includes a diverse group of investigators with
strengths in cancer stem cells, DNA damage repair and genomic instability, tumor-host interactions, and other
fundamental areas of cancer biology. Areas of scientific focus in our program include basic cancer biology,
computational oncology, solid tumor oncology, and hematopoietic malignancies. The Molecular Oncology
Training Program at Washington University proposes to train the next generation of basic scientists, including 4
predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees per year. Predoctoral PhD students follow the curriculum of the
Washington University graduate school. After passing their qualifying examination, they enter the laboratory of
participating faculty Mentors for 3-4 years of laboratory research to complete their dissertation. Postdoctoral
Ph.D. trainees from around the world apply to participating laboratories. The duration of postdoctoral training
depends on prior experience, but typically they conduct research for 2-3 years before transitioning to an
independent research position. The current training program provides funding for 2 years for each trainee within
a structured program. Trainees receive intensive mentoring and career counseling, participate in program-
specific annual retreat, didactic course and clinical-translational mentoring rotations, journal clubs, and a variety
of specific scientific and career building workshops, as well as training in Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility.
Other courses, including those in Responsible Conduct of Research, are provided by the Washington University
graduate school and the Institute of Clinical Translational Science. Completion of this program will prepare
talented trainees for careers in basic and translational cancer research, to make discoveries that will transform
the diagnosis and treatment of malignant disorders."

The increase of people with complex chronic health conditions is stressing the U.S. healthcare delivery system.
People needing chronic care management (CCM) are at a high risk of medication safety issues and health-
related harms, such as hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Community pharmacies play a role
in ensuring patients’ safe medication use for CCM, but their efforts are undermined by volatile work demands
and other system barriers. In preventing medication hazards for people needing CCM, pharmacy staff are
further hampered by the historical preoccupation with what “went wrong” (a Safety-I approach), rather than
also considering the vast majority of times that things “go right” (a Safety-II approach). This project seeks to
reengineer the pharmacy system to advance a combined Safety-I and Safety-II approach to improve CCM.
Our transdisciplinary team of pharmacists, health services researchers, engineers, and quantitative and
qualitative researchers will partner with pharmacies in 2 large healthcare organizations (Advocate Health, UW
Health), and Boscobel and Center independent pharmacies, to design and evaluate a pharmacy work system
of care that optimizes resilience. To achieve this objective, we will create the Medication Safety Map
(MedSafeMap) for pharmacists and technicians to better navigate complex pharmacy tasks, and to facilitate
communication with patients and clinicians, while safely providing medications for patients dealing with CCM.
The CARE (Concepts for Applying Resilience Engineering) and SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for
Patient Safety) models will be used to define and address the complex pharmacy work system issues that
exacerbate medication safety risks for patients needing CCM. Human factors and systems engineering will be
used to carry out the AHRQ RFA-required 5-step method. Aim 1 will focus on problem analysis of the work
system through pharmacist and technician stakeholder observations and interviews, and analyses of work
system information flow and artifacts, which will illustrate relationships among work system features that are
then addressed in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will employ participatory design and in-situ simulations to develop and
design MedSafeMap detailing pharmacy redesign recommendations to optimize pharmacist and technician
interactions within their work system and with patients/caregivers. For Aim 3, we will implement and evaluate
MedSafeMap impact on CARE/SEIPS resilience outcomes – pharmacy staff attitudes, behaviors, performance,
and work demands (interviews and surveys), time involved in tasks (time and motion analysis), types and
quantities of services provided, and perceived changes in medication-related problems (self-reported data).
This innovative transdisciplinary PSLL seeks to redesign interactions to strengthen pharmacy staff resilience
while ultimately improving medication safety for patients needing CCM. This study, therefore, responds to an
AHRQ priority population (i.e., patients with chronic disease) and a patient safety priority “to examine effective
ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors” that span the medication use process continuum."

CEC 
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water are challenging environmental and public health 
concerns for communities, policy makers, and scientists. PFAS are a broad chemical class representing over 
3,000 chemicals; PFAS are valued for their non-stick properties and are used in many water- and stain-resistant 
products, as well as fire-fighting foam. The multiple chemicals classified as PFAS and a lack of toxicological and 
human health information make PFAS contamination a difficult issue for many communities to address. The 
Cape Fear River basin is the largest river basin in North Carolina. It provides drinking water for more than 1.5 
million people and has been impacted by PFAS contamination from many sources. This Superfund (SRP) 
Center's Community Engagement Core (CEC) will work to help communities impacted by PFAS contamination 
along the Cape Fear River become better equipped to address PFAS exposure as well as other environmental 
health concerns. The CEC will engage community organizations who are currently working to address PFAS in 
drinking water. We will work with these partners to measure social connectivity and assess and improve 
environmental health literacy, so that residents can make informed prevention and intervention decisions for 
improved environmental public health. Infrastructure, resources, and educational materials will be supplied by 
the CEC in order to increase the capacity of community organizations. Environmental Health Fellows, student 
Mini Grant research funding, and access to SRP analytical resources will support local research and engagement 
efforts around PFAS. SRP researchers and trainees will participate in CEC training and programming to improve 
their capability to collaborate with impacted communities. As best practices emerge, the CEC will contribute to 
community-engaged scholarship."

RETCC 
Investigations of environmental and health implications of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) require 
an integration of numerous expertise, including knowledge in multiple scientific disciplines, methodologies in 
data science, and skills in community engagement. Current pre- and post-doctoral preparations for addressing 
such complex problems are typically insufficient due to limited training in interdisciplinary research, lack of formal 
data management and analysis skills, and limited opportunities for real engagement with affected communities. 
The broad mission of the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) is to train all the 
Center's pre- and post-doctoral trainees (10 per year) to be future leaders and outstanding scientists capable of 
conducting high-impact research, independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team, to solve the PFAS 
problem and similar complex environmental and health problems. In coordination with the activities of the PFAS 
research projects, Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC), Analytical Core (CAPTURE), and Community 
Engagement Core (CEC), RETCC will develop and implement a comprehensive program for the trainees to 
become fluent across disciplines, technologies, and communities. An aim of the program is to provide the 
trainees with cross-training and fluency across disciplines, technologies, and communities through diverse 
research experiences, nanocourses to cover the relevant disciplines, data management and analysis modules, 
multidisciplinary seminars and journal club, and engagement with communities affected by PFAS. The program 
will also include professional and career development training by creating opportunities to work across disciplines 
as part of a multidisciplinary team addressing PFAS-related problems and to interact with engineers, 
epidemiologists, biologists, regulatory policy scientists, and community engagement professionals. An Individual 
Development Plan will serve as an evaluation and career development tool. This training program will involve 
authentic learning, focus on real-world projects involving PFAS, build communications skills, and increase 
fluency across disciplines and integration of the trainees into the team science approach."

(Biomedical Research) Research Project 1 
Project 1 is one of two Biomedical Research (BMR) Projects for the proposed “Center for Environmental and 
Health Effects of PFAS” being led by North Carolina State University (NC State). Per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) are common drinking water contaminants in NC and around the United States. Little is known 
about how long these chemicals stay in the body or what the human health impacts are. These chemicals have 
been detected in the drinking water of communities living along the Cape Fear River in NC. Working with three 
community groups along the Cape Fear River, we will evaluate PFAS exposure and thyroid health effects to 
people whose drinking water has been contaminated with PFAS. Disruption of thyroid hormones as well as 
metabolic outcomes such as obesity have been associated with PFAS in other populations. The three 
communities have exposure to different types of PFAS in their drinking water. Pittsboro, located on the Haw 
River in the upper region of the Cape Fear River basin, is exposed to historically used PFAS as a result of 
upstream use of firefighting foam, wastewater discharges, and land application of biosolids. The Fayetteville 
private well community is located near a fluorochemical plant that discharged PFAS to both air and water (Cape 
Fear River) since 1980; their wells are believed to be contaminated as a result of air transport. Wilmington, at 
the mouth of the Cape Fear River and downstream of the chemical plant, is exposed to both historically used 
PFAS (e.g., PFOA, PFOS) as well as a number of newly identified PFAS (e.g., GenX, Nafion byproduct 2). To 
study these diverse communities, we plan to recruit 1,200 individuals in the region (300 from Pittsboro, 200 from 
the Fayetteville private well community, and 700 from Wilmington) to evaluate how PFAS levels change over 
time, whether personal characteristics influence PFAS level as well as excretion from the body, and whether 
PFAS, either individually or as a group, influence thyroid outcomes. We plan to include individuals ages 6 and 
over who have lived in the region since July 2016. We will invite participants to clinic visits in Years 1 and 3 to 
collect blood and urine samples for PFAS and clinical analyses, administer questionnaires to obtain information 
on water use history, demographic characteristics, and medical and health outcomes. Working with our 
community partners, we will report back individual and community-level results on a regular basis. We will have 
Community Science Advisory Boards in each community to provide input to the study and ensure that the study 
investigators are well informed about community concerns. We anticipate finding PFAS mixtures in each 
community; we will use statistical approaches that allow us to evaluate individual PFAS while taking into account 
the complex mixture present. This study, with its complex mix of PFAS and racially diverse sample, will provide 
key insights to the human health implications of PFAS both in NC and around the world."

(Biomedical Research) Research Project 2
Biomedical Research Project 2 is one of two biomedical research projects proposed for the “Center for
Environmental and Health Effects of PFAS” being led by North Carolina State University (NC State). The primary
goal of the proposed Center is to provide highly relevant data and information to help the Superfund Research
Program (SRP) address the growing problem of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) contamination across
the United States (US). PFAS are considered contaminants of emerging concern for myriad reasons, but one of
the most pressing is that only a handful of the nearly 5,000 PFAS that are known to exist have been evaluated
for their toxicologic potential, even though numerous communities are being impacted by their presence in
environmental media, especially drinking water. Studies of humans exposed to perfluoroocatonic acid (PFOA)
and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), two PFAS detected with high frequency and concentration in human and
environmental samples, have provided compelling evidence that the immune system is a sensitive target of
PFAS. Additional work with experimental animal models supports the hypothesis that PFAS induce
immunotoxicity and alter responses of both the adaptive and innate immune systems. While PFOA and PFOS
are presumed to be immune hazards to humans, several gaps in knowledge exist: notably, the mechanism(s)
by which these PFAS induce immunotoxicity remain elusive, and the extent to which most PFAS of emerging
concern perturb immune function is largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of Project 2 are twofold: i) explore
molecular changes underlying PFAS-induced immunotoxicity in select animal models as well as human cell lines
to identify impacted signaling pathways and networks, and ii) determine the immunotoxicological profile,
including mechanistic underpinnings, of PFAS of emerging concern relative to the few well-studied PFAS. Our
global hypothesis is that PFAS-mediated immune suppression results from modulation of immune cell metabolic
functions. This hypothesis will be evaluated by (Aim 1) quantifying the impact of PFAS exposure on B cell
development and antibody production in a mouse model and (Aim 2) identifying the impact of PFAS exposure
on phagocytotic cell function using a zebrafish in vivo model and human in vitro cell line models. This project will
address significant gaps in what is known about the mechanisms by which PFAS induce immunotoxicity, which
will improve management of a known PFAS health risk, immune suppression, and accelerate development of
immune therapies for affected individuals. Additionally, the large number of untested PFAS also means that
methods for rapid prioritization are critical for informing appropriate regulatory measures; our project will uncover
molecular initiating events underlying altered immune responses to facilitate novel, immune-mechanism-based
prioritization strategies for PFAS recently detected in North Carolina and elsewhere."

(Environmental Science and Engineering) Research Project 3 
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that are of emerging concern because they are widely 
released into the environment where they tend to be persistent and bioaccumulative. Some PFAS are associated 
with adverse health outcomes in people, and production of a limited number of them (e.g., PFOA and PFOS) 
has been phased out due to these concerns. However, there are approximately 5,000 PFAS, and there is 
considerable uncertainty regarding the human health and environmental safety of these compounds because 
most PFAS have never been tested. Because these compounds are routinely released into waterways that serve 
as sources of drinking water and nutrition via consumption of fish and aquatic wildlife, there is an immediate 
need to better understand their environmental fate and effects. As concerns about PFAS in the environment are 
beginning to grow, there are increasing reports of the presence of these compounds in water and in aquatic 
organisms, but our understanding of their bioaccumulation potential and toxicity to aquatic life is limited. This 
project specifically addresses concerns about the bioaccumulation and toxicity of PFAS in aquatic food webs. 
One major goal of this project is to compare the accumulation of PFAS (12 different compounds) in a food web 
context by comparing aqueous uptake in primary producers (periphyton), primary consumers (mayflies), and 
secondary consumers (zebrafish) in the laboratory. A second major goal is to understand the potential for 
different compounds to move trophically in food webs by measuring the movement of different compounds from 
periphyton to mayflies to fish. Only by doing controlled studies in the laboratory can we systematically understand 
the bioaccumulation dynamics of these different compounds based on their different chemical structures. The 
next major goal of this work is to compare the toxicity of different PFAS to zebrafish. While zebrafish is a 
recognized model for human health studies, this project utilizes the deep understanding of this species' biology 
to explore the consequences of PFAS exposure to fish. The project will compare the toxicity of 12 different 
compounds in zebrafish using traditional toxicity approaches (exposures from water) but will be unique in that it 
will also assess the potential for dietary PFAS exposures to contribute to toxicity because in nature, exposures 
are likely to both PFAS in water and in the diet. Finally, these laboratory studies will be complemented by field 
investigations of PFAS in local waterways and in the tissues of aquatic fish and wildlife. This work is prompted 
by local contamination of a major watershed by a PFAS manufacturing plant and associated concerns about 
real-world exposures. Specifically, the project will measure PFAS in fish and wildlife (alligators) that are potential 
dietary exposure routes of these contaminants to people. Together, the project will provide much needed 
information about the bioaccumulation, toxicity, and exposure profiles of PFAS in the aquatic environment."

(Environmental Science and Engineering) Research Project 4 
Project 4 is one of two Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) Research Projects for the proposed 
“Center for Environmental and Health Effects of PFAS” being led by North Carolina State University (NC 
State). The primary goal of the proposed Center is to provide highly relevant data and information to help the 
Superfund Research Program (SRP) address the growing problem of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance 
(PFAS) contamination across the US, including contamination of drinking water sources. PFAS are considered 
contaminants of emerging concern, and remediation of PFAS-impacted sites is a critical and timely public 
health challenge. Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption is the most widely employed PFAS remediation 
technology. Although much is known about sorption of organic contaminants by GAC, predicting GAC 
effectiveness from laboratory data or from fundamental pollutant and GAC properties remains a significant 
challenge. Our long-term objective is to develop models that predict sorption of organic micropollutants, 
including PFAS, in GAC treatment systems. A critical barrier to improving existing models is that accessibility 
of sorption sites inside of GAC particles is not known. An important assumption of current models is that 
contaminants are uniformly distributed inside of GAC particles at sorption equilibrium. However, direct 
observations of sorbed contaminants suggest that sorption can occur preferentially near the external sorbent 
surface. This distinction is significant because it can explain why PFAS sorption capacity increases with 
decreasing GAC particle size and why laboratory experiments overestimate PFAS removal effectiveness of 
GAC. Our overarching hypothesis is, therefore, that sorption of PFAS (as well as many other organic 
pollutants) occurs preferentially in a shell region near the external GAC surface. The shell adsorption 
hypothesis will be evaluated by (Aim 1) observing and describing intraparticle PFAS distributions at sorption 
equilibrium and (Aim 2) quantifying and describing PFAS adsorption/desorption kinetics. Using innovative 
approaches, such as isotope microscopy, we will begin to open the “black box” that GAC still represents and 
directly observe intraparticle PFAS distributions. We will use information from direct observations in 
conjunction with results from sorption equilibrium and kinetic experiments to explain our data with a shell 
adsorption model. We expect that model parameters will be physically meaningful and can be predicted from 
fundamental sorbent and sorbate properties. Results of this project will support the development of effective 
sorbents for PFAS removal, the design of (cost-)effective GAC treatment systems for PFAS remediation, and 
the evaluation of management options for spent GAC."

 Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer related death in the USA and in the world. Activating
 mutations of the proto-oncogene KRAS (mutant KRAS, KM thereafter) occur in ~30% of non-small cell lung
 cancer (NSCLC). These cancers are associated with an aggressive phenotype, resistance to therapy and poor
outcome. Expression of KM in the respiratory epithelium is sufficient to initiate lung tumorigenesis.
 Furthermore, KM is required for the maintenance of established tumors. These observations establish KM as
a high priority drug target. Only a minority of patients with KM-driven LC benefit from therapy, including
 immunotherapy or KRASG12C inhibitors. Accordingly, patients with KMLC have a poor prognosis. Hence,
 there is an urgent need for effective therapies for KMLC.
 Cancer cells undergo oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming in order to meet the energetic and
biosynthetic challenges of cell survival, growth and proliferation. It has been proposed that these changes are
critical for the maintenance of established cancers. Indeed, we found that extinction of KM in LC of transgenic
mice leads to the perturbation of several metabolic networks including fatty acid (FA) synthesis.
 To determine the contribution of lipid metabolism to KM-driven LC, we characterized the lipidome of KMLC
with high resolution mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging MS (MALDI-IMS) and
functional experiments. Our preliminary data indicate that KM upregulates Fatty acid synthase (FASN) and
the synthesis of FA to repair peroxided phospholipids (PL) damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS).
 FASN is often upregulated in cancer, however its role has remained elusive. We found that inhibition of
FASN with TVB-3664, a first in class FASN inhibitor (FASNi), induces ferroptosis, a form of iron- and ROS-
dependent programmed cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides both in vitro and in vivo in
preclinical models of KMLC. Lipidomics analysis and functional experiments suppressing ACSL3, LPCAT3 and
PLA2G4C strongly suggest that in KMLC, FA serve a prosurvival function by feeding the Lands cycle, the main
process that remodels the peroxided acyl chains of PL, deflecting ferroptosis.
 These observations support the hypothesis that KMLC depends on FA to evade ferroptosis and to
promote tumorigenesis. We propose to test this hypothesis with a multifaceted approach that employs KM
transgenic mice, panels of LC cells lines, functional and lipidomics experiments. it is worth noting that our
group provided the rationale for a phase II clinical trial of TVB-2640, a FASNi derivative, in patients with
KMLC (NCI identifier NCT03808558). We anticipate that these studies will contribute to a better understanding
of cellular metabolic networks required for KM driven tumorigenesis, providing the framework for the development
of novel cancer therapies."

The goal of this proposal, PRegnancy OuTcomEs and subclinical Cardiovascular disease sTudy (PROTECT),
is to understand the trajectory of risk factors and mechanisms linking interrelated adverse pregnancy outcomes
(APOs) and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm delivery,
and small for gestational age are common APOs, increasing in incidence, and currently complicate nearly 1 in 5
pregnancies in the United States. These APOs are associated with increased short- and long-term risk of CVD,
which was the focus of a recent NHLBI Working Group. Despite phenotypic heterogeneity in the clinical
manifestations of APO subtypes (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm delivery, and small for
gestational age), these APOs are thought to be interrelated vascular disorders with shared underlying
pathophysiology related to defective placental development. The processes leading to abnormal
placentation begin long before APOs are clinically apparent, and women who later experience any of the APO
subtypes (including and in addition to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy) are more likely (but not universally)
to enter pregnancy with higher BP levels. Therefore, it is unclear whether APOs reflect latent CVD risk or are
themselves independent risk factors for future CVD. Moreover, women who experience any of these APO
subtypes have a higher risk of incident hypertension within 5 years post-pregnancy. However, development of
hypertension and other traditional CVD risk factors following an APO may only partially explain the increased
risk for later CVD. Preliminary data from small-scale biomarker studies suggest underlying mechanisms linking
APOs and CVD may be related to inflammation and anti-angiogenesis. Therefore, in order to elucidate the
pathways between APOs, and CVD, it is critical to begin with a woman’s first pregnancy and incorporate both
intra-pregnancy risk factor levels (upstream of APOs) and longitudinal follow-up post-pregnancy (downstream of
APOs). We propose to leverage the ongoing NHLBI-funded Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study:
Monitoring Mothers-To-Be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS): a racially/ethnically and geographically
diverse cohort recruited during the first pregnancy with rigorously adjudicated pregnancy outcomes, extensive
exposure data, and longitudinal follow-up. We will perform carotid artery ultrasound to assess standard and novel
imaging parameters to examine differences in women who have and have not experienced APOs. In Aim 1, we
will quantify the strength and directionality of associations between APOs and subclinical CVD, independent of
BP in early pregnancy. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which the relationship between APOs and
subclinical CVD is mediated by post-pregnancy BP. In Aim 3, we will identify early pregnancy proteomic
pathways that are associated with APOs and subclinical CVD. Completion of these aims will yield novel and
significant insights into the trajectory and mechanisms of development of subclinical CVD, inform tailored CVD
prevention strategies, and advance discovery of new therapeutic targets for women following APOs."

Faithful replication of DNA and response to encounters with aberrant DNA are essential to cell propagation and
survival. Our long-term goal is to understand the action of multi-protein DNA replication and damage response
machinery at eukaryotic replication forks. Our strategy is to elucidate the structural mechanisms using an
integrative structural biology approach, coupled to biochemical/biophysical characterization and collaborations
to define functional implications. This proposal focuses on critical unsolved questions about the initiation of
daughter strand synthesis in replication, and the stalling and remodeling of replication forks upon encountering
aberrant DNA. In DNA replication, the processive polymerases δ and ε require a short primer strand on the
template to function, which is generated by DNA polymerase a-primase (pol-prim). Although 3D structures have
been determined for all components of pol-prim and even the intact heterotetramer, these have provided only
limited mechanistic insights because structures of the full-length protein with relevant substrates and essential
co-factors are lacking. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we propose to determine the relevant structures
using Cryo-EM. We also propose to continue working on characterizing the structure, biochemical properties
and functional roles of 4Fe-4S clusters in pol-prim. We will test and refine our hypotheses about the role of: (i)
the primase 4Fe-4S cluster redox in modulating DNA binding activity; (ii) the role of the cluster in pol α in driving
the transition from RNA synthesis by primase to DNA synthesis by pol α. Together, these studies will solve the
fundamental questions about how pol-prim counts the length of the primer at each step and how the substrate
hand-offs occur from primase to pol α and then from pol α to pols δ or ε. Our second project addresses two
critical gaps in knowledge about replication fork encounters with aberrant DNA. RPA and Rad51 are two highly
abundant ssDNA binding proteins that have critical roles in the stalling, reversal and stabilization of stalled forks.
RPA-coated ssDNA is the key initiating signal for multiple damage response pathways and plays several
additional roles, including recruiting and directing the fork reversal activity of the ATP motor protein SMARCAL1.
We propose to elucidate the mechanisms that drive this important aspect of fork remodeling by determining the
structure of the RPA and SMARCAL1 on a model fork substrate complex using Cyro-EM. Rad51 plays an
essential role in the stabilization of stalled replication forks. Collaborative studies with David Cortez led to the
discovery and characterization of RADX, a new DNA damage response protein involved in regulating the activity
of Rad51 at stalled forks. We recently discovered RADX also interacts physically with RPA, suggesting there is
a RPA-RADX-Rad51 network operating at stalled forks. We propose combined structural, biophysical and
functional analyses of RADX and its interactions with DNA, Rad51 and RPA to clarify the roles of RADX at stalled
replication forks. Together, our two projects will greatly enhance understanding of how DNA is processed at
eukaryotic replication forks and genomes are maintained and propagated."

The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful
career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent
tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are:
Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to
understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of
knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation
sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and
collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an
independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology.
Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration
with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee
with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my
success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty
position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly
Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles.
Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and
phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an
acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development.
Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses
have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer
development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and
somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the
wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are
interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory
elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding
ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed
studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and
improve our understanding of disease etiology."

The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade regulating numerous biological processes,
including cell growth and fate decision, organ size control, and regeneration. The core of the Hippo pathway in
mammals consists of a kinase cascade, LATS1/2 and MST1/2 that controls various cellular processes through
orchestrating the phosphorylation of downstream substrates including YAP and TAZ. In keeping with a
possible tumor suppressive role of the Hippo signaling pathway, it has been found that Hippo pathway
dysregulation is common in many human tumors including breast, glioma, lung, colorectal cancer, and
endometrial cancer. However, although a few of upstream regulators and downstream substrates were
identified, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying how upstream signaling pathways control LATS1/2
kinase activity and its physiological functions in breast cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. Hence, the
major goal of this proposal is to explore the upstream regulator of LATS1/2 as well as to uncover a novel tumor
suppressor role of LATS1/2 in controlling tumorigenesis in the breast cancer setting. To this end, I have
obtained preliminary data showing that the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUD3, but not other OTUD family
member, specifically interacts and deubiquitinates LATS1. More importantly, I identified Raptor, one of the core
components of mTORC1 which is a central cell growth regulator governing cellular metabolism, as a novel
phosphorylation substrate of LATS1/2. In this proposal, I plan to: 1) characterize OTUD3 as a novel upstream
regulator that positively regulates LATS1/2 kinase activity largely through deubiquitination of LATS1/2; 2)
determine the physiological role of LATS1/2 in suppressing breast tumorigenesis largely through
phosphorylating Raptor at Ser606 site, which in turn inhibits the kinase activity of mTORC1; 3) determine
whether and how Raptor phosphorylation at Ser606 by LATS1/2 regulates breast cancer development in vivo.
The long-term goals of my career are to apply the insights of molecular and cellular biology studies to
understand the physiological significance of deregulated Hippo/mTORC1 signaling pathways that are important
in the development of human malignancies, especially in breast cancer, and to search for proper druggable
targets for better anti-breast cancer treatment. This K99/R00 award will provide protected time for me to
pursue the novel hypotheses of this proposal, obtain new skill sets to execute experiments and solve problems.
In addition, the K99 award will allow me to focus my efforts on independently conducting basic and
translational research, and to train future young scientists in the cancer biology field."

Parkinson’s disease (PD), characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via 𝛼-Synuclein (𝛼S)
aggregation, costs $51.9 billion annually in the US and is predicted to affect 1.2 million Americans by 2030.
Current treatments only provide limited and symptomatic relief, with no functional cure, largely due to the
mysterious nature in which PD is initiated. Thus, a deeper, mechanistic understanding of PD pathogenesis is vital
for effective treatment. An emerging hypothesis is that PD begins in the gut, where 𝛼S aggregates spread from
the gut to the brain via routes like the vagus nerve. Interestingly, these 𝛼S aggregates are detected in the gut years
before PD diagnosis. In addition, gut permeability and dysfunction are common in PD patients. Although these
intestinal pathologies likely lead to in the translocation of gut bacteria and microbe-associated molecular patterns
(MAMPs) into host tissues and subsequent induction of inflammation via innate immune receptor activation, this
has not been directly investigated. Thus, the role of gut bacteria and innate immune receptors in 𝛼S aggregation
and PD progression is unclear. Furthermore, mammalian models for PD like mice are biologically complex,
harbor a diverse gut microbiota, and cannot undergo unbiased mutagenesis screens to identify novel PD factors.
Thus, a minimalist model which is genetically tractable and permits mutagenesis screens for both the host and
individual microbes would empower identification of novel host and bacterial factors crucial to PD pathogenesis.
To this end, I propose to use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism widely used in disease
study and PD research, to investigate how gut bacteria may trigger inflammatory responses that exacerbate
DA neurodegeneration. The particular model that I will use co-expresses human 𝛼S and GFP in DA neurons,
causing a progressive loss of DA neurons as indicated by GFP signal loss. My proposed studies will use the
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique to inactivate genes crucial for gut barrier integrity and innate immune
receptors and then investigate the spatial role of these genes in PD pathogenesis by monitoring fluorescently-
labeled 𝛼S and GFP-labeled DA neurons. Furthermore, bacterial species or specific MAMPs will be individually
given to C. elegans as bacterial food sources or treatments, respectively, to identify what bacterial characteristics
may enhance or suppress PD. Lastly, I will conduct mutagenesis screens on C. elegans and individual bacterial
lawns to identify novel host and bacterial factors, respectively, which either promote or inhibit PD progression.
My proposed study will help identify novel therapeutic targets and treatments to block or potentially reverse PD,
using C. elegans as a cost-efficient screening tool. This project is highly interdisciplinary, combining
immunology, neurobiology, microbiology, enteric biology, and genetics. This strategy improves the possibility
of identifying novel factors and treatments which affect PD pathogenesis."

Dr. Shapiro is an excellent candidate for the NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award.
Currently, she is transitioning from a postdoctoral research position in the NIMH-funded T32 program for
Developmental Psychobiology, Psychopathology and Behavior (MH015442-39A1) to faculty in the Department
of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado. She has a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology and Biostatistics,
a Doctorate in Epidemiology, and an impressive publication and funding record.
The proposed research plan has two specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which an energy surplus
stimulus alters neuronal response within, and functional connectivity between homeostatic and non-homeostatic
brain regions in adolescents with and without obesity; and 2) Determine the degree to which neuronal
connectivity between homeostatic and non-homeostatic brain regions is associated with disinhibited eating
behaviors among adolescents with and without obesity. Dr. Shapiro has designed an innovative study to address
these aims that will employ functional neuroimaging methodology (Aim 1) and a directly observed measure of
disinhibited eating behavior (Aim 2). She will test the overarching hypothesis that altered brain function in and
between homeostatic and non-homeostatic brain systems underlie disinhibited eating behaviors in adolescents,
and that this is most pronounced in adolescents with obesity.
The career development plan supports the research aims and Dr. Shapiro’s transition to independence
with training in 1) Functional neuroimaging methodology and analysis; and 2) Eating behaviors in youth: theory,
measurement and interpretation. Her mentors, Drs. Jason Tregellas (primary), Susan Johnson, Marc Cornier
(co-mentor) are recognized experts in the fields of neuroimaging, eating behaviors, and obesity, respectively.
Dr. Shapiro will also receive additional training with leading experts in the field of pediatric eating behaviors at
the Pennsylvania State University (collaborators).
The University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus will provide a rich training and research
environment for Dr. Shapiro to accomplish her short- and long-term research and career goals.
Specifically, the University of Colorado Brain Imaging Center, with its research-dedicated 3T MRI scanner
(Director: Tregellas), will be a significant resource for Dr. Shapiro’s current and future research efforts. Dr.
Shapiro also has the full backing of her department (Psychiatry) which will continue to provide her with protected
research time, a start-up package with significant research funds, office space, and equipment. Furthermore, Dr.
Shapiro will have access to The Children’s Eating Laboratory (Director: Johnson), a state-of-the-art laboratory
for collecting observational data for eating behaviors in pediatric groups.
This award will help to establish the foundation on which Dr. Shapiro will build her expertise as a leading
scientist in the study of the neural underpinnings of pediatric eating behaviors and obesity risk."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impaired social
interactions, repetitive or restrictive behaviors, and difficulties with communication. ASD is highly prevalent,
affecting 1 in 54 children in the US. Whole genome and exome sequencing studies identified 192 high
confidence ASD-associated genes, many of which are expressed early in various cell lineages during brain
cortex development, including neural progenitors, immature and maturing neurons, and glial cells. In addition,
GWAS studies suggest the existence of non-coding genome variants that contribute to ASD phenotypes.
Exposure of mice to chemicals present in the environment, including bisphenol A (BPA), result in ASD-like
phenotypes, alterations in the cellular composition of the brain cortex, and changes in the binding of
transcription factors (TFs) in genes implicated in ASD. Based on these observations we hypothesize that
sequence variants present in the non-coding genome of different individuals, when altering regulatory
sequences, may influence the interaction of TFs with their target sites in response to environmental chemicals.
Phenotypic effects may be weak or undetectable in individuals carrying specific sequence variants but
exposure to environmental chemicals may amplify the effect of these variants on their interaction with TFs and
the ensuing phenotypes. To test these hypotheses, we propose to use a collection of iPSCs obtained from
normal and ASD individuals from different sex, age, and racial backgrounds. These iPSCs will be used to grow
cerebral cortical organoids, which will be exposed to BPA at different times during the differentiation process
to alter gene expression in different cell types of neural lineages. Single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq and snATAC-
seq will be employed to analyze TF occupancy and gene expression in specific cell populations during the
differentiation of brain organoids in the presence or absence of BPA. This will allow us to monitor the effect of
BPA on differentiation pathways and relative ratios of different neural cell lineages. We will then identify
differential BPA-responsive ATAC-seq peaks among brain organoids arising from different iPSCs that correlate
with cellular differentiation and gene expression phenotypes related to ASD. We expect that these differential
ATAC-seq peaks will correspond to sequence variants present in regulatory sequences of different iPSC lines
that affect the expression of specific genes involved in ASD. This will be tested using massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRAs) in cell lines corresponding to the affected cell type, and cerebral organoids. The role of
specific SNPs in gene expression will be further tested using single-base scarless genome editing. Finally, the
possible contribution of these BPA-responsive SNPs to autism phenotypes will be analyzed by performing
snATAC-seq in post-mortem brain samples from ASD patients. These results will fill an important gap in our
knowledge of the fundamental principles by which genome variants can respond to chemicals present in the
environment to affect lineage commitment of neural cells and elicit ASD symptoms."

Research: EMT induction in cancer cells initiates the metastatic cascade by promoting motility and invasiveness 
through  cell-­autonomous  mechanisms.  Our  group  has  shown  that EMT  also  increases  the  secretion  of  proteins

elucidate the molecular underpinnings of EMT-­dependent secretion in LUAD. In my preliminary results, I show that 
the  EMT-­activating  transcription  factor  ZEB1  upregulates  the  expression  of  Rab6A  and  Rab8A  by  silencing 
microRNAs that target these effectors. I show that ZEB1 requires Rab6A and Rab8A to drive polarized trafficking 
of secretory vesicles toward the leading edge of migrating LUAD cells, to increase cytokine secretion, to generate

Adoptive cell therapy using T cells modified by gene transfer to express T cell receptors or synthetic chimeric
antigen receptors (CARs) that specify T cell recognition of tumor associated antigens can be effective in
patients with refractory malignancies. Clinical data has shown that tumor cells that express low levels of
antigen or that have heterogeneous antigen expression can escape and cause relapse. To address the barrier
of low antigen density on tumor cells, we have designed novel synthetic hybrid receptors based on principles of
T cell receptor signaling that have superior properties and may be capable of eliminating tumor cells with low
antigen levels. To address the barrier of heterogeneous antigen expression on tumor cells, we designed
colocalization-dependent orthogonal protein switches that perform ‘AND’, ‘OR’, and ‘NOT’ Boolean logic at the
cell surface. In principle, this approach can instruct T cells to eliminate heterogeneous tumor cell populations
and spare normal antigen positive cells, extending the constellation of antigens that can be safely targeted.
The studies in this application will advance these two classes of next generation synthetic receptors for
multiple clinically relevant target antigens to achieve more effective and safe elimination of tumors with low
and/or heterogeneous antigen expression. The specific aims are:
Aim 1: To evaluate signaling and function of novel CAR/TCR hybrid receptors in primary T cells.
Signaling, synapse formation, antigen sensitivity, and in vivo function and fate of T cells expressing CAR-TCR
hybrid receptors introduced by lentiviral transduction or by knock-in to the T cell receptor alpha gene locus, will
be compared to T cells expressing CD28/CD3z and 4-1BB/CD3z CARs targeting the same antigens.
Aim 2: To evaluate chimeric costimulatory receptors for T cells engineered with CAR/TCRs. We will
evaluate whether the addition of costimulation in CAR/TCR engineered T cells by co-expressing chimeric
molecules that engage a tumor associated ligand will enhance antitumor function.
Aim 3 To design OR and AND gated CARS specific for multiple myeloma (MM) antigens and evaluate
their ability to prevent tumor escape. Multiple myeloma is responsive to T cell therapy targeting single
antigens, but tumor cell heterogeneity allows escape. Co-localization dependent protein switches that can
perform OR and AND logic gated recognition of heterogeneous tumor cells will be developed and evaluated for
targeting multiple myeloma antigens."
10758788,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a group of severe birth defects that collectively represent the leading cause
of birth defect-associated illness and death. Despite the extensive use of clinical genetic testing and whole exome
sequencing (WES), less than a third of CHD cases can currently be accounted for by mutations in protein-coding
genes. Many of the remaining, currently unexplained cases are assumed to be due to non-coding sequence
variants that alter the expression of genes essential for cardiac development. To uncover non-coding variants in
CHD patients, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Bench to Bassinet (B2B) and TopMed programs
are using whole genome sequencing (WGS) on large CHD patient cohorts, principally for probands whose prior
WES failed to uncover a likely causative coding variant. WGS of 1,831 patient-parent trios from the B2B cohort
is currently available, with several hundred additional trios currently being sequenced. Initial analyses of ~750
probands have already identified over 2,000 de novo variants in predicted fetal human heart enhancers, along
with a statistically significant excess of genetic loci (27 genes versus 3.7 expected, p=1x10-5) at which the
neighboring human fetal heart enhancers showed multiple de novo variants in cases. This suggests that CHD
risk is conferred through dysregulation of the respective target genes of these enhancers. However, the causality
of these variants in CHD, as well as the molecular underpinnings of their potential pathogenicity, remain to be
demonstrated. Building on our extensive previous work in mapping and characterizing cardiac enhancers at
scale, we propose to perform systematic in vivo functional validation of de novo sequence variants from CHD
patients that reside in predicted heart enhancers to reveal enhancer mutations that contribute to the etiology of
CHD. We will 1) use a combination of comprehensive maps of predicted human heart enhancers, genetic and
epigenomic analysis tools, and massively parallel reporter assays in cardiomyocytes differentiated from induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs) to identify and prioritize cardiac enhancers harboring de novo variants from
CHD patients, 2) use our world-class mouse transgenesis pipeline in combination with novel single-cell
characterization methods to test the reference and variant alleles of 200 prioritized enhancers (400 alleles in
total) at appropriate stages of cardiac development to assess how the risk alleles alter enhancer function in vivo
at cellular resolution, 3) use CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to generate 20 knock-in mouse models for
human CHD variant alleles that alter enhancer activity and matched human reference alleles to assess their
impact on the structure and function of the heart using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and cardiac
phenotyping. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide foundational insights into the role of
non-coding regulatory sequences in the most common severe human birth defect, identify specific examples of
human enhancer variants conclusively implicated in disease, and provide initial mechanistic insights into their
respective mode of action to provide new avenues for exploring future therapeutics."

Both children and adults in rural areas have higher obesity rates than their urban counterparts. With less access
to evidence-based weight loss interventions, obesity poses a major risk factor contributing to elevated morbidity
and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer among rural Americans. Obesity runs in families
due to multiple factors including hereditary components, home environment, and behavioral modeling around
dietary intake, physical activity, and screen time. Thus, targeting the rural family unit has the potential to enhance
weight loss for adults and children simultaneously. Previous research from our team indicates that mHealth is
feasible and acceptable for the delivery of obesity interventions to rural families as this type of intervention lowers
child Body Mass Index z score (BMIz) and helps children and families to significantly change their health
behaviors. The current application extends this work in a new and innovative direction, targeting parents first
with an empirically supported obesity intervention, and then moving on to treat the family unit. In a randomized
trial, we propose to compare a 4-month parent-only intervention followed by a 6-month family based behavioral
group intervention (iAmHealthy-Parents First) to a parent wait-list control followed by the family based
behavioral group intervention (iAmHealthy). Parent/child dyads will be recruited from both rural elementary
schools and rural medical clinics in 8 towns. Each town will consist of a single site and will recruit 30 parent/child
dyads, 15 of whom will be randomly assigned to iAmHealthy-Parents First and 15 to iAmHealthy, for a total of
240 parents and 240 children. Each rural town will have a population < 20,000 and/or the Rural Urban Commuting
Area Codes of 4 or greater, and for the purposes of the study will include a nurse at a rural health clinic partnering
with a nurse at a rural elementary school to make a single site. In Aim 1 we propose to study effectiveness
through change in child BMIz and parent percent weight loss from baseline to month 10 (post-intervention), as
well as through change in diet, change in physical activity and change in parent and child weight related quality
of life. In Aim 2, we propose to assess mediators and moderators that we believe are specifically important to
the treatment model and to the rural population. In Aim 3 we propose to explore the reach and representativeness
of the intervention, and to explore a concept we have found key in both our adult and pediatric trials – nurse
engagement. Our experience suggests that nurse engagement plays a key role in recruitment, retention, and
engagement of the families, and here we propose to assess nurse engagement as well as foster it through the
development of a Rural Nurse Engagement Collaborative. This exploratory aim will provide critical pragmatic
data to inform future studies aimed at testing local implementation and dissemination strategies. The iAmHealthy
Parents First intervention is an easily scalable, widely disseminable obesity intervention option which could
significantly improve the way we treat obesity among rural families."

10771147,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health crisis, characterized by pneumonia and
multiorgan dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that community-acquired pneumonia increases the long-
term risk of cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need to investigate the incidence and mechanisms of
cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 survivors. Thus, we propose a novel investigation of the intermediate and
long-term cardiac, vascular, and renal consequences of COVID-19.
Acutely, COVID-19 is associated with microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic events and inflammatory-
and stress-related injury in the heart, kidneys, and vasculature that may put COVID-19 survivors at particularly
elevated risk of chronic complications. Our study team has combined expertise in the study of post-pneumonia
cardiovascular risk, vascular and kidney pathophysiology, epidemiologic outcomes research, and
implementation of longitudinal prospective cohort studies. Our goal is to examine the natural history of cardiac,
vascular, and kidney disease in COVID-19 survivors, and to identify risk factors for adverse longitudinal
outcomes in these patients. We propose a prospective cohort study evaluating 1) cardiovascular events in a
large, electronic health record-based cohort of survivors of COVID-19 in our health system compared with
matched controls (“MACE cohort”) and 2) detailed vascular and renal phenotyping in a smaller cohort of COVID-
19 survivors compared with matched controls (“deep phenotyping cohort”). In the MACE cohort, we will collect
detailed hospitalization, demographic, and clinical data as well as records for post-COVID-19 hospitalizations.
An expert physician panel will prospectively adjudicate hospitalization records to evaluate for post-COVID-19
MACE (heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, serious arrhythmia, stroke, peripheral artery
disease, and death). In the deep phenotyping cohort, we will perform serial quantitative measurements of
vascular health in large, medium-sized, and small arteries, specifically: (1) pulse wave velocity (the reference
standard measure of large artery stiffness), (2) flow-mediated dilation (a measure of endothelial function), and
(3) microvascular structure assessed by sublingual imaging. We will also perform serial measurements of kidney
function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, markers of tubular injury, and exploratory ultrasound
images to estimate fibrosis). We aim to assess the long-term incidence of and risk factors for MACE in COVID-
19 survivors, and to evaluate the trajectory of microvascular and macrovascular health and kidney function over
time in these patients. Our mechanism-driven approach will provide critical guidance on longitudinal
cardiovascular risk and vascular and kidney damage following COVID-19 infection. The results of this study will
enhance our understanding of the long-term target organ effects of COVID-19 and identify risk factors that can
be targeted by future interventions to ultimately reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 survivors."
10771150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD), particularly from biallelic mutational loss of
BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM (BRCA/ATM), is significantly enriched in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC). Such patients have multiple FDA-approved systemic life-prolonging therapies to choose
from, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, and taxane chemotherapies, as well as the possibility of poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy which currently remains investigational. A few recent studies
suggest that patients with germline and/or somatic HRD mutations may respond better (and for longer
durations of time) to novel hormonal therapies than their HRD-negative counterparts. These studies suggest
that in addition to PARP inhibition, potent AR suppression is also “synthetic lethal” with HRD in mCRPC.
However, the genetic/genomic determinants of HRD and their role in treatment selection remain unknown. We
propose a resource-driven, patient-centered study to determine the genetic/genomic drivers of HRD predicting
“deep” response to abiraterone and enzalutamide. We hypothesize that mCRPC patients can be categorized
into three groups according to HRD status defined by deleterious mutations in HRD genes: 1) germline/somatic
HRD; 2) somatic-only HRD; 3) negative HRD; and that these groups are molecularly distinct, and have
different clinical implications as predictive markers of response to AR-targeting therapies and taxane
chemotherapies. To address the overall hypothesis, it is necessary to establish clinical and tumor/normal
specimen cohorts that enable detailed molecular and clinical characterization of HRD in men with mCRPC. In
Specific Aim 1, we will seek to ascertain the HRD mutations status, both somatic and germline, in three
existing advanced/lethal prostate cancer cohorts enriched for HRD using blood-based assays. In Specific Aim
2, we will determine the association of HRD status defined by blood-based assays with treatment response to
first-line AR-directed therapy (abiraterone/enzalutamide) and taxane chemotherapies in mCRPC patients by
comparing treatment outcomes of men in these three groups. In Specific Aim 3, we seek to determine the
expression correlates of HRD status defined by blood-based assays and further ascertained by tissue-based
assays, by performing RNA-Seq in surgical specimens from men with lethal prostate cancer with: 1)
germline/somatic HRD; 2) somatic-only HRD; and 3) negative HRD. The proposed work addresses an unmet
need due to focus on liquid biopsy markers in a vulnerable patient population facing difficult treatment
decisions. Also, our effort in defining the clinical and functional implications of HRD status in established
cohorts of mCRPC patients will directly lead to treatment selection strategies to improve clinical management
as well as patient selection strategies for clinical trials."
10771152,"Antigen-specific immunotherapies have long been pursued for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). So far most
exploited are antibodies targeting the membrane-distal V-set domain of CD33, a glycoprotein displayed on the
cell surface of leukemic blasts in almost all cases and possibly leukemia stem cells in some. Improved survival
of some patients with gemtuzumab ozogamicin validates this approach but many patients with CD33+ AML do
not benefit from this antibody-drug conjugate, prompting interest in developing improved CD33-directed
therapeutics. Because AML cells are exquisitely radiosensitive across the entire genetic disease spectrum, a-
emitting radionuclides are ideal to arm anti-CD33 antibodies. Unlike b-emitters, they deliver a very high amount
of radiation over just a few cell diameters, thereby enabling precise and efficient target cell kill (as few as 10 a-
particle hits are sufficient to kill a malignant hematopoietic cell). Early clinical trials with an anti-CD33 antibody
labeled with actinium-225 (225Ac-lintuzumab) have been conducted. Besides high cost, however, important
shortcomings include the long half-life of 225Ac, leading to freely circulating radionuclide if not retained effectively
in target cells, and the release of daughter radionuclides after decay of 225Ac with risk of associated toxicity to
healthy tissues. We hypothesize that labeling with astatine-211 (211At), an a-emitter we have focused on because
of its shorter half-life and because it decays without production of any long-lived or potentially dangerous
daughter isotopes, will provide a novel, superior form of CD33-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Using
humanized mice, we have recently generated a panel of fully human antibodies recognizing either the V-set
domain or, as the first group, the membrane-proximal C2-set domain of human CD33. Since the V-set but not
C2-set domain is missing in some CD33 variants, C2-set domain-directed antibodies can recognize all naturally-
occurring variants of CD33 (i.e. are “CD33PAN antibodies”). With these antibodies available, we now plan to
optimize CD33-directed RIT for application in AML patients, focusing on 211At. To accomplish this task, we have
assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in developing
radioimmunoconjugates and other antibody-based therapeutics for AML. Envisioning broad use, we will study
211At-CD33 RIT as “stand-alone” therapy and as augmentation of HCT conditioning, focusing on MHC-
haploidentical in vivo models AML. Since many HCT candidates do not have an HLA-matched donor, facilitation
of alternative donor HCT remains a critical unmet need, particularly for the extension of this lifesaving option to
patients from ethnic minority groups. We expect results from our studies will be readily translatable into the clinic
and are anticipated to have an important positive impact as they will provide the groundwork for a new treatment
option for patients with AML and other CD33+ neoplasms, for whom current treatment outcomes are
unsatisfactory."

The overall goal of the LSU Superfund Research Center (LSU SRP) is to understand how redox-active metal
oxides and organic pollutants associated with particulate matter (PM) react to form environmentally persistent
free radicals (EPFRs) and secondary pollutants (e.g., dioxins); how EPFRs are stabilized and decay; and how
EPFRs induce cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction. To solve these complex research questions, the
LSU SRP brings together scientists from diverse areas, including chemistry, physics, environmental sciences,
and toxicology. To date, the LSU SRP has trained more than 30 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
these diverse research disciplines. LSU SRP trainees receive their research training through work defined by
the individual research projects but receive additional training through programs administered by the Research
Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC). The Core has enhanced trainees’ training and
professional development through unique programs meant to increase their appreciation of transdisciplinary
collaboration; for communicating to diverse audiences, including teachers, K–12 students, and community
groups; and for the ethical conduct of research. The RETCC will continue to facilitate the professional
development and training of all LSU SRP trainees through three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, cross-disciplinary
education in the environmental and biomedical sciences will be enhanced through innovative programs. For
example, the RETCC will continue to provide webinar-based biweekly meetings for cross-disciplinary

available on our campuses. In Aim 2, the RETCC will support the professional development of trainees by
providing education programs in writing, presentation skills, interviewing, and leadership. In an innovative
approach, trainees have now organized themselves into a Leadership Advisory Board with the vision that
trainees will learn leadership skills by directing the activities of other trainees. In Aim 3, trainees will mentor
undergraduates completing a service-learning course at a local historically black university. Together, the
trainees and their mentees will play a key role in facilitating bidirectional communication between SRP

Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), while increasingly appreciated for their importance in
particulate matter (PM), remain understudied. They are an important contaminant at many Superfund sites,
and are a unique component of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences’ portfolio. Nearly 30%
of Superfund sites employ some type of thermal treatment (TT) and thus produce EPFRs. We have repeatedly
shown that EPFRs form and persist on PM generated by combustion and TT of chlorinated hydrocarbons and
other hazardous substances and are present in contaminated Superfund soils and airborne PM near
industrialized Superfund sites. TT remediation processes result in the production of EPFRs that adversely
affect respiratory and cardiovascular health of those living near Superfund and hazardous waste TT sites. The
Materials Core (MC) is a research service Core tasked with providing material and analytical support for the
biomedical research (BMR) and environmental science and engineering (ESE) Projects. Within our program
we have developed such model systems that allow for the studies of EPFRs using a bottom-up approach (i.e.,
starting with simple, EPFR-only samples, proceeding through more complex, multicomponent EPFRs up to
actual field-collected EPFRs with variable composition). EPFR generation and characterization, according to
requested specification and compositional design, is unique to the MC. Laboratory-made samples, with
composition control, are a logical choice for systematic research studies. We will continue to generate EPFR-
particle systems containing other transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, and Zn, as MexOy) and chlorinated benzenes,
phenols, and chlorinated biphenyls because they are present in soils at wood-treating Superfund sites and
catalyze pollutant formation (i.e., dioxins). A new particle generation system expands our studies to complex
EPFRs stabilized on iron, the most common transition metal in PM present in many combustion by-products
from TT. This new, two-stage combustion reactor developed in the MC, allows for synthesis of complex
EPFRs—with combustion-driven composition and controlled EPFR content—which will be supplied to Projects
1, 2, 4 and 5. Additionally, the MC will assist Project 3 by providing specialized analytical capabilities and/or
new techniques and methodologies in relation to particle collection, characterization, and human exposure
assessment. This work is also being done in collaboration with the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and
the Research Translation component of the Administrative Core to discuss potential chemical hazards and
exposures with the communities. Through Project 3 and the CEC, the MC will work with communities and
stakeholders to identify, quantify, and address environmental health hazards related to the vicinity of
Superfund sites and Superfund materials remediation/TT."
10772189,"Project Summary/Abstract: Inhalation Toxicology Core (ITC)
Recreating an environment representative of real-life exposure scenarios is critical for experimental studies.
Inhalation is the most representative route of human exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM). The
assessment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction induced by inhaled PM is complex and involves a variety of
factors, including the physicochemical properties of the PM in its actual exposure form and dose. Innovative,
state-of-the-art exposure techniques are essential to reliably conduct in vivo and in vitro inhalation studies.
Therefore, to complement the physicochemical characterization of the bulk particles containing environmentally
persistent free radicals (EPFRs), as determined by the Material Core (MC), the Inhalation Toxicology Core
(ITC) will generate, deliver, and characterize EPFR-aerosols for the in vivo and in vitro exposures of LSU SRP
Projects 1 and 2. The mission of the ITC is to provide the expertise, training, facilities and equipment
necessary for LSU SRP investigators to expose either mice or cell systems to aerosolized and well-
characterized EPFR-containing aerosols, as well as to assess lung function in exposed mice. This support is
highlighted through three specific activities: 1) Generating stable EPFR-aerosols under real-life environmental
exposure conditions, as well as characterizing the physicochemical properties of the inhalable aerosols in the
breathing zone of the mice for Projects 1 and 2. Since it is hypothesized that EPFR-induced cardiopulmonary
dysfunction involves induction of oxidative stress at the air-blood interface, a unique innovative advantage of
this integrated EPFR-aerosol inhalation exposure system is that it facilitates mechanistic studies by allowing
dosimetry of environmentally-relevant particles of known size distribution capable of reaching the alveolar
region. 2) Providing support for lung function testing in mice for Project 1 via invasive techniques. The ITC will
provide the equipment, for instance the flexiVent system, to assess lung function (resistance and compliance)
in mice exposed by inhalation to EPFR-aerosols. 3) Generating and characterizing EPFR-aerosols for in vitro
exposure models at the air-liquid interface (ALI) of co-cultured cells for Projects 1 and 2. The ALI environment
simulates realistic pulmonary deposition patterns and cellular dosimetry, allowing for suitable cellular and
molecular responses. Overall, the outstanding research capabilities of the ITC permits investigators to obtain
both in vivo (functional and physiological) and in vitro (cellular and molecular) results following exposures to
EPFR-aerosols under similar exposure conditions and characterization methods. Thus, allowing for elucidation
of precise EPFR-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction mechanisms through novel complementary in vivo and
in vitro data-sets. In conclusion, the ITC is a central interdisciplinary platform, custom designed to fit the overall
goals of the Center by incorporating real-world exposure data, scenarios, and samples collected from Project 3
and characterized in collaboration with the MC, as well as providing the exposure methodology and expertise
for Projects 1 and 2."
10772191,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 1
Nearly 53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund remediation site. Superfund sites contain a wide va-
riety of pollutants, including organic chemicals, metals, carbonaceous material, and silica. Although each of
these components is capable of damage to organisms, their potential to combine into unique hazardous agents
has been understudied. Interestingly, when these agents are present together, particularly during thermal re-
mediation, they combine to form particulate matter (PM) with chemisorbed free radicals that persist in the envi-
ronment and biological systems. Over the prior funding cycle, we established that these environmentally per-
sistent free radicals (EPFRs) represent underappreciated pollutant species, induce oxidative stress and dam-
age, and negatively impact respiratory health. EPFRs are produced during thermal treatment (TT) of hazard-
ous wastes and nearly 30% of all Superfund sites (excluding groundwater) are remediated by TT. EPFR con-
centrations near Superfund sites range from 1x1018 - 4x1019 EPFRs/g (spins/g) of PM. This suggests a vast
number of US residents are exposed to PM containing EPFRs. Short-term inhalational EPFR exposure elicited
a Th17 inflammatory response similar to the severe asthma phenotype in humans. Mechanistically, we
demonstrated a role for Th17 cells driven by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in this response. EPFRs also
cause alterations in foreign compound metabolism. Not only is there a direct inhibition of P450-dependent
activities, mediated by disruption of the complex between P450s and their redox partners, but EPFRs also
induced P450s from the CYP1A family via AhR. Although there are unique features within the immunologic and
metabolic aspects of the proposal, they share a common feature—AhR. Our hypothesis is that EPFRs modu-
late AhR signaling leading to a pleiotropic response that alters both immunologic and P450 function resulting in
poor respiratory health. Aim 1 will demonstrate that EPFR mediated activation of AhR in airway epithelial cells
(AEC) induces Th17 responses. To test our hypothesis, we will employ mice in which AhR is selectively de-
pleted from AECs. As part of this aim we will test the role of the tryptophan metabolite 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]car-
bazole (FICZ) to activate AhR. Aim 2 will define the mechanism of EPFR inhibition of P450 function, focusing
on P450 interactions with their redox partners NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome b5.
These studies will show how inhibition of P450 function affects disposition of FICZ and ultimately Th17-medi-
ated asthma. This will be accomplished by kinetic and biophysical examination of the effect of EPFRs on com-
plex formation. Aim 3 will demonstrate an epidemiologic link between EPFR exposure and poor respiratory
health in children. Measurements of glutathione sulfonamide, a biomarker of pulmonary neutrophilia and asso-
ciated with Th17 mediated asthma, will be used to relate EPFR exposure and respiratory health. Responding
to SRP Mandate 1 and 2, Project 1 will demonstrate that EPFR exposure impacts child respiratory health and
provide mechanism(s) by which EPFRs contribute to disease."
10772193,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 2
Particulate matter (PM) is consistently associated with cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular mortality. Despite
the risk of exposure, little is known about the mechanisms underlying PM-mediated toxicity. Our Center has
shown that PM emissions from the thermal treatment (TT) of hazardous organics or contaminated soils at
Superfund sites produce environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs). EPFRs are a unique particle-
pollutant system capable of redox cycling to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biological systems.
EPFRs are present in contaminated Superfund soils and airborne PM near industrialized Superfund sites. Our
prior Superfund project focused on the role of EPFRs in modulating cardiac function and disease. Although
inhalation of EPFRs decreased baseline cardiac function, we found that these effects were secondary to
changes in pulmonary vascular resistance. The mechanism(s) underlying these vascular effects are unknown;
however, our preliminary data suggest that EPFR-mediated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
in pulmonary epithelial cells resulting in the release of vasoactive factors may play an important
pathophysiological role. Our central hypothesis is that EPFR-mediated activation of AhR at the air-blood
interface and mobilization of vasoactive mediators leads to activation/dysfunction of the pulmonary and
systemic vasculature, resulting in cardiovascular disease. To test this hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 will test
whether EPFR-mediated activation of the AhR in lung epithelium is responsible for the increase in pulmonary
pressure and decreased diastolic filling that underlies EPFR induced cardiac dysfunction. After establishing the
vasculature as the locus of injury, Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the cellular mechanisms of vascular injury by
testing whether EPFRs induce vascular dysfunction via activation of the AhR. In both aims, control littermate
mice and mice deficient in AhR specifically in alveolar type II will be exposed subchronially to EPFRs, non-
EPFR PM, or filtered air using a recently designed inhalation system. Millar pressure-volume catheters will be
used to measure left ventricular function and pulmonary arterial pressure in exposed mice. Telemetry devices
will be used to record blood pressure. Endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity, as well as markers for both
endothelial dysfunction and activation, will be assessed. Specific Aim 3 will identify a putative ligand promoting
EPFR-induced AhR activation and test whether this metabolite is associated with EPFR-mediated vascular
dysfunction. In collaboration with Project 1, this aim will use novel mass spectrometry approaches to identify
and characterize EPFR-induced lipid oxidation products that may serve as endogenous AhR agonists so that
we may correlate tissue and blood levels of these metabolites with vascular dysfunction. Completion of these
Aims will provide important new data linking EPFR-mediated oxidative stress in epithelial cells, AhR activation,
and cardiovascular disease. This information is critical for assessing risks to those living in proximity to sites
using TT technologies to remediate Superfund or other hazardous wastes."

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia and the sixth most common cause of death, afflicts
nearly 6 million people in the United States. Alzheimer’s disease is a major economic burden to our society with
an annual cost of more than $250 billion. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion
of the brain. Compliance of large cerebral arteries is critical as these arteries dampen the pulsatile pressure and
protect the microcirculation and blood brain barrier from damage. Cerebrovascular dysfunction can have
detrimental impacts on the brain. Growing evidences suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a crucial
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and can potentially be used as a biomarker for preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease. The overall goal of this project is to unravel the close relationship between cerebrovascular
remodeling and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
 Our preliminary study suggested that with pathological progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the human
cerebral artery showed progressive stiffening, structural breakdown, and increases smooth muscle cell atrophy.
We thus hypothesize that the structural and functional changes in large cerebrovasculature is correlated with
neurodegeneration and the accumulation of Amyloid-β, other toxic metabolites, and tau pathology in the brain.
Building upon our multidisciplinary expertise in vascular mechanobiology, precision mass spectrometry,
advanced optical imaging, immunohistochemistry, vascular biology and neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease,
we will test this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) to determine cerebrovascular remodeling (biomechanical,
structural, and compositional changes) in the frontal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer’s disease; Aim 2) to
determine the association between cerebrovascular remodeling and Alzheimer’s disease pathological changes
in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain; and Aim 3) to examine the association between cerebrovascular
remodeling and antemortem cognitive status and neuropsychological test performance.
We will use no or low atherosclerotic cerebrovascular and brain tissue from 100 age- and sex-matched brain
donors from the NIA-funded BU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center with 1) no Alzheimer’s disease pathology,
2) low Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and 3) intermediate/high Alzheimer’s disease pathology
. These
brain
donors have completed annual National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set evaluations during
life and have available consensus-based cognitive diagnoses. This proposal is designed to leverage existing
resources to make new discoveries. The matched and parallel studies of cerebral vessels and brain tissue will
provide new understandings of the temporal development of cerebrovascular remodeling and AD. Understanding
the role of vascular remodeling in Alzheimer’s disease may lead to the discovery of new treatment options and
directions for interventions to stave off Alzheimer’s disease."
10775697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Male gametes transmit the paternal genome to the next generation. At the same time, they also carry
epigenetic information that is passed to the zygote at fertilization. A major unanswered question is whether this
inherited epigenetic information influences gene expression, phenotype, and disease susceptibility in offspring.
We have found that knocking out the chromatin regulator gene Utx in the mouse male germ line leads to
reduced survival and increased rates of tumor formation in offspring, even when offspring do not themselves
carry a Utx mutation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that loss of Utx in male germ cells induces
epigenetic changes in the gametes that alter gene expression after fertilization and ultimately result in the
increased tumor susceptibility observed in offspring. Specifically, the experiments proposed here will examine
genome-wide changes in histone modification, DNA methylation, and gene expression in developing and
mature male gametes of Utx conditional knockouts (Aim 1); evaluate gene expression and phenotypic effects
in embryos of the next generation at the preimplantation and perinatal stages (Aim 2); and define changes in
histone modification, DNA methylation, and gene expression in developing and mature germ cells of offspring
in order to determine if these changes can persist across multiple generations (Aim 3).
The ultimate goal of this study is to understand how changes in the development and gene regulatory state of
mammalian male germ cells can impact phenotype and disease in progeny. In the past, this question has
been addressed primarily by manipulating the paternal environment using chemical or nutritional exposures,
which are difficult to control precisely. In contrast, this study will employ a simple, well-defined and highly
reproducible genetic manipulation that can be used to generate germline epigenetic changes. The proposed
experiments will elucidate a new mechanism by which epigenetic misregulation in male gametes can contribute
to male infertility, a priority area for NICHD. The results will also frame a new mechanism for non-genetic
inheritance of disease susceptibility, with broad implications for the etiology and epidemiology of common
diseases such as cancer and diabetes."

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is rapidly becoming an overwhelming economic and social burden. It is estimated
that 13.8 million Americans will have AD in 2050 and the total annual payments for health, long-term, and
hospice care for AD and other dementias will increase to $1.2 trillion in 2050. Despite the important role of
cerebrovascular function in AD, studies on cerebrovascular impairment in the asymptomatic phase of AD are
lacking. The proposed project directly addresses this important scientific area by using advanced MR imaging
techniques to study biomarkers of cerebrovascular function in AD subjects both before and after the
manifestation of clinical symptoms. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to study whether AD
pathology directly interacts with cerebrovascular pathology in the early phases of the AD continuum, as well as
the relative contributions of cerebrovascular and AD pathologies to cognitive impairments in early AD. (1) We
will use an advanced MR technique for measuring cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) as a biomarker of vascular
function and study CVR in 264 subjects composed of four groups including healthy young and middle-aged
subjects (HY), cognitive normal elderly without AD pathology (CN-), asymptomatic AD subjects who are
cognitively normal with positive AD pathology (aAD), and prodromal AD patients who are symptomatic with
mild cognitive impairment and have positive AD pathology (pAD). Longitudinal changes in CVR over two years
in CN-, aAD, and pAD subjects will also be studied. (2) We will also study differences in the white matter
hyperintensity volume and advanced diffusion metrics between the CN-, aAD, and pAD groups, their
longitudinal changes and relationship with CVR. (3) The relative contributions of AD and vascular pathologies
to cognitive performance will also be evaluated. The successful execution of the study will provide a better
understanding of the interactions between AD pathology and cerebrovascular dysfunction in the early phases
of AD continuum that could eventually lead to the development of effective multi-component therapeutic
interventions of AD that target both AD and vascular pathologies."
10773262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US and globally. Physical activity has been
clearly shown to improve CVD risk factors and reduce disease incidence; thus, the US (and other countries)
have guidelines for physical activity. Current guidelines call for both aerobic exercise (AE; e.g., walking) and
resistance exercise (RE; e.g., weight lifting). Research on AE, including its dose-response, and health has
been extensive; consequently, guidelines are clear on what should be done (≥150 min/week of moderate
intensity AE). In contrast, there is only limited research on RE; thus, guidelines lack clarity (2 times/week, but
with unspecified duration). A recent meta-analysis of observational studies reported a J-shaped relation where
more time in RE was associated with lower CVD risk only up to 60 min/week, beyond which CVD risk reduction
attenuated, and indeed appeared to increase at ≥130 min/week. While it remains unclear, postulated
mechanisms that may underlie the higher CVD risk with higher RE doses include increased arterial stiffness
due to increased sympathetic activity during RE and chronic inflammation occurring with higher RE doses,
leading to atherosclerosis and systemic vascular damage.
There are currently no randomized controlled trials that have directly tested and compared multiple doses of
RE on CVD risk factors in general population. Thus, to provide data that are crucial for exercise prescription
and translation to public health practice, this proposal seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial among
240 adults with overweight or obesity (since adiposity increases CVD risk). In the first 6 months (Phase 1), they
will participate in a supervised, lab-based RE training phase. Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 doses
of RE (n=60 per group): 0 min/session (control), 15 min/session, 30 min/session, or 60 min/session, all for 2
sessions/week per current RE guidelines. All 4 groups also will be asked to do AE for 30 min/session, 2
sessions/week, congruent with the current guidelines that require both RE and AE. A primary aim will be to
assess changes from baseline to 6 months in a composite CVD risk score using 4 well-established CVD risk
factors: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and percent body fat.
There will be sufficient statistical power to detect changes in the risk score, based on prior data. Another
primary aim will be to examine potential mechanisms underlying the J-shaped relation of RE on CVD risk, by
assessing changes from baseline to 6 months in aortic arterial stiffness (purse wave velocity) and inflammatory
markers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). In the second 6 months (Phase 2), there will be an unsupervised, self-
maintenance phase where all will be provided with free health club memberships and asked to continue with
their assigned intervention in Phase 1. Continued adherence to their assigned RE dose will be assessed to
address the secondary aim of: which dose(s) will engender best participation in a free-living situation?
This trial will fill important gaps in knowledge on effective, safe, and practical dose(s) of RE for CVD prevention."

A considerable number of clinical, neuropathological, immunohistochemical and immunological studies suggest
that human brain cells, in particular those of myeloid origin, are susceptible to HIV-1 infection; infection of these
cells may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction and viral long-term persistence despite ART. However, among
all anatomical tissue locations in the human body, the central nervous system (CNS) arguably represents the
most difficult one to access and to evaluate for viral infection and persistence. Recently, we and others have
made significant progress in defining viral reservoirs at a single-cell and single-molecule resolution, using a
platform of novel next-generation sequencing assays allowing to simultaneously analyzing near full-length
proviral sequences, the corresponding chromosomal integration sites and the respective HIV-1 RNA expression
profile from individual viral reservoir cells. Using such technologies, we observed evidence for immune-mediated
selection mechanisms that enable long-term persistence of viral reservoir cells with features of deep latency,
while reservoir cells with higher susceptibility to reactivation signals seemed to be actively selected against; in
rare cases of individuals with “elite control”, such selection mechanism resulted in a highly-restricted viral
reservoir configuration consisting of intact proviruses located in heterochromatin positions not permissive to viral
transcription. Here we will propose to use this established and fully-operational technology pipeline for a detailed
analysis of the frequency, clonality and replication competence of proviruses isolated from sorted CNS cells, in
particular from myeloid parenchymal microglia, from myeloid perivascular macrophages and astrocytes
(Specific Aim 1). In addition, we will utilize novel next-generation sequencing assays for characterizing the
chromosomal locations of intact and defective proviruses, and their associated epigenetic chromatin
microenvironment, using ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq and Methylation-Seq assays (Specific Aim 2). For a functional
evaluation of proviruses residing in the CNS, we will subsequently conduct reactivation assays with single
patient-derived virally-infected cells from the CNS, allowing us to determine how chromosomal positioning and
epigenetic features affect the transcriptional activity of proviruses and their susceptibility to latency-reversing
agents (Specific Aim 3). Together, these investigations will provide high-resolution insight into the dynamics of
HIV-1 persistence in myeloid CNS cell subsets and may be highly informative for targeted HIV-1 cure
interventions."

ART initiation (ARTi) is a unique clinical juncture in which virus replication and host immune responses are in
flux and treatment of a substantial component of people living with HIV (PLWH) is possible. In both preclinical
studies and recent clinical trials, infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) at ARTi has shown exciting
preliminary results, but key questions about the mechanisms of action, the requisite bnAb properties, and
the extent of clinical impact remain. Further, it is unclear if these benefits can be extended to the >35 million
PLWH currently on suppressive ART, by using bnAbs after treatment interruption and ART re-initiation. Several
clinical trials are planned or ongoing, but the complexity of human research limit the ability to definitively elucidate
key mechanisms. Our scientific premise is that our molecularly defined, mixed bnAb-sensitive and resistant,
barcoded transmitted/founder (TF) SHIV/NHP model system is uniquely poised to determine the extent and
durability of bnAb activity at ARTi/re-initiation and decipher the mechanistic role of neutralization potency and
effector function on reservoir dynamics, durable immune responses, and virus control. Our group has
generated a body of work demonstrating that TF SHIVs reproduce key features of HIV-1 immunopathogenesis.
We have expanded the model to incorporate genetic barcoding and virus inocula containing defined mixtures of
bnAb-sensitive and resistant viruses. In this system, each animal is infected with a precise ratio of TF SHIVs
encoding wildtype (WT; bnAb-sensitive) and escape mutant (EM; bnAb resistant) viruses, which have similar
replication kinetics but markedly different sensitivities to V3-glycan bnAbs. Because WT and EM viruses have
unique barcodes, we can track bnAb-sensitive vs. resistant virus clonotypes over time and across tissues through
high-throughput sequencing, allowing for statistically powerful within-animal comparisons, as well as
comparisons across treatment arms. Here, we will leverage this novel NHP system to determine the effects of
bnAbs at ARTi and re-initiation and dissect the roles of bnAbs’ neutralizing and effector functions through a
coordinated NHP experiment comparing 4 treatment groups: (i) ART alone, (ii) ART + bnAb, (iii) ART + bnAb
with disabled effector function, and (iv) ART + bnAb with enhanced effector function. We will then determine if
similar effects can be seen with use of bnAbs at ART re-initiation in animals already on suppressive ART who
underwent ATI. This strategy allows us to define bnAb’s clinical impact and test our overall hypothesis that
both the neutralizing potency and effector function of bnAbs at ARTi are essential to activity on the reservoir,
host immunity, and induction of virus control. Successful completion of this project would have substantial
significance to the HIV cure field, as it rigorously tests promising roles for bnAbs in HIV cure strategies that
could guide the clinical development of bnAbs in cure strategies."
10777395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 1 in 10 Americans has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the incidence continues to rise as the US
population both grows heavier and ages. T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance, where the insulin target
tissues become under-responsive to insulin stimulation, leading to unregulated blood glucose and tissue
damage. Despite multiple therapeutic approaches to increase insulin production and to enhance insulin receptor
sensitivity, there are no drugs that directly ameliorate insulin resistance by targeting mechanisms that drive
insulin resistance, in part because these mechanisms remain poorly defined. We have identified novel machinery
that regulates S-nitrosylation of the insulin receptor (INSR) and its key downstream mediator, insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS1), including the enzymes SCAN and SCoR, which catalyze S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation
of INSRβ/IRS1 respectively. Under normal conditions, insulin-stimulated S-nitrosylation of INSRβ/IRS1 by SCAN
transiently inhibits signaling to prevent hypoglycemia. In obesity, sustained and excessive S-nitrosylation of
INSRβ/IRS1 by SCAN in skeletal muscle chronically inhibits insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance.
Excessive SCAN activity and consequent hypernitrosylation of INSRβ/IRS1 are also induced by aging and by
glucocorticoid treatment, representing a widespread cause of insulin resistance. In human skeletal muscle and
adipose tissue, SCAN expression increases with Body Mass Index and correlates with INSRβ S-nitrosylation,
suggesting this mechanism is relevant to human insulin resistance. Our goal is to define the role of this novel
pair of enzymes (SCAN and SCoR) in insulin signaling and to elucidate their clinical significance. We will 1)
characterize a newly discovered S-nitrosylation-based feedback loop in insulin signaling; 2) define the
pathological role of SCAN and SCoR in insulin resistance; 3) determine the clinical significance of SCAN in
insulin resistance. Successful completion of these Aims will define the functional role of S-nitrosylation of
INSRβ/IRS1 by SCAN and SCoR in both health and disease. More broadly, our work promises both new
understanding of obesity-, aging-, and
glucocorticoid therapy
-associated T2DM and new therapeutic
opportunities for treating metabolic disorders and T2DM."
10776451,"Our sense of taste is critical in helping us decide what to eat. Altered taste perception is associated with obesity
and eating disorders, suggesting that dysregulation of taste processing may contribute to these conditions.
Understanding how the taste system flexibly transforms sensory input into behavior thus represents a
fundamental question underlying feeding decisions across healthy and disordered states. Two key questions
underpin the mechanisms of taste processing: how are neuronal responses to taste transformed along the taste
pathway, and how do these responses drive behavior? Studies in mammalian models have characterized
neuronal responses at each layer of the taste system, but it is not clear how these neuronal responses are used
to drive behavioral responses to taste. To address this gap, this proposal uses a model system, Drosophila
melanogaster, that offers unique tools to examine the connectivity, response properties, and behavioral role of
individual cell types within each layer of taste processing.
For decades, central taste circuits in Drosophila have remained largely unknown. Recent studies by our lab and
others have identified neurons that receive direct input from taste sensory cells, termed second-order neurons,
which represent the first layer of taste processing in the brain. These second-order neurons include diverse types
of taste projection neurons (TPNs) that relay taste information to higher brain regions. The goal of this proposal
is to determine how TPNs, both individually and as a population, transform sensory information and regulate
behavior. Our central hypothesis is that different types of TPNs encode different features of taste and make
distinct contributions to behavior, representing parallel pathways for sensory processing.
In Aim 1 we will use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to determine how each type of TPN encodes and
transforms sensory information. We will test response properties such as taste selectivity, dose-dependence,
response dynamics, and hunger-dependent modulation. In Aim 2 we will examine how the information encoded
by TPNs is used to drive behavior. We will activate or silence each TPN type and examine the effect on a range
of taste-related behaviors, including feeding, locomotion, spatial preference, and learning. These experiments
will determine whether different TPN types represent separate pathways for regulating different aspects of
behavior, or whether TPN outputs converge downstream to regulate a common set of behaviors. In addition to
analyzing each TPN type individually, we will use computational modeling to examine how activity across the
TPN population is transformed into behavior. Together, these studies will reveal how taste encoding is
transformed at the first synapse and distributed across diverse cell types, and how these neuronal responses
are used to drive specific behaviors. Given the similarities in how flies and mammals respond to taste, we expect
to uncover fundamental principles that generalize to other species. Understanding taste processing also lays the
groundwork to investigate how the dysregulation of taste circuits contributes to overeating and obesity."
10818539,"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this
pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune
diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation
dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease
severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation
because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes,
mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for
diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain
methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways
that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the
establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could
contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases.
This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across
multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and
integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic
screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims:
(1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning
approach;
(2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of
 genome variants and chromatin accessibility data;
(3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation
 landscapes in a high-throughput manner.
In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements
associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of
epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will
explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could
lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in
genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in
experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent
research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease."

 The clinical benefits of cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cells, are limited when used against solid tumors. The immuno-suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) is enriched in cellular components (regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor
cells, tumor-associated macrophages, etc) and acellular factors (hypoxia, deficit of nutrients, acidosis,
adenosine, etc) that decrease viability and tumoricidal activities of anti-tumor native CD8+ cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) and of therapeutic CAR T cells. Therapeutic neutralization of these factors and components
is challenging because of their diversity and redundancy. Instead, we aim to identify and thwart the key
mechanisms by which the TME-derived factors and conditions undermine viability and the anti-tumor activities
of CAR T cells. We will focus on TME-triggered downregulation of type I interferon (IFN1) receptor IFNAR1,
which normally supports viability and activity of native CTLs and CAR T cells. Our preliminary data show that
MAPK Activated Protein Kinase 2 (MK2) and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase PARP11 cooperate to
downregulate IFNAR1 on intratumoral CAR-bearing T cells, leading to their inactivation and rapid cell death.
IFNAR1 loss leads to downregulation of IFN1-inducible cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). CH25H acts to
limit the effector trogocytosis between malignant cells and specific CAR T cells. In the absence of sufficient
levels of CH25H and its product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), this trogocytosis undermines the activities of
CAR T cells and exposes them to fratricidal killing. These and other exciting preliminary results suggest an
overarching hypothesis that targeting TME-driven PARP11/MK2/CH25H-dependent mechanisms that regulate
the viability and activity of CAR T cells should enhance their anti-tumor activities and increase the efficacy of
CAR T ACT. To test this hypothesis, we will determine (i) the roles of TME-induced PARP11 in inactivation of
CAR T cells, (ii) the importance of MK2 activity in suppression of intratumoral CAR T cells and (iii) the
contribution of downregulation of CH25H in CAR T cells inactivation and decreased efficacy of CAR T ACT.
 Completion of these studies should gain insight into immunosuppression of intratumoral CAR T cells and
help to develop novel CAR constructs and CAR T pre-treatments as well as combinatorial approaches to
increase the efficacy of CAR T ACT."
10767815,"Project Summary / Abstract
 The major goal in this application is to evaluate isatin-derived spirocyclic dimers as novel unfolded
protein response (UPR) activators in proof-of-concept studies. Despite the dynamic changes in protein levels,
protein homeostasis is maintained by a combination of tightly controlled processes which include synthesis,
folding, trafficking and degradation. Accumulation of unfolded / misfolded proteins in the ER due to cell intrinsic
and / or extrinsic signals results in the activation of UPR, an adaptation mechanism. Failure to resolve this
results in irremediable ER stress and triggers UPR mediated programmed cell death. Cell intrinsic situations in
cancer such as loss of tumor suppressor gene or oncogene addication result in higher basal UPR levels.
Cancer cells maintain the higher basal UPR levels through upregulation of UPR associated proteins. The
higher basal UPR levels in cancer cells provides a therapeutic window that can be exploited by UPR activators.
This has been attributed to the success of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of hematological
malignancies. Although the success of proteasome inhibitors validates activation of UPR as a therapeutic
modality, the need for UPR activators with novel mechanisms of action (MOA) is exemplified by the failure of
proteasome inhibitors in patients with solid tumors. In this application we will address the above need by
focusing on the development of a UPR activator with a novel MOA. We have identified an isatin-derived
spirocyclic dimer (n7) that activates UPR in both normal and cancer cells but selectively induces apoptosis in
cancer cells. Here we propose to continue the development of the novel chemical entity n7 through the
following specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on characterization of n7 MOA, aim 2 will focus on structure activity
relationship through synthesis and evaluation of n7 analogs and aim 3 will assess the efficacy of n7 or an
improved UPR activator in in vivo models. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical
proof-of-concept for translating isatin-derived spirocyclic dimers as UPR activators."

 Treatment of non-resectable recurrent/metastatic solid cancers is currently palliative only and there is an
urgent unmet need for novel mechanisms of action and additional paradigm shifting therapeutic options. Antigen-
targeting cancer immunotherapies such as bi-specific antibodies (eg Bi-specific T cell engager or BiTE’s) provide
a unique approach for cancer immunotherapy. However, applying this therapeutic tactic to solid cancers has
been restricted by a limited number of protein antigens safe for targeting. Moreover, even if safe cell-surface
antigens are identified, different bi-specific antibodies will likely be needed for each different antigen/cancer. This
would greatly increase development time and costs. Thus, there remains a great need for additional safe antigen-
specific immunotherapies, particularly for those with refractory/metastatic solid cancers who have few
therapeutic options. Many cell surface cancer-specific antigens are not proteins but rather complex
carbohydrates that have limited or no expression in normal tissues. For example, β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-
glycans constitute a small subset of the complex-type N-glycans expressed at the surface of normal human cells
but are markedly up-regulated in diverse solid cancers by driver mutations in the receptor tyrosine
kinase/RAS/phosphoinositide-3-kinase(PI3K) signaling pathway. Aberrant over-expression of β1,6GlcNAc-
branched N-glycans in solid tumors drives RTK signaling, tumor growth, motility, invasion, and metastasis. As
both a marker and driver of many diverse cancers, β1,6 GlcNAc-branched N-glycans provide an excellent target
for antigen-specific immunotherapies. However, an antibody to β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans has never been
generated. To address this issue, we generated a novel class of immunotherapeutics that readily target abnormal
glycan antigens with high specificity. We have termed this technology ‘Glycan-dependent T cell Recruiter’
(GlyTR, pronounced ‘glitter’). With funding from the Biden Cancer Moonshot program of the National Cancer
Institute, we developed and optimized the GlyTR1 bi-specific protein that binds both β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-
glycans and CD3 in T cells. The GlyTR1 bi-specific protein induces T cell-dependent killing of a wide diversity of
solid cancers in vitro and in vivo with EC50’s as low as ~50 femtomolar, yet does not kill normal cells or trigger
“on-target, off-cancer” toxicity in humanized mouse models. GlyTR1 is undergoing late-stage IND-enabling
studies and upon FDA approval, the UC Irvine Cancer Center will perform a dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical
trial in relapsed/metastatic solid cancer. However, as GlyTR1 has a short half-life of ~2.5hrs and requires
constant intravenous infusion, herein we propose to develop a longer half-life version of GlyTR1. We also
propose to examine for potential additive/synergistic activity with checkpoint inhibitors. Data from this
proposal will be used to inform future clinical trials following confirmation of safety of GlyTR1 in our Phase 1 trial,
namely whether a longer half-life GlyTR1 and/or co-treatment with checkpoint inhibitors should be pursued."

CORE 3 – PRECLINICAL MODELING
The Preclinical Modeling Core will be co-led by Dr. Joyce Liu, a medical oncologist specializing in gynecologic
cancers who has experience in the development of gyn patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and patient-derived
organoid (PDO) models, and Dr. Jean Zhao, who is an expert in the development of genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMMs). The core will provide support for all three projects with a focus on targeting
replication stress in uterine cancers, including (1) targeting WEE1 in uterine serous carcinomas or p53-mutated
uterine cancers; (2) combined ATR inhibition and PI3K inhibition in uterine cancers; and (3) induction of
replication stress to generate anti-tumor immunity in uterine cancers through the activation of the cGAS/STING
pathway. The Core will generate, characterize, and maintain preclinical models in support of each of the
projects, and will provide expertise in the design of modeling experiments. The goal of Aim 1 of the Preclinical
Modeling Core is to generate, maintain, and characterize additional PDX models of endometrial cancer from
patient samples. Successfully implanted models will then be passaged and fully characterized; in collaboration
with the Pathology Core, histologic fidelity to the primary tumor will be assessed. Additionally, models will be
assessed for genomic fidelity to the parent tumor via next generation sequencing. In Aim 2 of the Core, we will
continue to generate, maintain, and characterize PDO models of endometrial cancer from patient samples.
Successful organoids will also be characterized for fidelity to the parent tumor, similar to in Aim 1. Finally, Aim
3 of the Core will focus on the generation, maintenance, and characterization of a collection of endometrial
cancer GEMMs, with defined genomic characteristics selected based upon their frequent presence and clinical
relevance to human endometrial cancer. The collection of fully characterized PDXs, PDOs, and GEMMs
generated and maintained by this Core will be utilized to support the experimental plans for all three projects."

Heart failure (HF) is a major barrier to healthy aging among people with HIV (PWH) in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA). Women with HIV (WWH) may be most vulnerable, with a nearly two-fold increased risk for HIV-
attributable HF among women vs. men. Why HIV-attributable HF risk is higher in women is incompletely
understood, but among WWH, chronic inflammation, metabolic factors such as obesity, and other hormonal
factors such as accelerated reproductive aging are hypothesized to play key roles. Once HF is established
among PWH, the 1-year mortality rate is 31% and sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias is
common. In this context, strong imperatives exist to identify strategies to prevent the development of HF and
SCD among WWH. The most important pathologic processes upstream of HF and SCD are myocardial
fibrosis and myocardial steatosis. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and spectroscopy (MRS) are
considered gold-standard techniques for identifying myocardial tissue characteristics, including diffuse
interstitial fibrosis, focal scar, and steatosis. Among PWH, myocardial fibrosis and steatosis correlate with
diastolic dysfunction; in addition, myocardial fibrosis predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes and SCD. To
date, no studies have characterized the extent of myocardial fibrosis and steatosis among ART-treated WWH
in SSA or examined predictors of fibrosis/steatosis progression specific to this group. Through this innovative
proposal focus on WWH in SSA, we will: 1) characterize myocardial fibrosis burden and identify novel
infectious/immunologic predictors of progression; and 2) quantify myocardial steatosis burden and identify
hormonal/metabolic predictors of progression. We hypothesize that among WWH in SSA, predictors of
myocardial fibrosis progression will include endemic co-infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus and latent
tuberculosis), immune activation/inflammation indices (e.g. osteopontin and circulating immune cell subsets),
and novel metabolomic signatures. We further hypothesize that among this group, predictors of myocardial
steatosis progression will include reduced ovarian reserve (anteceding overt menopause; characterized by
menstrual history and levels of anti-Mullerian hormone), obesity and/or increased fat in ectopic depots (visceral
and epicardial fat by MRI), longer cumulative exposure to select ART subtypes including integrase inhibitors,
and novel metabolomic and lipidomic signatures (some overlapping with and some distinct from the signatures
associated with fibrosis). This work will inform the design of HF prevention strategies targeting: select
immune/inflammatory pathways (e.g. dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonism); vs. viral co-infections (e.g. letermovir for
treatment of cytomegalovirus); vs. early/abrupt decrement in endogenous estrogen production (e.g.
transdermal estrogen); vs. ART-associated weight gain (e.g. culturally-specific diet/exercise intervention timed
to initiation of or switch to culprit antiretroviral therapeutics). Overall, this work will have high-impact to preserve
healthy cardiometabolic aging among 13 million WWH in SSA, representing 2/3 of all WWH globally."

Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S., has one of the highest recurrence rates of all
cancers, and is the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death. Current standard for bladder
cancer diagnosis relies on clinic-based white light cystoscopy for initial screening, followed by transurethral
resection of bladder tumor in the operating room for pathologic diagnosis and local staging. White light
cystoscopy has several well recognized shortcomings, particularly incomplete detection, thereby leading to
suboptimal resection and contributing to cancer recurrence and progression. Our goal is to improve outcomes
for bladder cancer patients through integration of a deep learning algorithm to improve cystoscopic detection
and enhance surgical resection.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based on deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable capacity to learn
complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge into the inference model. We hypothesize that AI-
augmented detection of bladder tumor will improve diagnostic cystoscopy in the clinic setting to identify
suspicious lesions and improve the quality of transurethral resection in the operating room, thereby reducing
overall cancer recurrence and outcome. Towards the goal of establishing a paradigm of AI-based framework
for augmented detection of bladder cancer, we will leverage our strong preliminary data and outstanding
environment in AI research. We propose three specific aims: 1) To curate a high-quality annotated cystoscopy
imaging dataset to optimize deep neural network CystoNet; 2) To design and optimize CystoNet for real-time
cystoscopic navigation and cancer detection; and 3) To conduct a prospective multicenter validation of
CystoNet during bladder cancer surgery.
Successful completion of the studies proposed here will serve to translate deep learning algorithm to the
dynamic environment of cystoscopic surgery without the need for specialized instrumentaitons. We foresee
our approach will improve the outcome of a major cancer and genearlizable to other organ systems amenable
for endsocopic interventions."

Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) are a class of retrotransposable elements that continually mutate
genomes, including mammalian genomes. The currently active family of LINEs in mammals is called LINE-1
(L1). There are hundreds of thousands of copies of L1 in mammalian genomes, and unchecked expression of
this element in humans and/or model organisms is associated with various abnormal states, such as cancer,
infertility, aging and neurologic disease. We do not know whether L1 plays a causative role in these disorders,
partly because our knowledge of L1 biology in vivo is rudimentary, which has limited our ability to experimentally
manipulate endogenous L1 activity in a specific manner. Although a number of cellular host factors that can alter
L1 retrotransposition have been identified from biochemical pulldowns and genetic screens in immortalized cell
lines, the in vivo biological relevance of these factors in the evolutionarily relevant germ cells is unclear.
Previously our lab discovered that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) plays a critical
role for productive LINE retrotransposition in both yeast and human tissue culture. This proposal will use mouse
genetics to examine whether ESCRT is used for L1 intracellular trafficking and retrotransposition in the male
germ line, and whether disruption of the ESCRT/L1 interaction can alleviate germ line defects found in a mouse
models of infertility. To this end, we will utilize both wild type mice and mice with known increases in L1
expression in the germline. Mice deleted in the gene for Maelstrom (Mael-/-) have massive overexpression of L1,
arrest in meiotic prophase I, and are male sterile. Maelstrom is involved in the biogenesis of small RNAs in the
germ line, called piRNAs, and similar transposon/infertility defects are seen when related piRNA biogenesis
genes (e.g. Mov10l1) are knocked out in mice. It is currently unknown whether L1 is a driving factor of infertility
in these mice. To reduce L1 activity, we will introduce an ALIX knockout allele (ALIX is a component of the
ESCRT complex). In Aim 1 we will evaluate germ line L1 RNP localization, regulation, and retrotransposition
when the L1/ESCRT interaction is disrupted. In Aim 2 we will determine the contribution of L1 overexpression to
germ cell phenotypes in mice. This project will provide valuable insight into whether ESCRT enables L1 RNP
trafficking in the germ line. The proposed work will also shed light on whether excess L1 retrotransposition is a
driving factor responsible for infertility in piRNA pathway mutants. Because L1 and the piRNA pathway are
conserved in humans, and mutations in piRNA pathway genes have been associated with human infertility, we
expect that this work will form the basis for future study on the relation between transposon regulation and some
cases of human male infertility."

This proposal “Forefronts in Substance Abuse Disorders during Pregnancy, Postpartum and Pediatrics
(FrSADP3)” requests its first renewal within NIDA’s Research Education Program. The primary rationale is that
there are too few underrepresented minority (URM) clinicians and clinical researchers, too few clinical and
research programs investigating substance use (SU) and abuse (SA), and especially, substance abuse
disorders (SAD) during pregnancy, postpartum, and in pediatrics (P3); there are far too few new URM trainees
for clinical and clinical research careers within the SADP3 fields. Many innovations include optimizing the
depth, breadth, and scope of SAD topics of concern during and following pregnancy and the leadership and
participation of Indigenous Americans. Our objectives are to train, mentor, provide meaningful research
experiences for and help launch the clinical careers of SAD Clinicians and Clinical Scientists (R25 Clinical
Trainees). FrSADP3 includes PI and Program Director Gerald Schatten, PhD, at Pitt and Co- I Aimee McRae-
Clark, PharmD, BCPP (Addiction Research Leader), with Theresa Cronan, PhD, at SDSU (Facilitator,
Psychologist, URM and Women’s Health), Calvin Simerly, PhD, at Pitt (Program Coordinator), and Evan
Snyder, MD, PhD, at SBP (Addiction Neonatologist). It is overseen by a Scientific Advisory Board, 40% who
are URM faculty. Five Specific Aims: I. Annual FrSADP3 advanced hands-on lab courses, offered at a
URM Institution at which we provide conceptual education, expert guided discussions and research
training in the methods necessary for studying pregnant people with or at risk for SAD and their neonates,
toddlers, and children; relevant animals that self-administer drugs; and the mechanisms of and
therapeutic strategies to alleviate the suffering from SADP3, along with research resources available at
NIDA and elsewhere. II. Mentored Research into substance use and abuse disorders during pregnancy,
postpartum and pediatrics, launched by the participant, together with any FrSADP3 faculty member. III.
Encourage trainees’ longer-term Career Planning and gently exploring their self-identified career choices,
particularly within the possibilities of them joining NIDA-NIH’s clinical and research workforce. IV. Demystify
the changing regulatory oversight requirements in Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR) to ensure full
compliance with the NIH’s guidance. V. Unbiased, Quantitative Independent Evaluations to track
participants’ careers. The R25’s goals, then, are to provide courses in skills development, mentored addiction
research, and ongoing career support resulting in comprehensive, sophisticated training in clinical and
translational strategies for addressing the current challenges in addiction during pregnancy, for designing
better therapies for the future, and for launching and sustaining successful careers in substance abuse,
pregnancy, pediatrics, and related fields. In so doing, FrSADP3 will continue to advance the careers of the
most promising clinical scientists and clinicians, with sensitivity for ensuring full diversity in the NIDA workforce."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with MLL (KMT2A) gene rearrangement (MLL-r) is an aggressive disease with
uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells and a failure of proper cell differentiation. Despite
conventional chemotherapy, the overall survival of MLL-r AML remains poor and therapeutic options are limited,
highlighting an unmet need to understand MLL-r AML pathogenesis and discover new genetic vulnerabilities.
MEF2 transcriptional factors (MEF2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D) play important functions in the development of muscle,
neuronal, and lymphoid lineages. Despite the known role of MEF2C as a direct MLL-r target essential for
leukemogenesis, it remains unknown whether additional MEF2 family members are deregulated or involved in
MLL-r leukemia. In this study, we identified that MEF2D gains aberrant super-enhancers and is highly
upregulated in MLL-r AML. We demonstrate that MEF2D is selectively required for MLL-r AML, and depletion of
MEF2D results in profound leukemia differentiation through transcriptional repression of CEBPE. We further
show the MEF2D-CEBPE axis is critically involved in the anti-leukemia effects of DOT1L and Menin inhibitors.
Furthermore, we discovered a novel interdependency of MEF2 paralogs in MLL-r AML. These preliminary data
have provided us scientific rationale and enthusiasm for our central hypothesis that MEF2D, a novel
transcriptional dependency highly expressed in MLL-r AML, maintains leukemia through inhibition of a CEBPE-
centered myeloid differentiation program. This hypothesis is supported by extensive preliminary data and will be
further tested by two specific aims: (1) establish the oncogenic function of MEF2D in MLL-r leukemogenesis and
therapeutic response, and (2) investigate the mechanisms of MEF2D-mediated oncogenic regulation in MLL-r
AML. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the role of MEF2D in our pre-established genetically defined AML
mouse models in vitro and in vivo; we will also evaluate the role of MEF2D-CEBPE axis in Menin inhibitor-
mediated anti-leukemia effects. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which MEF2D
represses CEBPE, define MEF2D target genes using unbiased genome approaches, and evaluate the role of
MEF2D-MEF2C interaction in MLL-r AML. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the MEF2 regulatory
network in MLL-r AML, and to develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting oncogenic MEF2 factors for
leukemia therapy. The main objective of this proposal is to establish the oncogenic function of MEF2D and
determine how it regulates leukemia cell self-renewal and differentiation. Results from this proposal will provide
significant new knowledge on the critical role of MEF2D in AML, reveal a new mechanism for suppression of
normal hematopoietic differentiation in leukemia, and serve as the basis for targeting MEF2-related pathways as
a potential therapeutic strategy for AML patients."

With the surge of ARDS cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an urgent need to understand
novel pathways involved in resolution of lung inflammation and injury to provide the basis for new therapeutic
approaches. Studies comparing rodent and human lung injury gene expression signatures reveal conserved
pathways, including MAPK/ERK activation during injury. More recently, we found a genetic polymorphism in
MAP2K2 associates with death in ARDS, suggesting a biological role in ALI recovery. We demonstrated that
MAP2K1/MAP2K2 (MEK1/MEK2) activation in macrophages promotes pro-inflammatory pathways and inhibits
reparative ones, making it a potential target to manipulate macrophage phenotypes in ALI. In preclinical acute
lung injury (ALI) models, inhibition of MEK1/MEK2 improves measures of ALI, including faster recovery of body
weight, reduced pulmonary neutrophilia, and greater reparative macrophage activation. These results suggest
that MEK pathways could be effective targets in ALI. To address the isoform and cell source driving this
improvement in outcome, we generated mice deficient in MEK1 in myeloid cells (LysmCre+Mek1fl). These mice
have no phenotype in naïve conditions, but experience 100% mortality with LPS-induced ALI using a moderate
LPS dose from which all wild-type mice recover. These mice have a similar early inflammatory response to LPS
but fail to turn off inflammation at later time-points. This phenotype can be completely rescued with IFNAR1
blockade, suggesting MEK1 suppression of type I interferon responses is critical for ALI resolution. We also
found sustained MEK2/p-ERK activation in the absence of MEK1, suggesting that MEK1 is critical for MEK2
deactivation to promote ALI resolution. In support of this hypothesis, we found that mice lacking MEK2 globally
or in the leukocytes compartment have faster ALI resolution. The proposed aims below outline our approach to
identify how MEK isoforms work in concert to regulate myeloid cell responses to better define and target a novel
regulatory pathway in ALI. In aim 1, we will determine MEK1 and MEK2 cell-specific roles and signaling
pathways in ALI and test our will test our hypothesis that MEK1 is required to deactivate MEK2 in alveolar
macrophages to promote resolution of lung inflammation. In aim 2, we plan to evaluate MEK1 and MEK2
interactions and mechanisms of MEK2 deactivation. We will use MEK1 mutants to test our hypothesis that
MEK2 is deactivated by binding to pT292 MEK1, and we will determine how these mutants alter macrophage
inflammatory (LPS) and reparative (IL-4) responses. In aim 3, we plan to test MEK1 and MEK2 degraders as
therapeutics in murine models of ALI. We will test our hypothesis that MEK2-specific degradation will result in
faster ALI resolution. These studies will advance our understanding of how the immune system stops
inflammation and promotes ALI resolution, revealing new therapeutic targets and approaches that could be
brought to the bedside."

 The prevalence of tooth-supporting alveolar bone loss by periodontal disease (PD) steeply rises in the 3rd
and 4th decades of life. As such, PD is a leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Mechanisms behind the increased
susceptibility to PD bone loss in adulthood are unknown. 17 to 23% of PD patients do not respond to current
treatment and thus progress to tooth loss. Our long-term goal is to identify the mechanism of age-related bone
loss in PD to develop mechanistically based therapies of PD bone loss. A potential factor in the development
of PD bone loss is the accumulation of senescent cells. Senescent cell accumulation in tissues is increasingly
recognized as a driver of age-associated disorders. To mitigate the deleterious effects, senescent cells can be
removed by drugs called senolytics that selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells. Fisetin is a recently
characterized senolytic without observable adverse effects and is being evaluated in clinical trials targeting
pathological conditions hallmarked by senescent cell burden.
 Our preliminary studies using the ligature-induced PD (LIP) model showed that LIP induces initial rapid
bone resorption followed by a rapid recovery due to bone formation by day 14 in young mice (2.5 months). In
contrast, significant bone loss remained at day 14 in mature mice (8-12 months). Also, mature mice showed
greater bone volume loss compared to young mice, indicating the increased susceptibility to LIP-induced bone
loss in mature mice. Furthermore, bone formation rate in mature mice with LIP was lower than young mice,
suggesting that diminished bone formation rate is responsible for the increased susceptibility to LIP-induced
bone loss in mature mice. We found increases in expression levels of senescence marker genes in periodontal
tissue of mature mice before PD induction, suggesting that accumulation of senescent cells in the tissue
increase the susceptibility to LIP-induced bone loss in mature mice. Our hypothesis is that accumulation of
the senescent cells is a critical factor responsible for inhibiting bone recovery and for increasing bone loss
susceptibility in the pathology of PD bone loss, and that senolytic treatment will improves the PD-driven bone
loss. Here, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine if the clearance of pre-existing
senescent cells by the senolytic, fisetin, will prevent PD alveolar bone loss. 12-month-old mice will be pre-
treated with fisetin to clear and prevent age-related senescent accumulation before inducing LIP, and we will
analyze the effect of senescent cell clearance by fisetin pre-treatment on LIP-induced bone loss. Specific Aim
2: Determine if fisetin treatment will induce recovery from PD-induced bone loss. We will induce LIP in 12-
months-old mice and wait until bone resorption progress to detectable levels before starting fisetin treatment.
We will then analyze bone loss induced by LIP. Our team is uniquely suited to conduct these experiments with
expertise in periodontology, bone biology, and cellular senescence in musculoskeletal tissue. Outcomes from
this work will lead us to further mechanistic studies of the role of senescence in PD toward our long-term goal."
10886115,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
More than two years after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, more
than 600 million cases and 6.5 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Genomic and
epidemiological analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have provided key understanding of the emergence and
evolutionary processes that drive viral mutations and promote antigenic escape and enhanced virus
transmission. Preliminary studies reported increased transmissibility for SARS-CoV-2 lineages with the
D614G mutation 1, as well as the variants of concern (VOC) Alpha/B.1.1.7, Beta/B.1.351, Gamma/P.1
and Delta/B.1.617.2. The emergence and unprecedented speed of transmission of the VOC
Omicron/B.1.1.529 resulted in a significant number of cases worldwide and breakthrough infections in
a high proportion of vaccinated individuals. Therefore, there is a continued need to monitor the genomic
characteristics of circulating viruses for early identification of new variants with altered immune,
transmission or pathogenicity properties, particularly in settings with high infection rates. Mexico ranks
third in Latin America in terms of COVID-19 burden with more than 7 million cases as of November 3,
2022, and third worldwide in total number of reported COVID-19 related deaths, with fatalities above
330,000. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the gaps in the current surveillance system in
Mexico. The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico is underrepresented and
undercharacterized due to limited spatial coverage of viral genomes. Genetic differences between
the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Mexico, the Americas and globally are unclear. Mexico is a vast
and diverse country with differences in demography, climate, and significant population mobility, both
domestically and internationally, recording 32.4 million US tourists in 2019 5. Our previous work on
influenza virus in Yucatan showed strong evidence that seasonality and the occurrence of genetic
variants vary greatly across the country, which encompasses temperate and tropical regions 6,7. Thus
examining the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico, particularly in highly touristic states
such as Yucatan, will shed light on the viral diversity and transmission dynamics in the country, and
clarify evolutionary changes as the disease becomes endemic. Because of tight connections between
Mexico and the US, these analyses will also contribute to informing public health interventions in both
nations.
This project leverages existing and newly generated data on SARS-CoV-2 in Yucatan and
consequently in Mexico, enabling: 1) epidemiological and mathematical modeling to evaluate
changes in viral dissemination and diversity in the context of vaccination campaigns and changes in
population mobility, and estimate the fitness advantage of new variants on a population level, and 2)
characterize circulating variants by generating genomic sequences and reconstructing the
evolutionary history and migrations that led to the emergence or introduction of locally circulating
lineages. Genomic and phylodynamic analysis, in conjunction with mathematical modeling, have
provided powerful tools to understand and predict the fate of new SARS-CoV-2 variants elsewhere 8.
An integrated capacity for outbreak analytics combining genomics, phylodynamics and
mathematical modeling is lacking in Yucatan, Mexico. This work will build local capacity to
address these questions and have a significant public health impact by providing accurate
information about COVID-19 transmission dynamics."

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are commonly observed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. These symptoms affect up to 97% of patients during the course of AD and
may cause accelerated declines in cognitive functions and conversion to dementia. Though numerous efforts
have been devoted to investigating the etiology of NPS, the neurobiological basis underlying NPS in AD dementia
remains unclear. There is an urgent need to advance the mechanistic understanding of these symptoms, which
is crucial for early detection and timely intervention to prevent AD progression. Increasing evidence has indicated
that differential NPS overlap substantially and are relevant to dysfunctions in distinctive brain networks.
Assessing NPS dimensionally and their associated circuit-level dysfunctions would therefore provide significant
benefits to deepen our understanding of neural circuits involved in the expression of NPS. In response to the
guidelines of the PAR-20-159, the overall objective of the project is to assess neural circuits and identify
neurophysiological subtypes (i.e., subtypes) underlying dimensions of NPS in dementia. We hypothesize that
distinct patterns of neural circuits will reflect latent dimensions of NPS domains that span from preclinical to
severe AD dementia, and interact to define neurophysiological subtypes that are predictive of clinical symptoms
and the rate of AD progression. In Aim 1, we will identify interpretable neural circuits and the linked latent
dimensions of NPS domains using a sparse multivariate correlation analysis. In Aim 2, we will identify
neurophysiological subtypes using statistical clustering with guidance from the NPS dimension-associated
circuitry characteristics. We will further evaluate and interpret the neurobiological meanings and clinical
relevance underlying these dimensions and subtypes. The proposed approaches will be developed and
evaluated by assessing resting-state functional MRI from two independent cohorts (OASIS-3 and ADNI) with
more than 1,800 subjects in total. Successful outcomes of the project will lead to an improved understanding of
the neurobiological mechanism underlying NPS and its clinical relevance, form a promising new avenue to
potentially guide the intervention of NPS and better the management of AD progression, and hence pave the
way towards precision medicine of AD dementia."

impairment and/or functional deficits. Many organizations including the American
Society of Clinical Oncology and the Institute of Medicine have recognized the
need for more research and education about the diagnosis and management of
geriatric syndromes in patients with cancer as many healthcare providers (HCPs)

providers, and other HCPs (nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists) to screen for and
conduct an initial assessment to identify cognitive impairment and/or functional

patients will participate in the interactive, multi-modal two-day in person program
with ongoing professional development over a 12-month period. Training will
occur in 14 cohorts over the 5-year project. We will examine knowledge,

In this project we will bridge the traditionally largely distinct fields of quantitative genetics and mechanistic

on large human data sets providing parallel whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data, we will extend
proof-of-principle studies and computational approaches developed and validated in model organisms to achieve
improved functional interpretation of GWAS loci associated to mental health disorders. We focus
specifically on the role of transcription factors as both upstream regulators of genetic risk variants as well as
mediators of downstream network-level effects. As Aim 1, we will develop extend methods to allow accurate
modeling of transcription factor activity from transcriptome data from large cohorts of human tissue samples
in GTEx, PsychENCODE, and TOPMed cohorts. These data will be used in Aim 2 to dissect the mechanisms
underlying proximal genetic regulatory variants in cis. We hypothesize that dynamics of transcription factor
activity and binding modifies the effect size of genetic regulatory variants across individuals, tissues, and cell
types, and that by modeling this relationship we can detect TFs regulating specific regulatory variants and
noncoding disease-associated loci. In parallel Aim 3, we will map network-level trans-acting genetic variants
for inter-individual variation in TF activity. Going beyond treating TF activity as a tissue-specific parameter
of the cellular environment, we will now consider it as a variable quantitative trait itself, and by GWAS/TWAS for
inferred TF activity, we map specific polymorphisms that affect TF activity within each tissue. We anticipate that
the trans-acting loci discovered in this analysis will be of major interest not only to basic biology of regulatory
networks, but also for explaining GWAS associations to complex diseases, and to mental health in particular."
10896312,"Germination is essential for many spore-forming bacteria to initiate disease. Spores of the nosocomial pathogen
Clostridioides difficile induce germination when they sense bile acid (germinants) combined with amino acids
and/or Ca2+ (co-germinants). C. difficile senses these small molecules using a mechanism that is distinct from
previously studied spore-formers because it lacks the transmembrane germinant receptors encoded by all other
spore-formers. Instead, C. difficile uses two soluble proteins of the clostridial serine protease family, CspC and
CspA, to sense germinant and co-germinant signals. While most Csps are active proteases, C. difficile CspC
and CspA are pseudoproteases due to mutations in their catalytic triads. Despite their lack of catalytic activity,
the CspC and CspA pseudoproteases control the activity of a related protease, CspB, during germination. While
CspC and CspA were identified as the likely bile acid germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively,
through genetic screens, we unexpectedly discovered in the past funding period that CspC not only senses bile
acid germinant but also co-germinant signals. These findings raise the question as to how CspC and CspA
integrate signals from such different small molecules, especially since we lack biochemical evidence that either
of these proteins binds any of these signaling molecules.
 We recently gained biochemical insight into this question by demonstrating that CspC and CspA directly
interact. We also determined that CspA forms a homodimer, in contrast with CspC, by solving CspA’s crystal
structure. Intriguingly, when we model CspC onto our unpublished structure of CspA, CspC residues that control
the sensitivity of C. difficile spores to germinants and/or co-germinants cluster to the predicted CspC:CspA
heterodimerization interface. These data lead us to hypothesize that germinant and co-germinant signals alter
the equilibrium between CspC:CspA heterodimers and CspA homodimers. Since CspA is also needed for CspC
to be stably incorporated into spores, we propose that a partner-swap mechanism regulates C. difficile spore
germination. According to this model, CspC:CspA heterodimerization allows CspC to be stably incorporated into
dormant spores. The inactive heterodimer is disrupted upon germinant and co-germinant addition, which triggers
germination potentially by promoting CspA homodimerization. We will test this model by evaluating the functional
significance of CspC:CspA heterodimerization and CspA homodimerization (Aim 1) and the impact of germinants
and co-germinants on these protein:protein interactions (Aim 2). We will also determine the role of CspA’s
unstructured prodomain in regulating the equilibrium between CspA homodimers and CspC:CspA heterodimers
in the presence of germinant and co-germinant signals (Aim 3). Collectively, these analyses will provide atomic-
level insight into how C. difficile spores transduce germinant and co-germinant signals to induce germination.
They will also reveal novel mechanisms for how pseudoenzymes, which are ubiquitous and conserved across
all three domains of life, control the activity of cognate enzymes in response to small molecules."

10745659,"ABSTRACT
Bacterial species have evolved multiple mechanisms to survive ecological, nutritional and chemical stresses as
well as host cell defenses. Among these is to enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. As the name
indicates, bacteria in the VBNC state have lost the ability to grow on routine agar, but are in fact, alive, albeit in
a dormant (not spore) state. The ability of a bacterial species to enter the VBNC state and also resuscitation
from this state is now recognized to be an important or even required mechanism for the survival and
pathogenesis of several bacterial pathogens, especially those that are associated with chronic infections.
These proposed studies are designed to genetically and metabolically characterize the VBNC state and
resuscitation from the VBNC state of the oral pathogen, P. gingivalis. The goal, in addition to defining the P.
gingivalis gene expression and metabolism in the VBNC state is to also identify one or more biomarkers for the
VBNC state of P. gingivalis strain W83 (PgW83). In addition, knockouts of genes found to be specific for or
highly expressed during the VBNC and resuscitation states will be constructed. These mutants will then be
tested in both in vitro and in vivo models to determine the requirement for these genes, and thus the VBNC
state, in host cell invasion and virulence in an in vivo animal model. Our hypothesis is that the existence of
VBNC subpopulations with the ability to resuscitate allows P. gingivalis to survive those conditions of
intracellular stress that it encounters thus allowing P. gingivalis to exist and persist in a chronic state of
infection. We have designed in vitro and in vivo experiments to test this hypothesis. First, we propose to use
cellular and in vitro methods to establish the VBNC and resuscitation states of PgW83. Next, we will perform
RNAseq and metabolomics to identify possible biomarkers for VBNC and resuscitation states. Biomarker
mutants will be constructed and tested for their abilities to enter the VBNC and resuscitate within host cells.
Finally, we will treat mice with PgW83 wildtype and mutants defective in transitioning into and resuscitation
from the VBNC state to determine whether these states of P. gingivalis are necessary for chronic periodontitis.
These studies will provide new insights into the molecular events of P. gingivalis occurring during chronic
infections such as periodontitis and identify new protein targets for future therapies."

 The human genome is continuously attacked by a variety of endogenous and exogenous genotoxic agents,
which can lead to DNA damage and compromise genomic integrity. Alkylating species constitute a ubiquitous
class of DNA damaging agents. Aside from forming nucleobase adducts, alkylating agents can also attack one
of the non-carbon-bonded oxygen atoms of internucleotide phosphate group to yield backbone alkylation
products, i.e. the alkyl phosphotriester (alkyl-PTE) lesions. Although the alkyl-PTE lesions are induced at
relatively high frequencies, very little is known about their repair and biological consequences. We hypothesize
that unrepaired alkyl-PTE lesions may lead to the development of cancer and other human diseases by
compromising the flow of genetic information through inhibiting DNA replication and transcription, and inducing
mutations in cells. We also posit that the effects of the alkyl-PTE lesions on DNA replication and transcription
may be modulated by the size of the alkyl group conjugated with the backbone phosphate in DNA. Moreover,
alkylating agents are among the earliest and most widely prescribed cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Hence,
a systematic investigation about how the alkyl-PTE lesions perturb DNA replication and transcription will reveal
molecular insights about how exposure to alkylating agents contributes to cancer development, and provide an
important knowledge basis for designing better cancer chemotherapeutic agents. To test the above hypothesis,
we propose experiments according to three specific aims: Aim #1. To synthesize oligodeoxyribonucleotides
(ODNs) harboring site-specifically inserted alkyl-PTE lesions with different flanking sequences; Aim #2. To
investigate how the alkyl-PTE lesions perturb the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in cells. Aim #3. to
examine the transcriptional mutagenesis and repair of alkyl-PTE lesions. The proposed research is built upon
our established expertise in the chemical syntheses of lesion-carrying ODNs and in utilizing shuttle vector
methods for the assessment about how DNA lesions perturb DNA replication and transcription in cells. The
outcome of the proposed studies will provide a systematic and molecule-level understanding about the repair
and human health consequences of the alkyl-PTE lesions. Thus, the proposed research will lead to important
knowledge for assessing the risk of human exposure toward alkylating agents, for understanding the roles of
these lesions in the etiology of human diseases, and for developing better strategies for cancer chemotherapy."

This study's long-term goal is to elucidate the genetic and immunologic features of Eosinophilic Esophagitis
(EoE). EoE is an emerging chronic disease that often starts in childhood and continues into adulthood and is
associated with substantial morbidity, yet there are currently no FDA-approved therapies. Understanding this
subject has significant implications as elucidating the fundamental genetic and immunologic features of the
disease has potential to yield improved diagnostics and therapies. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
genome-wide association study (GWAS) interrogation, followed by genetic and biological validation, will uncover
key processes involved in disease pathoetiology with a focus on the interface of adaptive and innate immunity.
The rationale for this hypothesis is based on our prior studies, including initial GWAS that have identified disease
susceptibility at chromosomes 2p23 and 5q22. Evidence is accumulating that the causal genes at these 2 loci
are CAPN14 (calpain 14) and TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), respectively. These findings shift the focus
from primary eosinophil defects to epithelial responses as being causal of EoE pathogenesis. Mechanistic
studies have established that CAPN14 contributes to impaired epithelial barrier function and that TSLP promotes
adaptive type 2 T cell immunity associated with overproduction of IL-5 and IL-13. CAPN14 sits at the interface
of innate and adaptive immunity, as it is constitutively expressed by esophageal epithelium; however, it is also
markedly induced by IL-13, likely derived from food antigen–activated Th2 cells. In addition to these 2 genetic
loci (2p23, 5q22), GWAS have implicated numerous other suggestive loci, of which 11 have been recently
preliminarily implicated using a custom-designed Illumina SNP array approach followed by preliminary functional
analyses. Despite these advances, the causal gene variants and/or genomic pathways for EoE pathogenesis
remain largely unclear. Herein, we will test the relevant and key hypothesis that GWAS interrogation, followed
by genetic and biological validation, will uncover disease pathoetiology. We will test this central hypothesis via 3
complimentary aims using innovative approaches that combine genetic and biological studies. In Aim 1, we will
focus on a primary GWAS lead, CAPN14. We will test the hypothesis that CAPN14 is an essential regulator of
cellular junctions and barrier integrity and contributes to IL-13–induced, EoE-related epithelial responses. We
will identify its binding partners and potential substrates and the consequences of CAPN14 deficiency in
esophageal epithelial cells and CAPN14 transgenic overexpression in mice. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that meta-analysis of additional EoE cohorts analyzed by GWAS will refine the involvement of implicated
loci/genes and identify new variants. In Aim 3, we will interrogate disease-associated single-nucloeotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) by a combination of innovative genetic, chromatin mapping, transcriptomic expression
profiling, and functional biological studies to establish relevance of the genetic variants and identify causal genes."

A primary concern regarding current breast cancer detection and diagnosis is the large number of benign
biopsies being performed. Annually in the United States, radiologists recall over five million women for
diagnostic workup and perform over one million breast biopsies, with fewer than one in four diagnosed as
cancer. The new BI-RADS 4 subset assessment categories of 4A/B/C enables new tailored approaches for
“risk” based decisions in different subsets of cases. In this classification scheme, lesions rated as 4A have an
expected probability of malignancy more than 2% and up to 10% and those rated as 4B have a probability of
malignancy more than 10% and up to 50%. A recent publication evaluating the positive predictive value (PPV3)
for 125,447 diagnostic exams collected in the American College of Radiology (ACR) National Mammography
Database (NMD) demonstrated that 88% of biopsies were performed on BI-RADS 4A and 4B lesions. Thus,
opportunity exists to identify novel ways to better classify these low probability lesions more accurately in order
to improve PPV3 and reduce biopsy of actually benign findings for hundreds of thousands of women annually.
We believe that an operationally simple, cost effective, contrast enhanced mammogram (CEM), performed
during the patient's diagnostic evaluation, would be the best approach to improve accuracy of radiologists'
decisions for need to biopsy lesions classified with mammography, tomosynthesis (DBT) or US as 4A or 4B.
CEM uses iodine contrast with dual low and high KeV mammogram images to create a contrast enhancement
map of the breast that directly overlays the mammogram, thus providing anatomic and kinetic information,
similar to MRI. We found in a preliminary clinical trial that radiologists had higher true-positive rates and lower
false-positive rates for biopsy recommendation with CEM than when using DBT and US. To validate those
initial findings, we propose to prospectively and sequentially perform CEM on 1855 consenting women with BI-
RADS 4A or 4B lesions detected on mammography, DBT or US. Prospectively radiologists will provide BI-
RADS ratings for every lesion using DBT alone, then with US and finally with CEM. With pathology known and
based on the study design to minimize case by radiologist potential biases, we plan to estimate the NPV level
of CEM-based recommendations (overall and within the cases with conventionally confirmed biopsy
recommendation) and demonstrate that it is sufficiently high, while leading to substantial reduction in biopsy
recommendations for actually benign lesions. Our primary expectation is that the number of recommendations
to biopsy benign lesions will decrease significantly (~20%), while maintaining high NPV (>95%) among the
initial recommendations. Using a subset of prospectively collected verified cases we will conduct a multi-
reader (MRMC) study to assess heterogeneity of CEM effects across radiologists, obtain generalizable results,
and elucidate supplemental specific CEM performance by lesion characteristics."
10745708,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Researchers still do not understand the mechanisms behind the progressive and irreversible lung structural
damage that ultimately causes respiratory failure in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have developed a CF
mouse model of chronic inflammation that recapitulates the progressive and irreversible lung tissue remodeling
in late-stage CF lung disease. The overall goal here is to understand the cellular mechanisms that lead to
progressive and irreversible CF lung deterioration. The objective is to study how inflammatory monocytes and
monocyte-derived MΦs (MΦs) contribute to the development of irreversible lung tissue remodeling in CF. Our
central hypothesis is that, in CF, chronic lung exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases recruitment of
inflammatory monocytes to the lungs and that these monocytes are programmed to cause tissue damage while
failing to effectively fight the infection. Moreover, we hypothesize that this is initiated by the loss of CFTR function
in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The rationale is based on observations that an
increased number of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived MΦs are found in the lungs of patients with
CF. This feature is recapitulated by our CF mouse model when chronically exposed to LPS. Moreover, after six
weeks of recovery from chronic LPS exposure, monocytes from CF lungs maintain a “pro-inflammatory”
signature, suggesting a permanent change in CF monocyte functions. Furthermore, we conducted studies using
a mouse model in which migration of inflammatory monocytes is impaired (Ccr2-/- mice). These studies suggest
that the inflammatory monocytes drive the lung tissue remodeling caused by chronic exposure to LPS. Our
specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (aim 1) that lowering the recruitment of circulating inflammatory
monocytes to CF lungs during chronic exposure to LPS is sufficient to reduce TGFβ signaling and mitigate tissue
remodeling in CF lungs without compromising host defense against bacteria; (aim 2) that the innate immune
memory acquisition in CF myeloid progenitor stem cells, caused by chronic LPS exposure, will generate
inflammatory monocytes that fail to effectively clear infections and that cause profound lung tissue damage; (aim
3) that cell-autonomous CFTR dysfunction in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and monocytes contributes to
pathogenic responses to chronic lung exposure to LPS. The contribution is significant because it will result in a
better understanding of the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases in CF and in other chronic inflammatory
diseases with persistent bacterial lung infections. Our proposed research is innovative because we will use novel
mouse models, we will bridge together methodologies in lung immunology and hematopoietic stem cell fields,
and we will use unbiased cutting-edge technologies. At the completion of this work, we will have identified novel
mechanisms by which chronic instigation of the lung immune response in CF disrupts the monocytic-lung axis
feedback, leading to progressive lung damage. Ultimately, these studies may identify new pathways for effective
therapeutic interventions in slowing down CF lung deterioration."

Approximately 9.8 million United States adults experienced suicidal ideations in 2018, of which 1.3 million
attempted suicide. Of these affected individuals, ~48,000 died of suicide in 2018, making suicide the tenth
leading cause of death in the United States that year. The impacts of depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder
account for many suicides, especially in older men. Yet no specific anti-suicide treatments or biological
approaches to predicting suicide risk in bipolar disorder exist. In addition, several critical gaps exist in our current
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain circuitry abnormalities implicated in suicidal behaviors.
The high prevalence of global suicide rates, in excess of over one million deaths every year globally, is a
significant problem. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the brain mechanisms for bipolar disorder-related
suicides and to better define the molecular abnormalities underlying suicide risk in bipolar disorder in general
and in older men who suffer a disproportional risk of dying by suicide. Our previous postmortem RNA-sequencing
studies have identified an anterior insula and subgenual anterior cingulate circuitry molecular abnormalities
associated with bipolar disorder diagnoses and suicide risk. These results led to our central hypothesis that the
anterior insula and subgenual anterior cingulate brain circuitry will harbor dysregulated brain circuitry and cellular
gene expression profiles in inflammatory signaling in bipolar disorder, and more so in older men brain donors
who died by suicide. Towards this hypothesis, we have discovered specific gene expression abnormalities of
this brain circuitry in postmortem bipolar disorder suicides. Based on our preliminary transcriptomics findings,
we propose two Specific Aims to 1) identify downregulated/reduced molecular profiles in the anterior insula and
subgenual anterior cingulate brain regions in bipolar disorder and bipolar suicide deaths using bulk tissue RNA-
sequencing, and 2) identify downregulation/reduction of molecular profiles in the anterior insula and subgenual
anterior cingulate brain regions in bipolar disorder suicide deaths at the cellular level using single-nucleus RNA-
sequencing. These results will potentially uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder
morbidity and suicide in a critical brain circuitry known to control emotion monitoring and mood states.
Furthermore, these findings may be extrapolated to other mood illnesses and advance our understanding of
brain circuitry biological changes underlying complex maladaptive behaviors like suicide."

Invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are responsible for 30% of all deaths
due to antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States. MRSA infections are particularly frightening because
they are readily transmitted both in hospital settings and in the community, often to otherwise healthy individuals,
and they are typically resistant not only to beta-lactams, but to other major classes of antibiotics. There is an
ongoing need to identify vulnerabilities in S. aureus that can be targeted through new therapeutic strategies. This
project leverages previous technological and conceptual innovations by the Project Team that combined novel
screening paradigms with state-of-the-art genomics technologies to identify promising pathways for inhibition as
well as compounds that inhibit those pathways. Aim I builds on our discovery, made using a TnSeq data-mining
approach, of a protein that acts as a positive regulator of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) synthesis. This protein forms a
complex with the essential signal peptidase SpsB, which inactivates LTA synthase. We will elucidate how the
protein regulator functions and will investigate the mechanisms that cause lethality when SpsB is inhibited. The
work may lead to new strategies to target SpsB in combination with other compounds. Aim II builds on our
discovery, made using an innovative screening platform and target identification strategy, of D-alanylation
inhibitors that may be useful as antibiotic potentiators and anti-virulence agents. To provide methods to
characterize these compounds, we will elucidate the pathway for D-alanylation. The D-alanylation pathway is
broadly conserved in firmicutes and related pathways are widespread in bacteria, yet how they mediate transfer
of amino acids and acyl groups across the membrane is not understood. This work will therefore have broad
implications for understanding bacterial physiology. Aim III will use TnSeq to elucidate the synthetic lethal
network for a gene important for LTA assembly, and we will then use that knowledge to identify targets for
compounds we previously discovered that kill bacteria lacking that gene. In addition to providing potentially useful
compound-target pairs for antibacterial therapy, this work will provide a genetic interaction network for each
target we discover, leading to a comprehensive understanding of how different components of the cell envelope
cooperate to create a robust, functional barrier between the organism and its environment, and potentially
allowing future prediction of compound combinations effective for preventing the spread of resistance. We will
also synergize with other subprojects by supporting their efforts to use Johan Paulsson’s microfluidics platform
(Core B) for massively parallel image analysis of individual mutant lineages from pooled transposon libraries.
We will provide MRSA and MSSA transposon libraries, individual mutants, training and advice on using the
libraries for TnSeq, and will brainstorm with other project team members on experiments and conditions that
best demonstrate the utility of this platform for taking TnSeq to the next level."

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are leading causes of serious community and hospital-associated
infection. In addition to acquiring antibiotic resistance, S. aureus converts to a persistent antibiotic-tolerant form
in which traditional treatments are powerless. Antibiotic-tolerant persister cells are responsible for recalcitrant
chronic infections. To address the urgent need for new anti-MRSA therapeutics, we developed a C. elegans-
MRSA screening platform to identify compounds with activity against MRSA. The assay identifies compounds
with both in vivo efficacy and low host toxicity. We combined a whole animal in vivo screen of ~82,000 synthetic
compounds for ones that exhibit potential anti-MRSA activity with in vitro screens for compounds with the ability
to kill the stubborn persister subpopulation. We have focused on four compounds, CD437, nTZDpa, bithionol,
and PQ401, all four of which eradicate both actively growing MRSA and stationary phase MRSA persister cells
by disrupting their membrane lipid bilayers. These compounds exhibit fast killing rates, synergism with other
antibiotics, extremely low probabilities of resistance selection, and high selectivity for bacterial over mammalian
membranes. Using bithionol and nTZDpa and analogs of these compounds, we found that anti-persister activity
of these compounds positively correlates with their ability to increase membrane fluidity. All four compounds
have been previously studied as potential therapeutics and bithionol is a former FDA-approved anthelmintic.
Despite the potential of membrane-disrupting compounds to kill persisters, it is generally thought that their
therapeutic applications are limited due to a lack of selectivity for bacterial over mammalian membranes.
However, our results show that the presence of cholesterol in mammalian but not in bacterial membranes
provides an important opportunity to identify/design non-toxic anti-persister membrane-disrupting compounds.
We therefore propose the following two aims to identify features of membrane-disrupting compounds that
correlate with their ability to kill persisters but not disrupt mammalian membranes. In Aim 1, we will utilize
biochemical, physiological, biophysical, and cryo-EM techniques to 1) further investigate the correlation between
the ability of compounds to kill persisters and their ability to increase membrane fluidity, and 2) to identify the
mechanisms of action and targets of membrane-disrupting compounds. We also propose to test the efficacy of
membrane-disrupting compounds in a murine S. aureus subcutaneous abscess infection model in collaboration
with the Hooper lab and determine whether the compounds also target E. faecalis cell membranes. In Aim 2, we
will utilize high throughput microfluidics technology developed in the Paulsson laboratory (Core B) and referred
to as “mother machines” to: 1) isolate rare MRSA persister cells in growing cultures, and 2) in collaboration with
the Walker lab, use Tn-seq in mother machines to identify MRSA transposon insertion mutants with enhanced
susceptibility to membrane disrupting compounds. Successful completion of the proposed project will enhance
our ability to identify and/or design efficacious and safe antibiotics for hard to treat Gram positive infections."

The enterococci are ancient microbes that appear to have co-evolved along with the spread of
animals on land. They possess an intrinsic ruggedness that allows them to survive unusually
harsh conditions, including starvation and desiccation, yet efficiently recolonize the gut of a new
host. These traits distinguish them from their ancestors, which led to the identification of an initial
set of enterococcal-specific genes and phenotypes. Functional analysis by Tn-seq recently
implicated a subset of those genes is important for growth under non-challenged conditions, with
still others assuming importance upon antibiotic challenge. This subproject proposes to take
advantage of the power of high throughput single cell imaging to more rigorously identify genes
critical to the hardiness of enterococci, and associate them with precisely defined growth defects.
Moreover it expands this to include genes of importance to various probes of the cell wall,
including innate defense molecules, and in the process it will generate an ordered array of known
transposon insertion mutations in these genes of importance. As most of the genes that encode
the distinctive ruggedness of enterococci encode proteins of unknown function, these mutants
will be of considerable value for discovering the underlying mechanisms. Genes found to be
important are bioinformatically organized into putative functional networks, which create models
that can be tested experimentally. One such network emerged from preliminary studies, and
incorporates functions of three critical enterococcal genes with limited distribution outside of the
species, that encode genes of unknown function. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that these
genes play important roles in regulation of cell wall homeostasis, and appear to be influenced by
a quorum sensing mechanism. From functional analysis, this network appears to be highly
sensitive to the influence of rifampicin, supporting the role of several key inferred transcription
factors in the network. This network will be defined by creating tightly controlled gene silencing
constructs and identifying elements of the network through comparative transcriptomics and
proteomics. Because of the apparent involvement of three unique enterococcal genes in this
network, it appears to be a promising target for limiting the growth and survival of enterococci in
patients or in the hospital environment. It is expected that new insights gleaned from the applying
Mother Machine imaging technology will add new components to these networks with rigorously
defined contributions to enterococcal cell fitness."

The longterm goals of the project are to identify the full array of efflux pumps of Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterococcus spp that contribute to multiple antimicrobial resistance and to elucidate
the determinants of their expression, their role in microbial physiology and their effect on bacterial
response to antimicrobials in infection. The work will focus on a structural and functional analysis
of the Tet38 efflux pump that enables multidrug resistance, survival in abscesses, and invasion
of epithelial cells, the potential contribution of multiple pumps to persister subpopulations in the
presence of antimicrobials, expanding the understanding of efflux resistance in enterococci, and
evaluating collaboratively novel novel antimicrobial compounds for effects of efflux, tissue
tolerability, and in vivo efficacy. There are four specific aims: 1) assess the structural determinants
of the S. aureus Tet38 efflux pump in resistance, physiology, and pathogenesis and determine
the mechanism of its diverse effects on cellular physiology; 2) explore the conditions promoting
and heterogeneity of S. aureus efflux pump expression in single-cell groups; 3) evaluate the role
of effux pumps in resistance in enterococci; and 4) evaluate the effect of S. aureus efflux pumps
on novel compounds from collaborating projects. The work will utilize genetic manipulation, allelic
exchange, and expression vectors in S. aureus and E. faecalis, measurements of gene/protein
expression with fluorescent reporters, and established murine models of infection (subcutaneous
abscess, intestinal colonization) utilizing a genomically defined strains. The overall goal of the
program project is to take a well‐integrated, multi‐disciplinary approach to understanding antibiotic
resistance development and efflux within cellular physiology combined with the search for
compounds that compromise resistant pathogens by inhibiting novel targets and pathways. This
project will add to understanding of resistance mechanisms related to multidrug efflux pumps and
provide strains for testing the effect of such pumps on novel compounds active against new
targets and pathways. It will also utilize a mammalian model of infection to screen new compound
tolerability and in vivo activity."

New HIV-1 infections continue to drive a worldwide pandemic. Combinatorial anti-retroviral therapies (cART)
have helped to blunt the clinical outcomes of HIV-1 infected individuals. However, drug-resistance mutations
continue to challenge cART regimens underscoring the importance of identifying new viral drug targets.
HIV-1 integration into the human genome is essential for a productive infection. Integration is catalyzed by the
retrovirus encoded integrase (IN) that forms a complex with the long terminal repeat (LTR) ends of the viral
cDNA, produced by reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genomic RNA. The resulting intasome precisely positions
the LTR-ends for catalytic strand-transfer into a genomic target site. Structural comparisons show that all seven
retrovirus genera maintain a central Conserved Intasome Core (CIC) containing a tetramer of IN. Some
retrovirus family members expand the structure surrounding the CIC by appending additional IN subunits. For
example, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome assembles into a simple IN-tetramer while the mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV) forms an IN-octamer by attaching IN-dimers to either side of the CIC. IN octamer,
decamer, dodecamer (12-mer) and hexadecamer (16-mer) intasomes have been reported for HIV-1.
Remarkably, the contributions of IN-multimer architecture to HIV-1 biology is largely unknown.
The IN-assembly progressions that result in a fully formed HIV-1 intasome are similarly unknown. During
infection, reverse transcription and intasome assembly occurs at or near the nuclear membrane. The host
cofactor LEDGF/p75 appears to facilitate chromatin localization of the HIV-1 intasomes, and deletion of
LEDGF/p75 reduces HIV-1 integration at least 10-fold. We have found the non-conserved peptides linking well-
known conserved IN domains control HIV-1 IN-multimer architecture, and that LEDGF/p75 is necessary for
efficient HIV-1 intasome assembly in vitro. These observations underpin several key unanswered questions:
What are the factors that guide IN multimer progressions resulting in a fully assembled HIV-1 intasome? What
is the function of LEDGF/p75 in HIV-1 intasome assembly and/or chromatin interactions? How does HIV-1 IN-
multimer architecture impact genomic target site selection in cellulo?
We propose to utilize innovative real-time single molecule imaging and analysis to understand the contributions
of IN-multimer architecture on HIV-1 mechanics with the following Specific Aims: 1.) determine the IN assembly
progressions that control HIV-1 intasome architecture, 2.) determine the role of HIV-1 intasome architecture on
the dynamic interactions with defined target DNA and chromatin in vitro, and 3.) determine the role of HIV-1
intasome architecture on targeting host chromatin features in cellulo.
 These studies are designed to interrogate the animated processes that support HIV-1 intasome architecture
 with the goal of identifying additional retroviral progressions that might be exploited as therapeutic targets."

Pubertal hormone levels differentially modulate the neural circuits implicated 
 in emotion dysregulation in youth with psychopathology 
Estimates indicate that over 20% of American adolescents suffer from serious psychopathology, including stress, 
mood, anxiety, and behavioral disorders. Patients with these disorders show emotional dysregulation, which is 
part of the cognitive control construct within the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria framework. The critical brain 
circuitry underlying emotional regulation is known to include the amygdala, frontal, and parietal cortices, with 
heightened emotional responses in children most commonly linked to aberrations in frontal and parietal activity. 
Testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) are known to indirectly affect neural processing in these regions in adults, but 
their particular role in aberrant emotional responses is unknown and studies in children have yet to be conducted. 
Thus, our goal in this study is to identify the role of T and C reactivity in modulating neural responses associated 
with emotion regulation in adolescents with and without psychopathology (i.e., emotion regulation issues). 
Consistent with the NIH’s mission to reduce the burden of mental disorders, the proposed work will yield a better 
understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying emotion regulation, and thereby support the development 
of new and improved interventions for adolescents with psychopathology. Specifically, the current proposal aims 
to: (i) determine the extent to which T reactivity modulates emotion regulation and neural function in youth with 
emotion regulation issues relative to typically-developing (TD) youth, and the degree to which pubertal status 
mediates this relationship in each group; (ii) determine the role of C reactivity in emotion regulation and neural 
function in youth with emotional dysregulation and TD youth, and the degree to which pubertal status mediates 
these relationships; and (iii) identify the role of biological sex in modulating T and C reactivity in the context of 
emotion regulation in youth with emotional dysregulation relative to TD youth. We believe identifying sex 
differences in this context is critical, as there are known sex differences in both hormonal functioning and the 
prevalence of these disorders during adolescence. 
 These aims will be accomplished by recruiting 210 participants (aged 9-15 years; half male; half community 
controls), including 105 with psychopathology (i.e., emotion regulation issues) from outpatient mental health 
clinics. Participants will complete an fMRI protocol assessing emotion regulation following a social challenge 
paradigm designed to elicit a T response. Our pilot data indicates that increased T reactivity improves emotion 
regulation in healthy youth, but impairs it in youth with psychopathology. Further, C reactivity also appears to 
improve emotion regulation in healthy youth, but has not been examined in youth with psychopathology. It is 
anticipated that the proposed study will show the extent to which T and C reactivity each impact behavior and 
the neural activity underlying emotion regulation in youth with psychopathology, particularly during the pubertal 
transition, and the role of biological sex. As current intervention strategies for psychopathology do not consider 
hormonal mechanisms, these data will be critical in the development of novel treatment approaches."
10767491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The plasma membrane dictates how cells sense and respond to their environment, informing
cellular decisions to, for example, proliferate, mature into other cell types, respond to
pathogens, transmit electrical signals, or strengthen neuronal connections in the brain. Lipids
and proteins within membranes act collectively to provide both a physical barrier to the
extracellular space and the ability to selectively transmit information and materials to the cell.
Defects in these processes lead to diverse human diseases ranging from cancer to
immunodeficiency to neurodegeneration. Work in the PI’s lab seeks to discover how collective
behaviors of membranes contribute to cellular sensing, combining physically rigorous
thermodynamic models with single-molecule, supper-resolution fluorescence imaging and
functional studies of signaling outcomes. The plasma membrane undergoes a liquid-liquid
phase transition, and recent work from the PIs lab demonstrates that this phase transition
enables membranes to adapt their compositions locally in response to external stimuli,
establishing a heterogeneous environment that can impact membrane biochemistry to induce or
modulate a functional response. Future work will explore the ways in which this highly
susceptible membrane state shapes the functional outcomes of cell sensing, focusing on
signaling systems relevant to immune recognition and on the functioning of individual ion
channel receptors found at inhibitory synapses within neurons. Work in immune cells will
explore the roles of membranes in regulating the biochemical networks responsible for sensing
in these cell types, exploring the impact of receptor clustering, lipid homeostasis, and protein
scaffolds such as cortical actin and condensed platforms of adaptor proteins that often
assemble at membranes as part of signaling cascades. Work with ion channels will probe
impacts of the membrane phase transition on the functioning of single proteins, exploring
theoretical predictions of allosteric regulation by membranes and the chemical availability of
hydrophobic effectors of channel activation. Future research will also begin to probe internal
membranes, such the nuclear envelope, extending methods established in the PI’s lab to
determine if and/or how these membranes exploit consequences of the phase transition.
Through discovery of underlying mechanisms, the overall vision of the research program is to
identify new approaches to influence cell sensing through manipulations of membrane
properties, informing new strategies for the treatment of human disease."
10769855,"Pediatric patients have a real and urgent unmet need for less invasive treatments which can efficiently and
safely treat brain tumors without incurring significant late effects. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
develop an efficient non-invasive treatment modality without any late effects for safe treatment of both benign
and malignant pediatric brain tumors. This will be done utilizing tissue-liquification by focused ultrasound
(FUS)-induced histotripsy. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) elucidate the degree to which high
acoustic pressures and non-linear shocking mediate the tissue liquification process and what contribution each
of three possible histotripsy mechanism may play when using a hemispherical FUS transducer; and (ii)
systematically investigate the parameter space that supports mechanical liquification by hemispherical
transducers both ex vivo and in vivo with pediatric skulls in the FUS beam path. The central hypothesis is that
carefully designed experiments can be performed to understand the mechanism of action behind tissue
liquification using low f-number (e.g., hemispherical) transducers, and that histotripsy can be feasibly
accomplished within at least a subset of the pediatric population. The rationale for this project is that
understanding the mechanism responsible for tissue liquification using existing and regulatory approved
hemispherical transcranial FUS transducers, together with in vivo parameter optimization, is likely to offer
strong scientific support for the feasibility of pediatric brain tumor histotripsy treatments. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) conduct carefully designed computational, benchtop, and ex
vivo experiments to determine the contribution each of three possible histotripsy mechanism have on the tissue
liquification process; and 2) investigate the parameter space that supports mechanical liquification by
hemispherical transducers through pediatric skulls. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in
the applicant’s opinion, because it proposes to determine the mechanism of action behind histotripsy tissue
liquification using low f-number FUS transducers, as well as optimize the FUS pulsing parameters. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific justification for further
studies of transcranial histotripsy for the pediatric population. Ultimately, this novel non-invasive treatment
modality has the potential to help the approximately 4,300 children who are diagnosed with brain tumors in the
US every year, 30% of whom do not survive past five years after diagnosis, with a safe an efficient treatment
option."

This project seeks to harness big data in electronic health records to study the impact of increasing access to
telemedicine on the health and wellbeing of rural caregivers. Life in rural communities comes with additional
barriers to daily activities. Family members may travel hours to make weekly or monthly purchases from big
box super stores. Travel time eats away at time for other activities, both paid work and family related. Farm-
related family work is often time- and labor-intensive, budgets are often stretched, and household production
activities usually require more time. Rural families have less access to restaurants, food preparation programs,
food delivery services, and the like. They are less likely to outsource household production tasks like cooking,
cleaning, washing clothes, growing food, childcare, and elder care. The compilation of this reality puts
disproportionate stress on caregivers in rural communities. Rural caregivers, predominantly women, are
vulnerable to exhaustion, increased health issues related to stress, and missing their own preventative care
screenings due to the increased burden of care within their households. This was especially true during
COVID-19. Using data from the Northeast and Southern regions of the country, the project develops a proof of
concept for a future R01 grant to study the dynamics of increasing telemedicine in rural communities in the
Midwest. The focus of this project is to document increased access to telemedicine and other remote
healthcare options for caregivers during COVID-19 and its effect on the health and wellbeing of caretakers in
rural communities. Technological advancements of the past half century have accelerated the use of big data
methods to understand major health, economic, and social trends, and the project harnesses electronic health
records from major health systems linked to the 2020 Census and American Community Survey (ACS) to
analyze differential changes in health service take up and overall health and wellbeing of caregivers and
related family members. The project will evaluate what public health policies that can effectively be
implemented to support increased access in rural communities, and which types of telemedicine prove
particularly helpful in enhancing and increasing the health and wellbeing of caregivers in rural communities."

Many health promotion programs fail to address barriers to successful adoption of healthy behavior. Barriers
include lack of knowledge about individual risk and lack of motivation to prevent a disease decades in the
future. We propose to increase awareness of individual disease risk through disclosure of individual risks for
Alzheimer’s disease and to provide a program to prepare for adoption of health behavior change. Because
women in the U.S. have twice the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and compelling evidence suggests
female-specific cardiometabolic and hormonal changes emerge in midlife that contribute to these sex
disparities, the behavioral intervention program is designed specifically for women in midlife. We hypothesize
that: 1) disclosure of individual risk information will increase awareness and motivation for health behavior
change, particularly among those at higher risk, 2) completing our intervention will increase awareness,
motivation, and action that precede health behavior change. Aim 1 is to evaluate whether the intervention
increases precursors to health behavior change. Using the electronic health record to identify participants
at risk for Alzheimer’s and baseline testing to quantify risk, we will inform participants of their individual
Alzheimer’s risk. We will randomize participants to start immediately (or after 12 weeks) the Women’s AD Risk
Reduction in Midlife (WARM) program. WARM is a 12 week online education and health coaching program,
followed by monthly group support and health coaching. Building on 10+ years of Alzheimer’s prevention
programs, WARM will focus on risks specifically elevated in midlife women. We will conduct a randomized
controlled trial to assess increased awareness, motivation, and action—precursors to adopting health behavior
change. Aim 2 is to Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the Women’s AD Risk Reduction in Midlife
(WARM). We will assess feasibility in terms of 1) completion of educational modules, 2) scores on knowledge
assessments. We will assess acceptability via questionnaires (quality of materials, preferred delivery format
and frequency, coaching support, preferred timeline, level of commitment, and cost). We will conduct semi-
structured interviews with a sub-set of participants. Aim 3 is to Evaluate the effect of WARM on changes in
AD risk factors. At baseline and after week 12 we will assess changes in body composition, blood pressure,
and blood tests (fats and sugars), and self-reported health behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep). The project
is innovative in its focus on midlife as the critical time to intervene, and disclosure of individual risk
information. The focus on successful adoption of health behaviors and the online delivery will enhance
successful implementation in later stages. It is innovative in its use of bioinformatics tools to identify a diverse
set of participants at increased Alzheimer’s risk."
10769720,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mammals are colonized with a vast and diverse consortium of microorganisms, collectively called the
microbiota, that influence a wide array of biological processes. Recent studies demonstrate that in addition to
their roles in nutrition, immunity and metabolism, the intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in the
development and activity of the nervous system, influencing several complex host behaviors. The proposed
research plan aims to uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the interaction between specific
gut microbes and the brain, and to elucidate the impact of these relationships on host physiology.
This research plan will investigate microbiome-gut-brain interactions that mediate the antiseizure effects of the
ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy and an increasing number of other
brain disorders. However, use of the KD remains low due to difficulties with implementation, compliance and
adverse side effects, and exactly how the diet succeeds in treating neural dysfunction in cases when drugs fail
remains unknown. Understanding the molecular bases for KD-mediated protection against seizures will reveal
new insights into signaling mechanisms from gut microbes to the nervous system and novel pathways for
treating neurological disease. Notably, a previous publication from our laboratory reported that the KD results
in striking changes in the gut microbiota, and these changes are required for the anti-seizure effects of the diet
in two seizure models. We now propose to i) determine how the clinical KD influences the human gut
microbiota in children with refractory epilepsy, ii) evaluate whether the KD-associated human gut microbiota
regulates seizure susceptibility in mouse models for epilepsy, iii) uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms
for microbial influences on neuronal activity. In doing so, we will consider the ability of microbes to modulate
metabolomic profiles, sensory neuronal activity, ketone body levels and/or immune homeostasis as potential
pathways for any microbiota-dependent host phenotypes.
This work will push the frontiers of microbiota-gut-brain research toward uncovering new molecular pathways
for treating neurological disease. The proposed research tests the transformative hypothesis that alterations in
the human gut microbiome contribute to the anti-seizure effects of the ketogenic diet and could inspire novel
strategies for enhancing the protective effects of the KD while overcoming major obstacles of strict dietary
therapy. It is methodologically integrative in its study of neurobiology, drawing from advancements in functional
genomics, metabolomics, gnotobiotics, imaging, molecular biology and neuroscience."

The immune system faces the external world and encounters pathogens, including viruses in barrier tissues (e.g.
skin, lung, and gut). There the immune system must detect and respond to pathogens, while simultaneously
preventing autoimmunity and promoting tissue repair. Dendritic cells (DC) in tissue are the key cells which
balance self-tolerance (preventing destruction of our bodies tissues) with pathogen surveillance.
The goal of this application is to understand how DCs develop uniquely and are adapted in the tissue to perform
and balance these functions. We have recently identified an important new mechanism, and a new molecular
target that dictates how DC in tissues differentiate in ways that impact their function. The goal of this proposal is
to gain a deeper understanding of DC biology along this regulatory axis, as a critical first step to intervene upon
tissue DC to restore health, when dysregulated. This would advance better immunization strategies as tissue
DCs are necessary for vaccine, viral, and cancer immunity. This application enables us to now test, for the first
time, how our myeloid compartment is architected to balance immune tolerance and pathogen surveillance in
barrier tissue sites.
Upon completion of this project we will understand how DCs in tissue are locally conditioned to behave in a site-
specific manner. We will gain an appreciation of how shared environmental sensing patterns are balanced
against individual cell identities, and tailored to specific pathogenic contexts. We will understand how local cues
modify the behavior of DCs, positioning us to test this in disease states. We will also identify DC behaviors that
are modifiable by local cues, enabling improved intervention on DC during disease pathogenesis and a better
model for successful DC development to improve adoptive cell therapy. The insights here are foundational, fill a
critical knowledge gap, and represent basic science advances needed to advance human health."

Amino acids are crucial nutrients that are also important to support immunity. Yet, we have limited
understanding with regard to how immune challenges modulate amino acid availability, and how immune cells
sense amino acid and transduce the signals to execute immune reponses. Rag-GTPase has recently been
identified as a key amino acid sensor that mostly transduce signals from amino acids to mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) in non-hematopoietic cells. However, Rag-GTPase also modulates
transcription factor TFEB, a member of the microphthalmia (MiT/TFE) family of HLH-leucine zipper
transcription factors, whose functions in B cells remain unknown. Moreover, Rag-GTPase independent
mTORC1 activation has been identified. How Rag-GTPase and mTORC1 coordinates to regulate humoral
immunity has not been addressed. We compared the functions of Rag-GTPase and mTORC1 in B cell
response in vivo using genetic knockout models. Our data showed that while both Rag-GTPase and mTORC1
are required for systemic immune challenges, Rag-GTPase, but not mTORC1, is critical for humoral immune
response towards respiratory influenza infection. This divergent requirement between Rag-GTPase and
mTORC1 is associated with differential amino acid availability between systemic immunization and airway
influenza infection. Furthermore, we showed that Rag-GTPase suppresses TFEB and promotes autophagy,
which is associated with ERK activation, but largely independent of mTORC1. Thus, we hypothesize that
reduced availability of specific amino acids during respiratory viral infection renders B cells dependent on Rag-
GTPase-TFEB pathway, for GC reaction and anti-influenza antibody production. In Aim 1, we will first test
whether the respiratory route of live virus immune challenge is the determining factor for Rag-GTPase
dependent, but mTORC1 independent, humoral immunity. Second, we will further investigate the temporal and
spatial dynamics of amino acid availability during immune challenges. Finally, we will test whether dietary
amino acid intervention can improve humoral immunity against respiratory viral infection. In Aim 2, we will
utilize complementary loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to elucidate the downstream signaling
mechanisms by which Rag-GTPase promotes GC reaction and humoral immunity. We will further characterize
the Rag-GTPase interactome in B cells using unbiased proteomics approach. Our study will define a novel
Rag-GTPase-ERK-TFEB signaling axis that respond to amino acid availability to promote B cell activation and
antibody production against airway viral infection."

Pancreatic cancers are devastating diseases with five year survival rate less than 9%. Currently,
there is no effective treatment for advanced disease. One major barrier to efficacy of anti-tumor
therapeutics is the dense desmoplastic stromal response. Evidence suggests that cancer
associated pancreatic stellate cells (CaPSC) produce the stromal collagen. The ECM laid down
by CaPSC is considered to be one of the major contributors of resistance to established therapies
of the diseases. Depleting CaPSC and altering vessel density could significantly improve efficacy
of existing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treatments. However, currently, there are
no approved therapies that are able to deplete CaPSCs in PDAC. We have developed a novel
therapeutic protein (ProAgio) using rational protein design. ProAgio is designed to target integrin
αvβ3 at a novel site (not the ligand binding site). ProAgio specifically induces apoptosis of integrin
αvβ3 expressing cells with high efficacy by a novel mechanism of drug action (recruiting &
activating caspase 8 at cytoplasmic domain of β3). We reasoned that, since both CaPSC and
angiogenic endothelial cells express high levels of integrin αvβ3, and since ProAgio is very
effective in inducing apoptosis of integrin αvβ3 expressing cells, ProAgio should both deplete
CaPSC and eliminate new blood vessels in and around pancreatic tumors. This unique strategy
may prove advantageous in treatment of PDAC. Our STTR phase I&II studies demonstrated
efficacy of ProAgio potentially as a PDAC treatment via various cancer models. The studies
support our hypothesis that ProAgio can provide treatment benefit by simultaneously depleting
the collagen-producing CaPSCs that support tumor desmoplasia and cancer cell growth, while
also eliminating newly grown cancer associated blood vessels that feed cancer cells and enable
cancer metastasis. Data from our STTR phase I&II studies provides proof of principle for future
clinical tests. Results from our phase II studies have led to IND application of ProAgio as a
pancreatic cancer treatment drug. The main objective of this phase IIB application is to generate
a definitive dataset to enable the development of ProAgio as a viable therapeutic option for PDAC
patients. Aim 1 will characterize the toxicity and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ProAgio as a single agent and in
combination with G-nP. Aim 2 will characterize PK property of ProAgio in cancer patients and to
obtain preliminary anti-cancer activity data of ProAgio and ProAgio + G-nP in PDAC patients. Aim
3 will analyze the effects of ProAgio in patient tumor to validate the mechanism of drug action in
patients. This study will explore new therapeutic avenue for PDAC patients."

The past decade in the US marked pivotal changes in the policy and retail environments regarding marijuana (MJ), the
most commonly used federally illicit drug, particularly prevalent in young adults and racial and sexual/gender minorities
(SGM). Despite controversy regarding recreational MJ, further legalization is likely, and states will continue to navigate
its implementation. Thus, states with legalized recreational MJ provide an opportunity and a need to monitor recreational
MJ retail and impact on various subgroups, as MJ regulatory frameworks are in their infancy and require advancements
given the nuances of MJ retail (e.g., specialty stores, uniquely diverse products, progressive promotional strategies). The
overall goal of this research is to inform regulatory efforts to minimize MJ use in vulnerable populations, in states with
legalized recreational MJ and those that subsequently legalize it. The immediate objective of this proposal is to examine
the recreational MJ market, MJ use, and related perceptions in consumer segments of disproportionately-impacted groups,
particularly diverse young adults. Our scientific premise builds on literature indicating that licit drug retail marketing –
both brick-and-mortar and online – target certain populations (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, SGM, young adults) and the
consequences of such marketing on substance use in these groups. The MJ retail has largely lacked standardized industry
marketing surveillance tools, which have been critical in establishing the impact of tobacco and alcohol retail marketing
and informing regulation. This proposal leverages our team’s prior work; we developed surveillance tools to characterize
point-of-sale practices (e.g., age verification), product availability, promotional strategies, and product pricing at brick-
and-mortar shops and online – now used broadly in research and practice. Findings indicated several issues with policy
compliance (e.g., age verification), promotional strategies appealing to young people and minorities, various health
claims, and minimal health warnings. Our team has also shown the utility of identifying young adults at high-risk for
substance use and likely marketing exposure by using industry market segmentation based on psychographics (e.g.,
values, attitudes, lifestyle); the extent to which psychographics vs. sociodemographics inform industry marketing
strategies, particularly among targeted populations, is not well known. Using a Socioecologic Framework and Diffusion
of Innovations, we aim to: 1) determine whether neighborhood demography is associated with marketing and POS
practices among recreational MJ retailers over time, accounting for policy context; and 2) compare young adult market
segments defined by age and minority status vs. psychographics in relation to MJ use, perceptions, access, and advertising
exposure in states with differing MJ policy contexts (recreational, medicinal, no legalized MJ policy) over time. Led by a
by uniquely-poised research team, this proposal is: a) responsive to NOT-DA-19-065 (public health research on
cannabis); b) based on a strong scientific premise and rationale; c) highly integrative across aims/data sources; and d)
based on rigorous methods integrating innovative applications. We include a robust dissemination plan involving
representatives from state/local agencies overseeing MJ retail implementation to speed research translation to practice."

years (in total, 12 trainees/year). Our 49 training faculty, representing multiple departments and disciplines, are
part of a cohesive scientific community that offers a strong mentoring environment.
 Central to our new training program is the commitment to educate a diverse population of students to
conduct science in a rigorous, reproducible, creative and ethical manner. Our curriculum will emphasize the
ability to think critically, to build and test models and hypotheses, and to understand the essential principles of
experimental design. Biomedical science is an empirical discipline, and our students must understand the
strengths and limitations of contemporary and classical methodologies. The ability to critically analyze data is
essential, as is competency with quantitative methods and statistical analysis.
 We want to ensure that our trainees can work effectively in diverse groups and are skilled at communicating
with a variety of audiences. In addition to coursework and a deep immersion in a research laboratory, our trainees
will participate in two (out of four) enrichment tracks focused on Communication, Community Engagement and
Advocacy, Education, and Innovation and Entrepreneurship. In the Communication track, students will have the
opportunity to hone their skills in written, verbal and graphic presentations for expert, non-expert and lay
audiences. In the Community Engagement and Advocacy track, trainees will work with students in nearby
elementary schools, children's museums and city-wide events to foster their enthusiasm for, and appreciation
of, science. Engagement in science policy and advocacy in regional and national contexts will also be featured.
Trainees participating in the Education track will be educated in “teaching techniques”, will participate in teaching
externships at local universities and give guest lectures at regional HBCUs. Trainees in the Innovation and
Entrepreneurship track will earn a certificate by taking an online course and participating in local and regional
pitch competitions, and will participate in brief externships in local biotechnology companies and the MUSC
Foundation for Research Development. For at least two of these tracks, Digital Badges will also be offered.
 As they pursue their dissertation research, our studies will participate in a variety of career development
activities that introduce them to a breadth of future opportunities within and beyond academe. They will be truly
prepared to make important contributions within the changing landscape of contemporary biomedical science."

Monoclonal antibodies against co-inhibitory immune receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 [immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs)] have revolutionized immuno-oncology by reversing T cell exhaustion and harnessing the power of the
immune system to fight solid tumors. Although ICI therapy has improved the survival of patients with metastatic
cancer, treatments are unfortunately limited by the development of immune-related adverse events. Colitis is
the most common, severe side effect of ICIs – seen in 5-10% of patients on PD-1 and up to 50% of patients on
dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade – and is marked by epithelial injury and apoptosis. To date, little is understood
about the immunologic underpinnings of PD-1 colitis, in part because mice treated with PD-1-blocking
antibodies do not readily develop gastrointestinal toxicities. This proposal presents a five-year research career
development program focused on understanding the immune drivers of human colitis that develops after PD-1
blockade [i.e., immunotherapy-related colitis (irColitis)]. Dr. Molly Thomas is an Instructor of Medicine at
Harvard Medical School in the Division of Gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital. This award will
provide Dr. Thomas with the support necessary to test the hypothesis that irColitis is caused by the expansion
of specific colon CD8+ T-resident memory (Trm) cells into cytotoxic effectors that produce IL-26 and IL-17A
and home directly to damaged epithelium where they have deleterious effects on epithelial turnover and
absorptive function. This hypothesis will be tested through the following aims: (Aim 1) Define the epigenetic
landscapes and effector functions of distinct colonic CD8+ Trm and Trm-derived effectors; (Aim 2) Determine if
CD8+ T effectors detected in the colon mucosa of irColitis patients circulate in blood and which blood immune
cell states track with disease; (Aim 3) Map interactions between CD8+ Trms and damaged epithelial cells to
understand how PD-1 inhibition leads to interferon-dependent defects in CD8+ Trm homing and epithelial
absorptive function. Through these proposed aims, Dr. Thomas will map the complex interactions between
CD8+ Trms and damaged colonic epithelium following PD-1 blockade. She will work under the guidance of her
primary mentor Dr. Nir Hacohen, an expert in immuno-oncology and autoimmunity, and her co-mentor Dr.
Alexandra-Chloé Villani, an expert in leveraging single cell genomics to understand immune heterogeneity in
health and disease. The proposed experiments, analyses, and didactic work will provide Dr. Thomas with a
unique set of skills that will enable her to transition to independence as a physician-scientist studying immune-
mediated gastrointestinal diseases. These studies will define mechanisms by which IL-26+ and IL-17A+ CD8+ T
cell effectors orchestrate pathologic inflammation and will allow for the development of diagnostic tools and
treatment strategies that will be broadly applicable to irColitis patients and those with inflammatory bowel
disease. By year four of this five-year award, Dr. Thomas will be well-positioned to develop an R01 application
to define pathologic Trm responses in the human gastrointestinal tract and therapeutic targets to treat irColitis."

and metachromatic leukodystrophy, underscore the critical unmet need for therapeutic development
more broadly across the leukodystrophies. The future of innovation, however, is limited by the pipeline
of future translational researchers interested in rare diseases.
The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Global Leukodystrophy Initiative Clinical Trials
Network (GLIA-CTN; U54TR002823) is an NIH-funded research consortium for leukodystrophy
collaboration and innovation across a network of 8 large US-based academic institutions. This
infrastructure provides a unique opportunity to recruit and support the next generation of rare disease
research leaders. We hypothesize that a formal education program in rare disease research targeting
junior research coordinators who are early in their career will facilitate long-term commitment and
passion for rare disease research. This is a population that is enriched with young scholars interested
in science who are often undecided about career paths or have had insufficient exposure to translational

of Excellence (LCE) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), a GLIA-CTN site, and the
Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics Education (ITMAT Ed) programs at the Perelman

Predoctoral Preparatory Program (P3) with 8 junior research coordinators, known as P3 scholars, based
exclusively within the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). In 2022-2023, the program expanded
to include 14 coordinators working at sites across the GLIA-CTN. Each year we aim to enroll 12-15
scholars who are junior research coordinators working within the GLIA-CTN. We recognize the
importance of diversity among future translational research leaders and will continue to recruit from
populations underrepresented in medicine (UIM).
In this application, we propose an education program, the Predoctoral Preparatory Program (P3),
which will (1) provide a curriculum related to responsible conduct of research and (2) prepare the next
generation of physician scientists in translational research through professional development workshops
and mentorship. This proposal is to further the development and implementation of a one-year program

background and a demonstrated commitment to academic leadership, research, education, and mentorship.
They have assembled an enthusiastic training faculty of 35 mentors who are committed to diversity and
inclusivity and will provide extensive opportunities for cutting-edge interdisciplinary training in basic,
translational, and clinical biomedical research. The DLBR program is centered around the following aims: 1.
Provide enhanced academic and research training, access to support resources, and social and professional
connections for incoming students from historically underrepresented groups to support their successful
transition to graduate school. 2. Provide ongoing enhanced support of DLBR trainees to foster their growth as
effective and independent scientists while cultivating self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and overall well-being.
3. Provide enhanced professional and leadership skill development to prepare DLBR trainees for successful
leadership roles in the biomedical research workforce. The 1st aim will be accomplished during the pre-
matriculation summer when DLBR trainees will engage in academic programs, a summer research rotation,
orientation activities, and cohort building activities. Training goals two and three will be supported through
subsequent programming and team-mentoring for the remainder of graduate training. Through courses and
highly interactive workshops, trainees will practice skills in rigorous and ethical scientific inquiry, effective
written and oral scientific communication, practical well-being practices, and leadership. Trainees will also
network with individuals from diverse biomedical research career paths through seminars and facilitated
networking. All DLBR programming will be reinforced by robust multi-tiered mentoring and intentional cohort
building. To supplement their foundational expertise, all DLBR mentors will receive extensive training in
effective and culturally responsive mentorship to ensure supportive and productive mentor-mentee
relationships. In addition, ongoing cohort activities will foster a strong sense of community, sense of belonging,
and social support network as trainees progress through their doctoral training. Measurable program objectives
will be improved matriculation of underrepresented PhD trainees, research productivity, PhD completion and
time to degree, number of graduates who enter and continue in biomedical research careers. DLBR will
complement and expand Dartmouth’s current initiatives to support a more diverse and inclusive community."
10773002,"PD-1 blocking agents have achieved significant success as anti-cancer therapeutics. The mechanism(s) of how
PD-1 compromises anti-tumor function remain poorly understood. We generated an antibody that recognizes
PD-1pY248 that is required for PD-1 inhibitory signaling. In three mouse tumor models, we identified PD-1
expression and phosphorylation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) but more
prominently in myeloid cells. These findings prompted us to examine the role of PD-1 in myeloid cell
differentiation and function in cancer immunity. The rapid change in hematopoietic cell output that occurs in
response to immunologic stress is known as “emergency” myelopoiesis”. During continuous low-level stimulation
mediated by cancer-derived factors, common myeloid progenitors (CMP) and granulocyte/macrophage
progenitors (GMP), undergo modest but continuous expansion with hindered differentiation leading to the output
of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). We analyzed the myeloid compartment of tumor-bearing
mice and determined that myeloid cells that expand during cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis express PD-
1 and PD-L1. Using PD-1 KO mice or WT mice treated with PD-1 blocking antibody we determined that PD-1
deletion or blockade prevented the accumulation of immature myeloid progenitor cells and stimulated
differentiation and output of Ly6Chi effector monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). To determine
whether these outcomes were mediated by a myeloid-intrinsic impact of PD-1 ablation or by the effects of PD-
1neg T cells on myeloid cells, we generated mice with conditional targeting of the Pdcd1 gene (PD-1f/f) and
selectively eliminated PD-1 in myeloid cells or T cells. Compared to T cell-specific, myeloid cell-specific PD-1
ablation more effectively decreased tumor growth. Cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis was differentially
affected. Both myeloid-specific and T cell-specific PD-1 ablation resulted in expansion and accumulation of CMP
but only myeloid-specific PD-1 ablation prevented the accumulation of GMP and switched the myeloid cell fate
from MDSCs to differentiated effector monocytes, macrophages, DC. Our findings reveal a previously
unidentified role of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway and support the novel hypothesis that switch of myeloid cell fate
commitment might be a key mechanism by which PD-1 blockade mediates its anti-tumor function. To investigate
this, we will pursue the following specific aims to determine:
1. How PD-1 signaling mediates lineage fate determination of myeloid progenitor cells in response to
 emergency myelopoiesis.
2. How PD-1 targeting impacts the metabolic and epigenetic program of myeloid cells.
3. How PD-1 affects anti-tumor immunity by regulating the crosstalk between innate and tumor-
 associated T cells."
10773004,"Pathological deposition of abnormal aggregated tau protein in neurons is one of the diagnostic
hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD). How pathological tau causes
dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains an enigma. However, neuronal dysfunction and
neurodegeneration clearly cause dementia. To understand how abnormal tau contributes to
neurodegeneration in AD and ADRD, we established a transgenic model in C. elegans for
neurodegeneration driven by human tau aggregation. In our previous work, we identified XBP-1, the
master transcriptional regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as a critical regulator of
pathological tau accumulation and toxicity. ER stress and activation of the UPR have clearly been
implicated in human tauopathy disorders by other laboratories although the functional consequences
of UPR activation on tau pathology remain unclear. We have leveraged our C. elegans model of
tauopathy to dissect the functional role of the UPR in tau pathology. We have found that tau pathology
can induce ER stress, and that UPR activation protects against tauopathy through XBP-1s. We
hypothesize that XBP-1s target genes can modulate accumulation and clearance of pathological tau.
To test this hypothesis, we upregulated the UPR in neurons in the absence of ER stress, using a
constitutively active XBP-1s expressing transgene. Transcriptomic studies of this system have
revealed key XBP-1s target genes that modulate tauopathy and cross talk with other regulatory
branches of the UPR (ATF6 and PERK branches). Given the high level of conservation of the UPR
system between mammals and C. elegans, we propose to utilize the existing model and transgenes to
dissect the mechanism by which the UPR protects against tau neurotoxicity. The Specific Aims of
this project are to: 1) Identify the molecular mechanisms of XBP1s mediated suppression of
tauopathy; 2) Examine UPR branch crosstalk contributing to tau clearance and ER associated
degradation, 3) Address the disease relevance of XBP-1s target genes to neurodegeneration in
both human disease and mouse models of tauopathy. Completion of the project as proposed will
inform the molecular mechanisms by which the UPR participates in tauopathy. We will also explore
the neuroprotective translational potential of XBP-1s mediated tau clearance in the mammalian brain."
10773106,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial multidrug efflux transporters confer resistance to structurally diverse antimicrobials, which is one of the
major causes for clinical treatment failure. Campylobacter jejuni is a major enteric pathogen and has developed
various mechanisms for antibiotic resistance. Recently, both the World Health Organization and the Centers for
Disease Prevention and Control have designated Campylobacter as a “serious antibiotic resistance threat”. In
Campylobacter, the multidrug efflux pump CmeABC, a RND-type efflux system, plays a key role in the resistance
to various antimicrobials and in intestinal colonization by mediating bile resistance. In CmeABC, the three
proteins assemble to form a powerful tripartite machinery, allowing direct efflux of substrates across both
membranes of the Gram-negative cellular envelope. CmeABC is essential for C. jejuni as it has an important
natural function for bile resistance, which is required for Campylobacter colonization in animal intestine. Typically,
CmeABC requires to function cooperatively with other resistance mechanisms (such as target mutations) to
confer clinically relevant antibiotic resistance. However, a “super” resistance-enhancing variant of CmeABC (RE-
CmeABC) has recently emerged in clinical isolates of C. jejuni. This variant pump has a distinct CmeB sequence
and is much more potent in conferring multidrug resistance. Additionally, we found that RE-CmeABC is
increasingly prevalent in clinical isolates and mediates exceedingly high-level resistance to fluoroquinolone, a
clinically important antibiotic for treating campylobacteriosis. Our preliminary data further suggest the enhanced
efflux function of RE-CmeABC is due to sequence variations in the RE-CmeB transporter. To begin to understand
how CmeABC extrudes antimicrobials, we have initiated work to decipher the structural basis of CmeABC-
mediated efflux. Our preliminary crystallization data indicate that CmeB forms a homotrimer, where individual
protomers bind to and export substrates independently. Based on the solid preliminary data, we propose in this
application to pursue three specific aims to 1) identify the specific mutations responsible for the enhanced efflux
function in RE-CmeABC, 2) define the structural basis of CmeB-mediated antibiotic efflux and how sequence
polymorphisms affect the structure-function relationship, and 3) determine the horizontal spread of RE-cmeABC
and its impact on C. jejuni fitness in the absence and presence of antibiotic selection pressure. We will use a
high throughput mapping strategy, a CRISPR-Cas9 based technique for efficient gene editing and replacement,
in vitro and animal model systems, x-ray crystallography, and single-molecule FRET to achieve the goals of the
three specific aims. The team of investigators have strong and complementary expertise, and are uniquely
positioned to conduct the proposed work, which is expected to reveal novel mechanisms used by an RND-type
transporter for antibiotic extrusion and enhanced multidrug resistance. This gained knowledge should be
transferrable to other bacterial efflux pumps, and the findings may facilitate the development of new strategies
to control the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant Campylobacter."
10773107,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA-Neuroimmune, INIA-N) consortium component is for
a U01 research project that seeks to determine how neuroimmune signaling molecules and glia contribute to
neuronal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens that promote excessive ethanol drinking. Prior work by this INIA-
N component identified neuronal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that are associated with excessive
alcohol consumption. In particular, we found that ethanol dependence and excessive intake are associated with
plasticity in glutamatergic synapses on dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1MSNs),
which comprise a major output pathway of the NAc that is heavily involved in reward-based behaviors. Recently
we discovered that, although synaptic excitation is enhanced, the membrane excitability of these neurons not
only is suppressed during acute withdrawal from ethanol, but is strongly, inversely, correlated with prior ethanol
intake. We will employ mouse behavioral models of chronic and excessive drinking, genetically engineered mice,
and brain slice electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that neuroimmune activity contributes to these synaptic
and membrane adaptations of D1MSNs. Specific aim 1 will evaluate how neuronal physiology is altered by the
cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in an ethanol-dependent manner, and it will use genetically-engineered mice for
inducible and conditional deletion of IL-33, or its receptor, from specific cell types (microglia, astrocytes, and/or
neurons) to probe the role of this signaling pathway in the escalation of alcohol intake. Specific aim 2 will take a
broader approach, using brain slice electrophysiology to ask whether NAc microglia exhibit functional
adaptations that correlate with alcohol intake and its associated adaptations in D1MSNs. Specific aim 3 will be
collaborative studies on other neuroimmune signaling and regulatory molecules identified by INIA-N investigators’
as playing a role in excessive alcohol intake. Here we will again use brain slice electrophysiology and will
determine whether manipulations of these neuroimmune molecules may alter NAc D1MSN physiology to
regulate alcohol consumption. These studies will serve the mission of NIAAA by generating new, fundamental
knowledge about the effects of alcohol on brain health, and seeks to apply such knowledge to identify new
targets for the treatment of excessive alcohol consumption."

participants will be eligible for pilot grants to develop independent research programs for their first federal and/or
non-federal TB grant applications, to bring new technologies to their laboratories, or to develop collaborative
multi-disciplinary programs that will increase opportunities for large programmatic grants related to TB research.
At completion, IN-TRAC participants will understand many of the most significant clinical problems for TB
detection, surveillance, treatment and prevention. This will be combined with the confidence to move across
multiple disciplines and with skills to communicate science effectively to ensure that their TB research is funded,
developed, implemented and known worldwide."
10774312,"Texas Biomed IN-TRAC Biosafety & Biocontainment Core (BBC) – ABSTRACT
The goal of this core is to establish a personalized Biosafety & Biocontainment training curriculum for the next
generation of tuberculosis (TB) researchers in order to prepare them to work and excel within the biocontainment
environment performing studies to advance the field. For a new investigator pursuing TB research as well as for
well-established investigators who want to enter the TB research field, it is critical for them to understand
biosafety and the biocontainment environment, including knowledge of the strengths and limitations of working
in biocontainment, in order for them to achieve their career goals. The ability to properly conduct risk assessment
including a thorough understanding of equipment and procedures in biocontainment, will further ensure
innovations in TB research, especially in resource limited areas. Our Aims are to: Aim 1. Establish and manage
a personalized Biosafety & Biocontainment curriculum. In this Aim a phased approach (assessment and
didactic phases) will be implemented to provide comprehensive and customized training. Aim 2. Execute a
Biosafety & Biocontainment training program for IN-TRAC participants. In this aim, a personalized
Biocontainment training program established for each IN-TRAC participant will be executed. Participants will
learn how to function safely and effectively in a high-containment BSL3 facility. We will divide this into three
segments: Biocontainment facility operations, General Procedures and Emergency Response Drills. Aim 3.
Apply risk assessment and mitigation strategies to emerging technology and multi-hazard scenarios.
New technology often introduces unforeseeable biosafety risks. Equipped with general biocontainment and M.tb
procedure-specific knowledge, participants will be able to properly evaluate and implement procedures when
encountering emerging technology and develop procedures to safety achieve their research goals.
Upon completion of this core curriculum, new TB researchers will be prepared/proficient in working in a
biocontainment environment, including general and specialized techniques required for success in the TB field.
Importantly, IN-TRAC participants will prepare a written and oral summary about the strengths and weaknesses
of experience for the IN-TRAC program."
10774314,"IN-TRAC ANIMAL CORE ABSTRACT
The Animal Model Core will establish a training program to introduce all IN-TRAC participants to the TB field
using a variety of animal models that can translate in silico and in vitro findings into potential application to
humans. Texas Biomed hosts the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) and has developed
large NHP programs that incorporate aerobiology, molecular biology and a variety of imaging platforms within
the Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL3). These will be the foundation of the Animal Core. SPECIFIC AIM 1:
Conduct an educational program in the use of animals for research, and alternatives. The use of animals
in research requires consideration of the three R’s (reduction, replacement, refinement). All IN-TRAC participants
will receive training in the considerations of the three R’s during experimental design, selection of appropriate
models to test their specific hypothesis, and the alternate systems available or in development for the
replacement of animals in biomedical research. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Leveraging the mouse model of TB to
study pathogenesis and testing of new therapies and vaccines. The mouse model has been a mainstay for
TB research and remains a useful tool for understanding TB immuno-pathogenesis and for screening drugs and
vaccines for TB. IN-TRAC participants will be introduced to a variety of mouse resources available for TB
research, and will be trained in theory and practice of how to design and conduct studies using rodents, and how
to interpret experimental data with scientific rigor. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Leveraging the NHP model of TB to study
pathogenesis and testing of new therapies and vaccines. Texas Biomed has a unique resource in the
SNPRC that can provide IN-TRAC participants with an in depth training in the use of NHPs in TB research. IN-
TRAC participants will be introduced to a variety of NHP resources available for TB research, and train in theory
and practice of how to design and conduct studies using NHPs, and how to interpret experimental data with
scientific rigor. At the completion of the Animal Model Core, participants will be able to effectively interpret
published data that use rodents and NHP (and other animal models, in part through externships), design
experiments to test their own hypothesis, and participate in TB research that uses animals."

platforms. AIM 1: Provide didactic and hands-on training program in confocal microscopy and optical
imaging. IN-TRAC participants will learn multi-label immunofluorescence or fluorescence in-situ hybridization
(FISH) confocal microscopy, which allows for 3- or 4-D evaluation of tissues and cells with multiple fluorochrome
labels. AIM 2. Provide didactic and hands-on training in cutting-edge cellular immunology techniques
requiring imaging support or computational analysis. The Texas Biomed Biology, Microscopy and Molecular
Cores provide high-dimensional, multi-parameter flow cytometry and analysis as well as BSL3 sorting
capabilities. Established TB researchers will provide training live cell imaging (Cytation 5) and scRNAseq (10x
Genomics) in BSL3. AIM 3: Provide didactic and hands-on training in live imaging using PET/CT and IVIS
systems. Training in whole-body live Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and X-ray Computed Tomography
(CT) imaging of NHP and in-vivo imaging system (IVIS) of rodents within the BSL3. IN-TRAC participants will
extern at the NHP MRI facilities at UTHSCA to learn the advantages and limitations of this imaging platform. At

10774320,"IN-TRAC Clinical Research & Patient Care Core (CRPCC) ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading infectious disease cause of death worldwide. In the US, TB incidence rates are
historically low, but control remains challenging in certain populations, including the communities along the US
border with Mexico. Thus, there is an urgent need for the next generation of TB researchers to have an
understanding of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of TB research, as a foundation for their future
leadership in the development of improved TB diagnostics, surveillance, treatments and vaccines. The Clinical
Research & Patient Care Core (CRPCC) of the IN-TRAC will provide to New TB Investigators (NIs) and
investigators new to the TB field, the infrastructure, resources and training in TB clinical research, and education
on the challenges faced by clinicians in managing TB cases. Our training sites are strategically located in south
Texas, a state adjacent to Mexico, which is the number one country of origin for foreign-born TB cases in the
US. The TB clinical research site is led by Dr. Restrepo, an expert in TB field epidemiology and pathogenesis in
TB patients with diabetes comorbidity or old age. Her field site is unique within the US due to its access to TB
patients enrolled on the Mexican side of the Texas border. The TB patient care training will be in San Antonio,
led by Drs. Armitige and Seaworth, an exemplary team of physicians who are affiliated with the only free-standing
TB hospital in the US, the Texas Center for Infectious Diseases (TCID). In the same setting, there are also busy
outpatient clinics: The San Antonio Metropolitan Health Department Chest Clinic, and a TB regional training and
medical consultation Center of Excellence (The Heartland National TB Center; HNTBC). Our Aims are to: Aim
1. Execute a personalized training curriculum on TB clinical research studies. We have designed a hybrid
(hands-on and virtual) training curriculum for IN-TRAC participants on all aspects of Clinical TB Research,
including ethics, study design, field logistics, data and specimen management, specimen processing and data
analysis plans and communications. Aim 2. Execute a personalized training curriculum on TB patient care.
IN-TRAC participants will be educated on the complex set of decisions that physicians make, particularly during
the management of difficult TB cases (e.g. with DR-TB, or with social problems such as homelessness), and
who require specialized management and prolonged in-hospital stays.
The mentoring team will meet with each IN-TRAC participant prior to their rotation to discuss customization of
the core curriculum, including the development of a pilot project, depending on the IN-TRAC participant’s interest.
IN-TRAC participants will provide a written and oral evaluation of their training experience."

Sperm must be motile and complete capacitation to be able to fertilize the oocyte. Soluble adenylyl cyclase
(sAC) is an enzyme in sperm that is essential for both processes. sAC knockout mice are male specific
sterile, and men with mutations which disrupt sAC are infertile. In both mice and men, all other phenotypes
observed require long periods of sAC absence to manifest. Thus, an acutely acting sAC inhibitor could be
a safe and effective on-demand contraceptive by blocking sperm functions for hours without eliciting the
side effects only seen when sAC is absent for months or years. Such a male birth control pill would only
be taken when, and as often, as needed, shortly before sex. The goal of the Weill Cornell Medicine
Contraception Research Center (WCM-CRC) is to develop acutely acting sAC inhibitors into on-demand
birth control pills. This Contraception Development Research Project focuses on advancing the in vivo
validated chemical series of sAC inhibitors which demonstrated proof-of-concept for on-demand male
contraception in mice. A `tool' compound from this series renders male mice temporarily infertile. In this
project, we propose lead optimization to enhance pharmacokinetic properties while maintaining (or
improving) potency, drug-like properties, and other efficacy-defining features. The goal of these studies is
a series of well-developed, potent, selective, drug-like, non-toxic, orally available sAC inhibitors with better
pharmacokinetic profiles to progress into in vivo animal testing (Project 2 of the WCM-CRC). Our ultimate
goal is to advance optimized leads into clinical development candidates suitable for an FDA Investigational
New Drug (IND) application to test a novel oral, nonhormonal contraceptive for men."
10904994,"Project 2
Mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a dormant state; they are immotile and unable to fertilize
the oocyte. Upon ejaculation, motility is activated via bicarbonate-induced stimulation of soluble adenylyl
cyclase (sAC: ADCY10). Men and male mice with the sAC gene knocked out are infertile, and
pharmacological inhibitors specific for sAC block in vitro fertilization and render male mice temporarily
infertile. Thus, sAC is a nonhormonal target, genetically and pharmacologically validated to be essential
for male fertility. The goal of the Weill Cornell Medicine Contraceptive Research Center (WCM-CRC) is to
develop acutely acting sAC inhibitors into safe and effective nonhormonal, orally available, on-demand
contraceptives which men take only when and as often as needed, shortly before sex. In this Contraception
Translational Research Project, we will establish a second, non-rodent animal model for testing
contraceptive efficacy; test the in vivo efficacy of optimized sAC inhibitors; and validate sperm motility as
a pharmacodynamic biomarker of efficacy for use in early phase clinical trials of an on-demand male
contraceptive. A goal of this Project, and the WCM-CRC, is to identify a lead candidate (along with
backups) to progress into studies enabling an Investigational New Drug (IND) application as a novel oral,
nonhormonal contraceptive for men."

Methadone maintenance reduces and/or eliminates the use of opioids, reduces the death rates
and criminality associated with opioid use, and allows patients to improve their health and social
productivity. In addition, enrollment in Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) can reduce the
transmission of infectious diseases associated with opioid injection, such as hepatitis and HIV.
The Computerized Oral Prescription Administration System (COPATM) device is being developed
as an automated oral liquid dispensing system. COPA is specifically designed to deliver liquid
oral controlled and non-controlled medications to the validated Intended User. While the need for
COPA began with an opioid epidemic with adverse consequences that have escalated in the last
two decades, an even more urgent need for a take-home device supporting opioid use disorder
(OUD) patients emerged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has limited
access to methadone maintenance therapy/treatment at opioid treatment programs in both urban
and rural sections of the US. The COPA device has a major application to at-home methadone
maintenance treatment, based upon the device's innovative dual biometric confirmation of both
the patient's fingerprint and dentition before delivery of drug. We propose to design, engineer and
human factor test an enhanced COPA prototype and submit it for FDA De Novo approval."
10774009,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), and diisononylphthalate (DINP) are increasingly replacing the endocrine
disrupting chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), respectively. However, BPS, BPF,
and DINP have not undergone safety testing. Perinatal exposures (in utero and during lactation) to BPA and
DEHP are associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD, a common
disease in children, is being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages and its prevalence is increasing in late
adolescence. While BPA and DEHP have been extensively studied in this context, BPS/BPF and DINP have
not. BPS exposure promoted NAFLD progression in zebrafish, and BPF serum levels are higher in NAFLD
patients than in controls. BPS and BPF levels were associated with increased prevalence of obesity in children,
a risk factor for NAFLD. DINP caused lipidomic disruption in neonatal mice, while phthalate exposure caused
hepatic steatosis in adult mice. Thus, like BPA and DEHP, early-life BPS/BPF and DINP exposure may promote
NAFLD development/progression. To date, the mechanisms by which bisphenols and phthalates, particularly as
a mixture, trigger these long-term metabolic consequences are elusive. Here, we will test the hypothesis that
early life exposure to a bisphenol/phthalate mixture activates RAGE signaling pathways, triggers a trained
immune response in peripheral monocytes, and reprograms the epigenome/transcriptome in liver and in
peripheral monocytes, thereby priming offspring for exaggerated metabolic dysfunction upon exposure to
Western diet. This ViCTER consortium will address this novel hypothesis through integrated studies in mice and
in human subjects."
10772195,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 3
Nearly 53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund remediation site. Superfund sites contain a wide va-
riety of pollutants, including organic chemicals, metals, carbonaceous material, and silica. Although each com-
ponent is capable of damage to organisms, their potential to combine into unique hazardous agents has been
understudied. Interestingly, when these agents are present together, particularly during thermal treatment (TT),
they combine to form particulate matter (PM) with chemisorbed free radicals that persist in the environment
and are active in biological systems (environmentally persistent free radicals: EPFRs). EPFRs are produced
during TT of hazardous wastes. Nearly 30% of all Superfund sites (non-groundwater) are remediated by TT.
EPFR concentrations near Superfund sites range from 1x1018–4x1019 radicals/g of PM. Colfax, LA hosts a haz-
ardous waste TT facility, which disposes of fireworks, explosives, and military ordnances. 68% of Colfax’s resi-
dents are African American and median household income is $26,149, indicating the community’s institutional
vulnerability. Project 3 will measure concentrations of EPFRs to estimate human exposure in Colfax. We will
also measure other components of combustion-generated PM across size fractions and detonation-related
noise as a co-stressor. Project 3 addresses the three overarching objectives of the 2018 Strategic Plan for the
Superfund Research Program. By characterizing EPFRs emitted from this TT site handling hazardous wastes
including waste from Superfund sites, we address an issue of high relevance to inform solution-oriented re-
search. We will maximize the impact of our program’s investments by coordinating with the Research Transla-
tion component of the Administrative Core to facilitate translation of our results to actionable information for the
Colfax community. Further, we will coordinate with the Community Engagement Core (CEC) to implement our
community-based participatory research model. This novel approach will foster innovation by designing and
implementing a field sampling plan for size distributions of EPFRs, size distributions of other PM components,
and noise as a co-stressor. The overarching hypothesis of this research is that EPFRs are produced in meas-
urable quantities in PM during TT, so that outdoor and in-home EPFR exposure increases with decreasing dis-
tance to the source. In Aim 1, we will partner with the Colfax community on plans for assessing exposure to
hazardous air pollutants from hazardous waste TT emissions and determine if collaboration will promote com-
munity empowerment and engagement on public health advocacy. This work is planned in partnership with two
community organizations and in coordination with the CEC. Aim 2 will characterize Colfax residents’ exposures
to EPFRs in PM by size distribution and composition, how exposures change with distance downwind of the TT
facility, and how exposures correlate to detonation-related noise. Aim 3 will characterize in-home concentra-
tions of EPFRs and additional chemical and non-chemical stressors among Colfax study participants."
10772196,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 4
Thermal treatment of hazardous waste including Superfund Site wastes and soils leads to the formation of
environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) associated with emitted particulate matter (PM). Many metals
such as copper, iron, zinc or nickel present in PM form EPFRs with varying yields and different degrees of
stabilization and persistency. Such EPFR entities were shown to be potentially a primary factor causing the
observed cardiopulmonary health effects in exposed populations. Our studies of model systems containing
particles with single metal speciation and associated EPFRs has allowed for significant advancement in
understanding the formation mechanism of EPFRs as well as the respiratory and cardiac health effects
resulting from EPFR exposure. The central hypothesis of Project 4 is that the formation of EPFRs and their
biological activation and their propensity to undergo catalytic cycle, producing •OH, is defined by the
constituents of PM and physico-chemical properties of the media (media pH, ionic strength, and polarity)
accelerate or prevent EPFR activation. Major scientific questions explored by Project 4 include 1) how does the
persistent EPFR in ambient air transform to very active, redox cycling species in biological systems and 2) can
the reactivity of EPFRs be exploited as a means to prevent or control EPFR formation and their detection?
Project 4 takes a systematic approach to address these questions, starting with defining the mechanism by
which EPFRs transition from persistent radicals to reactive species generating ·OH (i.e., activation). A bottom-
up approach is used in the studies; results obtained from laboratory-made samples with simple composition
will be compared and evaluated against more complex combustion-generated EPFRs and, finally, field-
collected EPFRs. Capitalizing on the results from previous studies, we propose a method for EPFR prevention
formation that will be studied in detail. This method is based on the “in situ” deactivation of the metal centers in
thermal treatment (TT) facilities, thus effectively blocking the EPFR emissions. The field sensor development is
based on EPFR propensity to generate hydroxyl radicals and is based on the visible light absorption by
sensory solution. The results of these studies will provide a basis for technology development to control the
emission of EPFRs during TT of Superfund sites materials and to develop devices for simple and fast detection
and measurement of EPFRs in field."
10772198,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 5
There is strong evidence that environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) associated with partic-
ulate matter (PM) and soils found in/around declared and potential Superfund sites pose adverse
health effects. Mitigation of the associated environmental risks requires a detailed understanding of
EPFR-contaminated air and soil systems. Specifically, Project 5 is in direct alignment with SRP Man-
date 4, which is elucidating chemical and physical methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of these
hazardous substances. Project 5 will study the microscopic, or atomistic, properties of EPFR for-
mation, including their remarkable stability in the environment, and will model the resulting influences
of chemical decay on a broad base of metal oxide (MO) platforms. Employing a toolbox of state-of-
the-art experimental and molecular ab initio computational methods across differing material plat-
forms (surfaces, nanoclusters/powders, clays, EPA fly ash, soil), our continued focus is on elucidating
individual details of and corresponding local effects (electronic/chemical/atomic structure) on organic
molecular-metal oxide/center chemisorption, ensuing charge transfer (redox), and consequent chemi-
cal degradation pertinent to EPFR-containing systems such as PM, powders, clays, and real-world
(field EPFR) materials. Our Aims focus on answering three simple questions at an atomistic level: 1)
How do EPFRs chemically form? 2) What causes EPFR decay? and 3) Why are EPFR properties simi-
lar across differing platforms? While our previous efforts have elucidated trends in EPFR formation,
the connection between EPFR decay mechanisms, lifetimes, and dependence on MO—the path to
destabilization/remediation (SRP Mandate 4)—has not yet been addressed and is a main goal of our
project. Although focused primarily on revealing fundamental environmental science, our Project will
work symbiotically with the Center. By identifying material factors from our other SRP Projects and
correlating results across differing material platforms, we will obtain synergistic/antagonistic tendency
parameters for EPFR destabilization/remediation that translate to other Projects, and in turn, initiate
and clarify mitigation and remediation strategies. By employing experimental processes that both
model and recapitulate real world exposures, Project 5 will provide a picture of the microscopic sys-
tems generating the EPFRs and related adsorbate systems, but more importantly, will interrogate ef-
fects that promote/hinder degradation and the corresponding products that influence and enhance
activities across the Center (Projects 1–4 and all the Cores). Integrating closely with and expanded by
Project 4, this will allow our Center to synergistically elucidate the atomic mechanisms of the EPFR
chemistry in a scalable and predictive manner that contributes to understanding biochemical health
effects, mitigation, and remediation of these particle-bound pollutants at Superfund sites."
10773458,"A Central Role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in LPL Maturation in Adipocytes
SUMMARY
My laboratory has a long-standing interest in protein folding and degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) by defining the (patho-)physiological importance of mammalian ER quality-control machineries in vivo. ER-
associated degradation (ERAD) is the principal protein quality-control mechanism responsible for targeting
misfolded proteins in the ER for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. The SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex
represents the most conserved branch of ERAD from yeast to humans. We recently showed that SEL1L-HRD1
ERAD protein complex coordinates with autophagy, or specifically ER-phagy, in adipocytes to ensure the
maturation of lipoprotein lipases (LPL), a key enzyme involved in lipoprotein hydrolysis and systemic lipid
partitioning, in the ER. ERAD degrades misfolded nascent LPL in the ER and, when ERAD is impaired, LPL
forms aggregates and sequestered in ER fragments which are subsequently cleared by ER-phagy. When ERAD
and autophagy are both compromised, ER fragments containing LPL aggregates spatially coalesce into a distinct
cellular architecture termed Coalescence of ER Fragments (CERFs). Proteomics screens identify lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) and ER chaperone BiP as principal components of CERFs. Hence, our data point to a synergism
between ERAD and autophagy in adipocytes; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains vague.
Our proteomics screens for SEL1L and LPL interactors both identified CCPG1, an ER-resident ER-phagy
receptor, as a top hit. Strikingly, our preliminary data showed that CCPG1 interacts with LPL and is an ERAD
substrate, i.e. degraded by SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, suggesting that CCPG1 may link ERAD to ER-phagy of LPL
aggregates. Demonstrating the clinical relevance, we further showed that disease-causing LPL variants in
patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia are retained intracellularly as large aggregates in the absence of ERAD.
We will test the hypothesis that SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD regulates ER-phagy activity via ER-phagy receptor
CCPG1 to maintain ER homeostasis and ensure the maturation of secreted proteins such as LPL in
adipocytes. This model expands the current paradigm in ER biology by placing SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD at the
center of cellular quality-control function and identifying new LPL regulators. Using various mouse models, we
will (1) determine whether SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD regulates ER-phagy of LPL aggregates via CCPG1 in adipocytes;
and (2) delineate the pathological importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD and CCPG1-mediated ER-phagy in the
pathogenicity of LPL disease mutants and its underlying mechanism. This study will provide unprecedented
insights into the role of various key ER quality control machineries in regulating LPL biology in adipocytes.
RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: LPL deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to abnormal
accumulation of triglycerides in the blood and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This
study will establish a key mechanism underlying the regulation of LPL maturation in adipocytes and shed light
on the crosstalk between ERAD and ER-phagy in adipocytes in health and diseases."

Agricultural workers are essential to the US economy and its food systems yet experience a “digital
divide” that limits access to health services, including telehealth, and results in poor health outcomes. The
purpose of the proposed Agricultural Workers Digital Equity Initiative (AWDEI) is to transform
agricultural workers’ access to affordable, reliable high-speed broadband internet to enhance telehealth
models and reduce health inequities. The proposed AWDEI will engage community-based partners across
North Carolina (NC) that serve agricultural workers and their families. The project team will use
intervention mapping in combination with input from the NC Agriculture Digital Alliance and its Health
Equity Research Assembly workgroup. The NC Farmworker Health Program maintains an existing data
system for tracking health outcomes among agricultural worker patients, and it will leverage a partnership
with its research team to implement a longitudinal, repeated cross-sectional survey of agricultural workers
to assess changes in internet access over the course of the project. The outcome of this project will
improve internet connectivity for agricultural workers and their families. This will allow for better
utilization of comprehensive health care delivery systems and contribute to improved management of
chronic medical conditions including mental health. This project will also leverage opportunities for
improvement of electronic health record system communication among community health sites."
10931509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid abuse is devastating communities across the United States and is responsible for untold suffering. The
synthetic opioid fentanyl, whether due to prescription or illicit use, is involved in nearly half of reported opioid-
related deaths. Unlike heroin and morphine, fentanyl is commonly administered through non-intravenous routes,
but we have a limited mechanistic understanding of fentanyl use and abuse vulnerability. A leading hypothesis
for the transition from use to abuse, in vulnerable individuals, is the recruitment of drug-induced gene expression
changes in certain brain circuits and cells following repeated drug exposure. However, identifying such circuit-
and cell-type specific populations, in combination with their underlying genetic and functional adaptations, is
often limited by the resolution, throughput, and data registration of current assays. The overall goal of this project
is to (i) generate machine--guided behavioral characterization of oral and intravenous fentanyl self-administration
and reinstatement in male and female mice that captures individual risk vulnerability, and (ii) perform brain-wide
mapping by integrating new enabling technological platforms including single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Pixel-
seq), whole brain cell type specific circuit connectivity, and functional distributed brain-wide neural activity
recordings (Neuropixel 2.0), recently developed by PIs in our team. To realize the potential for the molecular and
functional brain mapping and data registration, we have three Specific Aims: 1) perform single-cell spatial
transcriptomic profiling, with circuit-specificity, in mice with varying degrees of fentanyl-seeking behavior; 2)
perform single-cell whole-brain activity mapping, with cell-type and circuit-specificity, in mice with varying
degrees of fentanyl-seeking behavior; 3) perform brain-wide distributed large-scale electrophysiological
recordings during oral fentanyl-seeking and integrate spatially resolved transcriptomic data with recording data.
In the first Aim, Pixel-seq will be used to generate cell atlases, analyze drug- and behavior-associated spatially
conserved gene expression, and map neuronal connectivity by coupling with retrograde viral tracing. In the
second Aim, we will perform immediate early gene-based whole-brain activity mapping, contextualized by cell
type-specific afferent connectivity, after fentanyl self-administration and reinstatement. In the third Aim, we will
first perform Neuropixel2.0 electrophysiological recording of the brain-wide distributed regions of interest, and
then integrate and align Neuropixel2.0 and Pixel-seq data in a new assay called NeuroPixel-seq (NP-seq). The
proposed project is innovative as our integrative approaches will, for the first time, generate spatial multimodal
data of unprecedented depth and resolution within the context of opioid relapse risk. It is significant because our
data will provide a much-needed accessible oral fentanyl self-administration model for the neuroscience
community, paired with the first fentanyl cellular-resolution atlas, allowing non-specialized labs an accessible
beachhead for participating in the identification of the mechanistic basis for fentanyl use and relapse in mice."
10932920,"Project Summary
In 2021, the number of drug overdoses in New York continued to rise, with 4,946 deaths involving opioids.
Synthetic opioids are driving the rise as these are mixed with other substances taken by people who use drugs
(PWUD). Alarmingly, the rates of overdose deaths are rising faster for Black and Latinx individuals,
exacerbating health inequities. The New York State agency that regulates addictions treatment—the Office of
Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS)—oversees a system that annually serves 350,000 individuals with
substance use disorders (SUD). Within the system, outpatient clinics provide the majority of treatment services
for individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD). In response to the continuing opioid crisis, OASAS is calling for
new approaches that embrace person-centered care, evidence-based practices, equitable treatment, and harm
reduction principles. OASAS envisions a revised treatment system that better retains clients in treatment,
mitigates adverse healthcare events, and reduces deaths. To drive change, OASAS will invest in a quality
measurement and management (QM2) strategy that provides performance feedback to activate leadership
and staff of clinics to improve practice as well as publicizes quality measures to ensure public accountability.
Using the Donabedian framework as a guide, the OASAS QM2 strategy will include a suite of structural (e.g.,
client/counselor ratios), process (e.g., use of medications for OUD), and outcome (e.g., hospitalization for
detoxification) quality measures. In support of the strategy, OASAS will also provide funding to ensure all
clinics have electronic health records (EHR) that have capacity to capture and report on quality measures. The
OASAS strategy will address common barriers to QM2 efforts, including: inadequate technological capacity at
clinics, dearth of validated quality measures for SUD treatment, limited data literacy in the workforce,
insufficient expertise in change management among staff, and clinic leadership resistance due to concerns
about fairness in accounting for the clinical complexity of their clients. In addition, OASAS recognizes that
gathering data directly from patients is essential to assessing whether their goals and needs are addressed in
a person-centered system of care. OASAS will work with academic partners to develop measures and provide
support to clinics to address these barriers. This QM2 research center (QM2-RC) proposal comes from an
academic-government partnership that has a longstanding history of collaborating on studies to improve
treatment for SUD. The broad aim is to build then test a science-based QM2 strategy for person-centered
treatment. The project will leverage OASAS's investment in its new QM2 strategy and policy leadership. The
academic partners will offer expertise in statistical methods for measurement validation, risk adjustment, and
causal inference that will address some obstacles to QM2 as well as build the evidence base for the benefits of
the strategy. The team will also assess how clinics and other stakeholders—e.g., patients, payers—incorporate
the QM2 strategy into practice improvement, contract negotiations, and choosing clinics."

Despite decades of treatment with ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers, and the
recent addition of SGLT2 inhibitors, chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients continue to progress
towards end stage kidney disease. While studying mechanisms of proteinuria and kidney
disease a decade ago, we identified and published circulating sialylated Angiopoietin-like-4
(ANGPTL4) and mutated versions of the human protein as a potential therapy to reduce
proteinuria via interaction with glomerular integrins. Subsequent studies (preliminary data in this
proposal) have now shown that transgene secreted rat ANGPTL4 and the mutated human
ANGPTL4 protein 8520 reduce the progression of CKD in rat models of focal and segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)and diabetic nephropathy (DN), respectively. Moreover, the
preservation of inulin clearance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic rats treated with 8520
was superior to control treated rats, and 8520 + ACE inhibitors superior to control treated rats or
rats treated with ACE inhibitors alone. We further noted that 8520 treatment reduces kidney
interstitial capillary apoptosis significantly, thereby also reducing interstitial fibrosis, potentially
via interaction with integrins.
In this proposal, we plan to extend our mechanistic studies on the beneficial interaction of 8520
with integrins in kidney interstitial capillaries, while also extending potential therapeutic studies
in rat models of DN and FSGS, that include comparisons with ACE inhibitors and SGLT2
inhibitors, and additional vital sign monitoring using telemetry. Finally, we study potential
therapeutic effects of 8520 in a large animal (minipig) model of CKD.
In Aim 1, 8520 efficacy in improving CKD will be studied in ZSF1 diabetic rats and Buffalo Mna
(FSGS) rats, including comparisons and combinations with ACE inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and
controls.
In Aim 2, we will study whether the anti-apoptosis effects of 8520 on kidney interstitial capillaries
are mediated via Integrin β1 or Integrin β5. Additional Mass Spectrometry studies on purified
8520 will be conducted to develop an assay to monitor plasma levels, and an ELISA to study
potential immune response to mutations in 8520 will be developed.
In Aim 3, the autologous phase of nephrotoxic nephritis will be studied in minipigs to determine
the efficacy of 8520 in slowing the progression of CKD in a large animal model."
10931717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developing an individualized approach to interpreting patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) scores is
essential to providing quality care. In this proposal, we plan to create an individualized minimally clinically
important difference (MCID) that is specific to each patient in order to improve the ability of PROMs to assess
individual patient preferences and measure responsiveness to treatment in heterogeneous patient populations.
Specifically, we will evaluate how clinically relevant information (e.g., baseline severity, sociodemographic
characteristics) affects the interpretation of PROMs and how this information should be incorporated when
making clinical decisions for individual patients. Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (paralysis) is a life-changing
condition caused by injury to one recurrent laryngeal nerve and results in temporary or permanent glottal
incompetence. Effects on health and quality of life can include loss of voice, swallowing dysfunction, and
psychosocial distress. Paralysis is suited for developing the individualized MCID because (1) treatments exist,
but effectiveness is poorly characterized; (2) decision-making is based on individual patient preferences; and
(3) patient symptoms are heterogeneous, affected by injury severity and unique patient characteristics.
Our team has pioneered statistical theory to develop the individualized MCID and simultaneously developed
and validated the Cord Paralysis Experience (CoPE) – a novel PROM designed to assess disability specific to
paralysis. The proposed study will develop an individualized MCID that incorporates each patient's injury
severity, vocal demands, and sociodemographic characteristics, which can be used to improve the
interpretability of PROMs at the point-of-care and align patient-provider expectations. To do this, we will
perform an observational cohort study that measures pre- and post-treatment CoPE score changes among
adults treated for acute paralysis (<3 months from injury, when symptoms are most severe) with standard-of-
care interventions across a 37-site national collaborative of high-volume voice centers. The specific aims for
this project are: (1) create individualized minimal clinically important differences (iMCID) that account for each
patient's baseline injury severity, vocal demands, and sociodemographic characteristics, (2) test the
heterogeneity of treatment effect among patients with acute paralysis to identify factors associated with
treatment effectiveness of speech therapy and/or injection augmentation, and (3) develop a method to
contextualize patient preferences using the iMCID with expected treatment effects in order to align patient-
provider expectations. This work will revolutionize how the MCID is applied in heterogeneous patient
populations while enabling clinical trials to improve the care of patients with paralysis, and making CoPE a
useful, standardized way to assess disability in patients with paralysis at the point-of-care."

The ability to time underlies adaptive behavior. Precise motor behavior is carefully timed.
Decisions about whether or not to take an action depend on knowledge of when they are
appropriate. Memories for how long actions usually take underlies most ordinary activity such as
planning a day or knowing how long it takes to cross a street. This learning of time is automatic
and a foundation of behavioral organization. Disordered timing and deficits in the capacity to
anticipate predictable events are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders including
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and depression. The diminished capacity
to anticipate future consequences also play a role in substance abuse disorders. Distortions in
timing and anticipation are both a symptom of the disorders as well as a source of additional
problems.
The purpose of this research is to understand how times are learned, remembered and used to
guide behavior. We explore the psychological and biological mechanisms that govern both
when we make a response at the right time and those that govern our ability to withhold a
response when it is the wrong time. These processes are studied in animal models that allow us
to observe and alter the functioning of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical brain circuits that
underlie these capacities. In particular, we are interested in how dopamine signaling in these
circuits conveys information about time. For the first time we will study how dopamine signals to
the cortex convey information about whether and when an event will occur. We will also test the
hypothesis that the dopamine also conveys information about the reliability of that information.
Understanding these basic mechanisms will lead to new treatment strategies and targets for a
wide range of psychiatric disorders and human problems."

Although early-stage and low grade endometrial cancer generally exhibits a favorable prognosis, metastatic
and recurrent endometrial cancer is incurable with currently available standard therapies for most women.
Therefore, there is an urgent obligation to explore the mechanism of tumor metastasis and recurrence to
further elucidate the progression of endometrial cancer. We have developed a genetically engineered mouse
model for metastatic and recurrent endometrial cancer that implicates coexistent Pten and Mig-6 mutations in
endometrial cancer. Pten mutation is not sufficient for distant metastasis, but mice with concurrent ablation of
Mig-6 and Pten develop distant metastasis. After hysterectomy at stage I of endometrial cancer in mutant mice
with deficiency of Pten and Mig-6, the double mutant mice developed recurrence of endometrial cancer in the
abdomen and lung. Our preliminary results show that the expression of genes related to cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway was significantly increased in the mutant mice. Based upon these results, we
hypothesize that MIG-6 suppresses metastasis and recurrence in endometrial cancer with PTEN
mutation by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. Our Specific Aims are directed at understanding: 1) the
tumorigenic effects of MIG-6 loss in recurrence of endometrial cancer with PTEN mutation; 2) the molecular
signature of primary tumor, circulating tumor cells, and recurrent tumor in the mutant mice; and 3) the ability of
statins to prevent recurrence in endometrial cancer. There is strong innovation in the novelty of our hypotheses

10767822,"In this application, I propose to work on sensing and understanding innate immunity in ischemic heart disease.
I will ask the overarching question how cardiovascular disease, and more specifically the risk factor
hypertension, affects hematopoiesis, i.e. innate immune cell production, in the bone marrow. I propose to
tackle two major goals: 1. to develop and validate fundamental science and translational imaging tools that
provide in vivo data on bone marrow hematopoiesis, including intravital microscopy and positron emission
tomography/magnetic resonance imaging; 2. to decipher how ischemic heart disease disease alters bone
marrow function, and the organ's output of inflammatory immune cells. My immediate focus will be the bone
marrow vasculature. This focus is motivated by the influence of the vascular stem cell niche, which instructs
hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, progenitor lineage bias and leukocyte migration. At the same time, the
bone marrow vasculature is part of the systemic circulation, and therefore exposed to cardiovascular risk and
disease-promoting pathways. It is unknown if and how bone marrow vasculature changes in ischemic heart
disease, and how these changes modulate systemic innate immune cell supply. Motivated by evidence that
systemic leukocyte levels correlate with cardiovascular mortality, I will address this knowledge gap with the

11159882,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, exceeding deaths from colon, breast, and prostate
cancers combined. Resistance to chemo and targeted therapy is very common. Radiation therapy (RT)
remains a key treatment in about 60% of lung cancer patients.
We seek to develop a novel nanotherapeutic (termed PETTRA) that homes to EGFR+ lung tumors and
delivers siRNA against Polo-like kinase 1 (siPLK1). EGFR is an ideal homing target since it is routinely profiled;
and is overexpressed in 50% of lung cancer patients. PLK1 is among the strongest cancer targets due to its
crucial roles in cell division and DNA repair, and inhibiting PLK1 leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic
death. Cells in G2/M arrest are also most sensitive to radiation. Thus, PETTRA is hypothesized to be effective
as a monotherapy and as a radiation sensitizer for lung cancer. Or prototype PETTRA has demonstrated good
safety and efficacy for such dual proposes in cells and in mice. Herein, we propose to further optimize the
material to enhance the efficacy and safety. While lipid-based particles have been effective at delivering
siRNAs to the liver with 4 FDA approved drugs in the past few years, no platform has been successful in solid
tumors yet. We have solved the limitations of nanoparticle delivery and achieved long circulation half-life (e.g.,
25 hrs in monkeys), 10-fold increased siRNA accumulation in tumors, specific delivery to target cells (by 5 to 8-
fold over normal cells), excellent PLK1 gene knock-down (e.g., by 84%), and tumor inhibition (e.g., by 90%) in
mouse models. Tech-transfer for GMP manufacturing of our nanoparticles has been accomplished.
Phase I: In Aim 1, we will optimize (by evaluating various EGFR antibody drugs (Ab) and increasing the
loading of EGFR antibody and siPLK1 by at least 3-fold) and screen for the lead constructs that yield
hydrodynamic size <120 nm, 75% gene knockdown, 7-fold greater uptake to EGFR+ over EGFR- cells, >70%
cell death in EGFR+ lung cancer cells, and safety to normal cells (<15% death). Proof of concept efficacy and
safety of the lead nanoconstruct will be performed in metastatic lung tumor mice.
Phase II: In Aim 2, efficacy of the optimal PETTRA will be assessed, both alone and in combination with RT.
Clinically relevant orthotopic NSCLC mouse models will be utilized, and findings will be validated in humanized
mice bearing patient-derived tumors. Free drug counterparts, nanoparticle delivering single agents, and first-
line chemo will be used as benchmarks. In Aim 3, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety profile of
PETTRA will be evaluated in tumor-bearing mice and in non-human primates.
Results will provide important data towards an investigational new drug application to the FDA. Successful
siRNA delivery has the potential to create hundreds of new targeted therapies for difficult to drug genes at low
costs, benefiting both precision and personalized medicines. This project is a collaboration among PDX
Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Engineering Department, and the Knight Cancer Institute of OHSU."
10766613,"The study of brain-immune interactions has contributed to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the
pathophysiology of mental disorders and has provided new insights into their prevention and treatment. Notably,
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions to restrict interactions between the brain and periphery, limiting the
influence of peripheral inflammation on the brain. However, increasing evidence indicates impairment of the BBB
in conditions like autism and schizophrenia, which combined with the consistently elevated levels of the cytokines
IL-6 and IL-1β, could potentially affect the ontology and outcome of neuropsychiatric disease. Thus, this proposal
addresses the connectivity of peripheral-neuroinflammation through brain vasculature, its impact on behavior,
and how they interact in response to an environmental “second hit”. We will study this interplay within the brain-
immune axis in the context of genetic susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. Besides providing a compelling
rationale to devise immune therapeutic strategies, the demonstration of a brain-immune link will be crucial for
understanding the mechanisms driving disease processes in mental illness.
Our proposal makes use of a model of human genetic susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease conferred by the
22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS). Based on the inclusion of genes that could affect BBB function, our
previous work demonstrated BBB compromise in 22qDS, a phenotype recapitulated in the mouse model of the
disease. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that adult 22qDS model mice have elevated levels of IL-6
and IL-1β, cytokines that promote T cell responses characterized by the expression of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL-17. We find enhanced IL-17-mediated inflammatory activation in the brain, modeling the exaggerated
IL-17 responses seen in 22qDS and neuropsychiatric patients. Notably, 22qDS mice also exhibit behavioral
deficits reminiscent of those seen in human patients. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that inflammation
across the brain-immune axis exacerbates a deficient BBB to promote neuroinflammation and
neuropsychiatric disease in 22qDS. To address this, we will: (Aim 1) Define the links between these different
phenotypes throughout development. (Aim 2) Determine how the BBB impacts brain-immune axis responses to
environmental “second hits” known to trigger symptom onset and the potential of restoring BBB properties
therapeutically. (Aim 3) Identify potential immune therapeutic strategies aiming at brain-immune axis dysfunction
to treat behavioral deficits. As CHOP houses the world's largest 22qDS clinic and Penn is a leader in
neuropsychiatric research, our environment is ideal for translating these studies into actionable science."
10766630,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE),
is the third most common cause of vascular death after a heart attack and stroke. VTE is responsible for 300
000 deaths annually in the USA alone. Although the development of direct oral anticoagulants has improved the
treatment of VTE, there are still significant bleeding risks associated with anticoagulant therapy. A better
understanding of the pathogenesis of VTE would aid in developing novel, effective and safer drugs. Although
the etiologic factors of DVT codified by Virchow’s triad, i.e., hypercoagulability, blood stasis, and endothelial cell
dysfunction, are still relevant, recent studies suggest that DVT is primarily a thromboinflammatory-mediated
event. This opens a new possibility that suppression of thromboinflammation may be an ideal approach to
prevent and treat VTE. The endothelium is an important contributor to thromboinflammation in DVT. Our recent
studies show that Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder2), a signaling adapter protein, plays a central and key role in
integrating inflammatory signaling initiated by diverse inflammatory stimuli in endothelial cells. Our studies
identify for the first time that Gab2 mediates the assembly of the CBM (CARMA3-BCL10-MALT1) signalosome
in endothelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Gab2-mediated CBM signalosome not only leads to the
activation of NF-kB and prothrombotic gene expression but also exocytosis of P-selectin and VWF via activation
of the Rho signaling pathway. In vivo studies show that global deficiency of Gab2 or inhibition of MALT1 in the
CBM signalosome by specific pharmacological inhibitors protects against LPS- and S. pneumoniae infection-
induced inflammation and inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation-induced venous thrombosis. These studies identify
novel inflammatory signaling mechanisms and suggest they could play a crucial role in venous thrombosis.
However, many knowledge gaps exist still in our understanding of these mechanisms and their contribution to
VTE. We hypothesize that endothelial Gab2-MALT1-mediated signaling plays a crucial role in
thromboinflammation and contributes to the pathogenesis of VTE and targeting Gab2-MALT1 signaling by
pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 will have therapeutic potential in preventing and treating VTE. The specific
aims are to (1) elucidate molecular mechanisms by which Gab2 mediates thromboinflammatory signaling
in endothelial cells, (2) determine the role of endothelial Gab2-MALT1 signaling in venous thrombosis
using cell-specific Gab2 and MALT1 knockout mice, (3) assess the influence of the Gab2-MALT1
signaling on venous thrombus resolution and vein wall injury. The proposed studies will employ innovative
experimental approaches and unique transgenic mice Impact: Our proposed studies will provide novel insights
into thromboinflammatory signaling in endothelial cells and other relevant cell types. Elucidating the role of Gab2-
MALT1-mediated signaling in thromboinflammation and venous thrombosis would aid in developing novel and
ideal therapeutic drugs to prevent and treat VTE without increasing bleeding risk."

are increasingly linking genome wide data (e.g., DNA variants, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility) with
other high-throughput molecular data (e.g., transcripts, proteins, metabolites). These additional omics
technologies have been useful for extending the biological relevance of GWAS findings by providing functional
interpretation of GWAS signals, biomarker identification, disease subtyping, and understanding of molecular
processes that underlie disease etiology in relevant tissues. Despite the promise offered by multi-omics data,
analysis is often challenging due to multiple large and high-dimensional data sets; heterogeneity across
technologies, coverage, range, and signal quality; decisions about how and when to integrate data; and the lack
of data from diverse subjects. The multi-omics field is quickly evolving, and we and others have developed
methodology regarding multi-omics analyses. In particular, network science and graph analytics has been an
intuitive framework for identifying interactions across omics modalities. In response to PAR-22-095 (“National
Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Short Courses for Genomics-Related Research Education”), we
have developed the Multi-Omics and NETwork analysis workshop (MONET) to provide an interactive experience
to learn about multi-omics analysis and the application of network methods. The MONET training would
complement the mission of NHGRI as genetic analyses are frequently being integrated with other omics profiles
and it is increasingly important to have a trained workforce that has familiarity with multi-omics tools. For
MONET, we propose a 7-day immersive experience for ~25 researchers each summer 2024-2028. MONET will
consist of ~50 hours of lectures, discussion sessions, computational labs, and tours. Each day will include
didactic portions providing overviews of the technologies and methods. The rest of the time will primarily be
devoted to hands-on sessions where participants will implement methods using provided sample code and data
sets. So that participants also understand how data are generated, we will organize tours of our technology
cores, in addition to an outing to an industry partner. We will also include discussion sessions on cross-cutting
topics for multi-omics research including omics data preparation, harmonization, and computing, in addition to
omics data sharing, privacy and policy issues. Finally, multi-omics research requires a team science approach
which will be developed through group exercises. Participants will be post-baccalaureate researchers (e.g.,
MS/PhD students, research staff, post-doctoral fellows, clinical fellows, junior and senior research investigators)
who have interest in analyzing multi-omics data and sufficient programming knowledge to follow data analysis
procedures. Instructors will be drawn from experts with experience in genetics, bioinformatics and data science
at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, affiliated institutions, and external guest lecturers."
10755258,"Mitochondria form elaborate reticular networks that make physiologically important contacts with nearly every
other organelle. Recently, mitochondrial membrane contact sites (MMCSs) have been shown to play a role in
regulating mitochondrial function. Beyond physically tethering organelles, MMCSs have been implicated in
interorganelle communication, modulating mitochondrial fusion and fission, and adapting the mitochondrial
network to function under stress conditions. Despite progress in defining the molecular composition of individual
MMCSs, little is known about the functions of MMCSs or how they are regulated in space and time. Previous
studies have focused on individual MMCSs under a narrow range of biological conditions; however, multiple
MMCSs exist simultaneously, creating a dynamic network that controls the function of mitochondria. Thus,
defining the functions of MMCSs and dissecting how these functions are coregulated in space and time to
modulate mitochondrial function represents a well-recognized gap in knowledge. To address this complex
problem, this proposal will analyze the simplified MMCS network of the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. A multidisciplinary approach will be used to characterize novel functions of the mitochondria-ER-
cortex anchor (MECA) and probe how these functions are coregulated with other MMCSs to adapt the
mitochondrial network to function under various stresses. MECA forms a unique tripartite organelle contact site
between mitochondria, the ER, and the plasma membrane. Work in Aim 1 will determine the mechanism and
function of contact between MECA and the ER and test the hypothesis that MECA-ER contacts are involved in
mitochondrial respiratory function. Work in Aim 2 will use unbiased screening approaches to identify novel genes
and metabolites involved in mitochondrial functions that are regulated by MECA. Work in Aim 3 will characterize
the dynamic regulation of MECA and other MMCSs in response to environmental or mitochondrial stresses and
test the hypothesis that MMCSs are coregulated to adapt the mitochondrial network for optimal function. This
proposal will identify novel functions of MECA and describe how this contact site and others are regulated
through space and time. This work will extend beyond the characterization of a MMCS in a single context and
begin dissecting how MMCSs are regulated at a systems level to modulate mitochondrial function.
The training plan in this proposal is designed to teach the skills required to operate as an independent researcher.
The central focus will be training in interdisciplinary research and career development skills. This proposal
provides the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art biochemical, genetic, and systems level approaches to ask
fundamental questions about organelle biology. Scientific communication and networking skills will be
strengthened by authoring scientific papers and presenting at group meetings and conferences. This proposal
also provides training in mentorship, ethical research practices, and promoting diversity and inclusion in science."
10755266,"ABSTRACT
The advent of protein design in recent years has brought us within reach of developing a “nanoscale
programing language,” in which molecules serve as operands with their conformational states functioning as
logical gates. Combining these operands into larger molecules and molecular complexes through protein
engineering will allow us to write and execute “code” using nanoscale computing agents (NCAs). These agents
would respond to any given input and return a desired output signal. While the speed of the “computation” will
be significantly slower than that of inorganic silicon-based computers, one cell can contain more NCAs than
the number of CPUs in any supercomputer currently in existence. The ability to utilize natural evolutionary
processes would allow code to “evolve” in the course of computation, thus enabling radically new algorithmic
developments. NCAs will revolutionize the studies of biological systems, enable a deeper understanding of
human biology and disease, and facilitate development of in situ precision therapeutics. Since NCAs can be
extended to novel reactions and processes not seen in biological systems, growth of this field will spark the
growth of biotechnological applications with wide-ranging impact, including to fields not typically considered
relevant to biology. Unlike traditional approaches in synthetic biology that are based on rewiring of signaling
pathways in cells, NCAs are autonomous vehicles based on single chain proteins. NCAs offer an orthogonal
and complementary means for controlling cellular phenotypes. In the past 12 years, our group has developed
technology toward this end, by engineering proteins that can be controlled by light and small molecules. We
designed functional prototypes that have already offered valuable insights in the cellular motility field. Here, we
plan to (i) further expand the repertoire of NCA inputs, (ii) include other biological molecules, such as RNA, in
our library of NCAs, and (iii) expand the portfolio of methods for “writing” algorithms at the nanoscale level. The
main objectives of this proposal are: (1) Extend the repertoire of inputs for regulation of proteins. We plan
to utilize/design proteins that respond to pH and temperature via conformational change in order to modulate
the activities of target proteins. (2) Extend our approaches to model and regulate RNA molecules. No tools
currently exist for computational evaluation of small molecule binding to RNA (the docking problem). Modeling
the structure and dynamics of RNA is challenging due to backbone flexibility. We plan to develop a platform to
address both the RNA structure and small molecule docking problems. (3) Develop tools to rationally design
allosteric networks in proteins. The technology to “rewire” allosteric networks in proteins does not exist yet.
Capitalizing on our method for mapping allostery, we plan to build a search algorithm that will iteratively rewire
communication pathways between distal protein sites. Addressing these challenges will provide a significant
leap in technology for programming living cells. While the research directions outlined in this proposal are
ambitious, we and others have created the basis for this technology to be feasible and within reach."
10768162,"Flow Cytometry Shared Resource Summary
The mission of the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) is to provide
cost-effective and comprehensive state-of-the-art services and training in all aspects of flow cytometry to MCC
personnel. Flow cytometry is essential for almost all cancer biology laboratories because it permits
multiparametric cell analyses and the physical isolation of phenotypically defined cell subsets for subsequent
analysis or manipulation. Accordingly, the FCSR supports 3 pillars in MCC’s strategic plan: 1) drive research
discovery; 2) accelerate the path to cures; and 3) enable research excellence.
MCC researchers currently have 24/7 access to 8 self-service flow cytometers and weekday access to 4 staff-
operated cell sorters. FCSR staff support the use of each instrument and bring decades of experience and
expertise in flow cytometry to MCC. This provides stability in the daily operations and ensures that MCC users’
flow cytometry needs are met. The Resource’s reputation for excellence and innovation in the national flow
cytometry community allows us to beta-test new reagents and equipment provided by industry. This affords us
a competitive advantage because MCC researchers gain working knowledge of new technologies before they
become widely available. The costs of using the instruments are billed on an hourly basis, with the rates
subsidized for MCC users.
FCSR has been led by Dr. Christopher Pennell (Immunology Program) since 2012. In January 2022, Dr.
Pennell was named as leader of the broader University Flow Cytometry Resource, of which FCSR is a part. In
his expanded role, he remains the Director of the FCSR and is supported by 5 staff members. To continue
supporting MCC research with outstanding flow cytometry equipment and services, we propose the following
specific aims:
Aim 1: To provide MCC researchers with 24/7 access to advanced flow cytometric instruments.
Aim 2: To aid MCC researchers in the design of flow cytometry experiments, data acquisition, and data
interpretation.
Aim 3: To educate MCC researchers regarding the principles of flow cytometry, to train users on self-service
analyzers and cell sorters, and to share cutting-edge advancements in flow cytometry.
Aim 4: To beta-test new reagents and equipment and to continually upgrade equipment.
FCSR was used by 162 people during fiscal year 2022, of whom 103 were members of MCC."
10768598,"Cardiovascular disease is a devastating disorder that has a major impact on length and quality of life.
According to the American Heart Association, approximately 121.5 million Americans carry the diagnosis of
heart disease. Veterans have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease starting at younger ages and
have 42% higher odds of having more cardiovascular diseases compared to non-veterans. Higher rates of
cardiovascular disease in veterans with a higher likelihood of cardiovascular morbidity at a younger age leads
to early onset cardiovascular mortality later in life. The number of heart and vascular procedures (balloon
angioplasties and vascular grafts) that will be performed in 2040 is expected to be more than twice the number
performed in 2008 and restenosis requiring reintervention occurs in 30-75% of procedures depending on the
treatment area. Similar increases in number of vascular procedures performed and similar restenosis rates
occur in the veteran population.
 When a blood vessel is treated with angioplasty, the endothelial cells (EC) are removed. The cells must
migrate from the edge of the injury into the area of injury to heal it. If healing is delayed, the chance of
restenosis is increased. Lipid oxidation products accumulate in atherosclerotic arteries and at regions of injury,
cause cellular dysfunction, and inhibit EC migration in vitro and in vivo. Limited re-endothelialization contributes
to thrombogenicity, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and restenosis.
 Oxidized lipids cause an inappropriate increase in intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i)
through canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels, specifically TRPC6. Activation of TRPC6 by
causes an increase in [Ca2+]i that results in activation of TRPC5 and a prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i. The
increased [Ca2+]i activates calpains that break down cytoskeletal proteins inhibiting EC migration. Studies in
TRPC6-/- mice provide compelling evidence of the importance of this cascade in vivo. Re-endothelialization of
injured carotid arteries is dramatically reduced in wild-type (WT) mice on a high fat diet compared with chow-
fed mice, but in TRPC6-/- mice, hypercholesterolemia does not inhibit re-endothelialization of the injury.
 Considerable effort has been directed at identifying a specific TRPC6 inhibitor without success. Non-
selective TRPC inhibitors have developed, but they impact TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 channels. We have
discovered that lipid oxidation products induce TRPC6 externalization by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K), which generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is anchored in the cell
membrane and promotes TRPC6 translocation to the cell membrane and leads to increased [Ca2+]i. Based on
our ongoing studies, the interaction between PIP3 and TRPC6 is mediated by an adaptor protein, and
preliminary data suggest that this is Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1). Importantly, identification of this
adaptor suggests a way to block TRPC6 activation and to restore EC migration, while minimizing off-target
effects of PI3K inhibitors or non-selective TRPC channel inhibition. We hypothesize that TRPC6 activation by
lipid oxidation products requires the interaction of an adaptor protein to link TRPC6 and PIP3 in the membrane.
As a corollary, inhibition of the TRPC6-PIP3 interaction can block TRPC6 activation and restore EC migration
in the presence of lipid oxidation products. To test this, we will 1) identify the mechanism that mediates PI3K-
generated PIP3 anchorage of TRPC6 in the plasma membrane, specifically the role of an adaptor protein, and
2) determine the mechanism of lysoPC-induced, adaptor protein-mediated TRPC6-PIP3 interaction.
 The long-term goal is to improve the outcome of therapeutic vascular interventions promoting endothelial
surfacing of angioplasty sites, stents, and vascular grafts. With progress in this area, mechanism-based
treatment regimens can be developed, transitioned into clinical trials, and ultimately be carried into clinical
practice to improve the long-term outcomes following vascular intervention and improve veterans’ quality of life."
10768600,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence strongly supports the idea that sleep is a crucial variable in neurodegenerative disease:
disease progression disrupts sleep, and disrupted sleep worsens brain degeneration. Sleep is thought to
represent a powerful untapped therapeutic modality through which neurodegeneration can be modified. Yet how
sleep and neurodegeneration are coupled at a mechanistic level is poorly understood. Defining cellular and
molecular links between sleep and neurodegeneration has been difficult, limiting the ability to pursue sleep
modification as a therapeutic avenue. We propose leveraging a neurodegeneration model in Drosophila to
dissect mechanisms of disrupted sleep in detail, including use of high throughput genetic screens available in
simple systems, with the goal of defining molecular pathways linking sleep and brain integrity.
 We have found that expression of the human neurodegenerative disease protein TDP43 (linked to
Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, and motor neuron disease) causes a robust sleep impairment. Our initial
data suggest that the Drosophila sleep phenotype results from dysfunction in glia, which are known to be critically
involved in sleep regulation. Importantly, expression of TDP43 in glia also causes brain degeneration and
shortened lifespan in flies, providing a strong rationale for investigation of TDP43 as a key link between sleep
and neurodegeneration. Because TDP43 pathology has been described in many human neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer’s, focused study of the mechanisms linking TDP43 with sleep are likely to be
broadly relevant.
 Here we will investigate the molecular mechanisms linking TDP43-associated brain degeneration and
sleep. In Aim 1, we propose to define the glial subtype critical for the sleep effect and examine how sleep loss
affects the subcellular localization and accumulation of TDP43. A preliminary genetic screen for modifiers of
TDP43-induced sleep dysfunction has already defined several suppressors, including Ataxin-2, a known human
disease gene that interacts with TDP43 in neurons. In Aim 2, we will examine this suppressor and others in detail
to define molecular and cellular mechanisms of the interaction. Finally, our preliminary data indicate that
restriction of sleep opportunity (Sleep Restriction Therapy, SRT) can reverse sleep defects in TDP43 flies. In
Aim 3 we will examine SRT in TDP43 flies, and conduct a genetic screen to define the molecular pathways
through which SRT improves sleep in this brain degeneration model. Taken together these aims will shed new
light on the molecular and genetic links between sleep dysfunction and brain degeneration, and provide the
foundation for novel therapeutic targets that leverage sleep to promote brain integrity."
10768602,"Abstract
Orofacial clefts (OFCs) of the lip and/or palate are a prevalent congenital malformation with a complex genetic
etiology driven by both common and rare genetic variants. OFCs are comprised of three major subtypes: cleft
lip alone (CL), cleft lip with cleft palate (CLP) and cleft palate alone (CP) with genetic studies indicating both
shared and unique factors contributing to each subtype. There has been remarkable success in discovering
genetic loci associated with OFCs using genome wide association studies (GWAS); however, the relatively weak
contribution of each individual locus toward overall disease liability has limited efforts to quantify an individual’s
genetic risk for OFC. Over the past decade, novel methods have been developed to provide better measures of
genetic liability for complex disorders by aggregating many subtle common genetic effects into a single,
polygenic risk score (PRS). Application of a PRS to OFC cases would greatly aid in defining the heritable basis
of many more cases, but two fundamental challenges have limited its current use: 1) the majority of OFC data
has come from diverse populations, which confounds traditional PRS approaches; 2) assessments of PRS are
typically performed on case/control study designs and aren’t optimized for the familial data found in most OFC
studies. In this study we will perform innovative statistical techniques to overcome these previous limitations in
PRS generation and explore OFC genetic susceptibility in a large OFC cohort (n = 24,195; 7,896 cases)
comprised of 5 distinct ethnic groups (African, Admixed American, European, East Asian, Central /South Asian)
(Aim 1). Moreover, to provide an even more robust measure of genetic liability for OFCs, we will examine the
influence of 59 OFC-related 3D facial features in our OFC cohort with the goal of understanding how these traits
may interact to increase OFC risk. Each of these analyses will both consider OFCs as a singular group as well
as consider each of the individual subtypes independently. In Aim 2, we will apply sophisticated variant detection
techniques to explore the contribution of rare structural and short variation on OFCs. This will allow us to leverage
our large, aggregated OFC dataset to perform novel gene discovery by integrating rare and common genetic
signals. Finally, we will stratify the PRSs generated in Aim 1 against the rare mutations discovered in Aim 2 to
better understand how they may interact to confer OFC risk. This analysis will be further expanded by the
development of an OFC composite genetic risk score, created by integrating the OFC PRSs directly with a rare
variation risk score, to provide a more comprehensive measure of OFC genetic liability. Taken together, these
aims are poised to greatly expand our understanding of the genetic risk factors for OFC across diverse
populations and discover new genes associated with OFCs. Overall, this study will have a transformative impact
on the OFC research community with potential applications in prenatal screening, genetic counseling, and
treatments for the disorder."
10900771,"Project Summary
Labor migration is a major contributor to fueling the global AIDS epidemic and also the movement of HIV
across country borders and populations. Migrants who inject drugs while in a host country are at especially
high risk. Tajikistan, a small country in Central Asia, exports more than a million temporary labor migrants
annually, many of whom inject drugs. These migrants are highly subject to the negative effects of intersectional
stigma within Russia's cultural and socio-economic environment due to being both a migrant worker and a
person who injects drugs (PWID). In addition, they are subject to extensive censure and marginalization from
their non-drug-using Tajik peers in the close-knit diaspora communities in which they reside, especially if they
acquire HIV. The adverse effects of stigmatization on those who experience it are well documented. The
intersection of stigmatized identities as migrants and people who inject drugs (PWID), along with stigma
associated with HIV infection, contributes to HIV risk behavior, poses as a barrier to accessing HIV testing and
other prevention/treatment services, and results in poorer health outcomes for those living with HIV.
 The proposed study will investigate the character of stigma in the Moscow Tajik migrant community,
and the effects of multiple intersecting forms of stigma on the health and well-being of Tajik labor migrants who
inject drugs while living in Moscow (Aim 1). We will use the insight and findings gained through this formative
research to develop an innovative intervention specifically designed to counter the negative effects of drug-
related stigma within the Tajik migrant community that can affect HIV risk behavior and prevention among Tajik
migrants in Moscow who inject drugs (Aim 2). The Stigma Reduction Intervention Approach Via Leaders of
Diaspora (SRI-AVLOD) intervention will draw on the strengths of close-knit Tajik diaspora communities in
which new norms and behaviors can be effectively diffused and promoted within and across migrant social
networks if endorsed by leaders whom they trust. SRI-AVLOD is designed to recruit and train Tajik diaspora
community leaders as agents of change and open up conversation within the Moscow Tajik community about
the effects of drug and HIV-related stigma, to reduce stigmatizing beliefs and actions that negatively affect HIV
risk behavior and prevention among community members who inject drugs. After developing a working
prototype, we will deliver the intervention to small groups of Tajik migrant community leaders to assess its
feasibility and acceptability, and need for further modifications (Aim 3).
 In future work we will deliver and test the efficacy of the SRI-AVLOD model in changing drug-related
stigma and stigmatizing beliefs, behavior, and consequences at all levels (community, leadership, PWID)
within the Tajik diaspora community and its positive effects in reducing HIV risk behavior and increasing the
adoption of HIV prevention methods and services among its Tajik members who inject drugs."

Suicide results in >800,000 world deaths and >40,000 U.S. deaths annually. Suicide rates in India, rising over
the past five decades, now reflect the highest rates in the world. India's contribution to global suicide deaths
increased from 25.3% in 1990 to 36.6% in 2016 among women, and from 18.7% to 24.3% among men.
Moreover, the suicide rate among girls and women in India continues to be twice the global rate. Yet while
several environmental and genetic risk factors for suicide have been identified globally, India remains
completely unrepresented in global research efforts. More broadly, a lack of population-based data from under-
represented populations greatly limits the impact and global generalizability of genetic and epidemiological
studies of suicide death. There are, in particular, myriad cultural and environmental factors that are expected to
dynamically influence risk for suicide in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Four in five suicides in young
people (<30 years) globally occur in LMICs, and a better understanding of suicide in LMICs will be critical for
designing stigma reduction initiatives and informing prevention efforts. Genetic analysis of population-based
suicide death in Utah has dramatically informed models of risk in the U.S., where a majority of deaths lack
psychiatric or other medical records, but have been profiled for hundreds of polygenic risks.
 This project aims to 1) collect blood, phenotypic information, psychological autopsy, and toxicology data
from 4,000 suicide deaths and postmortem controls in Delhi, India, 2) to collect brain tissue from multiple areas
of the brain in half of the suicide deaths and controls (n = 2,000), 3) to genotype all blood samples, and 4) to
conduct multiple cross-ancestry analyses of genetic and phenotypic risks, as well as the first (preliminary)
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of population-based suicide death in a non-European ancestry
population. Genetic data from India will be integrated with U.S. data, meta-analyzed with the U.S. suicide death
GWAS, and meta-analyzed with 22 international suicide attempt GWAS from the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC). Brain samples will be preserved at the All-India Institute for Medical Sciences in Delhi, for
future methylation and sequencing analysis with teams across India and the U.S. This biosample collection will
represent the only other resource for population-based suicide death in the world, after Utah, and as a diverse
ancestry cohort with psychological autopsy, blood, and brain tissue, it stands to significantly impact global
suicide research."
10890162,"By 2030, ~70 million people in the USA will be >65 years old with ~10 million >85 years
old. The studies proposed in this competitive renewal application are motivated by our
previous finding that larger phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) are selectively lost in old
age and the work of others implicating mitochondrial disruption in motor neuron death.
BDNF/TrkB signaling mediates CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 (pCREBs133), which
promotes mitochondrial remodeling via gene targeting of PGC1a. Activity dependent
pAMPK signaling also mediates pCREBs133 phosphorylation and PGC1a expression. It
appears that BDNF/TrkB signaling in PhMNs is reduced in old age, but activity of smaller
PhMNs persists to support breathing, which may underlie their sparing in old age. It is
also well established that circulating TNFa is elevated with aging. In other cell types, we
found that TNFa selectively activates the IRE1a/sXBP1 ER stress pathway, which
induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. Our experimental design involves
a comprehensive array of novel techniques already established and validated in our lab.
The results of the proposed studies will guide development of novel therapeutic
approaches targeting BDNF/TrkB or pCREBs133 phosphorylation (e.g., quercetin) and/or
TNFa induced IRE1a/sXBP1 ER stress (e.g., infliximab) to promote PhMN survival.
Conceptual Framework: We hypothesize that mitochondrial volume density (MVD) and
respiratory capacity (SDHmax) in PhMNs are affected by the balance between
mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated via
pCREBs133 phosphorylation and PGC1a expression, which is triggered by both activity
(via pAMPK – Aim 1) and BDNF/TrkB.FL signaling (Aim 2). In old age, the influence of
BDNF/TrkB.FL signaling is diminished especially in larger PhMNs, while activity of
smaller PhMNs persists. Furthermore, serum TNFa is elevated in old age, which induces
pIRE1a/sXBP1 ER stress leading to mitophagy (Aim 3).
Aim 1: Determine the role of pAMPK/pCREB/PGC1a signaling in maintaining
mitochondrial volume density in smaller PhMNs..
Aim 2: Determine the impact of reduced BDNF/TrkB/pCREB signaling in age-related
remodeling of mitochondria in PhMNs.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of TNFa induced activation of the IRE1a/sXBP1 ER stress
pathway in age-related remodeling of mitochondria in PhMNs."
10861036,"BK virus (BKV) infection and nephropathy is a major cause of organ loss following kidney transplantation. There
are no effective antivirals for BKV, and standard clinical practice is to reduce immunosuppression, which raises
the risk of allograft rejection. There is no consensus on how to safely reduce immunosuppression, and treatment
of BKV viremia varies by the attending physician and transplant center. To address this gap in our knowledge
for how to optimally manage kidney transplant recipients with BKV viremia, we propose to use mathematical
modeling and optimal control theory to develop software-guided management of immunosuppression
personalize for individual patients. To translate these models and algorithms to clinical reactive, we need to
calibrate and validate them on longitudinal data of kidney transplant recipients with BKV viremia. We propose to
utilize NIAID-funded Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT) data sets available in ImmPort, together
with pediatric and adult CTOT kidney transplant data not currently in ImmPort, to build the largest longitudinal
BKV monitoring data set and use it to calibrate our models. We build this proposed work on our published
mathematical model of BKV viremia, which accurately models BKV proliferation and infection of kidney cells, the
elicitation of anti-viral and allo-specific cytotoxic T cells that damage kidney cells and reduce graft function, and
the non-replenishment of damaged kidney cells resulting in rising creatinine levels. We propose to extend and
refine the model to fit the longitudinal clinical data from CTOT kidney transplant recipients with BKV viremia more
accurately. To better utilize the extensive patient data from the CTOT studies, we also propose an innovative
approach to build a more accurate BKV model by learning the equations describing immune regulation directly
from data. Learning will be performed using a neural network emulator, which can approximate arbitrarily
complex mathematical functions. This machine learning approach has the advantage of being more flexible and
using ancillary data sources that allow a greater degree of personalized model characterization. The CTOT data
will be used to inform immune response modeling and to validate the initial model refinements as well as assist
us in further model development. We then layer receding horizon control (RHC) algorithms, also known as model
predictive control, on top of the mathematical models, to provide adaptive guidance on optimal
immunosuppression doses customized to individual patients. The calibration of these models is critical, and a
critical component of our proposal is the use advanced statistical methods to estimate model parameters from
sparse longitudinal data and to perform sensitivity analysis. Finally, the proposal benefits immensely from the
collaboration of three experienced clinicians who manage kidney transplant recipients, who will provide domain
expertise, help with the interpretation of data, and guide model and software development to ensure clinical
utility. The expected outcome is a useful tool to guide immunosuppressive management that could be tested for
its effectiveness in improving patient outcomes and reducing the morbidity of immunosuppressive therapy."
10851946,"Due to changes in cannabis policy, most Americans now have access to an array of retail cannabis products.
An estimated 5.5 million Americans are registered with state-regulated medical cannabis programs and the
therapeutic use of federally legal hemp (e.g. CBD) products is widespread. Despite most states having legalized
medicinal cannabis use, little is known about the characteristics of these patients, the cannabis products they
use, or the patient-level health impact of their medicinal cannabis use. Filling these gaps in knowledge remains
an urgent public health need. We propose to: 1) design and implement a prospective medicinal cannabis patient
registry for longitudinal data collection. We will recruit a nationally representative cohort of patients newly
initiating the use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes into a longitudinal observational research registry. We will
assess patient demographics, cannabis product use, and a range of health outcomes prior to and repeatedly
after initiation of medicinal cannabis use via web-based surveys. A subset of patients will complete intensive
data collection via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and/or provide biospecimens for clinical chemistry
testing to determine the impact of medicinal cannabis use on daily functioning and symptom management in
addition to potential unseen harms such as liver toxicity; 2) Establish a program of medicinal cannabis product
testing based on adverse event reporting and other mentions of injury/harm in the patient registry or via
surveillance of other data sources (e.g. poison control data, FDA warnings, online forum posts). Products
associated with adverse events or other harms will be targeted for testing related to dose-label accuracy,
cannabinoid content, and presence of contaminants; 3) Identify and integrate existing sources of data that can
inform the health impacts of medicinal cannabis use. This includes electronic medical record (EMR) databases
as well as prior and ongoing research projects of the study team (e.g., Realm of Caring Observational Research
Registry); 4) Develop and implement a website that will include annual summary reports of the combined data,
an application process for researcher access to de-identified data for the conduct of novel analyses, and an
archive of published papers related to the health impacts of medicinal cannabis use. A pilot research program to
fund scientists interested in probing the data repository will be established. Our team includes internationally
recognized expertise in the comprehensive research methods proposed. The result of this project will be a rich
data resource for understanding the health impacts of medicinal cannabis use. Data will include patient-level
outcomes across a broad range of therapeutic purposes and include use of a variety of cannabis products. Data
will help inform clinical decision making related to initiation of cannabis products, guidance on product, route of
administration and dose selection, risks related to adverse events, injury/poisoning risk and abuse liability.
Findings will also help local and federal government agencies develop effective policies, programs, and
regulatory strategies to mitigate harms associated with the rapidly growing cannabis industry."
10874696,"ABSTRACT
Cryptosporidiosis is an important cause of diarrheal disease in young children in the developing world where it
causes significant mortality and morbidity. Children that present with symptomatic disease are more likely to
suffer from malnutrition and lower height and weight per age, and these deficiencies persist for years after the
primary infection resolves. Surprisingly even asymptomatic cases can be associated with malnutrition and
failure to thrive for several years beyond the initial infection. These findings suggest that alterations in intestinal
function during the initial infection establish persistent enteropathy that stunts development. However, the
cellular and molecular mechanisms driving this clinical outcome remain unresolved. During early development
of the intestine, Goblet cells play a critical role in sampling of antigens from the gut lumen in a process that
generates peripheral T regulatory cells (pTreg), which suppress immune responses to dietary antigens and
commensals. This early process in shaping the mucosal immune system is critical to maintenance of oral
tolerance later in life. Our study examines the intriguing hypothesis that cryptosporidiosis in early life alters
responses to lumenal antigens by disrupting oral tolerance that normally develops during this time period. In
preliminary studies we have shown that neonatal mice, which are highly susceptible to C. parvum infection,
show defects in Goblet cell functions related to antigenic sampling. Furthermore we show that C. parvum
infected neonatal mice have reduced development of pTreg cells. We will explore the hypothesis that
cryptosporidiosis disrupts oral tolerance through two main aims: 1) determine the molecular mechanism for
disruption of antigen sampling by Goblet cells, 2) explore the consequence of disrupted pTreg development on
oral tolerance. These studies will explore how altered immune responses to dietary antigens or commensal
organisms drive inflammation that impairs gut function following enteric infection."

ASH1L (Absent, Small, or Homeotic discs 1-Like) is a histone methyltransferase facilitating gene expression
through its-mediated chromatin modification. Recent genetic studies on large cohorts of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) patients identify ASH1L is one of top ASD risk genes. The genetic findings are further supported
by many clinical reports that children diagnosed with ASD acquire various de novo ASH1L mutations. To
understand the pathogenic role of disruptive ASH1L mutations in ASD pathogenesis, we used the Ash1l
conditional knockout (cKO) mice to show that deletion of Ash1l in the mouse brain was sufficient to cause autistic-
like behaviors and cognitive memory deficits, suggesting that disruptive ASH1L mutations are likely to be
causally involved in ASD genesis. Our following studies showed that Ash1l-KO mice developed general neural
hyperactivity, suggesting that loss of ASH1L causes excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance of neural signals in the
brain. Furthermore, our recent study reported that postnatal administration of SAHA, a histone deacetylase
inhibitor, ameliorated core autistic-like behaviors and cognitive memory of Ash1l-deficient mice, suggesting that
histone acetylation and ASH1L-mediated histone modification have a synergistic function in maintaining normal
brain functions. Building upon these discoveries at the molecular, brain, and organismal levels, we propose that
ASH1L facilitates gene expression through its-mediated histone modification in the brain. Loss of ASH1L impairs
the expression of genes critical for maintaining E/I balance in the brain, which consequently leads to neural
hyperactivity and behavioral deficits in Ash1l-KO mice. To further investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of
ASH1L in ASD pathogenesis, we will used the Ash1l-cKO mice to examine the function, transcriptome, and
epigenome of cortical excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and astrocytes in the brain. Specifically, we will (1)
dissect the functional roles of three neural lineages in contributing to the neural hyperactivity and behavioral
deficits in Ash1l-KO mice; (2) examine lineage-specific transcriptome dynamics to identify genes involved in the
functional abnormalities of the Ash1l-deficient brain; (3) examine lineage-specific epigenome dynamics to identify
ASH1L-mediated epigenetic mechanisms involved in the functional abnormalities of the Ash1l-deficient brain.
Completion of this study will not only significantly advance our understanding of the ASH1L-mediated epigenetic
mechanisms in regulating gene expression in the brain and their pathogenic roles in ASD genesis, but also
potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat the ASH1L-mutation-induced
neurodevelopmental diseases."
10912021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of this proposal is to understand sex differences in the neural regulation of feeding,
specifically how the anorexogenic effects of estradiol are modulated by a new hypothalamic node of the feeding
circuit. Previous research identified somatostatin (SST)-producing neurons as part of the neural circuit that
controls feeding, but sex differences were not explored. We find that activating SST neurons in the region that
spans the tuberal and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus increases feeding in male and female mice.
However, ablating these neurons decreases feeding only in females, only during the high-estrogen phase of the
estrous cycle, and only when their body mass is relatively low. These findings are consistent with previous
studies but go further to reveal a context-dependent role for SST neurons in the regulation of feeding. We
hypothesize that SST neurons of the tuberal nucleus are a sex-specific, modulatory node within the brain that
can mask the anorexic effects of estradiol when energy reserves are low. The proposal outlines studies in mice
to determine how SST neuronal function is modulated by both reproductive and metabolic cues. In Aim 1, we
use cell-specific manipulations combined with gonadal hormone manipulations to reveal how SST neuron
function is modulated by reproductive state. In Aim 2, we use cell-specific manipulations combined with
manipulations of body mass and adiposity to reveal how SST neuron function is modulated by metabolic state.
In Aim 3, we use fluorescent labeling and flow cytometry followed by RNA-sequencing (flow-Seq) to assess how
SST neurons may be responsive to reproductive and metabolic conditions and whether this differs by sex.
Together, these studies will help us understand how neural circuits integrate multiple peripheral signals to fine
tune behavior and physiology across dynamic states."

10909343,"Breast Cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Therapy resistance is a major
limiting factor. Therefore, the long-term goal of this grant is to elucidate novel molecular mechanisms
underlying therapy resistance. BC stem cells (CSCs) may mediate treatment resistance in part by altering the
tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote immune evasion. p27 plays a dual role: as a tumor suppressor, it
inhibits cell cycle; and as an oncogene, it promotes metastasis when phosphorylated by PI3K activated
kinases on its C-terminal at T157 and T198 (p27pTpT). p27pTpT acts as a transcriptional regulator of cJun,
driving EMT/pro-metastatic gene profiles. My thesis work showed it also coactivates STAT3 to upregulate
CSCs and cancer promoting-inflammation. My overarching hypothesis is that p27pTpT co-activates STAT3
gene profiles to expand cancer stem cells and promote immune evasion. My thesis work in AIM1.1 made
the novel observation that p27pTpT upregulates stem cell properties including sphere formation and embryonic
stem cell transcription factors (ES-TFs, MYC, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4), by co-activating STAT3. My ChIP-
seq/RNA-seq showed p27 recruits STAT3 to gene promoters to induce broad profiles of p27/STAT3 co-targets,
including MYC and JAG1, to increase tumor-initiating stem cells (TISC) in vivo. I showed p27pTpT-driven CSC
expansion is in part mediated through the novel p27/STAT3 co-target gene, ANGPTL4. In the F99, AIM1.2,
pursues the hypothesis that p27pTpT/STAT3 promotes tumor immune evasion by re-shaping the TME. I will
expand my research into cancer immunology which provides me with an outstanding training opportunity. My
ATAC-seq showed p27pTpT increases chromatin accessibility to co-recruit p27/STAT3 at promoters of
oncogenic, proinflammatory genes (IL-6, NF-κB (RELA), VEGFA) and the mediator of immune evasion, PDL1.
p27pTpT also increased NF-κB (p65), IL6 proteins and secreted CCL2. Next, I will test if p27pTpT drives
cancer-promoting inflammation and shapes the TME toward a more tumor-permissive state in vivo. First, I will
identify how p27pTpT modulates both tumor cell and immune cell signatures and cytokine expression by single
cell RNA-seq of BC and Luminex assays of cytokines in peripheral blood of tumor bearing mice in vivo. I will
also test how p27pTpT might drive immune evasion by modulating CD4, CD8 T cell and NK cell infiltration in
TME and test if p27pTpT recruits MDSCs, Tregs and increases the M2/M1 macrophage ratio in the TME by
IHC and by flow cytometry. In AIM2, my K00 addresses mechanisms underlying the greater prevalence and
mortality of breast cancer in obese women. My K00 will investigate if p27pTpT promotes the chronic
inflammation of obesity by cooperating with the estrogen receptor (ER) to activated NFB/STAT3 to promote
immune evasion and endocrine therapy resistance. I will further investigate if dual therapy with ER blockade
and checkpoint inhibitors can reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancers in obese hosts. The F99/K00 will
help my transition from predoctoral to postdoctoral research and, ultimately, into an independent investigator."
10918305,"Project Abstract
Obesity is the predominant risk factor for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the leading cause for
chronic liver disease with prevalence approaching 30% in certain populations. NAFLD, however, may in fact be
considered a “pre-disease” state for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), which is defined by liver injury and
associated inflammation and fibrosis. NASH has no approved pharmacotherapy, and is thus the fastest-growing
reason for liver transplantation. As the prevalence of obesity-related NASH continues to rise, and available livers
for transplantation remain limiting, this unmet need grows more urgent.
In obese mice and patients undergoing liver biopsy for suspected NASH, we observed an unexpected and
aberrant activation of hepatocyte Notch, a morphogenic pathway critical for cell fate decision-making in normal
liver development. Validation studies revealed that Notch activity was positively associated with markers of
liver inflammation and fibrosis and tracked with disease severity in patients with pre- and post-intervention
biopsies in randomized clinical trials. Our mechanistic work in the first cycle of this grant showed that Notch is
causal to disease, as hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function – by genetic or pharmacologic ablation of
either the Notch ligand Jagged1, or by blocking Notch transcriptional activity – protected mice from diet-
induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis, whereas forced Jagged1 or Notch activity exacerbated inflammation and
fibrosis phenotypes. To determine downstream factors responsible for Notch activity, we performed a series of
RNAseq and scRNAseq screens that revealed LTBP3 as a novel Notch target. In Aim 1, we study with novel
genetic and pharmacologic tools whether increased hepatocyte LTBP3 secretion mediates Notch-induced
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and potential mechanisms of these effects. Beyond endocrine
communication, hepatocytes can directly interact with non-parenchymal cells, including hepatic stellate cells
(HSC), to determine obesity-induced liver pathology. Intriguingly, we observed increased Notch activity in HSC
isolated from NASH diet-fed mice; other preliminary data suggest that the same proximal signal (Jagged1) may
mediate HSC activation and lead to liver fibrosis, which we test in Aim 2. Finally, we leverage a novel mouse
model of reversible hepatocyte Notch activity to discover potential fibrosis regression pathways in Aim 3.
Achieving the goals of this application will identify mechanistic determinants of Notch-induced liver pathology
and potentially lead to application of novel Jagged-Notch or LTBP3 inhibitors for NASH and fibrosis."
11059258,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Curative cancer treatment modalities (e.g., chemotherapy) are gonadotoxic (i.e., destroy sperm and eggs) and
frequently cause infertility. Thus, clinical practice guidelines intended to facilitate optimal oncofertility care
indicate that oncologists should comprehensively discuss possible treatment-related infertility with all cancer
patients of reproductive age. Such discussions are particularly relevant for adolescent and young adults (AYA;
15-39 years) with cancer who are in the prime of their reproductive years and endorse fertility-related distress
following treatment, situating oncofertility as a priority research area for AYAs. Unfortunately, barriers to
the implementation of guidelines compromise their effectiveness and AYAs are infrequently informed of
fertility preservation options, with knowledge, cost, and insurance barriers hindering uptake of preservation
among AYAs. The cancer care continuum is a multilayer system that describes a hierarchy of intervention
levels that are influential in cancer care delivery. Oncofertility care is particularly amenable to intervention at
various levels of influence (e.g., provider/team, organization/practice setting, health policy), as patient-,
provider-, system-, and policy-level factors impact the delivery and uptake of optimal care. Thus, I aim to
investigate oncofertility among AYAs by examining the multilevel influences of the cancer care
continuum. Most existing AYA oncofertility research is focused on clinical samples (e.g., academic medical,
comprehensive cancer centers) and on non-Hispanic white patients, limiting generalizability of findings, lacking
ethnic and racial diversity, and likely not capturing the experiences of at-risk AYAs. To address these gaps, my
dissertation (F99 Phase) will use SEER data to comprehensively examine oncofertility among a diverse,
population-based sample of AYAs to improve external validity and capture the care experiences of the
underlying population. I will gain an understanding of (F99 Training Goal 1) clinical considerations of fertility
issues, (2) quantitative analysis of cancer registry data, and (3) qualitative research methods to (F99 Aim 1.1)
examine sociodemographic and (Aim 1.2) healthcare correlates of AYAs’ fertility experiences (fertility
discussion, preservation, family planning, reproductive concern) and will (Aim 1.3) explore barriers/facilitators
to delivering guideline-concordant fertility discussions for AYAs among providers. To examine environmental
influences on oncofertility care, (K00 Phase) I will seek a postdoctoral position to study (K00 Training goal 1)
implementation science and intervention research and (2) health policy to examine (K00 Aim 2.1) provider
perceptions and perceived actionability of fertility guidelines and (Aim 2.2) insurer adherence to legislative
mandates and barriers to coverage for preservation. AYAs should receive equitable and guideline-
concordant care to improve reproductive outcomes. Therefore, understanding the multilevel influences
impacting oncofertility is critical to develop actionable, evidence-based interventions that improve care and
ensure AYAs are not disproportionately affected by their cancer experience."

 Providing molecular fingerprint vibration information and high imaging speed, coherent Raman scattering
microscopy, based on either coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) or stimulated Raman scattering
(SRS), allows real-time vibrational imaging of living cells and/or tissues with sub-micron spatial resolution These
instrumentation-based advances, however, do not fulfill all the desired parameters in hyperspectral imaging,
including broad bandwidth, high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and high speed. In pushing these physical limits, it
is common that one parameter is optimized at the price of sacrificing other advantages. The current proposal
aims to break this conventional thinking of ""no free lunch in optimization"" through a synergistic integration of
advanced instrumentation and data science. A multidisciplinary team with a strong track record of collaborations
will pursue the proposed studies. Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) is a leading expert in the development and applications of
SRS chemical imaging. Lei Tian (co-I) is a leading expert in computational microscopy and machine learning.
Daniela Matei (co-I) is a leading expert in cancer research specialized in ovarian cancer. We aim to develop two
complementary platforms that will allow high-speed, high-content, and high-sensitivity mapping of cell
metabolism. The first platform is for samples without prior knowledge. We will build a polygon scanner to tune
the delay between two chirped pulses on a 20-microsecond time scale. We will then deploy deep spatial-spectral
learning to denoise the low-SNR hyperspectral measurements and extract salient information with much
enhanced SNR. This integrated approach effectively bypasses the conventional tradeoff between acquisition
speed and SNR and enables high-speed, high-throughput, hyperspectral SRS imaging using informative
fingerprint Raman bands. The second platform is for samples with known target species. We will develop a
sparsely sampled hyperspectral imaging strategy to increase the overall speed by one order of magnitude while
maintaining the same SNR. We will develop a novel ""recursive feature elimination"" approach to determine the
minimum number of essential frames. On the instrumentation side, a fast-tuning fiber laser will be deployed to
acquire a sparsely sampled hyperspectral stack within one second for the study of living systems. As a focused
application, we will apply the proposed platforms to systematically investigate metabolic reprogramming in
ovarian cancers that are cisplatin resistant. Our focused application will unveil hidden signatures that are
associated with drug resistance, which will open new opportunities for improved treatment of drug-resistant
cancers."
10757375,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck cancer (HNC) caregivers face significant challenges at the end of treatment as they transition to
the home setting and care for survivors with devastating late and long-term treatment effects. The overall goal
of this research is to improve post-treatment recovery outcomes in HNC survivors and their caregivers through
the delivery of a tablet-based, dyadic survivorship needs assessment planning (SNAP) tool implemented into
clinic workflow at the end of treatment. SNAP is a technology-enabled survivorship care planning (SCP) system
that uses a self-management focus to: 1) prepare caregivers as they transition to the next phase of caregiving
and 2) optimize healthcare utilization (e.g., receipt of recommended medical and supportive care) in caregiver-
survivor dyads.
Our interdisciplinary team will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effects of SNAP compared to
usual SCP care on caregiver and survivor outcomes (N=176 dyads) and gather crucial data to guide best
practices for disseminating the system to diverse HNC care settings in the future. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate
the effects of SNAP on caregiver burden in caregivers, symptom severity in survivors and psychological well-
being in dyads at 6 months. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of SNAP on healthcare utilization uptake,
unmet needs and self-efficacy in dyads at 3 months. Specific Aim 3 will use mixed methods to characterize key
barriers and facilitators to SNAP system adoption in HNC healthcare settings diverse by practice structure,
patient volume and rural/urban status using surveys in a national panel of HNC healthcare providers (N=200)
and 5 in-depth case study visits with HNC centers in the southeastern United States to guide refinement of SNAP
program delivery strategies and tools.
SNAP is novel in its focus on using technology to build a clinic infrastructure to automate care practices to assess,
address and support survivorship needs in HNC caregiver-survivor dyads at the end of treatment. SNAP invests
in the critical roles played by caregivers through a stepped, dyadic approach to accelerate recovery. Results will
provide critical evidence to finalize this sustainable, technology-enabled care planning system for a multi-site
implementation study."

appointment at the Yale School of Medicine. Her long-term goal is to establish a stroke clinical research
laboratory that applies advanced computational techniques to better inform implementation of evidence-based
secondary stroke prevention treatments as well as discovery of novel therapeutics. In order to accomplish this
goal, Dr.Sharma seeks to fulfill her training objectives of: 1) furthering her skills in data science to manage and
process high-dimensional datasets; 2) gaining facility with advanced computational techniques; 3) developing a
foundation in biomarker-based clinical trial methodology; and 4) acquiring core competencies necessary to
independently lead a research program. Through the mechanism of this training grant, Dr.Sharma will have the
opportunity to complete directly relevant formal coursework, master fundamental research methodologies, and
generate a portfolio of work that will be critical for obtaining independent research funding. Dr.Sharma has the
full support of her mentoring team which includes Dr.Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and outcomes researcher
who specializes in harnessing big data to improve care; co-mentor Dr.Lauren Sansing, a vascular neurologist
and a translational scientist with expertise in stroke and investigation of biologic data; co-mentor Dr.Cynthia
Brandt, an emergency medicine physician and an informatician who is an expert in electronic medical record
research; co-mentor Dr.Hongyu Zhao, an expert biostatistician adept at analysis of data from a myriad of

prolific stroke clinical researcher. This mentorship team, along with collaborators and esteemed advisory
committee, will provide Dr.Sharma with the guidance, resources, and support necessary to reach these goals
and transition to academic independence.
There are nearly 800,000 ischemic strokes per year, of which the underlying cause of 20-40% of these strokes
is unknown. Consequently, secondary stroke therapies may not specifically target the pathology that led to the
stroke, potentially resulting in an unmitigated risk for a recurrent, potentially more devastating ischemic stroke.
We aim to address this diagnostic uncertainty through a series of analyses. The proposed research will utilize
novel methods to analyze electronic health record data of patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke to 3
healthcare systems (Yale-New Haven Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Veterans Affair
Health Administration Hospitals in the United States), proteomic, neuroimaging, and survey data from a
subgroup of stroke patients, and clinical trial data to achieve 2 specific aims: 1) to classify non-cryptogenic
ischemic stroke etiologies assigned to patients during hospitalization using EHR inputs; 2) to predict the
diagnosis of initially cryptogenic patients whose strokes are resolved to a specific etiology by 1-year follow-up."

 Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for more than 17.9 million deaths
per year in 2015, a number that is expected to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Several genetic and
environmental factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. Bisphenol A and phthalates are two endocrine
disruptors that are widely present in plastic and cosmetic products of daily use. These chemicals induce endothe-
lial cell death and have been associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. We
propose to identify genetic variants that interact with BPA and phthalates and modify gene regulation in vascular
cells, with consequences for cardiovascular health. We will use RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to characterize gene
expression and chromatin accessibility changes induced by BPA and phthalates in vascular cells. We will focus
on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells from African American donors, a population group at a higher
risk of dying of preventable cardiovascular disease, compared to European Americans, but underrepresented in
genetics and functional genomic studies. Using molecular QTL mapping approaches we will discover new gene-
environment interactions for BPA and phthalates. We will then use computational predictions and statistical
genetics approaches to ﬁne-map these gene-environment interaction signals and colocalize them with associ-
ation data for cardiovascular disease. Finally, we propose to use massively parallel reporter assays to validate
these GxE in gene expression and deliver a catalog of functionally validated GxE risk factors for cardiovascular
disease."

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive molecular imaging technique used for studying
biological systems in vivo, as well as for clinical diagnostic purposes. The ubiquitous presence of carbon in
most organic molecules makes carbon-11 an attractive and important positron-emitting radionuclide for
labeling molecules of biological interest. Because 11C has the same chemical properties as 12C, 11C is
especially useful for rapid exploration of molecules with well-characterized biological and pharmacological
properties (i.e., metabolism, receptor binding affinity, enzyme substrate affinity, etc.). In addition, the short half-
life of 11C (20.4 min) facilitates the possibility of multiple studies on the same subject in a single day due to the
low radiation dose and absence of overlapping activity between scans. This opens up the possibility for
longitudinal studies and studies involving an intervention, making it particularly desirable for basic and clinical
research investigations. The lack of methods to introduce and incorperate11C into organic molecules
conveniently and quickly limits the utility of this radioisotope. So far, the main criteria for successful synthesis
of 11C-lableled PET tracers is a rapid, robust and practical radiolabeling method that yields the desired tracer
with high radiochemical purity, chemical purity, and/or high molar activity. This is especially a challenge when
[11C]CO2 is used as radiosynthon for synthesis of desired PET tracers. In this proposal, we will develop
methods to address this issue. Our three Specific Aims are: 1). develop a fluoride-mediated desilylation
(FMDS) 11C-labeling methodology to directly incorporate [11C]CO2 into skeleton of molecules with diversified
structures. It is expected that this novel approach will provide facile and rapid access to 11C-labeled
compounds with carbon-11 attached at various hybridized carbons (sp, sp 2 and sp3) with broad functional
group tolerance; 2). Further extend FMDS 11C-labeling methodology to other accessible 11C-electrophiles (such
as [11C]CH3I/[11C]CH3OTf). Our goal is to develop a new 11C-methylation method, which can serve as a
complementary approach for synthesis of various 11C-labeled PET tracers; 3). Utilize FMDS 11C-labeling to
solve some long-standing problems in radiotracer chemistry research by developing facile and practical
labeling methods for radiotracers of high clinical interest where regular production is very difficult using
currently reported methods, such as [11C]pyruvic acid, [11C]succinic acid, [11C]PHNO, [11C]vorozole. This newly
developed FMDS 11C-labeling methodology may lead a brand new direction in radiotracer chemistry and open
multiple avenues for developing novel and practical radiolabeling methodologies."

Exposure to air pollution may play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD), but how it affects neurocognitive aging is largely unknown. Major barriers to understanding include:
inadequate assessment of cognitive decline, over-reliance on medical records and claims data to measure
dementia status, sparse information on the connection of air pollution exposure to dementia pathology, and poor
understanding of underlying mechanisms, including cerebrovascular and olfactory pathways as well as
particulate matter (PM) access to the brain. Here, we will remedy these deficiencies by investigating air pollution
and ADRD in a setting that: entails regular and systematic longitudinal evaluation of cognitive function and
dementia in all participants, postmortem neuropathologic assessments with extensive cerebrovascular detail,
and a far-reaching evaluation of the olfactory system, which is uniquely susceptible to airborne insults, as a direct
pathway for environmental toxicants to reach the brain and cause ADRD. Covered in this evaluation will be
assessments of olfaction, neuropathology of the olfactory bulb, and PM embedded in the olfactory bulb.
 We take advantage of 5 large, diverse ongoing, harmonized, well-characterized longitudinal cohort
studies of neurologic aging that have collected rich clinical information on >4000 older adults: the Memory and
Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, the Religious Orders Study, the Latino CORE Study, and the
Clinical Core. The data collected include annual assessments of cognition, dementia status, and olfaction, as
well as brain specimens at autopsy (N>1600): the Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research
Study, the Religious Orders Study, the Latino CORE Study, and the Clinical Core.
 We will estimate participants' long-term air pollution exposures using models previously developed by
the MESA Air and MESA Coarse projects and use state-of-the-art, advanced microscopy to measure directly
PM in the olfactory bulb, a first. We will assess 3 important underlying mechanisms: the olfactory pathway,
inflammation (microglial activation), and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, we will be able to determine the effect
of air pollution exposure on neurocognitive outcomes, and examine how resultant neuropathology and direct PM
deposition explains these relationships.
 Our goal is to rigorously test the hypothesis that exposure to air pollution impairs cognitive function and
accelerates ADRD via PM deposition in the olfactory system resulting in increased AD neuropathology. This
project will generate pivotal new information on the contribution of air pollution to ADRD, raising the prospect of
reduction of the burden of ADRD on a population scale via public health interventions."

Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the interest of using psychedelics as experimental therapies for
drug addition, depression and anxiety disorders. However, psychedelics are also powerful drugs that alter neural
functions in the brain. To understand their potential benefits or risks, it is important to determine the
neurophysiological effects of psychedelics on neural circuits in vivo. The psychedelic drug lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) is a classic hallucinogen that can alter perceptual and cognitive functions in humans and
animals. This project studies the neurophysiological impacts of LSD on the sensory and memory neural circuits
in freely behaving rats. We will focus on a hypothesis that the interactions between the visual cortex and the
hippocampus are reduced by LSD, which leads to imprecise spatial representations during active spatial
navigation and impaired neural activity reactivations during offline behavior that are important for memory
retrieval and consolidation. To test the hypothesis, we will simultaneously record neurons in the hippocampus
and the visual cortex while rats under LSD learn or perform a spatial working memory task and while they sleep.
We will determine how hippocampal and visual cortical activities and their interactions are altered by LSD during
active and immobile behavior and during sleep, how the alterations depend on LSD dosage and the serotonergic
5HT2A receptors, how they are correlated with behavioral task performances, and how they can be augmented
or alleviated by manipulating the network oscillations typical of active and offline behavior. This study will reveal
the in vivo neurophysiological effects of the psychedelic drug LSD, advance our understanding on how
alterations in the sensory and memory circuits may contribute to the psychotic state generated by drugs and in
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and uncover potential risks when psychedelics are explored as
novel therapies for drug addiction and mental disorders."

Adolescent cannabis use is increasingly recognized as an important public health problem with significant
adverse health consequences. Recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) has high potential to increase risk for
adolescent cannabis use and cannabis-related health conditions. However, the effects of RCL on adolescents
are unknown. With a highly representative sample of nearly 1 million adolescents (N=900,000) regularly
screened for cannabis use in Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s large integrated healthcare delivery
system from 2015 to 2023, this multi-method study will address the pressing public health questions of whether
and how California state RCL and heterogeneity of local regulatory schemes impact the risk of adolescent
cannabis use and cannabis-related health conditions. We will use a quasi-experimental interrupted time series
design to test whether adolescent cannabis use, cannabis-related health conditions (e.g., cannabis use
disorder, other substance use, respiratory symptoms, mental health problems, cannabis-related accidents,
acute cannabis intoxication, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome), and cannabis-related healthcare use (e.g.,
emergency department, addiction treatment) and rise post-RCL. We will also examine local RCL policies
(retailer bans or caps, product and advertising restrictions, taxes, health warnings) and use geographic
information systems methods to map retailer location (e.g., distance from home address to the closest retailer)
onto individual-level electronic health record data collected in clinical care to test whether the effects of RCL
are stronger among those who live in communities with less restrictive local policies, adjusting for pre-RCL
medical cannabis policies. We will conduct hypothesis-driven moderation analyses to identify sub-groups
whose risk for cannabis use and cannabis-related health conditions may be greatest following RCL. To gain
further clinical insight into our quantitative data and guide next steps, we will conduct focus groups with
adolescents and interviews with addiction medicine clinicians, pediatricians, and emergency department
physicians to gain insight into how RCL impacts adolescent cannabis use and addiction treatment need from
the perspective of both patients and providers. Together, results will have immediate public health and clinical
implications, providing urgently needed data to identify potentially actionable areas for future policy adaptations
and aid decision making for public health practices to reduce adolescent cannabis use and cannabis-related
harms."

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the major pathway to remove bulky DNA lesions induced by UV irradiation,
environmental mutagens, and chemotherapeutic agents. Deficiency of genes involved in NER has been linked
to Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) and skin cancer. There are two mechanisms to detect DNA damage by NER,
one is global genome NER(GG-NER) and another is transcription-coupled NER(TC-NER). GG-NER occurs
anywhere in the genome, whereas TC-NER is responsible for the accelerated repair of lesions in the
transcribed strand of active genes. The both pathways are divided into early and late steps. The early step is
the sequential actions, in which XP proteins recognize, unwind, and incise the DNA lesion. The latter step is
identical in both mechanisms and is characterized by gap-filling repair synthesis, in which DNA replication
proteins fill in the ~30 nucleotide gap, followed by ligation. Compared to the well-characterized early step, the
molecular mechanism regulating the activation of gap-filling DNA synthesis at late step remains largely
unknown. Even less is known about the physiological impact of such a regulatory pathway.
 And-1 is an acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein and its yeast ortholog, Ctf4, was originally
identified as a critical gene for chromosome stability. Interestingly, yeast cells with depletion of Ctf4 gene are
hypersensitive to UV lights, suggesting a role of And-1 in UV-induced DNA damage response. However, how
And-1 regulates NER remains largely unknown. In this study, we now have extensive preliminary data
demonstrating that And-1 is critical for NER by regulating gap-filling DNA synthesis. Our hypothesis is that
And-1 regulates DNA polymerase activity at UV-lesion sites to activate gap-filling DNA synthesis at the late
stage of NER. To test this hypothesis, we plan to pursue three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the mechanism
by which And-1 regulates DNA polymerase activity in NER. Aim 2: Determine the unique mechanism by which
And-1 is recruited to UV-lesion sites. Aim 3: Determine the role of And-1 in NER and skin tumorigenesis using
And-1 deficient mouse models. The completion of proposed studies will not only advance the field by
uncovering a novel And-1-mediated pathway to regulate NER, but also provide us with the in vivo evidence to
elucidate a novel role of And-1 in NER and skin tumor."
10932944,"Comparative effectiveness research (CER) aims to inform healthcare decisions by providing evidence on the
benefits and harms of different alternatives in cancer care. While randomized controlled trials are often
considered to be the gold standard of research and have high internal validity due to their controlled
environment, they are often not generalizable to `real-world' populations. Clinical trials often exclude large
segments of the population, particularly those who are older or have comorbid conditions, threatening the
external validity of the findings. Furthermore, explanatory trials typically compare only two or three
interventions. As the number of cancer therapies and technologies increases exponentially, additional methods
are necessary to adequately compare benefits and harms across several different interventions. While the
emphasis in the past was on determining whether an intervention could work under the best conditions,
increasing importance is given to whether interventions also work in `real-world' settings, and how they
compare to other available alternatives. Real-world evidence and CER are vital to adequately evaluate and
position new health interventions and technologies as they emerge. Few training programs specifically address
CER methodologies. The overarching goal of this application is to implement a comprehensive national CER
training program for junior cancer investigators, encompassing the broad spectrum of healthcare delivery in
cancer care. Training will encompass three major CER methodologies: 1) Knowledge synthesis including
systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and decision analysis; 2) Observational studies and secondary data
analysis of registries and other sources of data, and 3) Pragmatic clinical trials, and. After first completing a
series of interactive online courses in these topics to acquire a strong knowledge base in CER, participants will
complete an intensive, hands-on training small group workshop in one or more of the three CER
methodologies. Each participant will develop an individual protocol for a CER study, for a research question of
their interest. Topics of interest can address any of the stages of care throughout the cancer continuum,
including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive care, end-of-life care, and survivorship.
Program faculty will provide individual methods guidance and support to participants during the 12 months
after enrolling in the course. Participants will be junior investigators, recruited nationally, and affiliated with
academic institutions, cancer centers or non-profit organizations (junior faculty, research scientists or post-
doctoral or clinical fellows with an expectation of a research career path). Enrollment methods will include
engaging underrepresented minorities. This education program is designed to support the National Cancer
Institute's educational mission by arming cancer researchers with innovative tools needed to conduct CER.
Expanding CER in cancer research will lead to robust real-world evidence, which can inform cancer patients,
caregivers, providers and policy-makers of the benefits and harms of cancer treatment options."
10770368,"ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The
high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer
screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung
cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias
and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected
false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related
to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer
mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate
nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate
nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT
scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and
novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to
further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We
will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history,
lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected
indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with
the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this
project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected
indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung
cancer screening."

 For the millions of individuals who experience migraine each year, treatment typically consists of
reactively treating attacks only after experiencing disruptive pain and secondary symptoms. Because individual
migraine attacks are unpredictable to most sufferers, abortive medications are not used early or effectively,
and strategies to preemptively stop developing attacks cannot be formulated. By formalizing the daily risk for
an attack, individuals will be better prepared to use existing abortive therapies and reduce the suffering
associated with any single attack. Our team has previously built and tested the Headache Prediction-I
(HAPRED-I) and Headache Prediction-II (HAPRED-II) models, which are simple migraine forecasting models
that are based on daily stress. Despite their promise, these models exhibit several weaknesses that would
prevent them from broad clinical use. The objective of this project is to evaluate a new forecasting model that
has improved predictive power. To accomplish this, several important predictors have been added to the
existing model, and the parameters of the new model will be continuously updated using Bayesian estimation.
In the new HAPRED-III model (Aim 1), the forecasting window is reduced from 24 to 12 hours, temporal
statistical predictors have been added, and additional predictors (e.g., sleep, mood, medication use, prodromal
symptoms, and self-prediction) will be tested for improved performance. To allow the model to be more easily
deployed (Aim 2), predictors of the model parameters will be examined. These predictors will better inform the
prior probabilities of the model parameters and will reduce the need to collect weeks or months of data from
each individual before generating reliable forecasts."

 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training

10746795,"SUMMARY
Gene translocations that fuse segments of two different genes (termed parents) are known to drive
oncogenesis in myriad cancers. Expression of in-frame translocations yields fusion oncoproteins (FOs) with
hybrid functional properties that aberrantly control critical biological processes and, ultimately, cause
unchecked cell proliferation and oncogenesis. FOs are often abnormal transcription factors that fuse
unstructured segments of one parent that function as activation domains to a DNA or chromatin binding
domain of the other. These FOs result in abnormal gene expression that transforms cells and drives
oncogenesis. Our preliminary computational results show that FOs often contain intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs) that display sequence features associated with the ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase
separation (LLPS), a process now appreciated to mediate the formation and function of numerous cellular
bodies, including membrane-less organelles and, importantly, nuclear transcription centers with punctate
morphology.
 Our computational analyses of thousands of clinically documented fusion oncogenes show that a
significant portion of the associated FOs contain LLPS-prone IDRs. Based on this observation, we hypothesize
that a set of FOs transform cells by forming aberrant transcription centers through phase separation; other FOs
containing LLPS-prone IDRs may form aberrant cellular puncta that host different functions. Further, we
hypothesize that FOs represent a rich source of proteins which, through analysis in cells and in vitro, and
through computational analyses, will reveal novel sequence and conformational features associated with
phase separation. These hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims."

 From its inception as an NIDDK-funded P50 Center in 2002, the mission of the Indiana O’Brien Center
for Advanced Renal Microscopy has been to provide renal researchers with effective access to advanced
forms of microscopy. Over the past 20 years of continuous funding, the IU O’Brien Center has pioneered the
development and dissemination of novel methods of multiphoton intravital microscopy, quantitative tissue
cytometry and digital image analysis that have been applied in collaborative studies of renal physiology and
pathophysiology with investigators from around the world. Studies conducted with the P30 and P50 IU O’Brien
Center have generated data used in over 190 publications and numerous grant applications that have helped
launch the careers of a new generation of investigators. We look forward to continuing our work within the
consortium framework of the new U54 mechanism. The goals and projects proposed for the Center are
organized into three general aims – (1) Provide quantitative intravital microcopy of mice and rats as a service
to renal researchers. Provide hands-on training to encourage dissemination of intravital microscopy as an
effective research tool. (2) Provide quantitative, large-scale microscopy of the kidney as a service to renal
researchers. Three-dimensional confocal tissue cytometry, CODEX multiplexed cytometry and Spatial
Transcriptomics will be offered individually or in combination, supporting uniquely comprehensive molecular
characterizations. (3) Develop and implement methods of tissue clearing, light-sheet microscopy and digital
image analysis to expand the scale of quantitative microscopy of renal tissues, based upon a unique multi-
scale/multi-resolution strategy and state-of-the-art methods of digital image analysis.
 The Indiana O’Brien Center will include an Administrative Core, and two Biomedical Resource cores - an
Intravital Microscopy Core, and a Molecular Imaging Core, both hosted by the Indiana Center for Biological
Microscopy. Insofar as these two cores effectively extend services currently offered by the Indiana O’Brien
Center, they will benefit from the existing infrastructure, expertise and experience developed over the past
twenty years by the Center. The Center will also support a Resource Development Core, in collaboration with
investigators at the University of Washington, University of Nebraska and Purdue University that will develop
technologies that will start to be implemented at the beginning of the second year of funding."
10914938,"ABSTRACT: KIDNIT (Kidney Imaging: Developing Novel and Innovative Tools) is the Pittsburgh Center for
Kidney Research’s Resource Development Core. Working in collaboration with kidney investigators and the
Center’s Physiology and Model Systems Core, KIDNIT will build and adapt cutting-edge light, super-resolution,
and electron microscopic imaging modalities and technologies to address open questions related to kidney
function and dysfunction. The broad and long-range goals of KIDNIT are as follows: Aim 1 is to nurture a dynamic
incubator space for imaging tool development. KIDNIT will capitalize on the resources provided by the Center
for Biological Imaging (CBI), one of the largest imaging facilities in the country. The CBI has a dedicated expert
faculty, a large cohort of research technicians, and a vast array of imaging equipment including over 40
contemporary widefield, confocal, two-photon, TIRF, light-sheet, super-resolution, and electron microscopes.
Aim 2 is to develop new and custom-made imaging resources, tools, and technologies specifically to augment
and advance kidney research. KIDNIT will leverage the CBI’s faculty expertise to develop, adapt, and implement
new imaging tools for kidney researchers. Example projects in development include novel clearing and 3D
imaging protocols to reveal and quantify kidney architecture and function at the level of the entire organ;
analyzing collagen organization and structure in normal and fibrotic tissues using a recently developed variant
of polarized light microscopy (instant polarized light microscopy; iPOL); development of new protocols that
employ fluorescent lifetime imaging and fluorescent energy transfer to rapidly assess kidney cell function and
responses to extracellular cues; use of high throughput platforms to perform large-scale screening of organoid
form and function; and development of novel microfluidic chambers. Mechanisms are in place to ensure training
and information transfer. Aim 3 is focused on ensuring robust validation and quality control of new resources.
An example is a validated antibody collection that can be used to assess differentiation, injury, and repair status
of kidney cells and tissues. Aim 4 is to collaborate with the Consortium to prioritize, suspend, or implement new
and improved imaging resources. Working in collaboration with the Consortium, KIDNIT will replace obsolete
technologies by leveraging its ties with industry leaders, along with a strong track record of S10 funding, to offer
the most recent developments in microscopy, specifically to advance the research of our investigator collective.
Impact: KIDNIT will advance kidney research by providing Center and Consortium investigators with novel and
bespoke imaging tools that will provide critical information about the location, dynamics, amounts, and function
of kidney-associated molecules, organelles, cells, and tissues in normal and disease states."

Candidate Information: I am a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Joseph Mizgerd’s lab at Boston University Pulmonary
Center since Jan-2018 and my work has focused on elucidating how lung epithelial cells (LECs) and CD4 T cells
communicate with each other to optimize bacterial clearance and tissue resilience during pneumococcal
pneumonia. My career objective is to become a tenure-track faculty member in a top-tiered academic institution,
training scientists at all rungs of the academic ladder (including undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs) in
investigating mechanisms- and consequences- of distinct cell-cell interactions on lung immunity and repair in
response to diverse infections, allergies, cancer and aging. To ensure that I make timely progress towards
achieving my career objectives, I have put together a comprehensive plan comprised of short-, intermediate-
and long- term research and training goals. I have gathered a mentoring team that will be comprised of Dr.
Joseph Mizgerd (Mentor) and Dr. Darrell Kotton (Co-mentor) and an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Jose
Ordovas-Montanes, Dr. Carla Kim and Dr. Ulrich von Andrian that will ensure my continued training and progress
towards proficiency in lung epithelial- and stem cell- biology, single cell sequencing and computational biology,
and pulmonary immunology along with a larger appreciation of cancer biology and T cell biology. All the
committee members will regularly meet me in one-on-one discussion and larger committee meetings to ensure
my rigorous research and career development training. This will aid my transition to independence with a unique
set of skills that empowers me to be a leader in the field of LEC-CD4 T cell crosstalk during health and disease.
Proposed research and significance: Recurrent inhalation of microbes establishes lung-resident memory CD4
T (TRM) cells that confer anti-microbial immunity by remodeling LEC responses during reinfections. Our
preliminary data shows that LECs and stem cells are capable of antigen presentation to CD4 T cells during
pneumonia and then harboring autonomous immune memory of their past encounters with CD4 T cells post
resolution of pneumonia. Whether retrograde signaling that accompanies antigen presentation to CD4 T cells
reprograms concomitant and future LEC functions is unknown. Furthermore, the existence, epigenetic- and
transcriptomic- extent, and consequences of LEC immune memory on subsequent LEC functions have never
been investigated. Thus, the proposed studies will identify if engagement in an immune synapse remodels LEC
functions during pneumonia (K99) and will test if CD4 T cells generate trained immunity in LECs post resolution
of pneumonia (R00). The proposed aims will involve use of single cell sequencing technology, novel genetically
engineered mouse models, and innovative lineage tracing strategies to test whether CD4 T cells reprogram
LECs to preempt-, fight- and recover from- pneumonia. Findings will unify fields of mucosal immunity, LEC
biology and lung regeneration and have the potential to identify LECs as immunomodulatory targets that can be
trained to fight infections and cancers, promptly repair lungs, and to maintain pulmonary homeostasis."

10933579,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Astrocytes play a key role in cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation by modulating cerebrovascular reactivity
(CVR) and neurovascular coupling (NVC). CBF is dysregulated in many neurological disorders, including stroke
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is proposed to contribute to neuronal dysfunction leading to dementia. The
factors that drive CBF dysregulation remain unresolved but are critical to understanding the pathobiology of, and
developing novel interventions for, dementia. We hypothesize that ischemic injuries induce persistent life-long
astrogliosis, with a consequent negative impact on CBF regulation and cognitive performance. Epidemiologically,
a large fraction of AD patients harbor ischemic injuries, and patients who suffer ischemic injuries are more likely
to develop dementia. In pilot studies, we find that mice exposed to a unilateral mild ischemic injury demonstrate
persistent reactive astrogliosis lasting up to 8 months. Further, this chronic time point coincides with impaired
CVR and NVC response in both hemispheres despite the unilateral insult, mimicking observations in patient
populations. CBF dysregulation would produce persistent hypoxia and facilitate Aβ production, which, in turn, can
constrict vessels and worsen hypoxia. As the brain has a high energy demand but few energy stores, this interplay
between CBF dysregulation and Aβ can initiate a vicious escalating cycle of energy crisis. Preliminary data
suggesting that A and ischemia may have additive effects on NVC impairment support this concept. Thus,
ischemia-induced CBF dysregulation could be a triggering catalyst in dementia pathology.
 Interactions between ischemic stroke and AD are understudied because of traditional separation of the two
disciplines, confining this relationship to the correlative realm and precluding causality inferences. In this project,
we combine a model of mild ischemia with a transgenic AD mouse model featuring Aβ deposition to
comprehensively interrogate how ischemia-induced CBF dysregulation interacts with Aβ and contributes to
cognitive impairment across life span, with a focus on astrocyte-dependent vasoconstrictive mechanisms. Briefly,
we integrate genetic, physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral strategies to: (Aim 1) chart the progression
of astrogliosis, CVR and NVC impairments, cognitive/behavior deficits, and Aβ pathology across life span at the
intersection of ischemia, Aβ, and aging to unveil temporal causality links; (Aim 2) test the role of 20-HETE, an
astrocyte-derived vasoconstrictive signal, in ischemia-induced CBF dysregulation and cognitive/behavior deficits;
and (Aim 3) determine whether re-expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in ischemic-induced reactive
astrocytes drives 20-HETE synthesis to impair NVC and CVR. Our findings will reveal novel insights into the
cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie CBF dysregulation at the intersection of stroke and AD. This
information could be leveraged to design both new biomarkers (CVR/NVC impairment) and therapeutic targets
for early interventions (restoring CVR/NVC) for dementia."
10775760,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are exposed to various insults thought to reduce their survival including lack of
anchorage and trophic support from the primary tumor microenvironment, immune-mediated destruction and
exposure to hemodynamic forces that may mechanically destroy them. However, the relative contribution of
these factors to CTC survival and their overall role in metastasis is unclear. It has recently been shown that
cancer cells from many tissue origins actively resist destruction by fluid shear stress (FSS), implying that viable
CTCs are not mechanically fragile as suspected. Our long-term goal is to understand the biomechanical
influences on CTCs and how this contributes to metastasis. The objective of this proposal is to determine the
mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells and its role in metastatic colonization. Our central hypothesis is
that mechano-adaptation of viable CTCs to FSS promotes their survival in the circulation and “primes” them for
subsequent events in metastasis. Our hypothesis is based on our previously published and preliminary data
presented below as well as recently published data from others which is supportive of our hypothesis. The
rationale for the proposed research is that once we understand the mechanism underlying FSS resistance; this
would represent a novel therapeutic approach aimed at decreasing the survival of CTCs by enhancing their
destruction due to the mechanical forces that naturally exist in the circulation. Guided by preliminary data, the
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Define molecular mechanisms of FSS
resistance; 2) Determine the effect of FSS exposure on metastatic colonization; 3) Determine the effectiveness
of inhibiting FSS resistance as an anti-metastatic strategy. To accomplish these aims, we will employ a forward
genetic screen to identify novel genes that mediate FSS resistance and determine their involvement with RhoA-
actomyosin interactions. Short-term survival of CTCs will be assessed using a novel mouse model to measure
entrapment of intact CTCs in the lung and destruction of CTCs measured by a plasma biomarker. We will validate
novel genes identified in a forward genetic screen in similar assays. We will determine the involvement of RhoA-
YAP activation by FSS in supporting the survival and extravasation of cancer cells lodged in the microcirculation.
Finally, we will test the potential of clinically actionable drugs that sensitize cells to FSS as well as conditional
RhoA/YAP knockdown to block productive metastatic colonization in mouse models. The proposed research is
innovative because, it represents a paradigm shift from the idea that CTCs are mechanically fragile by elucidating
a mechanism whereby viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and drives further events
in metastasis. The proposed research is significant because defining the mechanisms and consequences of FSS
resistance in CTCs will open entirely new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in cancer patients."
10775763,"Project Summary
 As the population of the United States ages, the health burden imposed by diseases of aging is expected
to increase concomitantly. Social factors, including low socioeconomic status, social isolation, and low social
support, are among the best predictors of susceptibility to diseases of aging, as well as lifespan itself.
Nevertheless, key questions about the causal relationship and the biological mechanisms that link social
experiences to health and aging remain unanswered. Animal models are a powerful tool to address these
questions. Like humans, other social mammals exhibit strong associations between social adversity, health,
and mortality. Unlike humans, though, they experience less complex environments, have shorter generation
times, and can be subjected to experimental manipulation in controlled environments.
 The goal of this proposal is to build a Research Network on Animal Models to Understand Social
Dimensions of Aging. By supporting interdisciplinary communication and pilot research from both human and
nonhuman animal researchers, we aim to maximize the impact of animal model research on understanding the
social determinants of health and aging. A Research Network is essential because current research in this
area is distributed across many different disciplines, there is no standard set of conferences or publication
venues where researchers with related interests overlap, and there are high barriers to entry for animal model
work. The proposed network will overcome these challenges by supporting scientific meetings and workshops
that build contacts across disciplines and among researchers at all career levels. It will also recruit new,
diverse investigators into the field by providing opportunities for pilot project support, travel fellowships, and
mentorship by experienced senior investigators. As part of these activities, the network will provide hands-on
training for animal model research in rodents and nonhuman primates and for comparative research that
leverages human and animal data sets. To build visibility, it will support targeted symposia at meetings where
animal model work on the social dimensions of aging has not traditionally been represented. Finally, it will
identify priority areas for animal model research and promote data and protocol dissemination. These activities
will help set a research agenda that extends beyond the network’s immediate activities.
 Thus, the proposed network will transform a weakly connected community into a self-sustaining field of
researchers equipped to conduct impactful research on the social dimensions of aging. Areas of particular
interest include models to test the causal effects of social interactions on health; methods that can be flexibly
deployed in both nonhuman animals and human populations; and research that investigates the benefits of
behavioral interventions for alleviating the costs of social adversity. Advances in these areas will have direct
translational application to human health and well-being during aging."
10771699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: COOK PROJECT
 Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a relatively common connective tissue disorder with an incidence of 1 in
5000 persons. This dominantly inherited disorder occurs secondary to mutations in the extracellular matrix
(ECM) protein fibrillin-1. Thoracic aortic aneurysm with dissection or rupture and dilated cardiomyopathy with
progression to heart failure are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in afflicted patients. Fibrillin-1
microfibrils dictate both tissue integrity and local growth factor bioavailability and are widely expressed across
a range of tissues including ECM surrounding the cardiomyocyte and within the aortic wall.
 The long-standing understanding of MFS is that pleotropic manifestations are secondary to TGFβ
overactivation due to poor ECM sequestration and that losartan, an angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R)
antagonist, mitigates aortic aneurysm formation through reduction of TGFβ signaling. My work has revealed
that the mechanisms are more complex. I was the first to identify dilated cardiomyopathy as a primary
manifestation of a fibrillin-1 deficient cardiomyocyte ECM with accompanying abnormal cardiomyocyte-ECM
signaling.
 As a vascular surgeon, I am interested in understanding the development of cardiovascular disease in
MFS to improve the care we provide to patients with MFS and other inherited and acquired aortopathies. My
central hypothesis is that cardiovascular disease in MFS is the result of discrete tissue-specific loss of
Fbn1 signaling that disrupts homeostasis to induce inflammation and maladaptive remodeling. The
proposed studies represent a framework to interrogate the functional relationships among extracellular
microfibrils, inflammation, and adaptation to stress that intersect vasculature and heart. My investigations will
establish a foundation to identify molecular determinants underlying aortic aneurysm formation and stress-
mediated cardiomyopathy that can be pharmacologically targeted to restore cardiovascular function in MFS
and related conditions."
10771700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT: SALOMON PROJECT
 The intestinal microbiome plays a significant role in maintenance of health and homeostasis. Many disease
states are associated with an altered microbiome, known as dysbiosis, which could exacerbate disease and
worsen inflammation. Previous data has shown children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have an
abnormal intestinal microbiome with increased amounts of proinflammatory bacteria and reduced numbers of
healthy beneficial bacteria. These children also undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, which
is known to cause significant amounts of systemic inflammation and induce intestinal epithelial barrier
dysfunction. The systemic inflammation results in low cardiac output state, which is a major contributor to
morbidity and mortality in this patient population.
 We hypothesize that pre-operative intestinal dysbiosis in pediatric patients with CHD produces
inflammatory metabolites that exacerbate CPB-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and
systemic inflammation. Our specific aims will map the intestinal microbiome and evaluate intestinal
metabolite profiles associated with inflammatory signaling mediated through intestinal barrier dysfunction. We
will also implement an established piglet model of bypass to evaluate the influence of the microbiome, barrier
function, and metabolites on systemic inflammation. Innovation of this study lies in the concept of studying the
microbiome in patients with congenital heart disease, biological innovation in being the first to temporally map
the microbiome in a variety of cardiac lesions, and technical in the use of an animal model of cardiopulmonary
bypass to evaluate the microbiome.
 This proposal will yield novel evidence of the role the intestinal microbiome plays in relation to congenital
heart disease and the systemic inflammation and patient outcomes following cardiac surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass. Combined, these results will pave the way for future studies targeting interventions
on the microbiome to improve patient outcomes following surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass."

 Despite continued expansion in the use of donor hearts following brain death, there remains an
unacceptable shortfall in the supply of suitable donor hearts compared to the demand from increasing recipient
numbers on transplant waitlists. Donation after circulatory-determined death (DCD) is emerging as an
alternative pathway to traditional donation after brain death. DCD heart transplantation has been made
possible by technological developments of reanimation and preservation. In donation after brain death donors,
artificial ventilatory and hemodynamic (blood flow) support is used to keep organs in a fully functional state
before transplantation. In DCD donors, an absence of respiratory and circulatory function deprives the organs
of oxygen for a variable period of time before organ recovery, which increases the challenges in maintaining
viability.
 The current reanimation technique used once the heart ceases function is to take the heart out of the donor
body (ex-situ) and connect it to a heart and lung machine. A recently developed alternative is to restore
circulation inside the donor body (in-situ) by connecting the circulation of the donor to the heart and lung
machine. This technique of inside the body heart reanimation, in contrast to outside of the body reanimation,
has an added benefit of increasing the quality of other donor organs (liver, kidneys) and allows for an
assessment of heart function prior to transplantation in a more natural environment. An undesirable effect of
this technique, attributed to the use of fully oxygenated blood, causes structural damage to the heart and
compromises function. We hypothesize that using an advanced cardioprotective solution during initial
perfusion would minimize damage to the myocardium.
 Our long-term objective is to develop an optimal technique for inside of the body reanimation and
preservation of organs in donation after circulatory determined death. Our specific aims are to demonstrate
improved heart function and decreased myocardial structural damage in organs initially perfused with
cardioprotective solution in comparison to organs reanimated with fully oxygenated blood. To achieve our
aims, we will use a novel porcine model of low-oxygen circulatory arrest. We will assess the function (via
echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements), and structural damage via special blood and tissue
analysis) in donor organs perfused inside of the body with standard technique using fully oxygenated blood.
These will be compared to the results of 5 organs perfused initially with cardioprotective solution.
 We anticipate that successful translation of our technique into clinical practice could increase the heart
transplantation activity in our region by 20% by improving availability of donor organs. Expanding the donor
pool would also increase the accessibility of organs to ethnic and racial minorities in our region as well as
nationally."
10773764,"Abstract
 Objective, sensitive, and clinically meaningful assessments of disease severity are needed in ataxia-
telangiectasia (A-T) and other neurological disorders to support drug development efforts, facilitate clinical
care, and provide caregivers and patients with real-time information about disease status. This need has
become even more critical as the number of disease-modifying therapies under evaluation rapidly expands.
Daily fluctuation in symptoms, superimposed changes related to child development, and variable participation
in task-based assessments pose challenges to precisely measuring disease severity. Passive and continuous
(i.e., task-free) collection of movement data at-home using consumer-grade wearable sensors, combined with
motor control theory-inspired signal processing and machine learning methods, provides an opportunity to
produce reliable, interpretable, and meaningful motor measures that can sensitively capture disease change.
 We have recently made substantial preliminary progress in creating algorithms to extract and
characterize movement building blocks called “submovements” from a single wrist or ankle sensor worn
continuously at home. These sensor-based features show strong potential as novel disease measures: they
demonstrate high reliability, correlate with clinician assessments of motor severity and caregiver-reported
motor function, and show potential to sensitively quantify disease progression. By passively measuring
everyday activity, the information obtained can be more ecologically valid and comprehensive than task-
specific measurements and is applicable in young children as well in older, non-ambulatory individuals. We
propose to further develop and expand this technology over a wide age range and in a longitudinal cohort of A-
T and age- and gender-matched control participants to establish reliability, age relationships, and sensitivity to
disease change. Additional clinical, caregiver-reported, and molecular data will be obtained alongside wrist and
ankle sensor data to increase the interpretability and clinical meaningfulness of the measures and move
toward clinical trial-ready outcome measures.
 The overall goal of this project is to develop accessible technologies that produce highly sensitive,
meaningful, and ecologically-valid measures of motor function for use in clinical trials and clinical practice in A-
T as well as other pediatric and adult neurodegenerative disorders."
10773768,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is master regulator of cell growth and
metabolism. Dysregulation of mTORC1 is observed in sporadic and familial cancers. mTORC1 inhibition
is an established treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Despite great efforts to target mTORC1 in
cancer, adverse effects limit the use of mTORC1 inhibitors in the clinic. Recent work from our lab and
collaborators has revealed the existence and structural basis of substrate-specific regulatory pathways
that may be targeted with greater precision than heretofore.
 mTORC1 is activated on the surface of lysosomes in response to nutrient signals by conversion
of the nucleotide state of the Rag GTPases from inactive (RagA/BGDP-RagC/DGTP) to active (RagA/BGTP-
RagC/DGDP). The Rags are targeted to the lysosome by the Ragulator complex. Rag states are
interconverted by the RagC/D GAP FLCN-FNIP and the RagA/B GAP GATOR1. Subunits of these
complexes, and the Rags, are mutated in cancer. RagA/BGTP and GATOR1 inactivation is required for
phosphorylation of all mTORC1 substrates. RagC/DGDP and FLCN-FNIP activity is only required for
phosphorylation of non-canonical substrates, which include TFEB, the key transcriptional regulator of
lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Cryo-EM studies of the Rag, Ragulator, and FLCN-FNIP pathway
from our laboratory provided a start-to-finish structural explanation for the repression and reactivation of
FLCN GAP activity in starvation and refeeding. These studies contributed to the discovery that
RagC/DGDP uniquely regulates TFEB and MiT-TFE transcription factors, which in turn explained the tumor
suppressor activity of FLCN in Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome. This pathway has now been linked to
RHEB activity and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). We then demonstrated the existence and
determining the structure and function of the mTORC1-TFEB-Rag-Ragulator “megacomplex”, containing
a full mTORC1 dimer, two copies of TFEB, and four copies of the heptameric complex of active Rags and
Ragulator, showing how RagC/DGDP specifically recruits TFEB.
 In aims 1 and 2, we will explore the new avenues opened up the analysis of the megacomplex.
We will determine how the megacomplex is turned over following TFEB phosphorylation, and whether the
principles of substrate specific activation seen for TFEB and RagC also apply to canonical substrates.
Findings will be followed up in BHD and TSC cell lines and a BHD mouse xenograft model. While we now
have a start-to-finish structural mapping of FLCN/RagC/D pathway, the still mysterious regulatory
mechanisms operating in the GATOR1/RagA/B pathway will be elucidated in aim 3, and the cancer
implications explored in knock-out and Glioblastoma cell lines."

The goal of this innovative project is to bring together multidisciplinary expertise to dissect the functional,
structural, and dynamic nature of interactions between the HIV-1 envelope (Env) cytoplasmic tail (CT), the
underlying Gag matrix (MA) lattice, and the lipid containing membrane in the context of native virions. We will
utilize state-of-the-art cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, modeling, and
in vitro studies to produce a comprehensive rendition of how interactions between these key determinants of
assembly and infectivity are orchestrated. Our studies are based on recent cryo-ET data in which the positioning
of Env CT and MA interactions differed from previous models. In Aim 1, we will harness the power of cryo-ET to
advance the resolution of Env CT-MA interactions to facilitate further interrogation of the mechanics of Env CT-
MA-membrane interactions. In Aim 2, we will generate atomistic models of Env CT-MA in the context of the viral
membrane using high resolution structures and cryo-ET density, and strategic mutations and truncations of Env
CT and MA. In Aim 3, we will exploit conserved structural features to design novel antiviral agents comprised of
membrane-permeable cyclic peptide inhibitors. These Aims are supported by comprehensive biochemical and
virologic approaches and will use a well characterized clade C transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 infectious
molecular clone that is fully representative of global isolates and presents fully matched Env and Gag
components, which distinguishes our work. Our studies will reveal in unprecedented detail how Env CT, MA, and
membrane lipids engage one another, with all components in near native context. These powerful approaches
will produce an integrated model, including flexible regions that are difficult to resolve, to bring the complete Env-
MA-membrane machinery to life."

The plasma membrane experiences many cellular and environmental changes in form of
increasing or decreasing membrane tension. Events such as cytokinesis, cell differentiation,
migration, and metabolic changes all affect volume to surface area ratios and thus plasma
membrane tension. Therefore, an increasing number of studies identify changes in membrane
tension as a common signal for the cellular status. This signal affects cytoskeleton, ion channels,
and cell signaling and thus is able to coordinate cellular response pathways. A goal of cellular
stress response is to reestablish normal membrane tension, which is important to maintain cell
integrity and functionality of systems associated with the plasma membrane. How eukaryotic cells
sense and maintain membrane tension is poorly understood. We started to address these
questions by analyzing the response of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to dramatic changes in
osmolarity of the growth medium, a stress that is commonly encountered in the natural
environment of this unicellular organism. Within seconds, osmotic stress can change the surface
area of yeast by +/-20%, a change that suggests rapid addition or removal of membrane to/from
the surface. Our data indicate that this rapid membrane flux is mediated by the ER-plasma
membrane contact sites (EPCS). Current models implicate the EPCS in the shuttling of lipids
between the two membranes, a transport activity that can explain our observations during cell
shrinking. However, rapid cell expansion seems to require an additional mechanism, the fusion
of the ER with the plasma membrane at contact sites. This proposed fusion allows not only for
rapid membrane transport to the plasma membrane, but it also might be able to deliver within
seconds stress-response proteins from the ER to the cell surface."
10777626,"Project Summary: High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is responsible for ~15% of pediatric cancer-related deaths,
with nearly half of these characterized by MYCN amplification. The addition of anti-GD2 antibodies and
retinoids to maintenance therapy has improved the outcomes of these patients, but still more than 50% perish.
Omics studies in NB tumors has revealed that most NBs are driven by an adrenergic (ADRN) core regulatory
complex (CRC) of transcription factors that can be driven by MYCN and includes GATA-3, TBX2, HAND2,
PHOX2B, ISL1 and ASCL1. Genomically targeting the CRCs has been demonstrated to be highly effective,
however a pharmaceutical way to target the CRCs and in particular one that would be tolerated by the patient
has not been developed. Here we demonstrate a remarkable therapeutic vulnerability of MYCN-amplified NB
to SUMOylation inhibition. We provide evidence that toxicity involves disruption of the ADRN CRC which
requires the presence of MYCN. This pathway has become actionable, with the advent of the SUMOylation
inhibitor, TAK-981 (Subasumstat) now in multiple clinical trials. Thus, we propose we have uncovered an
ADRN CRC inhibition strategy that is effective in MYCN-amplified NB, suggesting a real therapeutic window.
Specific Aims
Specific Aim 1: Test a diverse set of well-annotated high-risk patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for
efficacy and safety of SUMOylation inhibition in neuroblastoma alone and combined with maintenance therapy
Specific Aim 2: Investigate the mechanism of adrenergic (ADRN) core regulatory complex (CRC) disruption
following SUMOylation targeting
Study Design: We will further characterize the high sensitivity of TAK-981 in high-risk MYCN-amplified NB
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models either alone or in combination with the anti-GD2 therapy, dinutuximab.
Through a series of genomic and proteomic studies, we will further categorize the mechanism of sensitivity to
SUMOylation inhibition. As TAK-981 induces NK cell activation, it is a rational inducing partner with the anti-
GD2 immunotherapy, dinutuximab. We will also investigate this combination in NB mouse models. In all, we
will attempt to gather the preclinical evidence that TAK-981 should be clinically evaluated in MYCN-amplified
NB patients."
10778042,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A cancer diagnosis and its subsequent treatment affects whole patient health -- disrupting the full spectrum of
physical, social, emotional, and functional quality of life. An estimated 83% of cancer patients report low to very
low quality of life. Individuals receiving chemotherapy report experiencing over 13 concurrent symptoms,
including fatigue, sleep difficulties, and pain. 30%-40% of people with cancer report significant psychological
symptoms, including anxiety and depression. Such disruptions in mental health and quality of life, in turn,
exacerbate physical symptoms and can worsen clinical outcomes. Despite growing evidence of the complex,
interconnected pathways linking the mind and body, scalable interventions that efficiently target whole-person
health upon diagnosis of a life-altering disease such as cancer have not yet been developed. Existing medical
treatments, focus on the physiological aspects of the disease. Existing psychological treatments, such as
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), apply a broad range of
cognitive and behavioral strategies to reduce diffuse symptoms of depression and anxiety. Such ancillary
programs for psychological care are routinely proposed as methods to reduce distress and symptoms, restore
function, and improve quality of life, but they are frequently inaccessible to patients and notoriously difficult to
scale. The MINDSET intervention aims to close this major treatment gap and promote whole patient health by
targeting patient mindsets at the point of diagnosis. This proposal builds on our extensive foundational
research completed over the past 6 years with support of the NIH New Innovator Award (DP2 AT009511) to
test a novel mHealth intervention targeting patient mindsets at the point of diagnosis. In our prior research, we
showed that a 2.5-hour digital MINDSET intervention significantly improves whole patient health (physical,
social, and emotional functioning as measured by the FACT-G) in patients undergoing systemic treatment for
cancer with curative intent compared to a Treatment as Usual (TAU) control. Leveraging our interdisciplinary
team of experts in oncology, psychology, psychiatry, mHealth, and biostatistics, we aim to expand on this prior
research to address this large and costly gap in clinical care. We propose a fully decentralized Phase 3
randomized controlled trial in which 440 cancer patients treated for non-metastatic solid tumors and
hematological malignancies will be allocated to either a (1) MINDSET or (2) Matched Attention Control (MAC)
condition. Patient-reported primary outcomes (FACT-G Total Score) and secondary outcomes (anxiety,
depression, affect, sleep, coping, symptom distress, patient activation/engagement, and inflammatory biology)
will be assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 6, and 10. Durability of the effect of the intervention will be
measured at two follow-up timepoints: 3 months, and 6 months after study completion. By promoting health at
the psychological, behavioral, and biological levels, MINDSET interventions have the potential to become a
highly impactful and complementary tool for promoting whole patient health."
10773017,"Current treatments of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clear the disease burden consisting mostly
of leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs), but they usually fail to eradicate leukemia stem cells
(LSCs). Altered DNA repair mechanisms may be responsible for survival of LSCs and/or LPCs
under genotoxic stress. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most lethal DNA lesions, are
usually repaired by BRCA -mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair at the replication
forks. BRCA-HR repair involves several proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD54 and RAD51.
An alternative HR pathway depends on RAD52-RAD51 (RAD52-HR). PARP1-mediated base
excision repair (BER) and PARP1-dependent non-homologous end-joining (P-NHEJ) serve as
back-ups/alternative mechanisms to prevent and/or repair DSBs.
 Cancer-specific defects in DNA repair create the opportunity to employ a phenomenon
called synthetic lethality, e.g. elimination of BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells by PARP1 inhibitor
(PARP1i). Since inactivating mutations in BRCA-HR pathway are rare in AMLs, we obtained
preliminary data suggesting that BRCA deficiency and BRCA proficiency on individual AMLs
can be predicted by a comprehensive Gene Mutation Analysis (GMA) of AML-inducing genetic
aberrations. This approach will be tested in Aim #1.
 BRCA-deficient AML LSCs/LPCs should be prone to PARP1i-induced synthetic lethality.
However, therapeutic effect of PARP1i in BRCA1/2-deficient cells may be reduced by
alternative RAD52-HR, which can protect, at least partially, BRCA-deficient PARP1i-treated
cells from lethal effect of DSBs. Therefore, in Aim #2 we propose that combination of
PARP1i+RAD52i may induce more effective synthetic lethality in BRCA deficient LSCs/LPCs.
We will also develop drug-grade RAD52i.
 On the other hand, BRCA-proficient AML cells should be sensitive to the inhibitors of BRCA-
HR pathway combined with PARP1i. Preliminary data suggest that RAD54 may be a valid target
to induce BRCA-deficiency in BRCA-proficient cells. In Aim #3 we will examine if targeting
RAD54 sensitizes BRCA-proficient AMLs to PARP1i - mediated synthetic lethality.
 We expect that personalized medicine-guided synthetic lethality combining drugs targeting
DNA repair may be designed to eliminate AML LSCs/LPCs in individual patients."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are three to six times more likely to develop epilepsy compared to the rest of the

and neurodegeneration. The objective in this application is to define the processes by which demyelination itself
causes cellular, molecular and circuit changes increasing neuronal excitability. Our central hypothesis is that
demyelination is coupled to elevated excitability, loss of parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons, and dysfunction of
astrocyte metabolism/transport. This hypothesis is based on our recently published work demonstrating marked

pared to mice on a normal diet. The rationale for the proposed research is that detailed spatiotemporal moni-
toring of EEG activity with multielectrode arrays (MEA) in CPZ-treated mice will allow identification of the locus
and timing of seizure initiation during chronic demyelination, and this will direct the probe of excitatory/inhib-
itory neurotransmission and cellular/molecular changes by immunohistochemical and electrophysiological tech-
niques. Based on new preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Define the spatial and temporal generation of chronic demyelination-associated seizures; 2) Evaluate the role of
GABAergic neurons with an emphasis of PV neurons in the generation of chronic demyelination-induced sei-
zures; 3) Evaluate the role of astrocytes in regional seizure susceptibility during chronic demyelination. Novel
electrophysiological and transgenic approaches together with direct comparison to human tissue from patients
with MS with and without seizures will elucidate demyelination-associated cellular and molecular changes that
lead to seizure susceptibility. The proposed research is significant, because it will advance fundamental
knowledge of glial-neuronal interactions in the brain while providing new and rational strategies and treatments
for prevention and treatment of MS-associated seizures."

The goal of this application for the NHLBI K01 Faculty Diversity Mentored Career Development award is to
provide Deshira Wallace, MSPH, PhD, with the essential training to become an independent researcher in
cardiovascular health and health inequities affecting minoritized populations, specifically Black Latinos. Dr.
Wallace puts forth a comprehensive research proposal and career development plan integrating training in and
application of theories of racialization and intersectionality, social epidemiology, cardiovascular health, and
advanced quantitative and qualitative methods. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent among
Latinos living in the United States (US). Studies have shown that CVD prevalence varies by Latino subgroup,
and these within-group disparities may be driven by different exposures due to varying identities. For example,
studies have established that within-group CVD disparities exist for Latinos by country of origin, nativity, and
years residing in the US. However, there is limited research on subgroup analysis according to how Latinos are
racialized in the US, despite Latinos simultaneously embodying both a race and ethnicity (intersectionality).
Racialization is the process by which race is understood by and ascribed to an individual. To examine the
racialized experiences of Latinos, the specific aims are to (1) Explore racialization experiences of Black Latinos
in the US; (2) Construct a multi-item racialization variable; and (3) Compare trajectories of cardiovascular risk
scores over time among Latinos to assess differences by racialization. Aim 1 will use in-depth interviews and
focus groups to understand individual and collective beliefs and perceptions of factors influencing how Black
Latino adults experience racialization in the US. Data collection will occur in North Carolina. Aim 2 (factor
analysis) and Aim 3 (mixture models) will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study. To complement
the scope of the proposed research study, the proposal includes four career-development and training goals:
(1) Deepen theoretical understanding of intersectionality and racialization and apply them to qualitative and
quantitative research methods; (2) Develop quantitative skills in latent class and mixture modeling analysis of
longitudinal, epidemiological data; (3) Integrate social and biological science approaches to address causal
factors that influence cardiovascular health; and (4) Strengthen scientific writing and grantsmanship skills. The
proposed K01 supports the NHLBI’s focus on investigating factors that account for differences in health among
populations. Findings from the proposed research will impact public health by using an intersectional approach
to provide novel information about experiences of racialization and their impact on cardiovascular health
among Black Latinos to inform tailored prevention and treatment strategies. This project will be carried out at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which offers exceptional resources and mentoring to train Dr.
Wallace to execute the proposed K01; it also provides resources to augment faculty diversity to successfully
transition as an independent researcher."

The long-term goal of these studies is to advance high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) methods
for evaluating brain-behavior relationships in infants and toddlers at risk for developing autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) while they are awake and engaged within a naturalistic setting. This application is being submitted in
response to FOA: RFA-MH-18-200, NIMH Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists
(BRAINS R01), because the PI is an early stage investigator who is building a program of research that is highly
innovative, transformative, and has the potential to elucidate underlying mechanisms, inform clinical
interventions, and improve outcome of ASD. As such, this research is harmonious with the mission of NIMH: to
transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the
way for prevention, recovery, and cure. ASD, defined by deficits in social communication and restricted
interests/repetitive behaviors, is a serious psychiatric disorder of childhood, is treatable but currently incurable,
and affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States at an estimated annual cost of $268B. Early
behavioral and educational interventions, starting at 18-24 months of age, improve outcomes in a subset of
patients. Neuroimaging methods, including both task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
task-free functional connectivity MRI, have demonstrated sensitivity to neural signatures of ASD that may inform
diagnosis and track responses to interventions. However, the MRI environment can prove intolerable for many
children due to noise, claustrophobia, and the need to lie supine and still. HD-DOT provides a compelling
alternative that overcomes the significant ergonomic limitations of fMRI and silently images brain function with a
wearable cap in a naturalistic setting ideal for studies on awake and engaged infants and toddlers. However,
studies in young children over multiple imaging sessions present significant challenges in optical data registration
and fidelity that motivate a new set of software tools to enable accurate and reliable mapping of brain function.
Here we address these needs by developing novel algorithms for photometric head modeling and data fidelity
management. With these advancements, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal study of brain function and
behavior in toddlers at risk for developing ASD. Specifically, we will measure neural signatures derived from
naturalistic movie viewing, determine the relationship between these signatures and behavioral assays across
development, and investigate how these signatures are affected in toddlers at risk for ASD in a case-control
sample. These data may provide markers to the specific aspects of impaired behavior observed in ASD, namely
affected social communication, receptive and expressive language, motor coordination disruption, and even
restricted and repetitive behaviors. Further, this strategy provides a diversified approach to assessment that will
be applicable across development, and may facilitate identification of common mechanisms by which disparate
genetic pathways to autism result in the broad autistic phenotype."
10773041,"Project Summary: Asthma exacerbations among U.S children result in 640,000 emergency department visits,
280,000 hospitalizations, and 14 million missed school days annually. Type 2 (T2) cytokine-driven
inflammation characterizes the most common asthma endotype in children (T2-high) and is associated with
viral-triggered exacerbation risk. Although treatment of T2-high asthma with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or
biologics reduces exacerbation frequency in many patients, these treatments are suboptimal with millions of
viral-triggered exacerbations annually in the U.S. Furthermore, treatment of T2 inflammation does not alter the
natural history of asthma, and effective treatments for the 30% of children and adults with T2-low asthma are
lacking. Viral infections trigger most exacerbations in asthmatic children, of which human rhinoviruses (HRV)
are the most common. Some have reported deficient type I and III interferon (IFN) responses by asthmatic
AECs and postulated that deficient IFN responses predispose to exacerbations, however, this concept is
controversial as others have not observed deficient IFN responses to viruses by asthmatic AECs. We have
observed that greater AEC IFN expression at baseline or in response to ex vivo viral infection is associated
with lower lung function in asthmatic donors. Furthermore, in a recent longitudinal study of exacerbation-prone
asthmatic children higher baseline epithelial expression of a T2 gene module and lower expression of an IFN
module were associated with a shorter time to viral-triggered exacerbation.
 In our cohort of well characterized asthmatic children, from whom we obtain bronchial AECs and conduct
mechanistic ex vivo experiments using organotypic models, we have observed marked heterogeneity in IFN
I/III responses to HRV and RSV infection, with greater HRV replication in AECs from exacerbation-prone
asthmatics. We recently observed greater production of the T2 alarmins TSLP and IL-33 by asthmatic AECs
with the lowest IFNλ responses to HRV, while AECs with the greatest IFNλ responses also had the greatest
production of T2-low/NLRP3 inflammasome-associated cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. These observations,
inform our global hypotheses that the magnitude and kinetics of AEC IFN responses to HRV influence T2-high
and T2-low asthma endotypes, with moderate self-limited IFN responses essential to limit viral replication,
reduce exacerbation risk, and dampen T2 inflammation, while exaggerated IFN responses enhance the
NLRP3 inflammasome and production of T2-low cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), neutrophilic and inflammation,
airway remodeling, and lung function decline. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common polymorphism in
the viral sensor IFIH1/MDA5 (rs1990760), recently associated with asthma, contributes to dysregulated AEC
IFN responses to HRV. Finally, we will use a humanized mouse expressing hICAM1 to allow HRV-A infection,
in the context of differential MDA5 function, to test in vivo the role of these pathways in HRV-A infection, T2-
high vs. T2-low airway inflammation, exacerbation, and airway remodeling."
10773045,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Urinary incontinence affects more than 18 million U.S. women and is associated with healthcare costs in
excess of $18 billion annually, with increasing prevalence as our population ages. Incontinence limits quality of
life and increases the risk of depression, falls, and institutionalization. Effective non-surgical solutions exist, but
only half of women with incontinence discuss their symptoms with a healthcare provider. Primary care
providers recognize the importance of diagnosing and treating incontinence but remain overburdened by
increasing and overwhelming competing priorities, and thus incontinence remains underdiagnosed and
undertreated. We will test two implementation strategies to help primary care clinics incorporate screening and
treatment of urinary incontinence: Ask (screen); Advise (educate that incontinence is common and treatable);
and Assist (offer evidence-based treatment), called UI-Assist. Recognizing that effective partnerships between
primary care and public health agencies improve health and decrease burden when implemented successfully,
we hypothesize that an implementation strategy that supplements streamlined practice facilitation with
partnership building (engaging community resources, building coalitions, providing ongoing consultation, and
creating an online learning community) will overcome known barriers to intervention implementation, resulting
in broader reach and ultimately larger impact. We have engaged partners at the local, state, and national levels
whose missions align with the proposed work and supporting primary care to improve treatment of urinary
incontinence, increasing likelihood of sustainability and subsequent scale. We will compare the impact of
streamlined practice facilitation versus streamlined practice facilitation with partnership building. Guided by
Glasgow’s Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, we will
test our hypothesis through a type 3 hybrid cluster randomized trial of 50 primary care practices. We will use a
difference-in-differences analyses that compares the proportion of patients who are (a) screened and (b)
offered treatment for incontinence before and after implementation (Aim 1) by study arm. Using mixed
methods, we will examine the impact of implementation strategy and contextual factors on UI-Assist’s Reach,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (Aim 2) and on patient-reported outcomes (Aim 3), including
symptom improvement, physical and social functioning, psychological symptoms, quality of life, coping
strategies, economic concerns, and adverse events). As the prevalence of urinary incontinence continues to
increase, and as primary care practices face increasing pressure to address more with less time and
resources, scalable interventions and implementation strategies to improve care are urgently needed."

 Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance
and obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling that result in right heart hypertrophy, failure, and premature
death. The underlying mechanisms of vascular remodeling and obliterative vascular lesion formation remain
unclear. Genetic mutations and variants were found in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) and PAH with congenital heart disease. However, the mechanistic role of endothelial SOX17 in regulating
pulmonary vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of PH has not been reported. We hypothesis that endothelial
SOX17 deficiency leading to activation of E2F1 signaling which contributes to endothelial hyperproliferation and
anti-apoptosis in the pathogenesis of PH. We will 1) define the novel role of endothelial SOX17 in the
pathogenesis of PH using multiple transgenic mouse and rat models. 2) delineate the molecular mechanisms
downstream of endothelial SOX17 deficiency in mediating pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH and 3) explore
the translational potential of targeting E2F1 signaling. Completing our proposed study will provide a novel
therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of PH in patients."
10773137,"Abstract:
Increasing threats of nuclear accidents and/or terrorism have triggered an urgent need for the
ability to confirm and quantify absorbed radiation doses in a large population exposed to an
unknown amount of unintended radiation. An effective triage method has the potential to save
thousands of lives. To best utilize the available resources, stepwise triage recommends first
using a point-of-care (POC) test that distinguishes between the non-exposed and the exposed
population, followed by an assessment of those exposed using high throughput quantitative
analysis methods to estimate their absorbed doses of radiation. The ideal POC test will predict
acute and delayed radiation injuries to major organs, like bone marrow. To estimate the
absorbed dose, biodosimetry measures host biological responses to ionizing radiation. The
expression of specific genes alters based on the dose of radiation. Here we use the expression
levels of these radiation-responsive genes as biomarkers of exposure to radiation. Previously,
we used genomic approaches coupled with an in vivo NHP model to identify many radiation
responsive genes and develop a high throughput laboratory test to detect and quantify absorbed
dose of radiation within 7 days of post exposure. A new analysis of these data reveals a subset
of biomarkers that distinguish exposed from non-exposed individuals. Moreover, one of the
hallmarks of radiation exposure is a rapid decay in the total number of lymphocytes. This new
panel of biomarkers can quantitatively predict a significant drop in the lymphocyte count at 7
days post exposure, only 24 hours post exposure. We also have technology for converting our
gene expression assays into a low-cost paper-based POC test, compatible with screening a
large population. By combining our capabilities and currently available biomarkers, we intend to
develop a low-cost POC test that; 1) identifies individuals exposed to unintended radiation; 2)
qualitatively classifies individuals based on their absorbed dose of radiation; 3) predicts the risk
of serious bone marrow injury by calculating their future day 7 lymphocyte counts on day 1. We
will execute our project study plan in three steps. First, we will select the best subset of
biomarkers by analyzing gene expression data sets and curating literature. Second, we will
adapt our paper-based, low-cost, POC test to the critical expression levels of these markers.
Finally, we will validate our test and biomarkers using independent unknown samples."
10773138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly every mammalian cell harbors a timekeeping mechanism, the circadian clock, that drives overt rhythms
in gene expression to coordinate the daily activity of biochemical and metabolic pathways. Consistent with the
large number of biological functions controlled by the circadian clock, disruption of rhythmic gene expression
leads to the development of a wide range of disorders that include metabolic diseases, cardiovascular
disorders and cancer. Moreover, most commonly used drugs in the United States directly target the products of
rhythmically expressed genes. For these reasons, characterizing the mechanisms underlying rhythmic gene
expression is critical to not only understand how clock dysfunction leads to pathological conditions, but also to
optimally time pharmacological treatment. Rhythmic gene expression is thought to be primarily regulated by
the molecular circadian clock found in every mammalian cell. However, increasing evidences from our lab and
others suggest that environmental signals like feeding rhythms generate 24-hour rhythms in gene expression
without involving the circadian clock oscillation. In Preliminary Studies, we show that the amplitude of feeding
rhythms controls the rhythmic expression of more than 2000 genes in mouse liver. Surprisingly, this effect on
gene expression does not seem to directly involve the hepatic circadian clock, which continues to exhibit
normal oscillations in core clock gene expression. Rather, our preliminary data suggest that rhythms in gene
expression rely on the rhythmic activity of the nutrient-sensing kinase mTOR. This proposal builds upon these
new exciting data and the proposed experiments will determine if feeding rhythms regulate rhythmic gene
expression by (1) controlling the rhythmic activity of mTOR signaling pathway, and (2) regulating the rhythmic
activity of metabolic transcription factors. Results from these experiments are expected to uncover novel and
important mechanisms for the regulation of rhythmic gene expression in mammals, and to provide a new
conceptual framework for how biological functions are synchronized to environmental cycles and coordinated
between tissues. They are also anticipated to lead to the development of novel strategies for advancements in
chronotherapy and for the restoration of rhythmic gene expression in humans showing poor circadian rhythms
like shift-workers and elders."

Cachexia is a debilitating syndrome that results in severe, involuntary weight loss due to the depletion of
skeletal muscle mass. This syndrome occurs in a majority of cancers and contributes to approximately a third
of all cancer deaths. Currently, no effective therapy exists to combat this malignant disorder. For pancreatic
cancer the potential benefit for effective cachexia therapies may be even greater than for other cachexia
associated malignancies, since 90% of these patients lose on average 14% of their pre-illness weight, and
cachexia dramatically limits their ability to tolerate surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. New therapies will likely
evolve from an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms leading to muscle wasting. Our recent efforts have
focused on events that occur outside the myofiber in the muscle microenvironment. We showed that circulating
tumor factors induce skeletal muscle damage leading to the activation of NF-kB in muscle progenitor cells that
associated with an engaged regeneration program. However, regeneration is inhibited leading to muscle
atrophy. We now find that NF-kB activation in muscle stem cells also promotes a local muscle inflammation,
characterized by the production of cytokines and chemokines. These signals promote the recruitment of
macrophages expressing M1 inflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory makers. The goal of this application is to
test the hypothesis that NF-kB in muscle progenitor cells regulates this local inflammatory environment that
contributes to muscle atrophy. Towards this goal we seek to perform the following two specific aims: 1)
Determine how NF-kB regulates local muscle inflammation in cancer cachexia; and 2) Elucidate the phenotype
and relevance of macrophages in cancer-induced muscle wasting. Achieving this goal will not only provide
insight into the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of muscle wasting in cancer, but will also broaden an area
of cachexia research that is currently underexplored."
10767936,"Project Summary/Abstract
 All blood cell types are derived from a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) precursor. HSCs must
balance expansion through self-renewing symmetric cell division with differentiation of progeny cells through
asymmetric cell division (ACD) to produce a functional blood system. When ACD is disrupted, profound blood
disorders occur often characterized by disproportionate production of specific blood cell types or uncontrolled
expansion of blood progenitors. The goal of the proposed project is to understand how ACD influences
developmental hematopoiesis and blood cell fate choice. Aim 1 will characterize how ACD occurs by
identifying molecular players using RNAi-based depletion in hematopoietic progenitors and
immunofluorescence techniques. Aim 2 will determine how ACD influences lineage choice during homeostasis
and stress by monitoring blood cell fate upon disruption of ACD during homeostasis and after stressors such
as oxygen deprivation or injury. Ultimately, these experiments will help elucidate a spatial and mechanistic
model for ACD in hematopoiesis while establishing a Drosophila model that will help accelerate advancements
in mammalian ACD hematopoiesis work.
 My career goal is to become a successful independent researcher at a top-tier academic institution. I
aim to lead a research program that investigates how extrinsic cues from the niche and microenvironment
influence cell polarity and cell division to impact HSC self-renewal and blood cell lineage choice. To achieve
these goals, I will utilize techniques and training in basic cell biology and cytoskeleton research combined with
genetic dissection of hematopoiesis and advanced imaging techniques. I will pursue the proposed training
under the mentorship of Dr. Utpal Banerjee who has extensive experience using genetic techniques to dissect
the molecular underpinnings of hematopoiesis using Drosophila as a model system. Additionally, my advisory
committee will provide key support and resources to help me translate my findings to mammalian systems and
develop cutting edge imaging techniques to monitor the blood system in real-time during homeostasis and
stress. I will present my work and disseminate my findings at national and international conferences to help
advance my research, build collaborations, and establish myself in the hematopoiesis field. This project will
facilitate my transition to an independent research position by helping me establish the feasibility of using
Drosophila to study ACD during hematopoiesis and a foundation of preliminary work to build upon. UCLA is an
excellent place to pursue this work as it provides a rich landscape of resources, research collaborations, and
professional development opportunities to help me advance my career. As a junior faculty, I will take part in
training activities focused on leadership skills, grant writing, publishing in high impact journals, laboratory
management, and mentoring to help me develop the skills needed to run a successful research team."

The prevalence of obesity among US Veterans is high and associated with a substantial healthcare burden.
The US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) estimated 78% of Veterans are obese or overweight, which is
much higher than the estimated 35% of the non-Veteran US adult population. Bariatric surgery is currently the
most effective treatment for sustained weight loss. Bariatric surgery interventions, such as Vertical Sleeve
Gastrectomy (VSG), also improve glycemic control and other comorbidities in patients more effectively than
conventional weight loss therapies. However, with the rising use of bariatric surgery, there is also greater
awareness of its complications, such as the development of osteopenia (loss in bone mass) and liver disease
for a subset of patients. Preliminary data from our rodent model of VSG led us to hypothesize the gut hormone
Fibroblast-Growth Factor 15/19 (FGF15/19, mouse/human ortholog) as a potent mediator for VSG effects.
FGF15/19 is expressed in ileal enterocytes of the small intestine and is released postprandially in response to
bile acid absorption. Plasma FGF19 levels in humans and ileal FGF15 expression in mice greatly increased
after VSG. We sought to test whether FGF15 is also required for the effects of VSG using our novel inducible
intestine-specific FGF15 (FGF15INT-KO) mouse model. To our surprise, FGF15INT-KO VSG mice develop bone
and muscle loss after VSG. Additionally, FGF15INT-KO mice do not show improved glucose tolerance and have
increased hepatic cholesterol after VSG. The lack of FGF15 after VSG also results in markedly elevated
plasma bile acid levels, including significant increase in toxic hydrophobic bile acids. Thus, our data suggest
that increased FGF15 is essential to limit the deleterious effects of VSG by keeping bile acids within a
physiologically healthy range. The overall goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that FGF15 is a critical
regulator of enterohepatic circulation that impacts lean muscle and bone mass, hepatic lipids and glucose
metabolism after VSG. These studies propose a novel mechanism for regulating bile acid signaling in patients
who have undergone VSG and develop bone and muscle loss and liver damage. Understanding the etiology of
these complications and developing potential treatment options will improve care for VSG patients.
Dr. Bozadjieva Kramer is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Surgery at the University of
Michigan. She has extensive experience working with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of obesity and type 2
diabetes. Dr. Randy Seeley and Dr. Robert O’Rourke at the University of Michigan will provide primary basic
science and clinical science mentorship, respectively, during the award. The career development activities will
take advantage of the exceptional research environment and resources at the University of Michigan and Ann
Arbor VA Medical Center. Dr. Bozadjieva Kramer’s career and research development will also be facilitated by
highly motivated Mentoring Committee, which includes Drs. Amy Rothberg, Ormond A. MacDougald, Charles
F. Burant and Rohit Kohli.
Dr. Bozadjieva Kramer will use various training activities to strengthen her experience, knowledge, and skills in
several areas, including technical and conceptual knowledge in clinical research and metabolomics, research
skills in rodent models of bariatric surgery, enterohepatic physiology, leadership, lab management, effective
communication, and mentoring young scientists. The training and knowledge from execution of this proposal
will lay the foundation for Dr. Bozadjieva Kramer’s future research directions in dissecting the role of
enterohepatic axis in the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery, as well as providing training for starting her own
independent research program."
10768692,"Commonly diagnosed among male US Veterans of advancing age and with prior history of cigarette smoking,
emphysema is a chronic lung disease in which loss of the alveolar-capillary gas exchange units ultimately leads
to end-stage respiratory insufficiency. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying lung function impairment
in emphysema and developing strategies to mitigate its development remains at the forefront of research into
US Veteran’s health.
Emphysema is associated with alveolar septal thinning, loss of extracellular matrix (ECM), especially elastin and
collagen, and alveolar simplification due to loss of alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. While
considerable attention has been focused on understanding how cigarette smoke (CS) exposure adversely
impacts alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells, little is known about its effect on alveolar septal fibroblasts,
which provide essential trophic and structural support to the alveolar epithelium. Using 2 validated mouse models
of emphysema, we have observed that PDGFRα+ alveolar fibroblasts are eliminated from alveolar walls and
septa prior to the pathologic development of airspace enlargement, raising the question of whether this event
may play a causal and previously unexplored role in emphysema. Therefore, the goal of this VA Merit Award
application is to test the hypothesis that emphysema is initiated by programmed cell death and loss of alveolar
fibroblasts, which in turn leads to loss of trophic support to the alveolar epithelium. Through the use of genetic
cell ablation and gain- and loss-of-function approaches in mice, we propose testing this hypothesis with three
Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that alveolar wall and septal fibroblast programmed cell death
precedes the development of emphysema and leads to disrupted crosstalk with, and support to, alveolar
epithelial cells. This hypothesis will be tested by investigating which alveolar fibroblast subsets are lost during
emphysema development, when they are lost, the type of programmed cell death that occurs, and how their loss
functionally affects alveolar epithelial cells. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that loss of alveolar fibroblasts is
sufficient to initiate the development of emphysema. This hypothesis will be tested using a conditional fibroblast
ablation strategy followed by assessment of the rate of alveolar epithelial cell loss and emphysema development.
The role of loss of specific alveolar fibroblast subsets in emphysema development will subsequently be
determined by conditionally ablating defined lung fibroblast subsets. Lastly, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
preventing alveolar fibroblast programmed cell death will maintain alveolar structural support and prevent
emphysema development. This hypothesis will be tested in two phases. First, we will investigate the mechanisms
of programmed cell death, with a focus on apoptosis and necroptosis. Second, based on this information, we will
conditionally express the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2, or functionally inactivate the necroptosis pathway by
conditional RIPK3 or MLKL inactivation, in defined alveolar fibroblast subsets and determine the ability of the
mice to respond to cigarette smoke induced airspace enlargement. Although alveolar septal fibroblasts have
long been known to be positioned adjacent to, and in intimate contact with the alveolar epithelium, remarkably
little is known about how early fibroblast programmed cell death and functional loss may be necessary and/or
sufficient to promote the development of emphysema. The proposed studies will address this key knowledge
gap. Additionally, identifying methods to prevent alveolar fibroblast loss could lead to new opportunities to target
this process as a strategy to prevent emphysema development."
10768694,"Aging-related skeletal degeneration is associated with changes in bone microarchitecture, loss of
bone mineral density (BMD), increased susceptibility to fracture, and delayed bone healing. A key
factor in these degenerative changes is the formation of osteoprogenitors (i.e. mesenchymal stem
cells [MSCs]), which decreases with aging and are regulated by cues in the local bone marrow
(BM) microenvironment (niche). To date, the specific changes that occur in the BM niche during
aging are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, Dr. Xiao-Dong Chen's lab developed a
culture system that reproduces the BM-MSC niche ex vivo, used in this project to compare the
growth factor responsiveness of MSCs cultured on ECMs produced by BM stromal cells from
“young” (≤25 y/o) and “old” (≥60 y/o) donors. MSCs on “old” ECM displayed less BMP-2
responsiveness compared to cells on “young” ECM. Recent preliminary data showed that
Cyr61/CCN1, a matricellular protein involved in regulating osteogenesis, was deficient in “old”
compared to “young” ECM and knock-down of Cyr61 in young ECM abrogated BMP-2
responsiveness, confirming the importance of this protein in osteogenesis. Further, treating old
BM stromal cells with adenovirus containing the Cyr61 gene prior to ECM synthesis restored MSC
responsiveness to BMP-2 and studies by Zhao et al (2018) using Cyr61 KO mice (i.e. Cyr61 KO
[yKO]) driven by osterix (Osx) showed that KO mice had reduced BMD relative to wild type (WT).
These findings lead to the hypothesis that aging-related bone degeneration is at least partially
related to depletion of Cyr61 in bone ECM, which negatively impacts the BM niche and reduces
MSC osteogenesis. In the proposed studies, Aim 1 will assess the impact of Cyr61 depletion on
bone phenotype and BM matrix proteome in 3 mo. old (WT-y), 18 mo. old (WT-o) and 3 mo. old
KO (yKO) mice. The bone matrix of WT-o and yKO mice is expected to contain less Cyr61, exhibit
similar aging proteomes, and reduced BMD as compared to WT-y mice. Aim 2 will assess the
ability of ECMs, produced by BM stromal cells from WT-y, WT-o and yKO mice, to support MSC
growth factor responsiveness to BMP-2 and IGF-1 and osteoblast differentiation. These studies
are expected to show that matrix bound Cyr61 determines the ability of an ECM to support MSC
responsiveness to growth factors and osteoblast differentiation. Studies to probe the mechanism
of aging-related changes in Cyr61 are expected to show that higher levels of active YAP [i.e. de-
phosphorylated] in young MSCs promote the expression of Cyr61 and its increased incorporation
into young BM-ECM. In contrast, old MSCs are expected to show lower levels of YAP and reduced
Cyr61 in the ECM. Aim 3 will determine if exogenous rhCyr61 promotes lumbar fusion in WT-o
and yKO mice, either alone or in combination with rhBMP-2. The results are expected to show that
co-administration of rhCyr61 and rhBMP-2 will dramatically improve bone healing, better than
either one alone, especially in WT-o and yKO mice. The results of Aim 3 have high translation
potential as supplementing BMP-2 with Cyr61 will reduce the dose of BMP-2 necessary to achieve
fusion and decrease its side-effects. Overall, the results of this project have the potential to
significantly improve Veteran health care by providing an innovative approach for
regenerating/healing bone under conditions where this is difficult to achieve (i.e. aging-
related diseases and co-morbidities). Moreover, the proposal contains a well-developed plan
for gaining new skills in bone and aging biology, proteomics, bioinformatics, and small animal
surgery and targeted career development to become an independent VA research investigator."

The Partnership Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH) Core will deliver research
education activities in cancer and health disparities and prepare future scientists to contribute to the
diversification of the biomedical research workforce. The REACH Core has demonstrated exceptional success
in training undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from Historically Excluded Communities
(HECs) in previous U54 Partnership funding cycles. Based on its experience implementing a variety of
research education programs such as undergraduate (Cancer Research Internship for NMSU Undergraduates;
CRI-U) and graduate (Cancer Research Internship for NMSU Graduates; CRI-G) research internships,
Graduate Health Disparities Course (University of Washington, School of Public Health), and the Health
Disparities Field Experience (renamed the Health Equity Field Experience in the U54-IV), the Partnership will
implement integrated biomedical research education programs with an emphasis on cancer and/or health
disparities research, across a spectrum of academic levels to diversify the scientific workforce contributing to
biomedical and population health research. The Partnership will also provide concurrent and on-going support
for academic and professional goal attainment among all its participants. Formative assessments to measure
strengths and inform areas for improvement of research education activities will be carried out with the
Planning & Evaluation Core. The Partnership will continue to use long-term tracking tools to offer sustained
support to participants and evaluate impact and effectiveness of activities. In response to past program
evaluation and recommendations from the Internal Advisory Committee and external Program Steering
Committee, a portfolio of activities is proposed that prioritize the current needs to promote and heighten cancer
research education that is focused on undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions.
The REACH Core will implement education programs across academic levels and disciplines; provide support
for trainees’ goal attainment that identifies individual-specific needs and interests, opportunities as well as
potential barriers to career advancement; design experiences for trainees that create a sense of community
and belonging both within the Partnership and more broadly in the larger scientific community, and; conduct
assessments of research education activities’ effectiveness, including long-term tracking, to identify
opportunities for innovation and needs for improvement while meeting the diverse needs of participants. These
activities will contribute to the Partnership’s Aims of diversifying the biomedical workforce, creating a more
inclusive and affirmative research environment and enhancing cancer health equity."

The Outreach Core is based on the premise that the US-Mexico border and Indian Country in the
northwestern regions of New Mexico (NM), as well as the Central region of Washington State (WA) are largely
rural and medically underserved areas where inequities are severe, especially among Hispanic/Latinx,
American Indian (AI), and LGBTQAI+ populations. These geographical areas are the foci of the Outreach
Core’s work. Long term, the Partnership aspires to increase the health equity in these regions. To do so, the
Specific Aims are: 1) To integrate community engagement activities and practices within the Partnership for
Advancing Cancer Research (PACR); 2) To increase capacity for community-academic partnerships to
successfully use community-based participatory research (CBPR); and 3) To build on and use evidence-based
programs (EBPs) to promote cancer equity in Latinx, AI, and LGBTQIA+ populations. The Outreach Core was
very successful in the U54-III, reaching 4,631 individuals in NM and 3,287 in WA. Since the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in-person cancer prevention education and other Outreach Core activities were adapted
to online platforms in English and Spanish. At the request of the Community Action Boards (CABs), information
on COVID-19 and vaccination was disseminated through social media with positive results. For this U54-IV, we
will follow the Partnership Guiding Principles of 1) restructuring scientific environments; 2) restructuring scientific
processes; and 3) restructuring scientific engagement, and will work collaboratively with our CABs to foster mutual
understanding of the Partnership and the community organizations represented by the CABs to ensure that NMSU
and Fred Hutch equitably engage communities in all the activities. CAB discussions about the various Research
Projects and Cores will be initiated as well as bi-directional discussions on community-based participatory
research (CBPR). The Partnership will also endeavor to establish community organization expertise in research
initiatives by providing training and education in research. The expected end result will be community-oriented
Pilot and Pre-Pilot projects funded by the Partnership. Five modules fostering inclusion of community members in
research practices will provide opportunities for historically marginalized communities to voice their strengths and
ways of knowing through collaborative experiences. Finally, the Outreach Core will continue to collaborate with the
CABs and communities on evidence-based programs such as Screen-to-Save (a colorectal cancer screening
program), Yéego (a Navajo healthy eating project), e-Learning by the Cooperative Extension Services (on healthy
lifestyle behaviors), and Cancer 101 (a series on cancer causes, prevention and detection). The Planning &

10756479,"Project Summary: Organelle size control is a fundamental cell biological problem, and nuclear size is often
inappropriately enlarged in cancer cells in a ploidy-independent manner, a change used by pathologists in
cancer diagnosis and staging. It is not known if nuclear size changes in cancer are a cause or consequence of
disease due to a gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate nuclear size. My lab addresses
fundamental questions about nuclear size regulation using biochemically tractable cytoplasmic extracts that
reconstitute nuclear assembly and Xenopus embryos that allow for in vivo functional testing. (1) What
mechanisms control nuclear size? Recent progress from my lab has revealed how nuclear import and nuclear
lamins contribute to the regulation of nuclear size. To complement candidate approaches to identifying nuclear
size effectors, an imaging-based RNAi screen was performed. Results from this screen will be used to dissect
novel mechanisms of nuclear size control using Xenopus egg extracts and embryos, focusing on hits enriched
in the screen: nuclear structural proteins, regulators of histone and DNA methylation, and vesicular transport
proteins. (2) How does cytoplasmic volume influence nuclear size? Using microfluidic-based technologies to
encapsulate Xenopus extract in droplets of defined size and shape, my lab recently demonstrated that limiting
amounts of a histone chaperone contribute to developmental regulation of nuclear size. (3) What are the
physical forces that drive nuclear growth? Having identified multiple regulators of chromatin structure as
nuclear size effectors, we hypothesize that intranuclear pushing forces applied to the nuclear envelope allow
for protein incorporation into the nuclear lamina, thereby promoting nuclear growth. Using a variety of in vitro
approaches, we will test the relative contributions of chromatin structure and nuclear f-actin to nuclear growth
and whether intranuclear pushing forces are sufficient to drive nuclear expansion. (4) Elaborating on the
microfluidic extract encapsulation approach, we will introduce f-actin, natural cell cycling, and modifications to
the droplet cortex. This bottom-up approach to generating synthetic cells with increasingly complex and native
attributes will allow us to address questions at the intersection of size control, cytoskeletal organization, and
cell cycle timing. (5) How is nuclear size regulated during development and differentiation? To extend our work
on Xenopus development to mammalian cells, we have initiated studies with human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs). We find that nuclear morphology and lamin dynamics change significantly during iPSC
differentiation, and we will investigate the underlying mechanisms using information gained from the Xenopus
system. Our work is bolstered by ongoing productive collaborations that employ diverse interdisciplinary
techniques including high-resolution microscopy, RNAi screening, microfluidics, proteomics, and RNA
sequencing. Ultimately, the mechanistic information gained from this work will enable experiments to address
how nuclear size impacts cell and nuclear function in the context of development, differentiation, and cancer."

The overall goal of this renewal application for a MidCareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is
to enable the candidate to continue to expand her research and mentoring programs in sarcoidosis patient-
oriented research. This award will allow her to continue to devote significant protected time to the professional
development of her current mentees with a focus on successful transition to scientific independence. During the
prior award period, the candidate and her mentees identified a crucial role for the Programmed Death-1/STAT3
signaling pathway in Th17 cells to pulmonary sarcoidosis progression. Now this team provides compelling
preliminary data that metformin reduces the percentage of sarcoidosis PD-1+CD4+ T cells in vitro, and that this
reduction is associated with reduced human lung fibroblast (HLF) collagen production. In this renewal
application, Dr. Drake and her mentees will assess the capacity of oral metformin to alter PD-1 expression on
sarcoidosis CD4+ T cells in vivo, as well as identify relevant mechanisms by which this occurs. The team will
determine the impact of oral metformin on sarcoidosis forced vital capacity (FVC), focus on Th17 cell immuno-
metabolomic alterations, as well as alterations in STAT3 signaling. The two specific aims are as follows: 1) To
assess the in vivo efficacy of oral metformin on reduction of PD-1+CD4+ T cells in sarcoidosis subjects and its
impact on sarcoidosis FVC; 2) To assess if oral metformin has the capacity to reduce HLF collagen production
in sarcoidosis subjects. These translational investigations will lay a firm foundation for a future advanced clinical
investigation of metformin efficacy against pulmonary sarcoidosis progression. The results from the proposed
clinical and mechanistic investigations will be translated into advanced clinical trials, thus providing future
mentees with basic, translational and clinical platforms for their career development."
10894790,"ABSTRACT
Embryos cultured external to the body are exposed to non-physiologic conditions that can impair the health of
the future adult. Moreover, culture stress reduces immediate embryo viability and implantation success,
motivating multiple embryo transfers and leading to high rates of multiple pregnancies. These pregnancies are
risky for fetus and mother and exhibit a high healthcare cost burden. To address this, embryos are screened
based on early-stage morphology to identify the healthiest for transfer, but this approach achieves limited
success and is highly dependent on the individual conducting the test. An accurate and objective screening
method would increase implantation rates and reduce the need for multiple transfers, in addition to yielding
healthier offspring. The objective of this project is to develop a new technology for noninvasive IVF embryo
selection. Dr. Paolo Rinaudo, Co-I on this grant, is a Reproductive Endocrinologist working at the UCSF Center
for Reproductive Health which performs >2000 IVF procedures per year and has commitment to research.
Through experience derived from two decades of work in IVF, he identified that current methods for screening
embryos are inadequate, with the gold standard, morphological selection, achieving a positive predictive value
of just 30%. While an embryo may appear morphologically healthy, it may not be molecularly healthy, which may
affect the long-term development of the fetus. Among his two decades of research on cultured embryos and IVF
is the finding that ex vivo culture can stress embryos and drive Warburg-like metabolism. In addition, culture
stress has now been correlated to long-term negative health outcomes, including abnormal placental
development, metabolic dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetes. Dr. Rinaudo hypothesized that metabolically
active embryos lower their culture droplet pH, similar to how Warburg metabolism acidifies the environment
around cancer cells, thereby affording a simple way to select the best embryos for transfer. His research has
confirmed this, but the technique cannot be translated to practice because there is no effective and reliable pH
measuring method for the culture droplet due to its tiny volume. Armed with this concept, he reached out to Dr.
Adam Abate, a physicist and engineer at UCSF. Dr. Abate is a leader in microfluidics and nanotechnology with
a record of developing and translating health care technologies to practice, having founded multiple companies
commercializing his inventions, including Fluent Biosciences (genomics), Mission Bio (oncology diagnostics) and
Scribe (cell & gene therapy). Together, Drs. Rinaudo and Abate have designed a novel hydrogel biosensor that
non-invasively measures culture droplet pH. Being an IVF clinician, Dr. Rinaudo is aware of the regulatory and
practical constraints of IVF operations and thus ensured the design is feasible for this setting by making it simple,
non-invasive, and cost-effective. This grant will develop the technology and validate its efficacy in a mouse model
of IVF, providing critical data for a follow-on R01. The project is thus based on a rigorous scientific foundation,
decades of clinical experience, and comprises a team capable of translating science discoveries to the clinic."

Our interdisciplinary training program, based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch),
focuses on Infectious Diseases in the Immunocompromised Host. Our objective is to recruit and train
outstanding physician-scientists and postdoctoral PhD scientists to perform basic, translational and clinical
research, using state-of-the-art methods and analytical techniques. Our overarching goal is to train the next
generation of leaders in the field, who will use their expertise to advance our understanding of infectious
disease biology and pathogenesis, and to develop novel strategies to prevent, treat and control infectious
diseases in high-risk immunocompromised patients. There is increasing demand for research training in this
field: infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality for immunocompromised hosts, and millions
are at risk or affected by established pathogens and emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The
population of immunocompromised individuals in the United States continues to grow, driven by advances in
transplantation techniques and cancer treatments, increased survival of these patients, and the development of
novel drugs and biological agents to treat autoimmune diseases. As part of an NCI-designated cancer
consortium whose renowned faculty have contributed landmark advances in the field of infectious diseases of
the immunocompromised host for the past 40 years, and whose expertise collectively encompass all facets of
this field, Fred Hutch is uniquely positioned to successfully lead this training program. In partnership with the
University of Washington (UW), the Infectious Disease Sciences Program of Fred Hutch has an excellent,
multi-decade track record of training physician-scientists and postdoctoral PhD scientists who launch
independent research careers in academia, government research, or industry leadership positions. Our funded
T32 grant has allowed us to expand our training program and solidify funding for trainees in this specialized
area of infectious diseases. We seek to maintain this high standard of training; the T32 will support 2 new,
qualified trainees (MDs and/or PhDs) per year, for 3 years of training each. T32 trainees pursue one of three
consolidated research tracks that represent the unique strengths of our immunocompromised host program
and its mentors: 1) Clinical Research, Infection Prevention, and Stewardship; 2) Immunology/Immunogenetics;
and 3) Microbiome and Pathogenesis. These tracks provide training in unique aspects of this field and will
assure that trainees develop expertise in epidemiology, diagnosis, management and host-pathogen
interactions. All trainees participate in a rigorous core curriculum consisting of courses, lectures, retreats,
research and targeted career development activities; trainees also have the opportunity to complete a master’s
degree at UW. Our training program helps to address the national need for researchers that focus their clinical
and/or laboratory investigation on Infectious Diseases in the Immunocompromised Host, and provides those
trainees with the skills and expertise to successfully transition into independent research careers."

There are approximately 250,000 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures performed annually to treat
coronary heart disease (CHD) with graft failure rates reported to be as high as 42.8%. A major cause of graft
failure in CABG has been attributed to graft compliance mismatch leading to subsequent intimal hyperplasia
and graft thrombosis. The development of a compliance matched functional small diameter vascular graft will
therefore significantly improve the treatment of those with CHD. Tissue engineering has shown promise in
achieving some but not all of the required characteristics for a functional tissue engineered vascular graft
(TEVG). A particularly challenging aspect in the development of a functional TEVG is the design of a fully
biodegradable biopolymer graft that can be tuned to a desired compliance pre-implantation and subsequently
maintain its compliance as it degrades and remodels in-vivo. As such there is a critical need to develop a
compliance matched TEVG that remains compliance matched throughout the host remodeling process while
also maintaining a functional endothelium. To meet this need we will develop and functionally assess a
tropoelastin layered and endothelialized TEVG that is and remains compliance matched. We will utilize
computational simulation to optimize the compliance of a biodegradable gelatin/tropoelastin layered TEVG that
elutes TGFb2 in a controlled manner to promote early cell infiltration and late matrix deposition in our graft,
thus stabilizing its compliance as our graft degrades. The overall working hypothesis of our research is that the
intravital (in-vitro and in-vivo) compliance of our graft can be maintained by temporally controlling TGFb2
elution from a computationally optimized TEVG. We will test this hypothesis by completing the following

The field of immunology has exploded in the past decade, mainly as a result of technical developments enabling
the study of complex organized structures and systems. Translational immunology research is immunological
research that is oriented toward human immune diseases or therapies, ultimately aiming to convert basic
discoveries made in laboratories into improved clinical therapies. Translational immunology encompasses
molecular and animal research that addresses human diseases while emphasizing studies of the human immune
system in an iterative “bench to bedside and back” approach. Because control of immunological processes is
the goal of research in cancer, infectious disease, transplantation and autoimmunity, knowledge gained in one
area is relevant to the other areas of applied immunology, resulting in a need for “horizontal translation” between
disciplines. In order to harness the revolutionary leaps that have been made in our ability to study and control
the human immune system, multidisciplinary training is needed that integrates knowledge from multiple
disciplines at the basic and clinical levels and teaches young scientists how to use and analyze big data obtained
from high throughput platforms such as next generation sequencing, proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics.
Analyzing these datasets increasingly demands cutting-edge bioinformatics capabilities that must be integrated
into training the next generation of translational immunologists. We are proposing an integrative training program
to meet this need by bringing together 29 established investigators at Columbia University Irving Medical Center
(CUIMC) and offering mentored research opportunities in six complementary fields of immunology: basic
immunology, developmental immunology, immunity to pathogens, tumor immunology, transplantation
 .
immunology and autoimmunity. Cutting-edge research along these themes will be supported by the outstanding
Department of Systems Biology at CUIMC. We believe this comprehensive program will expose trainees to
cutting edge translational immunology research that integrates bioinformatics analyses The ultimate goal of our
program is to provide fellows with the necessary competence to become future leaders in translational
immunology."
10744234,"Acute leukemia, including acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoid leukemia (ALL), is the most common (1 out of 3)
cancer in children and adolescents. Particularly, leukemia caused by chromosome translocations involving
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene accounts for ~75% of leukemia in infants and ~10% in children/adults with
a poor prognosis. Compared to other pediatric ALL with a 5-year survival of ~90%, that for MLL-rearranged
ALL is only ~40%, and for very young infants, the survival is even <20%. MLL-rearranged AML patients have
similarly poor clinical outcomes to other AMLs. Current treatments are conventional chemo-drugs, which kill all
rapidly proliferating cells including normal stem cells in bone marrow and other organs. This causes severe
toxicities, side effects, and even secondary cancer due to mutagenesis. There is therefore a pressing need to
find less toxic drugs targeting MLL-oncogene that drives the malignancy. MLL-oncogene consists of MLL fused
with another gene. AF9 (~30%) and AF4 (35%) are the most frequent fusion partners of MLL. These proteins,
together with DOT1L (a known drug target for the leukemia), associate with each other and constitute the so-
called super elongation complex (SEC), which causes malignant gene expression in leukemia. Previous
studies show the protein-protein interactions between AF9 and AF4 or DOT1L is critical to MLL-leukemia, but
is dispensable in normal cells. This project aims to find and develop the first small-molecule inhibitors that
disrupt the AF9-AF4/DOT1L interaction, which could be novel chemical probes for biological studies of
AF9/SEC, or potential therapeutics for MLL-rearranged leukemia with a low toxicity. The Specific Aim 1 is to
use rational design and medicinal chemistry to find potent, drug-like inhibitors of AF9. Aim 2 is to perform
biochemical, X-ray and NMR structural studies to characterize inhibitor-AF9 interactions. Aim 3 is to perform
cell-based assays to test biological activities of selected potent inhibitors, and Aim 4 is to perform
pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and antitumor activity testing to identify useful chemical probes or potential drug
candidates."
10744237,"Abstract
Pregnancy is often described as a physiologic “stress test” that may uncover latent risk for
hypertension, diabetes and CVD. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, women experience rapid
cardiometabolic changes to support fetal development. While many of these adaptations
normalize soon after delivery, some changes persist, including echocardiographic changes in
cardiac structure and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Whether these
pregnancy-related changes, or alterations in HDL particle structure or function, contribute to
long-term cardiovascular risk is unknown. Parity, or the total number of live births, among post-
menopausal women is also associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease and
alterations in HDL-C levels, HDL structure and function, and cardiac and vascular function.
However, a significant research gap exists in linking observed cardiovascular changes across
pregnancy to the observed associations of parity with cardiovascular health post-menopause.
We will address this gap by leveraging existing data and samples from the NHLBI Growth and
Health Study (NGHS) and conduct a new in-person visit in 350 participants at median age 46,
when the women will be pre- or peri-menopausal. NGHS enrolled 871 girls (50% African-
American and 50% white) in 1987 at age 9 or 10 and examined them up to 17 times, to age 27,
including 7 echocardiograms between ages 20-27, multiple saved samples and reproductive
history questionnaires. This study will conduct detailed lipoprotein sizing and functionality
assessments from stored and new samples and conduct cardiovascular imaging and repeat
echocardiograms at median age 46 to: 1) Determine the specific lipoprotein particle size
distribution and function changes which occur from before to short- and long-term post
pregnancy; 2) Determine whether pregnancy-related cardiac adaptations result in long-term
alterations in cardiac structure and function, thereby increasing CVD risk for women in their
forties; and 3) Test whether parity increases CV risk independently of socioeconomic status
(SES) in African-American and white women. With the completion of our aims, we will have
determined the prospective pathways between pregnancy-related lipoprotein and cardiovascular
changes and pre-menopausal cardiovascular health for women in their forties. Results from our
proposed studies will fill a critical gap in our understanding of how such risks may accumulate
during a woman's reproductive life, as well as how socioeconomic status contributes to parity-
related risk long-term. Women in this study have also been exposed to the obesity epidemic,
lending greater understanding to contemporary reproductive development."

Kinases are fundamentally important enzymes for regulating cell physiology through regulation of proteins and
protein interactions by phosphorylating tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. Kinase dysregulation is often a
contributor to cancer progression, which is why kinase inhibitors are one of the largest classes of FDA-approved
drugs for oncology. However, many challenges still remain in providing precision-based kinase therapy to pa-
tients, such as failure to respond to therapy and the development of resistance to therapy through diverse means.
This project seeks to advance a promising new approach (called KSTAR) for understanding kinase dysregulation
in cancer by inferring the activity of kinases in tumor biopsies, based on their phosphoproteomic proﬁles. KSTAR
is a ﬁrst-in class algorithm that can operate on any type of phosphoproteomic data, not requiring paired quantita-
tive comparison tissues, and is signiﬁcantly more robust than other available approaches. KSTAR was shown to
compliment clinical standard of care by identifying failure to respond to therapy and misclassiﬁcation of patients
as HER2-positive or negative, which departed from HER2-activity. Working with collaborators across a range of
solid cancers, we seek to further KSTAR's ability to help researchers and clinicians better match kinase inhibitor
therapies, based on patient molecular kinase activity proﬁles. Key algorithmic improvements will be performed,
such as: expansion of the approach to cover all human kinases, deconvolution of signaling from immune and
stroma components of a solid tumor biopsies, and increasing speed. This work will advance and harden dissem-
ination of KSTAR across a variety of platforms that will allow maximum ﬂexibility for other programmers, but also
web-based interfaces that require no programming to interact with patient and cell kinase proﬁles."
10745684,"Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The long-term goal of our
research is to develop novel interventions to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC). CRC invasiveness, a
critical adverse step during CRC progression, requires a combination of certain genetic mutations (e.g. APC,
KRAS and Trp53 mutations), which are the key events to drive CRC. However, CRC progression also requires
additional factors which increase aberrant Beta-catenin (B-catenin) activation above levels induced by APC/B-
catenin mutations. Linoleic acid (LA), the most commonly consumed omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in
humans, increases both chemically (AOM)– and APC mutation– induced CRC tumorigenesis in mice.
Nonetheless, human studies have been inconclusive regarding the impact of dietary LA on CRC. Determination
of LA's role in CRC is important because American diets are enriched with LA while expression of the main
metabolizing enzyme for LA,15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15), is lost in human CRC. Recently, we found that 1)
high dietary levels of LA promoted CRC by increasing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) containing LA
(PI3P_LA), which increases LRP5 membranous recycling and subsequently B-catenin activation; 2) ALOX15-
induced conversion of PI3P_LA to PI3P_13-HODE suppresses; LRP5 membranous recycling, B-catenin
activation, CRC stemness and LA promotion of CRC, especially formation of large tumors, associated with CRC
invasiveness; 3) ALOX15 loss of function (LOF) promotes large CRC tumor formation by azoxymethane in
12/15LOX-KO-12LOX (ALOX15-LOF) mice. Whether loss of ALOX15 expression promotes CRC invasiveness
remains unknown. Our preliminary data show that ALOX15-LOF mice increased CRC invasiveness and targeted
APC mutation into Lgr5+ colorectal stem cells induced CRC in the mice, which was blocked by transgenic
ALOX15 expression. We therefore hypothesize that ALOX15 loss of function promotes CRC invasiveness by
increasing PI3P_LA levels, which enhances LRP5 membranous recycling, thus potentiating Wnt/B-catenin
signaling and subsequently stemness. Aim 1 will determine the effects of ALOX15 gain of function and ALOX15
LOF on LRP5, B-catenin activation, CRC stemness and invasiveness using CRC mouse models in which CRC
invasiveness is promoted by either a combination of APC, KRASG12D and Trp53R172H mutations or Trp53R172H
mutation with AOM induced B-catenin and KRAS mutations. Aim 2 will determine the effects of ALOX15 LOF
on PI3P-LA, LRP5, B-catenin activation, stemness and invasiveness in human CRCs and examine the effects
of ALOX15 re-expression via lentivirus Tet-on inducible system in human CRC-derived organoids on
invasiveness in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The proposed studies are expected to provide important mechanistic
insights into whether colonic ALOX15 expression as a host factor affects CRC invasiveness risk especially with
high dietary LA intake. This gained knowledge could inform subjects with colorectal ALOX15 LOF to avoid high
LA intake and spur development of interventions to target ALOX15 for re-expression to prevent invasive CRC."

My long-term career goal is to become an independent leading scholar (with R01 funding) drawing on concepts
and methods to improve prenatal care and maternal outcomes among Black women who are three times more
likely than White women to die from preeclampsia, specifically early onset-preeclampsia (EOP), and other
childbirth-related issues. Specifically, I desire to become a nationally recognized health disparities and
implementation science researcher who: 1) identifies and disseminates implementation strategies to improve
processes of prenatal care and 2) increases the uptake of evidence-based treatment to reduce disparities in
maternal mortality faced by Black women.
Training facilitated by this Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical
Research (K01) will provide me with the protected time to obtain the theoretical knowledge and methodological
skills necessary to achieve my long-term career goal. My training goals will address the following content and
methodological areas: 1) prenatal care treatment for preeclampsia, in general, 2) dissemination and
implementation research, and 3) health disparities research. My mentors and I have developed a three-
pronged strategy to achieve my career goals and ensure that my research training needs are met: 1) a strong,
interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators who will guide my research and career development; 2) an
innovative research project integrated with my training goals that is both scientifically relevant and rigorous in
its design and methods; and 3) a schedule of didactic coursework, workshops, seminars, professional
interactions, and shadowing in prenatal care clinics that build upon the existing resources of the University of
Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.
My proposed research plan seeks to improve the processes of care for Black women by determining the
barriers and facilitators to implementing evidence-based treatments to prevent preeclampsia, specifically EOP.
The study's specific aims are to 1) examine the implementation of evidenced-based treatment with aspirin to
reduce preeclampsia among high-risk women; 2) determine critical facilitators and barriers to aspirin
implementation among providers; and 3) characterize patients' awareness and perceptions of preeclampsia
and the use of aspirin for prevention. The proposed development plan will provide training, mentorship, and
research experience that will strengthen the foundation for my career as an independent investigator
committed to reducing health care disparities and improving birth outcomes for Black women."
10745687,"There are more than a million persons living with HIV in the United States. Despite the effectiveness of
antiretroviral therapy (ART), viral suppression, particularly durable viral suppression, can be difficult to achieve.
Suboptimal ART adherence plays a significant role in unsuccessful viral suppression, which increases the risk
of disease progression, a shortened lifespan, transmission to others, and the development of treatment
resistant strains of HIV. As a result, interventions targeting adherence have been developed. There have been
some signs of success, particularly with more intensive interventions. However, there is a need to develop
efficacious ART adherence interventions that are readily disseminable and make efficient use of available
resources. To that end, PI Ramsey developed and tested an mHealth facilitated ART adherence intervention
that includes a single face-to-face ART adherence session delivered by a health coach, followed by 12 months
of access to an app and health coaching delivered via the app. The app generates a push notification
medication reminder, and adherence data are available to the health coach via a “dashboard,” allowing the
health coach to monitor adherence in real time and provide support. The health coach uses a two-way secure
messaging feature on the app to message participants and to provide support, encouragement, and resources,
including links and attachments, in response to adherence lapses and in response to participant-generated
messages. The combination of a face-to-face intervention component followed by app facilitated health
coaching represents a novel combination that affords participants with a personal connection to a health coach
while minimizing the resources needed to deliver the intervention and maximizing timely responsiveness to
adherence lapses and other participant needs. A preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the
intervention to a control condition in which participants received the single face-to-face ART adherence session
alone. Based on pilot data, the protocol and intervention are highly feasible and acceptable, and results are
consistent with preliminary efficacy of the intervention on objective measures of ART adherence. The proposed
study will expand on this preliminary test of the intervention using a fully powered RCT (n=400) across two
sites (Providence, RI and Atlanta, GA). The long-term goal of this line of research is to disseminate an
efficacious, mHealth facilitated ART adherence intervention that can be readily integrated into clinical care. The
present proposal will examine the impact of the intervention, relative to control, on electronic pillbox ART
adherence and viral load data. In addition, we will explore the role of theoretically supported variables in the
mediation and moderation of intervention effects. Interviews will be conducted at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12
months. A subset of participants will also complete interviews at 18 and 24 months to explore sustained
intervention effects. If found efficacious, the intervention could be broadly integrated into clinical care for HIV,
reducing morbidity and mortality among PLWH in a manner that makes efficient use of available resources."
10745688,"Abstract:
White matter injury is the most common neonatal brain injury leading to poor neurologic outcomes in premature
infants. This injury results in both focal and/or diffuse losses of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the
brain. Hypoxia and inflammation are common and important risk factors within this vulnerable population and
there are no treatment options available. A significant challenge to the development of novel treatment strategies
for brain injury in neonates is the appropriate concern for safety. To de-risk innovative therapeutic development
in this field, we focused on the identification of endogenous signaling molecules present in human maternal
breast milk to further develop into safe and effective therapies for neonates. We identified multiple oxidized
cholesterols (oxysterols) in human maternal breast milk that promote oligodendrocyte fate specification in
postnatal neural stem cell populations via a sonic hedgehog-dependent mechanism. Following neonatal WMI,
systemic administration of breast milk-associated oxysterol reversed the loss of periventricular oligodendrocytes
and rescued associated motor deficits in our neonatal inflammatory WMI mouse model. Our long-term objective
is to develop safe and effective therapy that mitigates the neurologic deficits of neonatal WMI. The objective of
this proposal is to test the efficacy of 20HC therapy in a chronic hypoxia model and determine the molecular
mechanism(s) of induced oligodendrogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that oxysterol therapy will improve
myelination in hypoxia-induced neonatal WMI through stem cell-derived oligodendrogenesis and induced
oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation. The rationale is that determining the efficacy of oxysterol
therapy in animal models of hypoxia will lead to critical development of novel therapies to treat hypoxia-induced
neonatal brain injuries. In Amis 1 & 2 this proposal we will test the efficacy of 20HC therapy in a neonatal mouse
model of chronic hypoxia. Using separate genetic tools, we can determine the cellular behavior of both
endogenous neural stem cells (Aim 1) as well as OPCs (Aim 2) in response to therapy. In our final Aim 3, we
will explore the impact of oxysterol-induced posttranslational protein modifications on Sox10. Sox10 is a critical
transcription factor that regulates oligodendrocyte maturation. Because oxysterols are found in breast milk, this
approach may be further developed into a novel and safe therapeutic strategy to mitigate myelin injuries including
those in the neonatal period. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oxysterol-induced
OPC maturation may support further testing in models of adult myelin disorders including, multiple sclerosis
(MS), traumatic brain injury, and stroke."

scientific collaboration and completing of operational tasks, provides an excellent foundation for increased enrollment
and retention of ECHO participants, including a large proportion of rural and American Indian participants. PASS ECHO
has a specialization in the ECHO Obesity health outcome. The following specific aims relate directly to advancing
collaborative ECHO Cohort science and completing operational tasks relevant for successful participation in the next phase
of ECHO. (SA1) Examine the effects of prenatal allostatic load, and its biomarkers, on childhood obesity and
neurodevelopment. (SA2) Examine the independent and joint effects of prenatal life-style related exposures on child
obesity-related outcomes, and how nutrition may impact these relationships. (SA3) Build upon demonstrated successful
strategies and strong community/participant relationships to implement the ECHO-wide protocol v3.0 with deliberate
efforts to increase participation in American Indian and rural communities."
10756959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overview:
A comprehensive molecular understanding of how mammals ascertain complex traits to adapt to specific
environments remains largely unknown. Here, we will take advantage of comparative and functional genomics
to systematically dissect dietary adaptation in mammals using frugivory as a model. Mammals evolved from a
common dietary ancestor to have an extremely broad range of diets. Amongst these, frugivorous adaptation is
of particular significance, as fruit-eating arose in multiple lineages within primate and bat orders. Frugivorous
adaptation is also of general interest as diets rich in sugar increase risk for diabetes and metabolic disease in
many mammals, including humans. Conversely, frugivorous primates and bats can eat large quantities of
fruit/sugar without apparent disease consequences. Supported by recent advances in genome availability and
genomic technologies, we plan to take a systematic approach to uncover frugivorous molecular factors by: 1)
carrying out comparative genomic analyses of primates and bats to identify sequences that were specifically
accelerated in frugivorous species combined with a wide-range of genomic techniques, including RNA-seq,
ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and combined single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on metabolically pertinent insect and
fruit bat tissues; and 2) functionally validate frugivory-associated sequences using cell-based gene assays,
massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and swapping these sequences into mice. Our work will
comprehensively identify the molecular components leading to frugivory and functionally characterize the
genes, regulatory elements and pathways involved in this complex trait.
Intellectual Merit:
As bats and primates encompass broad dietary ranges, and the evolutionary distances within each order are
sufficiently small, they offer ideal models for comparison within each group and between groups to analyze the
genetic determinants of dietary specializations. In addition, the use of mouse genetic engineering can allow for
functional validation of genetic candidates. We plan to not only identify protein changes that lead to phenotypic
differences but also gene regulatory elements that have been shown to be important drivers of morphological
change and the evolution of new traits. We have all the needed reagents in place to carry out this project,
including necessary bat and primate genomes as well as tissues from both insectivorous and frugivorous bats,
fasted and treated or untreated with fruit, and phenotypically relevant bat and primate cell lines for MPRA.
Importantly, we have all the needed expertise in our lab, routinely carrying out comparative and functional
genomic assays, MPRAs and mouse engineering. With our resources and proficiency, we are in the apt
position to advance understanding of the complex trait that is frugivory and ultimately genotype-phenotype
relationships.
Broader Impacts:
This research will improve genotype-phenotype predictions with regards to diet and environment and genetic
factors elucidated here have the potential to assist therapeutic developments for people with metabolic
diseases like diabetes. Thus, this work will have broad-ranging impacts across disciplines of comparative
biology, gene expression, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, molecular evolution and human disease. We
already have numerous collaborations with several scientists established from this project, which are
discussed in further detail in the project description. PI Ahituv and members of his lab working on this project
will contribute to the design of teaching modules from this work. This includes teaching both at UCSF in
graduate courses and at San Francisco State University (SFSU) both in undergraduate and graduate courses,
where PI Ahituv and his lab members have been actively involved in teaching for years. The lab has also been
enthusiastically expanding outreach through the UCSF Science and Health Education Partnership (SEP),
educating at local public K-12 schools and the Bay Area Science Festival and will use project materials and
findings for these. The Ahituv lab has trained over 30 undergraduate students and 10 high school students,
primarily from ethnic groups lacking sufficient representation in STEM. PI Ahituv will continue to offer
internships for these students to learn the details of genome analysis and manipulation through this project and
encourage careers across the aforementioned disciplines through inclusive mentorship."
10756960,"ABSTRACT
 Excision of introns from precursor messenger RNA by the spliceosome is a critical step in almost all
human gene expression. This process is highly regulated, integrally linked with the transcription of genes and
other processing events, such as polyadenylation and nucleotide modification.
 The mechanism by which the spliceosome recognizes the exact sites for the chemical events and how
the reactions are catalyzed are not well understood. The long-term goals of this project are to understand
interactions and rearrangements between spliceosome components and the RNA ligands that are substrates
for the catalytic reactions. Ample evidence argues for multiple rearrangements of factors and multiple
recognition events at the branch site. Investigation of these events — which are not understood
mechanistically — will elucidate interactions and rearrangements among core components and may serve as a
paradigm for rearrangements in the spliceosome and in other RNP machines. This proposal focuses on
mechanisms by which spliceosomal dynamics impact splicing fidelity.
 The Aims of this project focus on two newly-discovered aspects of the spliceosome and snRNAs:
(1) We will investigate the role of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in spliceosome function. This small molecule
was recently identified unexpectedly by cryo-EM as part of splicing complexes. No biochemistry or genetics
has so far explored its importance. We use mutants in the IP6 biosynthetic pathway to explore its contribution
to splicing and whether inositol polyphosphate (IPP) isoform levels may influence splice events. (2) One hole
in our current understanding of RNA biology is the role of snRNA mutations in disease. Two mutations were
recently described in the 5'-end of U1 snRNA, associated with glioblastoma (GBM) and other cancers. We will
use our in silico snRNA genome to interrogate TCGA whole genome datasets (WGS) and investigate, in
particular, U2 snRNA mutations that we find highly enriched in bladder cancer and bladder cancer organoid
lines."
10755925,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Patients with ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)
experience debilitating symptoms that include angina, dyspnea, and fatigue. Management of INOCA is
challenging, both because there is no option for coronary revascularization to improve symptoms and because
available medications are often insufficient. There are also marked sex and gender-related differences, with
women experiencing more severe symptoms as well as higher prevalence of disease. Millions of patients are
affected by INOCA in the US. While cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has strong potential to improve outcomes in
patients with INOCA, angina patients are rarely referred (~7% overall, likely lower for INOCA). Even when they
are referred, patients face multiple barriers that include long distances to facilities, high out-of-pocket costs,
transportation issues, and competing needs such as work and caregiving responsibilities. These barriers are
consistently higher in women. Given the limitations of traditional CR, there has been a recent proliferation of
mobile health-enabled CR platforms (mHealth-CR) that use portable electronic devices to deliver CR at home.
mHealth-CR seeks to replicate components of traditional CR (e.g., exercise counseling) while adding remote
monitoring technology to quantify physical activity and other metrics. While mHealth-CR programs are now
widely available, to our knowledge they have not yet been tested in patients with INOCA. Given that INOCA is
characterized by worse quality of life than obstructive CAD, higher prevalence in women, and poor correlation
between symptoms and ischemia, the efficacy of mHealth-CR needs to be evaluated before being prescribed
in routine practice. In this context, we designed INOCA-CARE (mHealth-CArdiac REhabilitation for INOCA), a
phase II pragmatic randomized trial of 250 participants at 2 sites with clinical expertise in INOCA (NYU
Langone Health and Emory Healthcare). We anticipate the cohort will be two-thirds female based on
prevalence of INOCA, defined as positive stress test for ischemia and no obstructive coronary disease on
imaging. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to mHealth-CR, delivered over 3 months, or usual care, and will
be followed for 12 months. All analyses will consider sex as a biological variable and gender as a sociocultural
variable in explaining outcomes and engagement given the higher prevalence of INOCA and greater symptom
burden among women. In Aim 1, we will test whether an mHealth-CR intervention improves outcomes at 3
months, including angina-related health status (primary endpoint), overall (1a) and by sex and gender-related
variables (GRV) (1b). In Aim 2, we will evaluate effects of the intervention vs. usual care on physical activity,
general health status, depression (secondary endpoints), overall (2a) and by sex and GRV (2b). We will also
evaluate effects at 6 months and 1 year. In Aim 3, we will characterize engagement with mHealth-CR and
elucidate barriers to participation, overall (3a) and by sex and GRV (3b). The MPIs are physician scientists with
complementary expertise in INOCA and sex differences (Reynolds) and mHealth interventions (Dodson)."
10885146,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transgender women (TGW) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important, under-researched key
population in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, HIV acquisition risk among TGW is 14 times higher than other adults
aged 15-49 years. Intersectional stigma and discrimination (ISD) experienced by TGW at the intersections of
HIV, sexual orientation, gender minority identity and sex work results in poor engagement in care and suboptimal
adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART). Much work remains in
addressing HIV-related ISD and scaling up treatment and prevention coverage for TGW. Two evidence-based
ISD-reduction interventions are available -- (1) Health Policy Plus (HP+) Total Facility Approach (TFA) to Stigma
Reduction (a clinic-level intervention) and (2) HIV Education, Empathy and Empowerment (HIVE3) (an individual-
level intervention) -- but these have not been adapted and implemented for TGW in sub-Saharan Africa. HP+
and HIVE3 are complementary interventions that could be combined to reduce health facility- and individual-level
stigma. However, research is needed to show if the adapted multi-level HP+/HIVE3 intervention, Ssimusango
(means “no self-blame or blaming others” in Luganda), decreases HIV-related stigma and improves HIV
outcomes for TGW. To address these questions, we will conduct a randomized wait-list controlled trial to test the
preliminary effectiveness of Ssimusango on PrEP adherence and viral suppression, compared with standard of
care, using a status-neutral approach i.e., engagement in care regardless of HIV status. We will also use
qualitative methods to assess mechanisms and synergies of intervention delivery. Leveraging the multi-
disciplinary expertise of our multi-national research team, and working at four health facilities in Kampala ranked
lowest on the PEPFAR Uganda stigma scorecard, we propose the following specific aims: (1) adapt the HP+
and HIVE3 stigma-reduction interventions to address ISD for TGW in Uganda (intervention adaptation); (2)
conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial with 120 TGW to pilot test the preliminary
effectiveness of Ssimusango on (a) PrEP adherence and (b) viral suppression (intervention implementation);
and (3) evaluate Ssimusango using qualitative methods and the Intersectionality-Enhanced Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (intervention evaluation). Clinic-level implementation outcomes are
adoption, fidelity, and sustainability assessed using key informant interviews, training attendance sheets,
observation checklists, and rapid feedback surveys. Individual-level outcomes: (1) PrEP adherence at 3 and 6
months post-intervention, measured by urine tenofovir levels (primary outcome) and (2) viral suppression (HIV
RNA <50 copies/mL) and (3) ISD reduction 6 months post-intervention (secondary outcomes). This multi-level
approach to implementing ISD interventions will improve PrEP and ART adherence outcomes among TGW -
“the most vulnerable of the vulnerable” -, build stigma research capacity in Uganda, and generate actionable
data for scale-up and program implementation in Uganda and sub-Saharan Africa."
10768554,"Background / Rationale: VTE (Venous Thromboembolism) is a common and serious cardiovascular disease
with significant mortality and morbidity. Prompt anticoagulation of patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
reduces fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) but does not prevent long-term morbidity of VTE. Post-thrombotic
syndrome occurs in 25-50% of patients with clots in the deep veins of the arms and legs that consists of pain,
swelling, and recurrent skin ulceration. Common risk factors for DVT include cancer, major trauma, surgery,
paralysis, prolonged periods of immobility, and older age. DVT and its complications have increased in the
Veteran population over the last decade. Deployed military personnel are at an increased risk due to prolonged
air and ground transport, dehydration, tobacco use, and extended immobility during hospitalizations for severe
injuries. Thrombus resolution is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of post-thrombotic syndrome since
incomplete thrombus resolution can result in obstruction of flow and loss of venous valve function. Using novel
3D serial measurements of thrombus volume; we demonstrated that DVT patients with similar initial DVTs have
widely varying rates of thrombus resolution over time despite adequate anticoagulation. Longitudinal studies
show that patients with more rapid thrombus resolution have a better prognosis than those patients whose
thrombus resolves much slower. Despite its clinical importance, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved
in DVT are poorly understood, and there currently is no therapy to accelerate this process.
Objectives: Using clinically relevant experimental models of DVT, a comprehensive picture of interconnected
cell-mediated molecular processes that orchestrate a precise inflammatory program is starting to emerge and
forms the foundation for this proposal. Our objectives are to build on our previous VA Merit findings to: 1) define
mechanisms by which plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) deficiency modulates inflammatory leukocytes
to accelerate venous thrombus resolution; 2) test the therapeutic efficacy of blocking the PAI-2 pathway to
accelerate venous thrombus resolution; and 3) determine specific gene signatures for the temporal inflammatory
vascular remodeling events that occur during venous thrombus resolution and evaluate the prognostic value of
candidate biomarkers in patients with evolving and maladaptive thrombus resolution after VTE.
Methods: Studies will utilize genetically deficient mice in experimental models of DVT that accurately mimic
many of the clinical and pathophysiological features observed in human DVT. We will define mechanisms by
which PAI-2 deficiency calibrates immune regulation to accelerate venous thrombus resolution using ex vivo
thrombolysis assays, transmigration assays, and neutrophil adoptive transfer experiments. The translational
potential of suppressing PAI-2 expression or activity to accelerate venous thrombus resolution will be tested in
human cells and in preclinical models. Finally, we will use our well-established clinically relevant mouse models
of DVT resolution to identify gene regulatory signatures/potential biomarkers and then evaluate changes in gene
networks over time in blood from patients with evolving thrombus resolution after VTE.
Findings/Results: Molecular mechanisms that modulate inflammation during venous thrombus resolution in
experimental models and in human patients will be identified and therapies based on these mechanisms tested
in preclinical models.
Status: This is a new project arising from substantial supportive preliminary data from a previous VA Merit
Award.
Impact: New knowledge from these studies regarding the inflammatory signatures in DVT patients may form the
basis for novel therapies for accelerating this process, and in combination with anticoagulants, control excessive
fibrosis, and prevent this disease."
10768555,"Involvement with the criminal justice system, substance use, and infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
are syndemic in the United States. Persons involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system are more likely to use
substances, have comorbid mental health conditions, limited access to health care and health insurance, and
have higher rates of HIV and HCV infection than the general population. Furthermore, incarcerated populations
are also more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities and be economically and educationally disadvantaged.
Research exploring these phenomena is insufficient. To address these disparities and increase the number and
capacity of clinical scientists working with CJ populations, we established The Lifespan/Brown Criminal
Justice Research Program on Substance Use and HIV (referred to as the CJRT) in 2014. Following a
successful initial funding cycle during which we enrolled 22 scholars, we seek renewal funding to sustain this
important and innovative training program. The CJRT program recruits an annual cohort of 4-5 scholars
consisting of exceptionally qualified pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and junior faculty researchers from the United
States. The program is led by an experienced team of investigators from Brown University who collectively have
several decades of experience conducting research among CJ-involved populations within local, national and
international settings; and who have extensive mentoring experience with early career investigators. The mission
of the CJRT program is to prepare scholars for independent NIH-funded clinical research careers focused on
improving health outcomes related to substance use, HIV and HCV infection, and related co-morbidities among
persons who are involved with the CJ system. The CJRT educational program is comprised of didactic education,
mentored research, and experiential learning. CJRT scholars are enrolled for a two-year period and pursue
research at their home institution under the guidance of both local and CJRT mentors. The program has the
following three aims: 1) provide scholars with a solid foundation for clinical research related to CJ populations
that includes skills in research methodology, scientific writing, grant writing, dissemination, and the ethics and
practice of conducting research among vulnerable populations; 2) provide professional mentorship and guidance
to support the career advancement of junior investigators; and 3) provide a mentored research experience
including funds for pilot projects that provides a supportive pathway to research independence. For the next
funding period, the CJRT program will highlight two new areas of training: 1) research related to the opioid crisis
and overdose epidemic, given the public health urgency of this epidemic and direct relevance to CJ-populations;
and 2) implementation science, given the need to effectively roll-out and expand access to evidence-based
interventions for CJ-involved populations. Scientific guidance and program evaluation are strengthened by an
Executive Committee and an External Advisory Committee."
10768556,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Malaria parasites are transmitted by the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Current malaria
control strategies rely extensively on the use of antimalarial drugs as human therapeutics, and on
long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and insecticide indoor residual sprays of house
walls (IRS) to target the Anopheles mosquito. LLINs and IRS play a key role in malaria prevention,
accounting for more than 70% of all cases prevented in the last two decades. However, these
interventions suffer from the alarming spread of insecticide resistance emerging in most Anopheles
populations in sub-Saharan Africa, which threatens their effectiveness. Combined with the emergence of
drug resistance in Plasmodium parasites, these issues stress the need for new tools to prevent malaria
transmission. In a recent study we have built the foundation for a novel malaria control strategy based on
combining antimalarials with mosquito-targeting interventions. Our idea proposes to incorporate antimalarials
on mosquito nets or other surfaces such as walls, so that female Anopheles landing on these surfaces will
uptake the antimalarial compounds via their legs the way they generally uptake insecticides on LLINs or IRS.
As a proof of principle, we coated a glass substrate with the potent antimalarial atovaquone (ATQ), a
cytochrome b inhibitor, and allowed Anopheles gambiae females to rest on this surface for a few minutes
immediately prior to P. falciparum infection. Strikingly, P. falciparum development was completely
abrogated in females exposed to low concentrations of ATQ (EC50 = 1.77 µmol/m2). Parasite
development was also completely aborted when mosquitoes were exposed to ATQ 24 hours prior to or
12 hours post infection, and when ATQ was deposited on a net substrate, demonstrating the broad
potential of this approach. Other cytochrome b inhibitors showed similar effects. In this project, we will
validate the use of antimalarials to kill P. falciparum in the Anopheles female. Specifically, we will: Aim 1)
screen a library of antimalarials to identify additional compounds that kill P. falciparum upon uptake by
the mosquito, in collaboration with Medicine for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Malaria Drug Accelerator
(MalDA) and others; Aim 2) determine the ability of ATQ and hit compounds from our screens to kill drug-
resistant P. falciparum parasites, in collaboration with MalDA and Dyann Wirth at the Harvard Chan
School; and Aim 3) assess whether insecticide resistance mechanisms operating in the mosquito affect
uptake and efficacy of ATQ, in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD,
Burkina Faso) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. By combining compound screens with
laboratory and field analyses, our project will validate the use of compounds with antimalarial activity in the
mosquito vector, aiding in the generation of an innovative malaria control tool."
10767670,"Program Summary
The Harvard Education Program in Cancer Prevention and Control, in its 29th year, is a dynamic
transdisciplinary collaboration that brings together the extensive expertise of the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, and Harvard
Catalyst, o u r Clinical and Translational Science Center. We have trained 126 (61 predoc, 65
postdoc) fellows in transdisciplinary approaches to cancer prevention and control, and over 80% of
trainees hold a research- focused position. In the current cycle, we have met or exceeded all of our
benchmark goals. In this renewal, we are requesting continued support for 4 predoctoral and 4
postdoctoral trainees each year who have an average length of training of 4-5 years and 2 years respectively.
The overall goal of the Program is to train fellows to become the next generation of scientists who are: (1)
knowledgeable about the current state of the science of cancer prevention and control; (2) skilled in
transdisciplinary research; (3) skilled in formulating and writing research proposals and scientific manuscripts
for publication; and (4) anchored in peer and professional networks that support continual professional
development and access to resources to translate their knowledge into new cancer research areas.
Transdisciplinary training is further enhanced by leveraging our transdisciplinary PhD program in Population
Health Sciences that integrates training in five public health disciplines, and by instituting continuing to
enhance our evidence-based approach to mentorship training. We conducted a strategic evaluation of the
program, as it enters its 30th year, and have developed additional activities to address areas for growth. We
will continue our training focus in 4 areas of emphasis: (1) cancer equity; (2) implementation science; (3)
health communication; and (4) global cancer prevention. We also are enhancing our efforts in evidence-
based culturally aware mentorship training. Robust and engaged internal and external advisory
committees, and 33 very strong mentors with extensive research portfolios ensure that the program will
continue to thrive and innovate in cancer prevention training. The maturity of this Program, extensive
resources available through Harvard and synergy across the focal training areas provide an outstanding
platform for training the next generation of cancer prevention scientists."

This project aims to use multiple secondary demographic and health data sets to identify the demographic and
behavioral pathways responsible for increasing rural mortality disadvantages for women. The goal is to first
determine how rural women’s mortality varies across county-level demographic factors and how it has changed
over time in the context of shifting demographic patterns that have brought new residents into rural regions due
to jobs, retirement, or Covid-19 migration. It also aims to understand how rural women’s health lifestyles or
combinations of health behaviors have shifted over time in response to new residents and the relative
consequences of these behaviors on health and mortality. By Identifying how these different compositional and
contextual county-level factors have changed over time across various degrees of rurality, ranging from the
least to most rural counties, we will ultimately identify the risk factors and potential intervention points to
increase the healthy lifespan for rural women."
10769804,"SUMMARY
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent a powerful vaccine approach for the induction of protective immune
responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since this vaccine platform
was approved for human use in 2020 for the first time, little is known about the durability and mechanisms of
induction of the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. In mice, the generation of SARS-
CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) driven by mRNA vaccines is associated with the formation of robust
germinal centers (GCs). GCs are sophisticated processes during which antigen-specific B cells give rise to high-
affinity Ab-secreting cells and memory B cells. The GC reaction is tightly regulated by T follicular helper (Tfh)
cells, which are also efficiently generated during SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In this grant proposal, we
seek to address the following 3 fundamental questions related to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines: 1) How durable
are the GC-derived B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in mice and humans?; 2) What types of
antigen presenting cells (APCs) promote Tfh cell differentiation in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination? And how
do these APCs sense these mRNA vaccines?; and 3) How do SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce GC B cell
responses? Overall, the studies that we propose here will allow us to determine the longevity of GC-derived B
cell responses and to shed light on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines ensure a powerful
elicitation of Tfh and GC B cells. The knowledge acquired here will be important to inform future boosting
strategies for SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, as well as the rational design of next generation vaccines for
difficult-to-neutralize pathogens."
10769840,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in neonatal and neurosurgical care, post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus remains among the
most frequent, severe neurological complications of very preterm birth (gestational age at birth ≤32 weeks) and
now represents the most common cause of pediatric hydrocephalus in North America. It also carries a heavy
neurodevelopmental toll, with cognitive deficits and/or cerebral palsy diagnosed in greater than 75% of affected
children. After the failure of medical approaches to impact its neurological sequelae, recent research has
centered on optimizing neurosurgical treatment of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, with a focus on mitigating
ongoing injury due to progressive ventricular distension, a long-recognized risk factor for poor outcomes. The
objectives of this proposal are to define the pathophysiological effects of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus on
cerebral connectivity and neurological outcomes and, more specifically, to determine how ventricular volume
modifies these relationships. Our Central Hypotheses are that 1) impaired structural and functional connectivity
across key white matter tracts (e.g., corticospinal tracts, optic radiations, corpus callosum) and related functional
networks (e.g., somatomotor, visual, default mode networks) are associated with neurological disability in post-
hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, 2) ventricular distension contributes to post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus-related
connectivity deficits, and 3) these alterations in connectivity improve with neurosurgical ventricular
decompression. Recent advances in MRI now enable characterization of functional and structural connectivity
in the developing brain with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Analysis of these data using the highly
innovative diffusion basis spectrum imaging approach affords unique capabilities to characterize the complex
neuropathological changes underlying these differences in cerebral connectivity. Here, our multidisciplinary team
will employ these state-of-the-art MRI techniques in combination with detailed neurodevelopmental assessments
to study a large cohort (N=180) that includes very preterm infants with and without post-hemorrhagic
hydrocephalus prospectively recruited and followed longitudinally after discharge from the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit. In addition, infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus will undergo neuroimaging studies both
before and after cerebrospinal fluid shunt surgery, characterizing the reversible effects on cerebral connectivity
while also defining the role of ventricle size in its pathology. Application of these cutting-edge MRI acquisition
and analysis approaches enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of post-hemorrhagic
hydrocephalus on the developing brain. Further, we will extend these methods to delineate relationships between
imaging measures and neurodevelopmental outcomes, improving our understanding of the modifiable effects of
this devastating disease. Critically, these results will address long-standing, clinically important questions related
to the care of infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and inform development of innovative assessment
tools to support clinical trials seeking to thwart the developmental disability observed in this high-risk population."
10769842,"Mortality in U.S. pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is improving, resulting in an increased focus on the quality of life of survivors who often have persistent physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments. Mechanically ventilated children in particular experience immobilization and poor nutrient intake, which results in muscle loss during acute illness. Early mobility and optimal nutrition during acute critical illness have been associated with muscle mass preservation and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. These interventions may have the potential to decrease preventable PICU-acquired morbidities. However, the optimal doses and long-term benefits of these interventions have not been shown in randomized studies of critically ill PICU patients. Thus, we will test the first pediatric-specific, interprofessional intervention that integrates high protein and individualized exercise. This intervention was developed by a team of experts in the fields of nutrition, early mobility, rehabilitative exercise, muscle ultrasound (US), and functional outcomes. We propose a 2-center, pilot feasibility, randomized controlled trial (PROXIMUS) with the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the feasibility and safety of a randomized open-label trial comparing high protein combined with individualized exercise vs. standard management during the acute phase of critical illness in children; 2) To determine the impact of high protein and individualized exercise on preservation of muscle mass; and 3) To determine the impact of high protein and individualized exercise on functional status at 1 month and 6 months after randomization. Outcomes: We will assess feasibility with a composite measure that combines predetermined thresholds for screening, enrollment, allocation, and compliance/adherence with significant separation in doses of protein and exercise between the two arms. Safety will be defined as absence of difference in rates of new renal injury and exercise-related adverse events. Preservation of muscle mass will be assessed by percent daily change in US-measured quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (QFMT) during the PICU stay. We will use a validated imaging protocol with high reliability and reproducibility. We will also examine the difference in the normative standard scores (T-scores) between the two arms for the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory – Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) assessment. Other secondary outcomes are Functional Status Scale, PedsQL, and muscle quality by US. We hypothesize that a larger trial will be feasible and safe. Patients randomized to the combined intervention will have lower decline in QFMT and better scores on PEDI-CAT assessment. The PROXIMUS intervention has potential to profoundly change medical care in the PICU and substantially impact public health by improving long-term outcomes for the growing number of pediatric survivors of critical illness"
10770553,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Philadelphia chromosome-like B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is an ALL subtype that
disproportionately affects the Hispanic community and is characterized as having a poor response to therapy,
a high risk of relapse, and a peak onset in adolescents and young adults. While lacking a BCR-ABL fusion,
nearly 65% of Ph-like ALL cases carry a rearrangement in the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) gene,
the most common being a chromosomal translocation with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (CRLF2-IgH)
resulting in overexpression of CRLF2 and low survival. One comparative study found that Ph-like ALL occurred
in 68% of Hispanics versus 23% of Whites and of those, 78% of Hispanics had disease associated with CRLF2
rearrangements compared to 22% of Whites, indicating a clear cancer disparity. The long-term goal is to
develop predictive diagnostics based upon a patient’s genetic background to address cancer disparities. The
overall objectives for this proposal are to leverage genetic and molecular expertise on the etiology of B cell
malignancies to determine the mechanism underlying CRLF2-IgH formation and determine how changing
levels of B cell-specific factors and epigenetic imprinting predispose Hispanics to this translocation and thus
Ph-like ALL. The central hypothesis is that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) leading to CRLF2-IgH
translocations result from a mechanism involving activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and DNA
methylation and that differential regulation of these processes in Hispanics is driving the cancer disparity. The
rationale for this project stems from results showing that CRLF2 DSBs resulting in CRLF2-IgH translocations
are highly enriched in a 311 bp cluster region. DSBs within this cluster occur at motifs recognized by AID and
these motifs contain CpG sequences that are also sites of DNA methylation. Evidence shows that meCT
deamination is more detrimental that CU deamination and more likely to result in DSBs. Determining if
aberrant AID expression and changing DNA methylation patterns account for increased CRLF2-IgH formation
in Hispanics is critical in addressing the Ph-like ALL disparity and will be tested through three specific aims: 1)
Define the molecular mechanism of CRLF2-IgH formation; 2) Determine genetic and epigenetic factors
underlying Ph-like ALL disparities in Hispanics; and 3) Develop a molecular assay to detect CRLF2-IgH
translocations and compare treatment response in Hispanics and non-Hispanics. The innovative aspects of
this work are identification of a 311 bp DSB cluster associated with CRLF2 instability, application of new
molecular and genomic techniques in human cells to address the etiology of Ph-like ALL, and the use of
patient material from the UCI comprehensive cancer center that serves a large Hispanic population. This work
is significant as it will address a major cancer health disparity in the Hispanic community and develops a novel

10977501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Philadelphia chromosome-like B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is an ALL subtype that
disproportionately affects the Hispanic community and is characterized as having a poor response to therapy,
a high risk of relapse, and a peak onset in adolescents and young adults. While lacking a BCR-ABL fusion,
nearly 65% of Ph-like ALL cases carry a rearrangement in the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) gene,
the most common being a chromosomal translocation with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (CRLF2-IgH)
resulting in overexpression of CRLF2 and low survival. One comparative study found that Ph-like ALL occurred
in 68% of Hispanics versus 23% of Whites and of those, 78% of Hispanics had disease associated with CRLF2
rearrangements compared to 22% of Whites, indicating a clear cancer disparity. The long-term goal is to
develop predictive diagnostics based upon a patient’s genetic background to address cancer disparities. The
overall objectives for this proposal are to leverage genetic and molecular expertise on the etiology of B cell
malignancies to determine the mechanism underlying CRLF2-IgH formation and determine how changing
levels of B cell-specific factors and epigenetic imprinting predispose Hispanics to this translocation and thus
Ph-like ALL. The central hypothesis is that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) leading to CRLF2-IgH
translocations result from a mechanism involving activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and DNA
methylation and that differential regulation of these processes in Hispanics is driving the cancer disparity. The
rationale for this project stems from results showing that CRLF2 DSBs resulting in CRLF2-IgH translocations
are highly enriched in a 311 bp cluster region. DSBs within this cluster occur at motifs recognized by AID and
these motifs contain CpG sequences that are also sites of DNA methylation. Evidence shows that meCT
deamination is more detrimental that CU deamination and more likely to result in DSBs. Determining if
aberrant AID expression and changing DNA methylation patterns account for increased CRLF2-IgH formation
in Hispanics is critical in addressing the Ph-like ALL disparity and will be tested through three specific aims: 1)
Define the molecular mechanism of CRLF2-IgH formation; 2) Determine genetic and epigenetic factors
underlying Ph-like ALL disparities in Hispanics; and 3) Develop a molecular assay to detect CRLF2-IgH
translocations and compare treatment response in Hispanics and non-Hispanics. The innovative aspects of
this work are identification of a 311 bp DSB cluster associated with CRLF2 instability, application of new
molecular and genomic techniques in human cells to address the etiology of Ph-like ALL, and the use of
patient material from the UCI comprehensive cancer center that serves a large Hispanic population. This work
is significant as it will address a major cancer health disparity in the Hispanic community and develops a novel

Identifying modifiable prenatal and early life risk factors is crucial for developing strategies to prevent childhood
asthma. While individual birth cohort studies have identified several asthma-related genetic, personal and
environmental risk factors, these studies were mainly limited to homogeneous cohorts and modest sample sizes.
Pooling data from multiple diverse cohorts could address these limitations. Based on the momentum and
accomplishments of collaborative multicenter research in the Children’s Respiratory and Environmental
Workgroup (CREW), we propose establishing a children's allergy and asthma data hub to ensure enduring
access for the scientific community to allergy and asthma birth cohort data. The proposed Children's Allergy and
Asthma Data Repository (CADRE) will leverage hundreds of millions of NIH dollars invested in conducting allergy
and asthma cohort studies by pooling and harmonizing these data for future collaborative studies. We propose
to initiate CADRE using CREW’s existing data set and data-sharing procedures and then expand this critical
resource to invite, facilitate and accommodate broad participation from the scientific community. The CADRE
data repository will invite collaboration and ensure ease of use by providing value-added services to facilitate
data accessibility, usability, harmonization and interpretation. To accomplish these goals, we propose three
specific aims. First, we will expand the CREW repository of birth and infant cohorts’ data focused on identifying
risk factors, clinical phenotypes and natural history of childhood allergic diseases and asthma by collecting more
data from the original cohorts and by recruiting new collaborators and cohorts to contribute data to the repository.
Second, we will develop the CADRE data collaboration platform as a foundation for a national data ecosystem
for secure integrative allergic diseases and asthma research. Third, we will establish the administrative
infrastructure to develop, refine and establish an ethical and compliant data-sharing and governance process for
the acquisition, linkage, usage, and analysis of multidimensional data containing protected health information
(PHI) and secure export non-PHI results to investigative teams. Establishing the CADRE data repository will
preserve, pool, and harmonize the precious and far-reaching data sets of US childhood asthma and allergy
cohorts. CADRE will develop secure procedures to facilitate investigators' access and utilization of these
comprehensive and irreplaceable data for collaborative studies while simultaneously protecting the privacy of
research participants."

Hypertrophy Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent hereditary cardiovascular disease – affecting 1 in
500 individuals. Advanced forms of the disease clinically present with hypercontractility, hypertrophy
(enlargement of the organ and individual cardiomyocytes) and fibrosis. Several single-point mutations in b-
myosin heavy chain (MYH7), Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3), and Troponin (cTn) have been associated
with HCM and increased contractility at the organ level. However, the kinetics at the molecular level remain
unclear, as different sarcomeric protein mutations can result in increased, decreased, or unchanged force
production. A knowledge gap persist in understanding how these altered kinetics at the molecular level lead to
the more advanced hypertrophic phenotype of HCM at the cellular level. Interestingly, the Hippo Pathway has
been demonstrated to be activated during developmental growth, quiescent during cardiac homeostasis, and
reactivated in pathological growth (i.e. HCM). However its involvement in the disease, in particular the initiation
of the hypertrophic phenotype, is poorly understood. Here, we aim to understand whether homeostatic
mechanical signaling through the canonical growth regulator, Hippo-YAP, is altered 1) by changes in the
biomechanics of single HCM mutant cardiomyocytes and 2) by alterations in the mechanical environment. We
propose to use human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) genetically edited to
harbor point mutations associated with HCM, as a reduce ordered model to study the relationship between
mechanical signaling and hypertrophic growth. We will modulate mechanical stresses (i.e. diseased conditions)
in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes by treatment with inotropic drugs and culture in fibrotic-like stiff
conditions and track the resulting signaling events by fluorescently labeling the key regulatory protein of the
Hippo pathway (YAP). To further elucidate the mechanism by which YAP is contributing to the phenotypes of
HCM we have developed a novel optogenetic tool, termed OptoYAP, which provides full temporal and spatial
control of the Hippo pathway. Lastly we aim to understand the mechanism behind the reactivation of YAP in
pathological conditions by perturbing the mechanical signaling by the nucleus. We hypothesize that 1) changes
in force production alter the homeostatic mechano-signaling of the Hippo pathway to initiate cellular
hypertrophy and 2) subsequent changes to the extracellular environment (stiffening) compounds this effect
leading to a feedforward signal progressing the disease phenotypes. 3) pathological YAP signaling is driven by
excessive force transmission by the cytoskeleton resulting in nuclear deformation. Our results will provide
insights into HCM progression and provide a testbed for therapeutic options in treating HCM."

Adipose oxidative metabolism is central to human health. Defects in adipocyte mitochondria are linked to
adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance, whereas lifestyle interventions and pharmacological agents
that promote adipocyte oxidative capacity promote metabolic health and insulin sensitivity. Studies over
several years have identified important regulators of adipocyte oxidative metabolism, such as members
of the PGC-1 coactivator family, and nuclear receptors of the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor) and ERR (Estrogen-related receptor) subfamilies. These transcription factors exert their effects
on gene expression and cellular function by both direct and indirect regulation of hundreds of genes that
coordinately promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Mining of genes regulated by
PGC-1s and ERRs, coupled to bioinformatic approaches to determine associations of PGC-1/ERR
targets with PPAR pathways and metabolism, has led us to identify a new and poorly characterized
protein, Mcrip2, as highly associated with adipocyte oxidative metabolism. The premise of this proposal
is that Mcrip2, a protein of unknown cellular and molecular function, that has not been linked yet to
metabolism or physiology, is induced by PGC-1, PPAR and ERR factors, acts to enhance basal and
adrenergically stimulated expression of oxidative metabolism genes, and is thus a critical element of the
regulatory networks that control adipocyte oxidative metabolism. Interactions of Mcrip2 with proteins
involved in mRNA processing and turnover suggest that Mcrip2 exerts its function by regulating gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level. Notably, we know little about mechanisms controlling post-
transcriptional steps in adipocyte oxidative metabolism pathways. The proposed work will define the role
of Mcrip2 in adipocyte basal oxidative metabolism and adrenergic responses, using gain- and loss-of
function approaches in primary brown and inguinal adipocytes, and delineate the level at which Mcrip2
impacts gene expression. It will also determine the physiologic significance of Mcrip2 for mitochondrial
function and adaptive thermogenesis, using a mouse model. Finally, the studies will elucidate the
mechanism by which Mcrip2 impacts adipocyte biology, by defining Mcrip2 protein domains required for
function and critical Mcrip2 interacting partners in basal and adrenergically stimulated adipocytes. In
sum, the work will give first insights into post-transcriptional regulation of adipocyte oxidative function,
and may suggest new targets and avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases that can benefit from
increases in oxidative capacity, such as obesity and obesity-related diseases."

Management of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires navigation of an
increasingly diverse therapeutic landscape. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) of anti-programmed
cell death 1 (PD1) and its ligand PDL1, in combination with chemotherapy (chemoICI), are standard of care for
metastatic NSCLC and have improved survival in some patients, the majority are subject to treatment-related
toxicity at significant financial burden with little clinical benefit. Radiation therapy can prolong survival in
patients with limited sites of metastatic disease (oligometastatic), or limited sites of progressive disease
(oligoprogression) on systemic therapy, but no consensus exists on which patients and lesions would benefit
from irradiation. Patient selection and treatment adaptation through early response assessment is an unmet
need to increase the effective combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy in
metastatic NSCLC and improve outcomes. Biomarkers are critical to our understanding of complex response
patterns to chemoICI and radiation. In patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC starting chemoICI per
standard of care, we propose to assess and monitor treatment response by combining positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging of macroscopic disease burden and circulating immunologic biomarkers of occult
systemic disease burden in support of precision therapy through the following aims: (1) construct clinical PET
imaging and circulating immunologic biomarker signatures of chemoICI response patterns to risk stratify
patients into (a) early widespread progression, (b) oligoprogression, and (c) responsive disease; (2) construct
clinical PET imaging and circulating immunologic biomarker signatures of oligoprogressive radiation therapy
response patterns to identify patients and lesions that benefit from ablative radiation; and (3) correlate localized
clinical PET imaging and global circulating immunologic biomarkers with survival outcomes.
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans and peripheral blood draws will be performed prior to chemoICI, 3
weeks into chemoICI, and 12 weeks into chemoICI. For patients who develop oligoprogressive disease, we will
acquire FDG PET scans and peripheral blood prior to and 1-month post radiation therapy. We will develop
combined quantitative PET imaging and circulating immunologic biomarker signatures of chemoICI and
radiation response that stratify patients into the following groups: (i) high-risk patients predicted to develop
rapid widespread progressive disease who require aggressive second-line systemic therapy, (ii) moderate-risk
patients predicted to develop oligoprogressive disease who require consolidation radiation to high-risk lesion
targets, (iii) low-risk patients predicted to have durable long-term response to first-line therapy. Successful
completion of this project will support the launch of a clinical trial on biomarker response-adaptive chemoICI
and radiation therapy in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in order to improve cancer control
and survival."

Protective humoral immunity is mediated by both long-lived memory B cells (MBC) and plasma
cells. MBC are uniquely important because they are multipotent and can rapidly diversify their
BCR repertoire compared to both terminally differentiated plasma cells and naïve B cells. MBC
represent a heterogenous population of cells with different subsets primed to either rapidly
generate plasma cells or form secondary germinal centers. Additionally, MBC can arise in
response to a diverse array of stimuli including independently of a germinal center through a
potential extrafollicular pathway. While all MBC seem to have enhanced recall properties, it is
not known how MBC phenotypes are programed in different subsets or what MBC programming
is dependent on GC? Epigenetic mechanisms are heritable programs that act to guide cell fate
decisions and determine potential phenotypes. Given the cell intrinsic nature of MBC
properties, we hypothesize that MBC harbor a distinct epigenetic programming that serves as a
molecular memory of prior states and instructs cell fate decisions and enhanced function during
recall. Recent work from our group has shown that atypical memory B cells, which are
expanded in patients with autoimmune diseases such as Lupus, show an epigenetic signature
of extrafollicular activation pathways. Thus, a full understanding of MBC properties is essential
to design vaccine strategies that maximize MBC potential and develop therapies that target
diseases where MBC are a component. To elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms governing
MBC phenotypes, we propose two aims designed to 1) define the cis-regulatory landscape,
transcription factor networks, and metabolism of influenza specific MBC subsets that are
derived from or independently of a germinal center; and 2) understand how the epigenetic
repressor EZH2 controls the formation of MBC subsets and recall responses. To accomplish
these aims we have established a series epigenetic and transcriptional profiling protocols and
bioinformatic approaches; assembled a series of genetic mouse strains that allow the
conditional deletion of EZH2; and developed an ex vivo MBC assay to fine map the molecular
changes during recall responses. Ultimately our studies will provide an epigenetic road map to
MBC formation and function and a platform that could aid in the manipulation of immune
memory and therapeutic targets for MBC mediated diseases."

 Bone cancer is one of the most common primary malignancies in children and adolescents. Osteosarcoma
comprises almost 60% of the common histological subtypes of bone sarcoma. While the five-year survival rate of
non-metastatic disease hovers at approximately 70%, metastatic disease, most often to the lungs, is associated
with survival rates of 15% to 30%. Despite advances in surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy, lack of
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of osteosarcomagenesis has prevented significant improvement in
the survival of patients over the past 40 years. This malignancy makes osteosarcoma one of the leading causes
of cancer mortality among children and adolescents. Therefore, elucidation of the function of individual
osteosarcoma-associated genes (e.g., RB1 and p53 tumor suppressor genes) to explore the possible pathological
mechanisms involved in osteosarcoma initiation, development and progression is critical for future osteosarcoma
detection and treatment.
 Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is one of the most promising platforms recognized by cancer
researchers. Recently, several groups including us successfully apply patient-derived iPSCs to phenocopy cancer
features, explore disease mechanisms, and screen therapeutic drugs. These findings strongly suggest patient-
derived iPSCs is a feasible system to model and dissect cancer etiology. Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma
(RB), an inherited autosomal dominant cancer disorder caused by germline mutations/deletions in the RB1 tumor
suppressor gene, have increased >400 fold incidence of osteosarcoma, which provides a perfect model system
to study the role of RB1 in osteosarcomagenesis.
 Our preliminary studies revealed that an increase of spliceosome genes in RB iPSC-derived osteoblasts.
These results lead to our central hypothesis that an altered spliceosome function is important for facilitating tumor
initiation and development in RB1-mutant osteosarcoma. Guided by strong preliminary data, we plan to utilize RB
patient-derived iPSC disease model to pursue three Specific Aims to elucidate the pathological mechanisms
involved in RB1-mutant osteosarcoma: (1) To elucidate how loss of RB1 contributes to upregulated spliceosome
gene expression. (2) To evaluate the therapeutic potential of splicing modulators for osteosarcoma treatment. (3)
To define the role of CUL9 in regulating RB1 function.
 Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the osteosarcoma field by characterizing the
essential role of spliceosome in regulating RB1-mutant osteosarcoma development. These studies will also have
potential to uncover novel molecular mechanisms regulating RB1 proteolysis controlled by CUL9 tumor
suppressor. Successful completion of the proposed experiment will add valuable and novel insights to a broad
range of fields including cancer genetics, dysregulation of spliceosome gene expression, and ubiquitin-
proteasome proteolytic pathway, each of which bears potential clinical applications for osteosarcoma treatment."

The  overarching  goal  of  this  project  is  to  better  understand  the  links  between  ASD  genetic  risk,  resulting

behaviors relevant to ASD. In the animal model, we will focus on behaviors that optimize active touch. This is 
approach  is  valid  because  altered  sensory  function,  including  touch,  is  a  core  manifestation  of  ASD  and 
somatomotor brain areas display altered activation in ASD patients. An emerging idea is that altered functioning 
of  sensory  systems  directly  impairs  the  functions  of  other  major  neural  domains,  such  as  cognitive  and  social 
systems. Active touch arises through rapid adaptions in the dynamics of touch organs in response to physical 
contact  with  objects.  This  behavioral  transformation  optimizes  touch-­related  input  into  the  brain  and  is  an 
emergent  behavior  resulting  from  sensorimotor  integration  at  various  levels  in  the  nervous  system.  Therefore, 
we generally hypothesize that genetic variants that cause ASD disrupt key points of functional connectivity within 
the  somatomotor  system,  which  in  turn causes  altered  active touch  behaviors,  leading  to altered  acquisition of 
tactile information. This hypothesis is significant because it could define a neural process (i.e. altered distributed 
functional  connectivity)  that  explains  how  sensory-­guided  adaptive  behaviors  are  impaired  by  genetic  variants 
that cause ASD. Our modeling studies also have the potential to define how altered brain connectivity can disrupt 
relevant  behaviors.  We  will  test  this  hypothesis  in  the  first  aim  by  recording  the  flow  of  information  throughout 
the major areas of the somato-­motor system in a mouse model for a monogenic form of ASD. The proposed in

measure local and long-­range functional connectivity of neurons during distinct behaviors, including during active 
touches of objects. These sophisticated measurements will identify circuits that are functionally impaired during 
ASD-­relevant  behaviors.  The  second  aim  takes  a  distinct,  but  complementary  approach  by  regionally  and 
temporally disrupting expression of the causal ASD gene and then observing the impact of these perturbations 
on behaviors that define etiologically-­relevant active touch. We expect to find that proper expression of the ASD 
gene  is  required  in  developing  somatomotor  cortical  areas  to  promote  normal  active  touch  behaviors.  The 
combined impact of these complementary approaches is that they are expected to define the circuits that cause

 Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and disease and is linked to approximately 20 cancers.
The rate of decline of tobacco use has been lower for marginalized populations compared to more privileged
groups. Most research on tobacco inequities has examined differences based on a single attribute like
race/ethnicity, yet this ignores heterogeneity within groups and how multiple aspects of a person’s identity like
their race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), or gender may interact to shape lived experiences and health
behaviors. Intersectionality posits that interconnections among multiple aspects of identity and their
interaction with social, and contextual factors can contribute to inequities. This framework is useful for shifting
focus from broad sectors of the population to groups with disproportionate health risk. Mobile health
methodology (mHealth), such as AutoSense and ecological momentary assessment (EMA), provide real-time
objective and subjective assessments of how and when emotions and behaviors change depending on time and
context and can inform just-in-time adaptive interventions for populations disproportionately affected by
tobacco use. The objective of this proposal is to advance methodological and content knowledge of the utility
of intersectionality for examining psychosocial, behavioral, and contextual factors that contribute to tobacco
use and cancer inequities. Training goals incorporate tobacco use and health inequities, mHealth
methodology, advanced statistics, and professional development.
The K99 phase will take place at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and focuses on tobacco use and
mechanisms of behavior change (e.g., stress, affect, self-efficacy) in intersectional groups using the existing
EMA and AutoSense data of the primary mentor, Dr. David Wetter, who is an expert in mHealth, health
inequities, and interventions targeting tobacco behavior change. Training with co-mentors Benjamin Haaland
in advanced statistics, Dr. Inbal ‘Billie’ Nahum-Shani in behavioral theory and the development of adaptive
interventions, and Dr. Nicole Else-Quest in quantitative intersectionality research will contribute to training
goals. The R00 phase will consist of a novel intersectionality study using AutoSense and EMA to investigate
the real-time dynamics of intersectional identities with stress, negative affect, self-efficacy, and tobacco use in
real-time. This work is innovative because no studies to-date have examined tobacco use inequities using an
intersectionality framework, nor have any studies combined this framework with the use of cutting-edge
technology like AutoSense and EMA to investigate tobacco use inequities in real-time. This work can directly
inform tailored interventions targeting tobacco use behaviors among populations at specific sociodemographic
intersections that confer inequitable cancer risk and directly addresses the NCI’s mission to conduct and
support cancer research to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives."
10746761,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers
and is the third and soon to be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States. The average life expectancy after diagnosis with metastatic disease is just three to six
months. There obviously is an urgent and unmet need for novel effective therapeutic
approaches, but identifying therapeutic targets that will increase survival rates of PDAC patients
remains one of the greatest challenges in current cancer research. Since nearly 100% of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carried mutational activation of KRAS, KRAS is
theoretically ideal candidate for PDAC therapeutic intervention. But targeting KRAS directly has
been unsuccessful. As a result, there is significant interest in identifying novel downstream
effectors of oncogenic KRAS signaling that could be amenable to pharmacologic intervention.
PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) is a non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, which is
expressed at a very low level in normal pancreas. We found that PYK2 was drastically induced
in mouse PanIN (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, non-invasive precursor lesions of PDAC)
and human PDAC tissues and that PYK2 elevation required KARS and occurred at the
transcriptional level. Functionally, our results showed that whole-body deletion of PYK2, even
heterozygous deletion, remarkably suppressed PanIN formation in the Pdx1-Cre KRASG12D
mouse model. Further, we found that shRNA knockdown of PYK2 abrogated tumor growth in a
PDAC cell line xenograft model, suggesting that PYK2 is required for PDAC maintenance.
Mechanistically, our data revealed that PYK2 regulates two cancer-related pathways: the Wnt/-
catenin pathway and the NF-B pathway, both pathways are known important for PDAC
genesis and progression. Overall, our preliminary results strongly suggested that PYK2 is a new
functionally relevant and druggable target for PDAC. Our central hypothesis of this study is that
PYK2 is a novel downstream effector of mutant KRAS signaling essential for PDAC
carcinogenesis and maintenance and a new actionable target for treating PDAC. We will test our
hypothesis through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will validate the role of PYK2 in mutant
KRAS-driven PDAC carcinogenesis. Aim 2 will unravel how PYK2 is hard-wired among mutant
KRAS-activated signaling networks. Aim 3 will validate PYK2 inhibition as an actionable and
effective approach to treating PDAC in preclinical models of PDAC. Successful completion of the
aims could prove that PYK2-targeted therapy represents an exciting and potentially promising
new approach to treating pancreatic cancer."

also an independent risk factor for CVD. Burnout is associated with 37% increased risk for coronary heart
disease (CHD) events, independent of age, body mass index, smoking, and lipid levels. Proposed physiological
mechanisms for the association of burnout with CVD include autonomic dysregulation and increased blood
pressure. Similarly, recent meta-analyses have shown short sleep (<6 hours) is associated with incident CHD
risk (RR=1.26), likely through similar pathways. Circadian misalignment, another consequence of shift work
common in ED providers, also increases CVD risk.
We will test the influence of ED factors, sleep, and circadian misalignment on ABP (a primary marker of CVD
risk) and burnout in an innovative study design, leveraging our expertise in ED research, behavioral cardiology,
and sleep. We will prospectively follow a cohort of ED physicians and nurses for 3 years, testing the hypothesis
that ED work factors (e.g. ED overcrowding, short sleep, and circadian misalignment due to shift work),
increase burnout and contribute to increased ABP. We will continually capture ED data on patient volume,
acuity, and staffing. Annually, participants will complete a 2-week burst, monitoring sleep duration, circadian
misalignment, and work-related stress. During each burst, we will assess burnout, job strain, and 24-hour ABP.
This design will allow us to: 1) evaluate the short-term contribution of ED crowding, circadian misalignment,
and short sleep to acute changes in ABP and psychological risk 2) characterize the relationship of cumulative
ED stress exposures and sleep impairment to 3-year progression of CVD and psychological risk."

Heterozygous deletion of human Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene results in hereditary neuropathy
with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). HNPP is characterized pathologically by focal myelin thickenings known
as “tomacula” in peripheral nerves. Patients with HNPP typically present with transient focal sensory loss and
muscle weakness that may be evoked by mild mechanical compressions that do not affect healthy humans. Our
preclinical studies testing small molecule compound in HNPP animal model have been shown to arrest disease
pathology. However, translation of this potential therapy to clinical use demand specific validated outcome
measures to monitor the effects of treatment longitudinally in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the goal of this
study is to develop monitoring biomarkers that may serve as either primary or secondary outcome measurements
in HNPP clinical trials. The study will investigate two measures: quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI)
and human skin biopsy. The degree of axonal loss is usually correlated with disease severity in neurological
disorders. Therefore, measures of axonal loss are often reliable biomarkers for disease progression. Traditionally,
pathology in peripheral nerve diseases has been evaluated by sural nerve biopsy, an invasive procedure that
requires surgical removal of the nerve, so sequential sural nerve biopsies are not possible for longitudinal studies.
Human skin biopsies are minimally invasive and can be repeated many times in the same subject. Preliminary
studies have demonstrated that pathologies in dermal axon and myelin can be quantified automatically through
deep learning. This study will use the established deep learning-based model to automate dermal nerve
morphometrics in skin biopsy. On the other hand, using qMRI to assess muscular fat fraction (FF) in legs, a
marker of muscle denervation that indirectly reflects axonal loss, we found that FF is increased in patients with
HNPP. This study will determine whether FF quantified in individual muscle can be used to track progression of
HNPP with better responsiveness. Furthermore, this study will develop a deep learning-based method to
automate the laborious individual muscle FF quantification with qMRI. Although intramuscular fat accumulation
is the end pathology resulting from axonal loss in HNPP, direct assessment of the diseased nerve is still needed.
This study will use the strategically acquired gradient echo (STAGE) imaging technique to quantify peripheral
nerves, including magnetization transfer ratio, proton density, longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation
times. Due to the transient, multi-focal features of clinical presentation in patients with HNPP, existing function
outcome measures, such as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy score or nerve conduction studies, may not
capture those episodes in a timely manner. However, axonal loss accumulated over time determines the final
disabilities in patients with HNPP. Our overall hypothesis is that quantitative data from skin biopsy together with
qMRI can reliably measure axonal loss in patients with HNPP."

Elemental processes occurring at the cellular level underpin embryonic development, the function of tissues and
organ systems, and disease pathogenesis. The mission of the predoctoral T32 Training Program in Cell, Molecular
and Developmental Biology (CMDB) is to provide interdisciplinary training in basic cell, molecular and develop-
mental processes essential for all multicellular organisms. While this is a new application for a predoctoral T32
program, it should be noted there is an existing CMDB T32 program at UAB that has been funded by the NIH since
1984. The new CMDB T32 program, which supplants the existing program, capitalizes on training components that
have been well-vetted for their effectiveness in providing high quality graduate training. However, these impactful
training elements are paired with new training activities designed to meet the ever-changing, and increasingly
competitive, scientific environment and workforce. New programmatic activities include didactic courses and work-
shops focused on basic cell structure, physiology and cell communication, as well as training in cutting edge tech-
nologies, diversity and inclusiveness, and scientific ethics. Additionally, a new Career Development Committee has
been instituted, which provides CMDB appointees with one-on-one career guidance to prepare trainees for a
variety of professional roles. By integrating well-validated training experiences with new activities tailored for the
current scientific milieu, the CMDB program will provide trainees with the tools needed to leverage knowledge of
seminal cellular processes to elucidate the mechanistic basis of disease. There are 6 key components of the CMDB
T32 Training program: (1) evidence-informed didactic curriculum and experiential learning activities; (2) research
mentoring by outstanding faculty preceptors; (3) training in scientific communication; (4) training in diversity, equity
and inclusiveness; (5) instruction in responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility; and (6)
personalized career guidance and networking opportunities. Trainees will be appointed to the CMDB T32 program
in the beginning of their 2nd year of graduate school and support will extend for 2 years. Our goal is to capture
students in the early stages of training in order to foster an interdisciplinary mindset as students advance in their
research projects. We are requesting 10 predoctoral training positions, based on the large gap between the number
of training grant eligible students, and the overall number of predoctoral T32 positions at UAB (an 11th position is
supported by matching funds from the UAB School of Medicine). Further support for 10 positions is provided by
historical data indicating steep competition for the positions on our existing CMDB T32. Importantly, the CMDB T32
program is unique at UAB in that it is the only T32 program that supports predoctoral trainees in basic cell and
molecular biology independent of a disease focus, thus, extending opportunities to high-caliber trainees who would
otherwise be ineligible due to the nature of their research. The overarching goal of the CMDB program is to provide
a dynamic and multidimensional training experience that equips trainees to translate information garnered from
studies of diverse biological systems into biomedical advances that promote human health."

The developing alveolus is lined by two epithelial cell types: thin alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells that provide the gas-
exchange surface, and cuboidal AT2 cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant. During embryonic development
both AT1 and AT2 cells derive from a distal progenitor pool. Alveolar epithelial differentiation is influenced by
multiple molecular signals –– especially FGF–– and recent work suggests that another key driver in late gestation
is mechanical stretch. Questions remain as to how these signals are regulated to precisely time alveolar
differentiation (as both are present at and critical for earlier stages of lung development), and to what extent are
they reactivated in adulthood during regeneration. Recent work in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) points to a
specific cell-intrinsic mechanical property (known to resist cell stretch) that blocks differentiation – cellular
membrane tension (CMT). In ESCs, high CMT represses differentiation by blocking the endocytosis of a FGF
receptor, which modulates its downstream signaling. While upstream FGF signaling was always active in ESCs,
it was the shunting of its downstream signaling that was CMT-dependent and that was critical in timing
differentiation. Could CMT also be involved in the embryonic lung to block alveolar differentiation? Does CMT
re-emerge in the adult lung during alveolar epithelial regeneration? If so, how does it affect activation of
facultative AT2 progenitors? To address these questions, we propose to investigate CMT in both the developing
and adult mouse lung. We hypothesize that alveolar epithelial differentiation is blocked by high CMT, which
regulates downstream signaling via inhibiting endocytosis and resisting stretch. During alveolar regeneration, we
hypothesize that facultative AT2 progenitors are activated by increased CMT that subsequently reduces to direct
AT1 and AT2 differentiation. To answer these questions, we will use a combination of culture and transgenic
mouse experiments wherein measurements will be taken primarily by confocal microscopy. Our preliminary data
indicate that CMT reduces immediately prior to (and is required for) differentiation during development.
Concomitantly, we observe an increase of endocytosis prior to differentiation and that its inhibition also blocks
differentiation in culture. Finally, we developed two approaches to measure mechanical properties of individual
cells within living lung tissue. In doing so, we observed higher CMT in progenitors versus adult AT2 cells, as well
as increased stiffness of AT2 cells relative to neighboring cells in the adult lung. Our approach is innovative, as
neither CMT nor endocytic regulation of FGF has been studied before in the context of lung development and
regeneration. Moreover, we have established two novel approaches to measure mechanics in living lung tissue
with cellular resolution. If successful, we will have established a novel mechanism of cell-intrinsic
mechanoregulation for the lung field which will be informative in understanding pulmonary diseases with aberrant
epithelial differentiation. Further, our findings will guide development of novel diagnostics or therapeutics, either
for direct use in patients or in culture to control stem cell differentiation."

system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning
signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are
essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in
quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic
analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to
meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes
that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across
500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver
behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's
Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized
by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships
between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key
real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging,
MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver
sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship
between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised
machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to
detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our
team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation
engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to
drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65-
90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria
will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility
monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk
for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al
risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances
NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic
care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly
promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages."

Macrophages are critical to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but several distinct macrophage
subpopulations co-exist in the synovium of joints. In steady-state, tissue-resident macrophages contribute to joint
integrity and are required for tissue homeostasis. While increased numbers of macrophages during the
development of arthritis is associated with inflammation and joint damage, depletion of all macrophages delays
resolution in a mouse model of arthritis. Thus, broad targeting of macrophages is unlikely to provide an effective
therapeutic option for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, we propose to characterize the function of synovial
macrophage subpopulations in healthy and inflamed joint to determine how they contribute to the
pathogenesis of arthritis. We and others have identified at least 4 synovial macrophage subpopulations that
differ in their ontogeny and localization within the joint: tissue-resident synovial lining macrophages, tissue-
resident interstitial macrophages, monocyte-derived interstitial macrophages, and infiltrating macrophages.
However, we currently lack specific targets to regulate macrophage function at the molecular level in the context
of developing and relapsing disease. Our prior work demonstrated that macrophage plasticity arises from the
combinatorial action of cell-type-specific and environmentally driven transcription factors (TFs) which poise the
epigenomic landscape for future stimulus response. Accordingly, our preliminary data confirms that murine
synovial macrophage subpopulations exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles associated with different TFs at
steady-state, display varying functions in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, and can be identified among
synovial cells in patients with active RA. We hypothesize that monocyte-macrophage transition is critical
for promoting joint inflammation whereas the adoption of the tissue-resident phenotype is required to
maintain homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of genomics approaches with lineage-
tracing, bone marrow chimeras, and genetic mouse models as well as clinical samples. In Aim 1, we will murine
models to determine the role of monocyte-macrophage transition in promoting joint inflammation. We will
compare the transition over time in the steady-state joint to the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages in the
serum transfer induced arthritis (STIA) model. In Aim 2, we will determine how the maintenance of the tissue-
resident phenotype contributes to joint health using an initial and second challenge model of STIA. We will assess
macrophage heterogeneity in the inflamed joint, the role of specific tissue-resident subpopulations, and
molecular drivers of the tissue-residency. In Aim 3, we will use single-cell approaches on synovial tissue biopsies
to determine whether the composition and transcriptional profile of macrophage subpopulations are associated
with response to treatment in RA patients. Together, these aims will clarify the role of different synovial
macrophage subpopulations in RA. These results will be critical to the development of targeted therapeutic
interventions for RA patients."

Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over
250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and
over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must
make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent.
In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant
candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a
designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown
that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates
than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart
allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who
have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival
benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there
is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to
develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who
gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using
conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques
outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart
Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is
closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My
overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test
this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315
adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based
system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing
conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to
b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My
overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce
medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML,
simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel
heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01-
level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation."
10772347,"The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to illuminate the structure, dynamics and
mechanistic principles that underpin active efflux of solutes, often of impressive size such as
protein domains, across cell membranes. Clinical multidrug resistance (MDR) in the treatment of
bacterial and fungal infections, and chemotherapy of neoplasms can be associated with
overexpression of membrane-embedded efflux pumps, collectively referred to as MDR
transporters, that selectively extrude cytotoxic molecules from the cell. MDR transporters harness
the free energy of ATP hydrolysis or that stored in electrochemical gradients to power a
conformational cycle that drives the energetically uphill vectorial translocation of substrates. The
cycle entails the energy-coupled isomerization of the transporter between multiple intermediates
thereby executing alternating access of the substrate binding site. Defining the structural elements
mediating alternating access and decoding the mechanism of energy conversion in a lipid bilayer
environment are central questions in the field and critical for elucidating transport mechanisms.
This MIRA proposal will continue support of two established, productive research programs
focused on addressing these questions for ATP binding cassette (ABC) and Multidrug and Toxin
Extrusion (MATE) transporters. Our innovative experimental blueprint capitalizes on recent
transformational advances in machine learning protein structure prediction, state of the art
electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR) tools in the context of high resolution cryoEM
structures. Project 1, motivated and grounded in the contribution of the PI’s group, seeks to
decipher ion-substrate coupling, to define conserved and divergent elements of alternating
access, and to reveal specific transporter-lipids interactions that shape the energy landscape of
conformational changes in MATE transporters. Project 2 will expand a long-standing investigation
of energy transduction and alternating access ABC efflux transporters in three archetypes that
represent a spectrum of energy conversion and substrate size. The two projects will illuminate
mechanistic principles for families of transporters implicated in the phenomena of drug resistance
and basic bacterial defense strategies."

10775591,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kidney transplantation is the desired treatment for kidney failure. While short term kidney transplantation
outcomes have improved significantly, long-term outcomes remain suboptimal. Death with functioning graft
from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of graft loss. The annual rate of cardiovascular events in
kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is 50 times higher than that of the general population. Over 30% of KTRs
have pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and around 10-40% will develop posttransplant T2D. T2D magnifies
risk for CVD, graft loss and mortality among KTRs. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are
now standard of care in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several large randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) have established that SGLT2i improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Using single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from kidney biopsies we found that SGLT2i treatment benefits the diabetic
kidney by mitigating diabetes-induced metabolic perturbations via suppression of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) in kidney tubules. Additional preliminary data from our group suggest that
SGLT2i is associated with improved kidney oxygenation by kidney MRI, which may contribute to the beneficial
kidney effects of SGLT2i. These potential mechanisms are particularly promising in KTRs, as our preliminary
studies in KTR biopsies found enrichment for renal metabolism and mTORC1 signaling post-transplantation.
mTORC1 plays a key role in the immune response and graft rejection in KTRs. SGLT2i may have benefits for
KTRs, such as improving graft function and lowering the risk of CVD. However, the potential benefit of
SGLT2is for KTRs has not been explored in RCTs. Accordingly, we propose a 12-month, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind study in 80 adult KTRs with pre-existing T2D or new onset posttransplant
diabetes with eGFR 30-90 ml/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 30-5000 mg/g to
examine the effects and underlying mechanisms of dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular structure and
function. The primary outcomes are change in UACR and establishing safety. In Aim 1, we will assess the
effects and safety of 12 months of dapagliflozin vs. placebo on kidney graft structure and function via kidney
MRI as well as kidney allograft biopsies in a subset of participants (n=40). In Aim 2, we will determine the
effects of 12 months of dapagliflozin vs. placebo on arterial stiffness, cardiac structure and function assessed
by aortic pulse wave velocity and aortic and cardiac MRI. In Aim 3, we will implement state-of-the-art
interrogation of kidney tissue from baseline and 1-year biopsies by integrating scRNA-seq with detailed
morphometry as well as comprehensive clinical phenotyping to investigate the mechanisms of dapagliflozin in
KTRs, and associations of these mechanisms with kidney structure and function. The expected results will
provide critical insight into the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of dapagliflozin in promoting kidney graft
function and cardiovascular health in KTRs."

 Due to the unique property of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to reconstitute the entire blood system of
the organism, these stem cells are utilized clinically to treat blood disorders. The possibility of culturing and
expanding HSCs in vitro would make hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-based therapies more
feasible. However, this has eluded the field for more than three decades, necessitating a closer examination of
the native developmental mechanisms that govern the emergence of HSCs. Many years of investigation have
revealed that HSCs require multiple molecular inputs for proper specification, including activity of the Notch, nitric
oxide (NO), Wnt, FGF, and BMP signaling pathways. In addition, inflammatory signaling (Tnfa, NF-kB, Tlr4,
interferons, Il1b and inflammasome) have been recently reported as a novel group of HSC fate modulators, yet
the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critical to help develop
in vitro protocols for the generation of patient-specific HSCs. The goal of this proposal is to reveal in vivo the
inflammatory network that unlocks HSC specification from the hemogenic endothelium (HE), and its relationship
with the Notch and nitric oxide pathways. To attain this goal, the following three specific aims will be pursued:
(1) Identify the role of Nod1 signaling during HSC development; (2) determine the mechanism of NF-kB-directed
HSC specification; and (3) analyze the impact of the NOD1/RIPK2/NF-kB inflammatory axis on human
pluripotent stem cell-derived definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells.
 Since hematopoietic development is highly conserved between vertebrate species, the zebrafish model
provides a unique opportunity to circumvent the challenges of in utero experimentation, permitting non-invasive
experiments that avoid the artifactual inflammation caused by cellular stress. To achieve this application's goals,
a combination of novel zebrafish reporter and mutant lines, new methods to perform epigenomic and
transcriptomic profiling of the HE by CUT&RUN-sequencing and RNA-sequencing, live imaging of HSC
development by confocal and light-sheet microscopy, qPCR, FACS-sorting, and lineage tracing using Cre-
mediated reporter systems will be utilized. In addition, to translate these in vivo findings to human health, this
proposal will be complemented with a model of hematopoietic differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs). Upon successful completion of the proposed research, a previously undescribed inflammatory pathway
affecting HSC specification will be identified, in addition to the central molecular mechanism by which
inflammatory signaling drives HSC fate and crosstalk to other main HSC inductors. These new findings could
provide key insights needed to instruct HSC fate, informing in vitro approaches to generate HSCs from pluripotent
precursors for the treatment of blood disorders."

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on human chromosome 6p21 is the most medically important region
of the human genome. Over 100 infectious, autoimmune and pharmacological disease phenotypes and cancers
are associated with genetic variation of HLA, and matching of HLA genotypes is required for bone marrow and
solid organ transplantation. HLA molecules have functional interactions with Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like
Receptor (KIR) molecules, also recognized to play critical roles in transplantation and disease. The genes
encoding these molecules are highly polymorphic and display extensive structural variation relative to other
genomic regions. Recognizing the need to consolidate complex data from a broad field, in the prior project
periods we developed a suite of tools and programs for the standardized analysis, collection, exchange and
storage (ACES) of all current and future immunogenomic data. These tools serve to fill gaps in genomic data-
management and analysis tools, which are primarily designed for use with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
and whole-genome and whole-exome sequence (WG/ES) data, and do not support the highly polymorphic
genetic data characterized by the immunogenomic loci and other highly polymorphic genetic systems. Our
standards and tools have been widely adopted by the immunogenomics community, but there remains an urgent
and unmet need for integrated, easy-to use, clinical-grade tools that unify immunogenomic genotype, SNP and
WG/ES data, while anticipating future genomic data formats. In the previous project periods, we have made
substantial progress on the development of these tools and resources, which are designed to maximize the
ongoing utility of immunogenomic data for clinical and basic research science. In the proposed project period,
we will advance the development of these tools, expanding their scope and improving ease of use, centralizing
their availability and enabling interoperability with electronic medical record (EMR) systems, and making them
available adjacent to these highly complex datasets for application in translational medicine. We will expand the
utility of our tools and services to accommodate additional data types and analytical methods, as well as
integrating across methods. Building on our development of an infrastructure to support transmission of HLA
data using HL7 FHIR resources, we will work to incorporate these resources into our data management tools
and pipeline. Finally, we will build on an infrastructure developed to support aggregation and standardized
analysis of HLA data in the context of COVID-19 to support additional data types and disease phenotypes for
immunogenomic disease association studies. By integrating these resources, and other tools and services we
have developed, and empowering them to generate FHIR messages, the products of these immunogenomic
ACES resources can be made available and accessible to researchers and within health systems, improving our
understanding of immunogenomics in human health and facilitating application for translational medicine."
10781896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. The TMPRSS2-ETS
related gene (ERG) fusion (termed T2-ERG), juxtaposing the strong androgen-responsive TMPRSS2 gene
promoter with the coding region of the putative oncogene ERG, occurs in approximately 50% of all PCa in
patients. It has been inferred that overexpressed truncated T2-ERG is a key player in PCa pathogenesis. Notably,
a number of studies show that overexpression of T2-ERG protein alone is insufficient to trigger formation of PCa
in mice unless at very advanced age (> 24 months), implying the requirement of additional lesions in T2-ERG
overexpression-induced PCa pathogenesis. By analyzing the NGS data from > 1500 cases of PCa patient
specimens, we showed that T2-ERG fusion and p53 inactivation (loss of p53 tumor suppressor function due to
TP53 gene deletion and/or mutation) co-occurred in both primary and metastatic PCa, supporting the notion that
T2-ERG fusion and TP53 inactivation cooperate to drive PCa pathogenesis and progression. We demonstrated
that prostate-specific T2-ERG transgene and Trp53 knockout (T2-ERG+/p53-) not only largely enhanced ERG
target gene expression, but also induced high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and cancerous
lesions in mice at 12-15 months of age. Mechanistically, we identified LSD1 as a direct binding partner of ERG
protein and showed that cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) phosphorylates LSD1 at threonine 59 (T59-p), which
disrupts LSD1 interaction with HP1γ, an epigenetic `reader' of H3K9me2/3 and induces demethylation of these
transcription repressive chromatin marks at ERG target gene loci. Based on these novel preliminary data, we
hypothesize that in p53-proficient cells the oncogenic potential of T2-ERG is constrained under a transcription
repressive chromatin state through association with the LSD1-HP1γ complex. However, p53 inactivation induces
loss or downregulated expression of p21WAF1, aberrant activation of CDKs and accelerated cell cycle progression,
which in turn triggers LSD1 T59-p-mediated disassociation of HP1γ from LSD1, HP1γ eviction from chromatin
due to accelerated cell cycle progression-associated H3S10 phosphorylation (H3S10-p), thereby promoting
H3K9me demethylation at ERG target gene loci, oncogenic reprogramming of ERG transcriptome, and PCa
pathogenesis and progression. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the molecular basis and regulation of
LSD1 phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of LSD1-HP1γ interaction in T2-ERG+/p53- PCa cells (Aim 1), define
the mechanism and extent to which LSD1 enzymatic activity and T59 phosphorylation regulates ERG
transcriptional program in T2-ERG+/p53- PCa cells (Aim 2), and determine the clinical significance of the interplay
between ERG and p53 signaling and anti-cancer efficacy of targeting LSD1 and ERG pathways in T2-ERG+/p53-
PCa (Aim 3). Findings from the proposed studies will shed new light on molecular mechanisms of PCa
pathogenesis and could lead to development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of T2-ERG+/p53- PCa."

residential segregation, the degree to which social groups live separately from one another within a specified
geographic area. Segregation is a multi-dimensional, complex construct that has contributed to racial disparities
across many domains. Segregated facilities and organizations persist throughout society, including in healthcare,
where for example, teaching services in academic medical centers are often located in areas with large numbers
of medically underserved groups; and discriminatory insurance programs perpetuate the maintenance of
separate outpatient practices for indigent patients. There is, however, surprisingly little research on segregation
in healthcare or its direct (disparate quality and access) and indirect (perceived discrimination, mistrust) impacts
on the delivery of care or health outcomes. To eliminate structural racism and discrimination from healthcare
systems, we must identify, quantify, and address these factors. The DiSRUPT study will use retrospective
ambulatory visit data for 12 million patients from five academic medical centers across New York City (NYC)
obtained from the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network (CRN) to assess the level of segregation of ambulatory
practices and its impact on processes of care and care outcomes. We will use detailed concurrent and
prospective data regarding clinical structures, processes, and policies at the Mount Sinai Health System (Sinai)
to characterize the multiple domains within which structural racism and discrimination operate and to evaluate
the impact of current and planned equity interventions. Sinai is undertaking a transformational set of equity
initiatives to dismantle structural racism system-wide, including the unification (desegregation) of ambulatory
practices, creating a “natural experiment”. We aim to: 1) use CRN data to describe the level of segregation,
(using Dissimilarity Index and Isolation Index), in hospital-based and faculty practice ambulatory sites in NYC
and its association with selected quality measures of preventive care (pediatrics), procedural care (obstetrics),
and chronic disease management (general and family medicine) for Black, Latinx, and Medicaid populations; 2)
identify structural differences between more and less unified practices in a large NYC academic medical center
and their association both with quality measures and with patient, staff, provider and trainee perceptions of
racism; and 3) observe effects of equity interventions over time on level of segregation, quality measures, and
perceived racism and, using microsimulation techniques, estimate the potential societal impact of widespread
desegregation on selected cardiometabolic outcomes. We will use our findings to build a blueprint that other
healthcare systems can follow to eliminate practice segregation. The proposed study will increase our
understanding of the racist structures and discriminatory processes embedded in ambulatory practices and of
potential strategies to inform institutional and societal efforts to eliminate them from the healthcare system."

Opioids are highly effective at reducing pain, but their potential for addiction and overdose has led to a growing
public health crisis. Researchers have attempted to develop new opioid compounds that are less likely to be
abused and have fewer side effects, but these efforts have been difficult. The endogenous opioid system has
multiple receptors and ligands heterogeneously expressed across different parts of the body and cell types.
Tremendous work has been done to delineate the relationships between opioid receptors (ORs) and ligands.
However, the specificity of ligand-receptor engagement often depends on relative affinities at predetermined
targets. In general, in vivo spatial and cellular heterogeneity of the brain obscure opioid actions, making them
hard to predict based on receptor affinity alone.
Currently, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics are transforming our understanding of brain architecture.
However, there is a significant gap in how we measure opioid actions and align them with the spatially resolved
cellular atlas of the brain. Levering emerging CATCH and inverse activity marker (IAM) techniques, we propose
multimodal profiling of opioid actions with spatial and single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain. Using
three pharmacologically diverse opioids, we aim to map neuronal activities and cellular binding of these drugs
onto the entire mouse brain in an unbiased way and register them with cell types identified from single-cell
transcriptomics. Furthermore, we will test whether a drug’s affinities across different ORs determine its in vivo
cell and neural ensemble engagement. Not only would this project provide a circuit-level mechanism linking the
molecular pharmacology to brain-wide opioid actions, but also lay out a roadmap for evaluating and developing
new opioids, e.g., by incorporating regional and cell-type preference into the structure-activity-relationship for
lead optimization or by revealing on- and off-target sites to guide further cell-type specific in vitro chemical
screening and optimization."
10773047,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sequencing an individual’s genome now costs less than many routine medical procedures. A resulting vision is
that everyone will have their genome sequenced early in life to enable individualized medical advice about
disease prevention and drug selection. A major concern with this vision, however, is proper interpretation of the
overwhelming volume of discovered novel and rare variants. In other contexts, a new diagnostic test can be
benchmarked and validated in studies that compare large populations with and without a disorder to determine
the predictive value of a positive result. In the genetic sequencing context, however, a positive test for most
variants cannot be applied to enough heterozygous individuals for a definitive association with disease.
Pathogenic variants in KCNH2 (a.k.a. hERG, a cardiac potassium channel gene critical for cardiomyocyte
repolarization) can cause sudden cardiac death in the young and can predispose carriers to drug-induced
arrhythmias. Genetic variants in KCNH2 are responsible for ~ 6% of autopsy-negative sudden unexplained
death in the young and ~ 1% of sudden infant death syndrome cases. Additionally, among heterozygous
carriers of variants in KCNH2, women are at greater overall risk of a severe event (including sudden cardiac
death) which is increased in the postpartum period. Since most disease-associated variants in KCNH2 are
rare, full exome sequencing has the potential to identify those individuals at greater risk early in life before any
phenotype manifests. However, even among heterozygous carriers of KCNH2 variants definitively associated
with disease, not all develop the same phenotype.
To address the challenge of variant interpretation, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
suggests criteria to incorporate variant population, functional, computational, and segregation data using
several described heuristics. Our foundational hypothesis is that clinically meaningful knowledge is lost
in the compression of these variant-specific data to a dichotomous classification. To investigate this
hypothesis, we will generate in vitro data for all missense variants in KCNH2 prospectively, build a prediction
model of disease penetrance, and validate resulting predictions against the incidence of arrhythmias and
cardiac events for variants observed in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network (eMERGE), a
Leducq Transatlantic Network, and the UK Biobank."
10773140,"The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and
implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein
trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about
the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head
that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We
have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection,
or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal
vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and
H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting
materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer
interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate
vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human
antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the
responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody
gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated.
Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies
will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using
crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide
the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human
antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state
design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades,
subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies
and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed
antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The
co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of
structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed
immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these
immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use
the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to
show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses."
10773141,"Project Summary/Abstract
The INIAstress consortium will employ a diverse set of scientific approaches to understand the brain
mechanisms that underlie stress and alcohol interactions. There is a commitment among the consortium to
deliberately carry out the science in a way that provides synergy across the research components through
common experimental designs and data acquisition approaches. The Computational and Statistical Analyses
Core (CSAC) proposed herein will implement statistical and computational approaches that will facilitate the
integration of the data created throughout the consortium, thus providing synergistic interactions amongst the
research components. This project functions as a core because it does not set out to test a specific
overarching hypothesis, but rather, it serves the consortium by codifying data among the components.
Accomplishing this will bring us closer to the overarching goal of generating impactful hypotheses that describe
how stress and alcohol act as an antecedent for an AUD.
 Each of the participating research components will generate large, complex data sets. Therefore, “Big
Data” expertise will be required to identify and implement best practices to ensure that data can be integrated
across the research components. Specific Aim 1 outlines the activities of the CSAC to prepare time series data
for analysis, perform these analyses, and prepare the results for publication. This includes methods such as
innovative data preprocessing methods, dimensionality reduction approaches, and artificial intelligence
approaches as well as others. In addition, to prepare data for open source distribution, all data will be
formatted in accordance with the standards described in Neurodata Without Borders.
 To increase synergy amongst the wide-range of experimental approaches and animal models
employed in the research components, it is critical to integrate these data into computational models. Specific
Aim 2 will link these levels of analysis through clear, mathematical formalisms that will provide added synergy
and rigor. Furthermore, this provides a rapid and rigorous way to develop novel hypothesis to drive future work,
as ideas can be explored and vetted in silico. This aim will integrate the data gathered in the components into
computational models of how alcohol and stress alters brain function and, ultimately, behavior.
Large data sets have an impact well beyond their initial publication and can be an enduring resource for the
scientific community. Therefore, in Specific Aim 3, the data created in the components will be curated in
accordance with standards accepted by the scientific community, publicly archived, and made freely available.
Agreements have been reached with several NIH-funded repositories that will host these data. In addition, a
searchable section of the INIAstress website will be created to aggregate free, open access data sets that are
relevant to stress and alcohol researchers. The goal of this web portal will be to provide an easy to access,
comprehensive list of data sets that researchers can access."
10773145,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The region near the brain vasculature in human brain tumors, called the perivascular niche (PVN), is an
important microenvironment for the maintenance of brain tumor stem-like cells (BTSCs), the development of
resistance to chemo or targeted therapies, and the path for tumor infiltration to distant regions in the whole
brain, leading to incurable diseases. Current in vitro models such as 2D cell cultures or 3D tumor spheroids do
not contain this niche environment. Mouse models of brain tumors can recapitulate some aspects of the PVN,
but have challenges in terms of costly assays, low throughput, and lack of the ability for high-resolution live cell
tracking of BTSC dynamics. Herein, we propose to develop a tissue-engineered 3D microvascular niche-on-a-
chip model that can incorporate primary brain tumor cells from patients in order to bridge this gap between in
vitro and in vivo models. Our pilot study has demonstrated the success in co-culture of patient-derived
glioblastoma cells and microvasculature in a microfluidic gel system and observed preferential localization of
BTSCs in the PVN. Comparing ex vivo dynamics of individual tumor cells on-chip to single-cell transcriptomes
across 10 patients further revealed a correlation between perivascular localization and transcriptional subtypes.
In this project, we propose to further examine tumor cell migration and localization using a larger cohort of
patient specimens and compare the results to pathological and clinical data, aiming to develop it into an ex vivo
functional assay for patient prognosis and subclassification (Aim 1). We will apply scRNA-seq to the same
samples to generate correlative data to identify subtypes associated with distinct ex vivo dynamics in the
tissue-engineered PVN model, which can help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PVN in tumor cell fate
and invasion (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the response of tumor cells in PVN to chemo and targeted
therapies administered through the perfusable microvascular network to assess the potential to perform
personalized drug test and therapeutic stratification (Aim 3). This project will lead to a novel tissue-engineered
microsystem to not only study the biology of PVN in human brain tumor development but also develop new
assays for ex vivo test of human tumor cells for precision medicine."
10896226,"Our recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial fission is tightly connected to lipid metabolism and
more specifically, that mitochondrial fission is an inherent element in oxidation of long chain fatty acids by the
orexigenic AgRP neurons (Jin et al., 2021). Intriguingly, while mitochondrial fission is associated with lipid
catabolic processes, mitochondrial fusion is associated with lipid anabolism. More specifically, mitofusin 2, critical
mitochondrial fusion protein, plays a critical role in the formation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria
contact sites, relevant sites of lipid metabolism where intact fatty acids are used as precursors for the generation,
for example, of sphingolipids. Besides mitofusin 2, other proteins have been shown to regulate the ER-
mitochondria interaction. Among those, the Neurite OutGrowth inhibitor (Nogo), a member of the reticulon family
of proteins (Reticulon 4 gene; Rtn4) located on the ER, plays also a critical role in regulating sphingolipids
production (Cantalupo et al., 2015). Among sphingolipids, Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to
play a crucial role in a large number of physiological processes including most recently feeding behavior via its
action in the hypothalamus. However, the specific site of synthesis of S1P and its target within the hypothalamus
have not been identified. Our preliminary data have shown that AgRP neurons are enriched of enzymes involved
in the S1P de novo biosynthesis and their mRNA levels are regulated by the metabolic state, with fasting
upregulating Nogo mRNA levels while downregulating all the enzymes involved in the synthesis of S1P. In line
with this, we observed that S1P levels in the arcuate nucleus are downregulated during food deprivation. As the
multitude of different S1P-mediated actions is linked to its capacity to be secreted, we found that S1P receptors
are expressed in the neighboring anorexigenic POMC neurons where S1P significantly induced their activation
by in vivo calcium imaging. Interestingly, we also observed that the expression of Nogo and several of the
enzymes involved in the S1P de novo synthesis, together with S1P levels, are altered in diet-induced obesity
(DIO). Altogether our data gave impetus to the central hypothesis that Nogo is a critical regulator of AgRP
neuronal function and feeding behavior by regulating fatty acid metabolic pathways (catabolism versus
anabolism) and that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism during high fat diet (HFD) plays a role in DIO.
Specifically, we hypothesize that when activated during fasting in AgRP neurons, Nogo by inhibiting S1P de
novo biosynthesis will direct fatty acids to oxidation by the mitochondria (catabolic pathway) thus, activating
AgRP neurons and inducing feeding behavior (Aim 1). On the other hand, Nogo downregulation in AgRP
neurons during fed state will disinhibit S1P de novo biosynthesis (thus promoting the anabolic pathway), and by
acting via its receptors, S1P will affect AgRP target neurons resulting in decreased food intake (Aim 2). Finally,
dysregulation of this pathway and the resulting imbalance in sphingolipid metabolism (increased ceramides
production but decreased S1P generation) during HFD plays a role in DIO (Aim 3)."

10767938,"Metals are essential for human health yet potentially toxic in excess. Our understanding of metal homeostasis stems prominently from studies of inherited diseases of metal deficiency and excess. The molecular basis of manganese (Mn) homeostasis is poorly understood relative to other metals, given that inherited Mn-related diseases were only recently identified. In 2012, mutations in a metal export protein SLC30A10 were reported in patients with Mn excess, liver and neurologic disease, increased red blood cell counts, and erythropoietin excess. Mn excess was attributed to impaired biliary Mn excretion, while liver, neurologic, and hematologic defects were ascribed to Mn toxicity. Employing our expertise in mammalian metal homeostasis, we recently demonstrated that murine Slc30a10 is not only essential for systemic and biliary Mn excretion but also for Mn export by the small intestine into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract (Mercadante et al., J Clin Invest., 2019). This indicates that the role of SLC30A10 in Mn homeostasis is more complicated than anticipated and that extrahepatic organs contribute to Mn excretion. In exploring the mechanistic basis of Mn excess in SLC30A10 deficiency, we also observed that Slc30a10-deficient mice develop paradoxically increased Mn absorption despite severe Mn excess. Our preliminary data suggest a multi-step model underlying this surprising observation. First, excess Mn aberrantly stimulates the liver to express the hormone erythropoietin. Second, erythropoietin excess indirectly suppresses expression of the hormone hepcidin, an inhibitor of dietary iron absorption. Third, hepcidin deficiency leads to increased Mn absorption. As a role for hepcidin in Mn homeostasis is not well-established, this last novel step in our model is based upon our observation that pharmacologic stimulation of hepcidin expression decreases Mn levels in Slc30a10-deficient mice . We propose that SLC30A10 deficiency is a unique pathophysiological context in which hepcidin plays an unexpected but pivotal role in development of Mn excess. The goal of this proposal is to establish the mechanistic link between hepcidin and Mn absorption in SLC30A10 deficiency and to explore pharmacologic stimulation of hepcidin expression as a treatment for Mn excess in SLC30A10 deficiency and other conditions. This will be accomplished using genetic, metabolic, pharmacologic, radioisotopic, dietary, and microscopic techniques. The proposed studies will enable us to not only further establish the molecular basis of mammalian Mn homeostasis but also to design therapeutic strategies for Mn-related diseases based upon our understanding of underlying mechanisms of Mn homeostasis."
10767946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Damage to telomeres resulting from radiation or exposure to toxic chemicals can lead to cancer and accelerated
aging. Damage may also result from normal metabolism including generation of formaldehyde or transcription
when RNA is left behind embedded in the DNA in the form of R-loops. Extensive studies of genomic R-loops
have shown them to play both positive roles in regulation of transcription and harmful roles leading to DNA
breakage, mutagenesis and cancer. Telomeric R-loops (tel-R-loops) may possibly be the single greatest source
of DNA damage at telomeres. Tel-R-loops occur in normal human cells, but are more abundant in cells
expressing the ALT cancer phenotype and cells mutated in DNA methylases that produce high levels of
telomeric RNA (TERRA). Elevated levels of tel-R-loops have been linked to telomere damage, shortening and
high recombination leading to cancer. Radiation, toxic agents such as cisplatin, formaldehyde, and exposure to
oxidative damage are also likely to generate higher levels of tel-R-loops. We demonstrated that telomeres are
arranged in large loops (t-loops) and recently made a paradigm-shifting discovery linking t-loop formation to
telomere transcription which generates TERRA and produces tel-R-loops which we propose are key to t-loop
formation. Thus, tel-R-loops are both toxic and necessary for forming protective t-loops. Tel-R-loops are more
stable than normal R-loops due to G-quartet formation. The extensive studies of genomic and tel-R-loops have
all relied on a single assay employing the S9.6 antibody to DNA/RNA hybrids (DRIP assay). While having driven
the field, this IP assay does not discriminate between one or many R-loops on a DNA fragment, or provide
information on the clustering of the R-loops, or their size. For tel-R-loops, the IP assay does not reveal whether
there are R-loops within the looped portion of the t-loop or their distribution from the sub-telomeric regions to the
telomere terminus. For the field to progress, such critical information must be obtained. This can now be done
using direct electron microscopic (EM) visualization using methods we have verified and in hand.
 In the proposed work we will carry out a high resolution study of the large (120-240 nt) particles formed by
single stranded G-rich telomeric DNA and TERRA RNA. This is critical for understanding the structure of tel-R-
loops and will be done by cryoEM. To determine the frequency, location, size and clustering of tel-R-loops we
will apply a novel affinity isolation for telomeric DNA, combined with our battery of EM tools. This will be done
using cultured HeLa and human ALT cancer lines and extended to cells treated with toxic chemicals including
cisplatin and formaldehyde to introduce crosslinks in the DNA. A novel chemoptogenomic approach for placing
ROS generated 8-oxoG lesions specifically at the telomere in cells will be applied in a collaboration and the
effect on tel-R-loops determined. The t-loop junction may have important functional roles and this will be
explored using assays to detect telomere extension following cleavage of the t-loop junction by HJ resolvases."

The onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases in incidence with age, and an increasing aging demographic
means the number of individuals suffering from AD is expanding rapidly. Changes in cerebral metabolism are
hallmarks of aging therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that age-associated change in metabolism play
major roles in AD progression. AD brains show clear metabolic impairments, and studies suggest that altered
metabolism drives a cascade of events leading to AD onset. The mechanisms initiating these metabolic
impairments remain a critical knowledge gap in AD research. We recently discovered that aberrant glycogen
aggregates (AD-glycogen) are a universal feature of AD in both human and mice. Increases in AD-glycogen
correlated with higher Braak staging and lower glucose levels in patient specimens. AD-glycogen is both
hyper-phosphorylated and hyper-branched making them architecturally distinct from normal glycogen. We
present strong evidence showing that AD-glycogen modulate brain metabolism through direct binding and
inactivation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of central carbon metabolism. We
will first elucidate the molecular events leading to abnormal AD-glycogen formation in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1),
then we will interrogate the impact of AD-glycogen on cerebral metabolism during aging (Aim 2). Finally, we
will assess the efficacy of a novel glycogen-clearing enzyme therapy on brain metabolism, cognition, and AD
neuropathology in vivo (Aim 3). The PI has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators with
complementary skillsets and state-of-art, high resolution, and Omic-based techniques to discover potential
therapeutic options and possibly treat the onset of AD."

10757029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by clonal expansion of myeloid cells with blocked
differentiation. Despite newly approved targeted therapies for AML, there is still a large subset of patients
whose disease progresses or does not respond to treatment. One group of patients that have demonstrated
resistance to targeted therapy (entospletinib, enasidenib, ivosidenib, and venetoclax) have protein tyrosine-
phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) mutations. The PTPN11 gene encodes for the phosphatase
Shp2, which regulates multiple signaling pathways including the RAS-MAPK pathway. PTPN11 mutations
(PTPN11+) commonly co-occur with mutations in the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene. Our preliminary data
demonstrates that the co-association of PTPN11 and NPM1 mutations results in inferior outcomes for patients
treated with intensive chemotherapy. Intriguingly, we have seen that PTPN11+/NPM1+ patients rarely have
FLT3-ITD, an alteration that is well-known to worsen outcomes in NPM1+ AML. Because PTPN11 mutations
activate many downstream signaling pathways similar to FLT3-ITD, we hypothesize that the addition of
PTPN11 mutations to NPM1+ AML can clinically phenocopy NPM1+/FLT3-ITD AML in terms of adverse
outcomes and therapy resistance. Therefore, we have generated a novel transgenic Ptpn11E76K/Npm1cA mouse
model to study the development of AML and the resulting immunosuppressive phenotype. Using this model,
we will interrogate whether expanded myeloid cells from Ptpn11E76K/Npm1cA animals can initiate AML in
immunodeficient mice and confer resistance to chemotherapy. In addition, we will use modified AML cell lines
to study the mechanism of resistance, particularly the roles signaling pathways, antiapoptotic proteins, and
immunosuppression play. The knowledge gained will clarify the biology of PTPN11 mutations in AML and
provide the foundation to develop therapies that will be effective in patients with PTPN11+ AML.
This research will be completed by an MD/PhD student under the supervision of two leading translational
researchers in the field of AML. The MD/PhD program is well established at Ohio State, and cancer research
at the Comprehensive Cancer Center is robust and exceptionally strong. The training plan contains
opportunities for the development of critical thinking, scientific knowledge, technical expertise, clinical skills,
communication capabilities, and rigorous experimental design. Successful completion of the research proposal
and training plan will provide the skills necessary to become an independent researcher in the field of
hematology."
10757031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Behavior emerges from the flow of information between brain regions. For example, finding a friend in a crowd
requires the interaction of brain regions performing sensory processing, memory processing, and motor
responses. Disrupting how neural activity flows through the brain is thought to lead to deficits in several
neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. However,
the neural mechanisms controlling the flow of information through the brain are not well understood.
To capture how information flows through the brain, we recently used mesoscale calcium imaging to record the
dynamics of neural activity across the dorsal cortex of mice. Surprisingly, we found cortex-wide neural
dynamics could be captured in 14 unique spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. These ‘motifs’ of activity
occurred repeatedly, were common to all mice, and were associated with specific behaviors. Importantly,
identifying these motifs allows us to quantify how neural activity is flowing across cortex. Here, we will leverage
this ability to understand the neural mechanisms that control the expression of different motifs and, thus,
control the flow of neural activity across the brain. Our Aims will address three key components of control:
First, information must be routed between brain regions. Activity from a brain region can flow to several
possible downstream regions (to support different behaviors). Using mesoscale calcium imaging, we will
quantify how activity is routed through the brain at each moment in time. Simultaneous electrophysiology and
optogenetics will then test two prominent hypotheses that predict activity is routed differently depending on 1)
how information is represented in the population of neurons and 2) the frequency of synchronous oscillations.
Second, the brain must be able to control how neural activity flows through cortex. Prefrontal cortex and the
basal ganglia are two regions thought to provide such control. However, their role in guiding cortex-wide neural
dynamics has never been directly tested. Therefore, our second aim will combine mesoscale imaging,
electrophysiology, and optogenetics to test whether neurons in prefrontal cortex or basal ganglia control the
expression of different motifs and, thus, control how neural activity flows through the brain.
Third, in order to learn a new behavior, one must learn the pattern of neural activity that supports that behavior.
Neuromodulation is thought to be critical for such learning: current models propose norepinephrine explores
new patterns while dopamine refines patterns. To test this, our third aim will combine mesoscale imaging with
recording and stimulation of noradrenergic/dopaminergic midbrain neurons while animals learn new behaviors.
In this way, we aim to understand how neuromodulation changes behavior and cortex-wide neural dynamics.
Our innovative combination of mesoscale imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics will provide insight into
how neural activity is routed (Aim 1) and how cortex-wide dynamics are controlled (Aim 2) and learned (Aim 3).
By understanding these mechanisms, we hope to improve treatments for diseases disrupting cognitive control."
10912020,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory infection and diarrheal disease are the two leading causes of pediatric death between 1
month and 5 years of age globally. These common problems have low-cost treatments, but these treatments
are most effective when administered early. This is difficult in resource-limited settings, especially at night.
Based on over 5 years of formative NIH-funded implementation science research, our team has built and
deployed a telemedicine and medication delivery service (TMDS) called MotoMeds to improve nighttime
access to care for children. The rationale is that a TMDS generates a multiplier effect to reduce mortality and
morbidity to a greater extent than the provision of in-person emergency medical services (EMS) alone. A
TMDS differs from EMS in that it mobilizes resources from a centralized location and transports these
resources to households. An EMS, on the other hand, identifies patients at households and transports the
patients to centralized resources. EMS logistics, clinical guidelines and decision-support tools do not readily
apply to a TMDS. Novel methods are needed to assure that TMDS models of healthcare delivery safely reach
their potential. MotoMeds was launched in Haiti in 2019 as a pre-pilot focused on safety and logistical
feasibility and configured for scale in a pilot study in 2021. We developed paper-based decision-support tools
for virtual call center exams that were derived from in-person World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
Our research exposed a critical need for electronic clinical decision support (eCDS) to assure guideline
adherence at scale and a need to confidently assign triage levels despite limitations in virtual telemedicine
environments. Accurate triage is essential to determine TMDS pathways of care: delivery alone (mild cases),
medication delivery plus an in-person exam (moderate cases) and EMS/hospital referral (severe cases). In the
R21, we will address these needs by concurrently 1) designing an alpha prototype of the eCDS tool through
human centered design followed by qualitative research analysis, while 2) using existing data from our prior
two studies to derive and internally validate a disease severity prediction (DSP) algorithm for integration
into the eCDS tool. In the R33, we will externally validate the accuracy of the DSP and evaluate the
performance of a beta eCDS prototype in a pilot stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The
performance of the beta eCDS prototype will be determined by comparing rates of guideline adherence
(primary outcome measure) and logistical metrics among providers using paper (control) vs electronic
(intervention) decision support. This single-site pilot will provide essential experience and metrics for a future
multi-site randomized controlled trial of the eCDS integrated with the DSP."
10914629,"This high risk / high reward exploratory R21 project will make breakthroughs in understanding
chemically-induced occupational allergy (asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, skin disease). We will
identify small molecules (peptides) that mimic the structure of chemical allergens by combining
cutting edge technology with unique reagents generated in our laboratory. The results, including
newly identified chemical allergen mimics (mimotopes), will lead to new diagnostics, surveillance
approaches, and potential therapies.
 The immunology of chemical-induced occupational allergy has long remained unclear
hindering the development of preventative, diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches.
Chemical allergens are generally too small to trigger an immune response on their own but attain
immunogenicity upon reacting with self-molecules. The specific structures (epitopes) of modified self
proteins that trigger immune responses are challenging to define. While hapten-like recognition of
chemicals (self-molecule conjugate) are possible, chemical allergens can also alter the native
structure of self-molecules, creating new structures (neo-epitopes) recognized as foreign by the
immune system.
 We hypothesize that peptide mimics of chemical allergens can be readily identified using
contemporary phage-display libraries and bioinformatics with specific antibodies triggered by
chemical exposure, either occupationally or in animal studies. We propose to define mimotopes of a
model chemical allergen, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), one of the most abundantly
produced chemical allergens in the US. Mimotopes will be defined by combining SERA/IMUNE (a
high-throughput bacteriophage-bioinformatic technology) with unique reagents from our laboratory (i)
a panel of anti-MDI mAbs, (ii) IgE/IgA/IgG antibodies from mouse models of MDI asthma, and (iii)
serum antibodies from MDI exposed/asthmatic workers. The biological relevance of newly identified
mimotopes will be demonstrated through binding assays with serum samples from MDI exposed
workers with and without asthma, animal models of MDI sensitization and asthma, and controls.
 Strong precedence for the proposed studies comes from published literature on mimotopes of
chemical food contaminants, human autoimmune targets, and COVID-19 vaccine epitopes. The
present investigation would bring similar cutting edge technology to the field of occupational chemical
allergy that affects workers in multiple NORA sectors (Construction, Manufacturing, Transportation)
and cross-sectors (Respiratory Health Immune, Infectious and Dermal Disease Prevention). r2P
outputs and outcomes will be reduced hazardous exposures/immune disease via new diagnostics."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.)(1).
Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 30% in those with prior history of ASCVD (2). Despite being
inexpensive and well-tolerated, however, statins are underused in clinical practice, particularly in patients who
identify as Black. A large-scale intervention to improve evidence-based statin initiation among individuals with
ASCVD is needed, particularly for the Black population. To meet this need, we aim to conduct a multi-center,
pragmatic, cluster randomized, controlled trial to assess the impact of a provider- and patient-directed
intervention to increase the prescription of, and adherence to, appropriate statin therapy among those with
ASCVD (ACHIEVE: A Controlled trial to improve use of High IntEnsity statins for Vascular protEction). The
intervention will be pharmacist-led, embedded in commercial payer systems, partnering with the National
Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and with a particular emphasis on improving statin use in the Black
population. Eligible patients and their clinicians will be identified through commercial payer records. The
pharmacist will then work with the patient and the clinician to overcome barriers and to achieve evidence-
based statin therapy and patient adherence to the medication. As with all pragmatic trials that operate outside
of the traditional clinic-based recruitment model, the optimal method to reach and engage both clinicians and
patients in this trial is uncertain. Our objective for this planning grant is to determine whether our strategies for
clinician and patient recruitment yield a high enough degree of engagement, including among Blacks, to justify
moving forward with the larger trial. Our specific aims are: (1) To evaluate our strategy for recruitment and
engagement of providers to participate in this multifaceted intervention to improve statin prescription and
adherence, with the goal of recruiting at least 25% of identified providers. (2) To evaluate our strategy for
recruitment and engagement of patients to participate in this multifaceted intervention to improve statin
prescription and adherence, with the goal of recruiting at least 30% of identified patients overall and within the
Black patient population. To our knowledge, this approach of engaging providers and their patients through
commercial payer networks has not been tried on the scale envisioned for the ACHIEVE trial. Understanding
whether we can recruit clinicians and patients in this setting will benefit not only the ACHIEVE program, but
also future pragmatic trials across therapeutic areas."
10908712,"Project Summary/Abstract. In this renewal application, we will advance the success of the Environmental
Influences on Child Health Outcomes program that seeks to “enhance the health of children for generations to
come” as one of the Pregnancy and Pediatric Cohort Study Sites. Since 2009, the New Hampshire Birth
Cohort Study, a rural prospective molecular epidemiology study, has accrued data and biologic samples on
pregnant people and their children with a goal of 6,000 dyads (including 1,005 new pregnancies and 2,800
children consented into ECHO) by August 2023. Data and biospecimens are being leveraged for nearly 100
Concept Proposals (each with one or more manuscripts), including Opportunity and Infrastructure awards to
early career investigators and COVID-19 supplements, and with more in the pipeline. Already, 7,440 of our
cohort’s biospecimens have been committed to 11 ECHO-Wide laboratory analyses led by our Dartmouth team
and other investigators. This includes the ECHO Genome Wide Association Study to which most participants
are contributing DNA samples. Non-DNA biologic samples available or being shipped to the ECHO
Biorepository include urine, toenails, hair, blood, placenta, meconium, human milk, stool, and teeth. We took
part in ECHO program leadership, committees and working groups, designing and sharing protocols, and
creating instructional videos and participant feedback materials. We addressed the urgent call for health equity,
fostered workforce diversity, and prioritized public health crises, including time sensitive evaluation of SARS-
CoV-2 on our most vulnerable populations. We are committed to strengthening these efforts in the next phase.
We responded to congressional and agency stakeholders as well as health care providers and families and
plan to elevate this engagement moving forward to ensure diverse perspectives and inclusion in our cohort and
impact of our work. We will recruit 1,500 additional pregnant people, enlist their conceiving partner, enroll them
into a preconception cohort if planning another child and follow children previously accrued into the cohort and
newly born in this study phase. We will adhere to the ECHO Cohort Protocol, rely on the program’s REDCap
Central database and single IRB. We will continue to capitalize on ECHO’s unprecedented data and samples
from diverse populations across the USA, along with Dartmouth’s robust infrastructure and interdisciplinary
expertise. Specifically, we will (1) address rural health inequities by characterizing the rural exposome and its
impact on child health outcomes, (2) determine the early drivers of lower and upper airway disease and other
outcomes and the mediating role of the developing microbiome using specialized measures of exposures (e.g.,
dietary nutrient-toxicant composition) and outcomes (e.g., respiratory infections and vaccine response), and (3)
investigate the influence of inter-pregnancy adiposity and factors of the conceiving partner on child growth
using the pilot preconception cohort. Thus, our study site fills a critical niche in the ECHO program and will
continue to provide leadership and collaboration in support of its overall mission."

 Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which obesity, and specifically upper body/visceral
obesity (UBO), causes insulin resistance, Type 2 Diabetes and the other health problems. We study what
regulates the release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue (lipolysis) in humans. For this application we
propose to complete the following Specific Aims: 1. We will determine whether impaired insulin-induced
suppression of regional lipolysis (measured by IC50) in UBO compared with insulin-sensitive control groups is
related to differences in adipocyte lipolysis protein responses. 2. We will determine whether the suppression of
regional lipolysis induced by niacin, acting independently of the insulin signaling pathway, is impaired in UBO
compared with insulin-sensitive control groups and, if so, if this is related to local differences in adipocyte
lipolysis-regulating proteins. 3. We will determine whether stimulated adipose tissue lipolysis resulting from the
combination of somatostatin infusion (to suppress insulin secretion) and intravenous epinephrine, is impaired
in UBO compared with insulin-sensitive control groups and, if so, if this is related to regional differences in
lipolysis and adipocyte lipolysis-regulating proteins. 4. We will determine whether the regional release of FFA
relative to glycerol as a measure of intracellular reesterification accounts for the differences in systemic FFA
delivery between UBO and non-UBO adults. Combined, we believe these studies will offer insights as to
whether adipose tissue lipolysis is abnormal in UBO specifically in response to insulin, or if there are more
fundamental issue with metabolic flexibility that relate to adipocyte size. By understanding what is different in
the process of lipolysis in UBO we hope to provide guidance as to what therapeutic strategies might be
employed to treat adipose dysfunction."

Recurrence of cancer cells that evade therapy is a leading cause of death. Given that residual disease can
persist for years to decades following therapy, it presents a second therapeutic window where the vulnerabilities
of residual cells can be exploited to identify novel, actionable targets, thus reducing or delaying recurrence.
Unfortunately, mechanisms of residual disease survival remain under-studied, partly due to the lack of tools and
models to precisely study the evolutionary nature of residual disease. To this end, metabolic and vascular
reprogramming have been observed to occur in parallel to therapy resistance and precede anatomical changes
after treatment, and thus hold promise as targets to be leveraged to improve clinical outcomes. This proposal
will develop novel functional imaging tools to understand the dynamic behaviors of residual tumors (F99 phase)
and how metabolic and vascular vulnerabilities can be targeted during residual disease to mitigate recurrence
(K00 phase). The emergence of residual disease reflects the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the tumor
microenvironment and the evolutionary property of cancer cells to adapt to therapy-induced selective pressures.
Therefore, to effectively monitor treatment responses, a systems-level approach to image metabolism and the
associated vasculature of the tumor microenvironment at a spatial resolution capable of visualizing intra-tumoral
heterogeneity in vivo is necessary, but currently unavailable. In the F99 phase of this proposal, I aim to design
novel optical imaging methodologies to track metabolic and vascular shifts to identify metabolically distinct
residual tumor subpopulations that emerge following chemotherapy. In aim 1.1 (previous work), I show that
longitudinal assessment of bulk tumor metabolism and intra-tumoral heterogeneity enables chemotherapy
induced metabolic shifts to be captured during disease regression, residual disease, and recurrence. In aim 1.2
(proposed work), I will develop image segmentation approaches to quantify 1) cellular-level metabolic features
and 2) vascular characteristics that lead to poor perfusion. I will examine whether resistance to treatment leads
to the emergence of specialized niches of metabolically distinct residual tumor subpopulations that could be
targeted. While functional imaging approaches are desirable due to their ability to reflect cellular, and tissue-
level dynamics, they are insufficient to elucidate all the molecular mechanisms that drive recurrence. In the K00
phase of this proposal, I will take a molecular approach to delve into the mechanisms of residual disease in PDX
models of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). I will focus on targeting MYC oncogenic signaling pathways
to identify novel, actionable metabolic and vascular targets of residual disease for a subset of TNBC tumors. In
addition to filling a critical need for the treatment of residual disease in TNBC, this training plan will provide
exceptional training by leaders in the imaging and cancer biology fields, positioning me to become an
accomplished independent researcher at the interface of these two fields."

Justice-involved Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly vulnerable to HIV, and oftentimes
experience delayed uptake and benefit from available HIV services. Status neutral interventions for justice-
involved BMSM are pertinent and urgently needed to address the social and structural barriers to HIV services
(e.g., unemployment) experienced by this population. Our collaborative has prioritized four status neutral
interventions (i.e., transitional case management [TCM], employment navigation [EN], contingency management
intervention [CMI], and employer outreach and support [EOS). Combining these interventions together will
maximize their independent effectiveness and provide significant promise for improving access to HIV and
employment-related services for justice-involved BMSM. We will utilize seven prioritized bundled implementation
strategies to support the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of status neutral interventions within
community and criminal justice settings. The overarching goals of the planned multi-site type 2 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation study, J-RISE: Relevant Implementation Strategies to Eliminate the social and
structural barriers to HIV services among Justice-involved BMSM is to simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness
and implementation of two packaged status neutral interventions within justice and community settings to
improve access to HIV and employment-related services. J-RISE is led by an academic, community, and criminal
justice collaborative and conducted in three Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) jurisdictions in Illinois and Louisiana.
Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of two packaged status neutral interventions (TCM versus TCM+EN+CMI) on
primary outcomes (linkages to HIV care, PrEP care, and employment-related services within 90 days) and
secondary outcomes (receipt of mental health and substance use services, retention in HIV care, viral
suppression, PrEP persistence, and sustained employment) among justice-involved BMSM.
Aim 2. Evaluate the bundled implementation strategies and implementation outcomes at multiple levels using
CFIR, RE-AIM, and MIPA. Key implementation outcomes include acceptability, adoption, costs, fidelity,
penetration, and sustainability. J-RISE will generate novel information about the utility of our chosen
implementation strategies as well as critical information about the effectiveness and cost of packaged status
neutral interventions to optimize HIV and employment-related outcomes for justice-involved BMSM in multiple
EHE jurisdictions."

Peri-prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are devastating complications of joint replacements. Prevention of infection
remains the best strategy as once a PJI has established, it is difficult to cure and recurrence rates exceed 17%.
Immediately following surgery, the joint implants are bathed in a post-operative serosanguinous fluid (SSF)
which over time changes to a viscous, protein- and proteoglycan-rich joint fluid. Our data show differences in
antibiotic sensitivity, bacterial adhesion, and myeloid cell function between synovial fluid (SynF), serum, and
serum dilutions that approximate wound fluid/SSF. Importantly, our data suggest that the fluid composition
across this evolution differentially modulates bacterial adherence, antibiotic sensitivity, and by implication,
immune response. Excitingly, our data further suggest that application of ultrasound-triggered microbubble
disruption (UTMD) can impact bacterial metabolism to enhance the antibiotic sensitivity that was lost with the
evolution of the joint fluid. Thus, we hypothesize that a “golden window” exists in which the post-operative SSF
permits eradication of contaminating bacteria through the combined actions of antibiotics and the immune
response while the transition to SynF limits the efficacy of both. We further propose that this golden window
can be enhanced and extended through the use of UTMD to activate bacterial metabolism. We will (1) determine
the effects of SSF and SynF fluid on antibiotic activity and myeloid cell function, (2) determine UTMD effects on
bacterial eradication and myeloid function in SSF and SynF joint fluid and (3) prevent PJI in vivo through
combined microbubble/antibiotic treatments. This information will be used to create combination therapies that
will prevent PJI in vivo. Importantly, our novel strategy will seamlessly integrate with current clinical infection
mitigation strategies and can be immediate translated into a new therapeutic approach for prevention of PJI."

The proposed “Child Mental Health in HIV-impacted Low-resource settings in Developing countries: Global
Research Fellowship” (CHILD-GRF) training program will provide state-of-the-art methods training, mentoring,
and “hands-on” research experience to promising early career researchers committed to research careers
focused on addressing HIV prevention and the serious burden of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH)
in the context of HIV/AIDS. The overall expectation is to increase, strengthen, and sustain the capacity of
research institutions in Uganda, a sub-Saharan African (SSA) country heavily affected by HIV/ AIDS. CHILD-
GRF is guided by: Aim 1. Identify and train a cadre of 18 SSA scientists from Uganda (6 per year over 3
consecutive recruitment cycles) capable of serving as a Principal Investigators (PIs) on extramurally funded
studies focused on combination HIV prevention (CHP) addressing persistent poverty, community violence, co-
occurring CAMH problems, and HIV care and prevention in HIV-impacted communities. The program will
establish and provide: (a) multi-disciplinary training in substantive areas and methods for identification and
treatment of CAMH in HIV-impacted low-resource settings in developing countries, applying interventions that
have been culturally adapted to SSA along with training in methods focused on SSA context through a 3-year
summer intensive training at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), led by multidisciplinary faculty, (b)
an intensive mentorship program and training infrastructure that fosters long-term research collaboration with
senior researchers and mentors from the global north and the global south; (c) hands-on learning opportunities
through activities between summers, including site visits to NIH funded research projects and centers focused
on HIV prevention and mental health interventions in communities heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS; (d) funding
for pilot studies; and (e) technical support and peer review for pilot studies, manuscript preparations, and grant
applications for larger studies. Aim 2. Bring together a network of committed mentors from the global north and
the global south to ensure quality training for promising new investigators from Uganda who would focus their
research on culturally-congruent interventions addressing HIV with an emphasis on co-existing CAMH and
CHP with potential implications for LMICs, including SSA. Aim 3: Delineate key factors that underlie successful
mentorship and training of new investigators from Uganda, with potential implications for new investigators
focused on CAMH and HIV-prevention interventions in LMICs, including SSA. CHILD-GRF has a structured, 6-
week intensive advanced summer training program. Each fellow will be paired with a mentor from WUSTL and
Uganda. A rigorous program evaluation will track individual fellow progress and program success. This
application is aligned with Fogarty's strategic priority of strengthening the scientific capacity of institutions in
LMICs to conduct HIV research relevant to the evolving HIV epidemic in their country."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia occurring in 9% of population older than 65 and is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality, notably from embolic stroke, sudden death and heart failure.
Although oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AF, detailed mechanistic insights into oxidase
activation and its downstream effectors have remained elusive. We have previously identified a correlation between
NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4) and AF in cardiac transplant patients, and a direct causal role of NOX4 in AF
development using RNA based acute induction of NOX4 in zebrafish. In preliminary studies, we have shown that
AF develops in a novel in-house generated, cardiac-specific NOX4 transgenic zebrafish line, which will be used in
Aim 1 to delineate a causal role of cardiac-specific activation of NOX4 in AF pathogenesis together with a novel
murine model of AF established in-house (Aim 1). Notably, these mice exhibit spontaneous AF episodes (absent P
valves and irregularly irregular RR intervals), as characterized by real time telemetry ECG analyses. Global and
cardiac specific knockout mice will be employed to examine a specific role of cardiac NOX4 in AF development (Aim
1). In Aim 2, we will examine whether NOX4-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy mediate AF
development in both the zebrafish and mouse models, based on preliminary observations of substantial
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in NOX4 overexpressed zebrafish, and significant
upregulation of autophagy marker LC3II in the murine model of AF, which was completely abrogated in NOX4
knockout mice. We will employ autophagy inhibitors and mitochondrial ROS scavengers to examine their effects in
preventing AF (Aims 2 & 3), via attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction-autophagy coupling (Aim 2). Changes in
autophagy markers of LC3II, Atg7 and Beclin-1 under MitoTempo treatment will be examined (Aim 2). We have
innovatively shown that nitric oxide (NO) attenuates NOX4 activation in ischemia/reperfusion. Indeed, in preliminary
experiments NO donor treatment was robustly effective in preventing AF in NOX4 overexpressed zebrafish, and the
cardiac specific NOX4 transgenic zebrafish. In Aim 2 we will also examine reversal effects of NO donors on AF, and
novel molecular mechanisms underlying NO inhibition of NOX4. In Aim 3 we will use patch clamp, live confocal
imaging, and dual voltage/calcium optical mapping to examine the electrophysiological and intracellular calcium (Ca)
handling targets of NOX4 expression in aged mice, including the intermediate roles of ROS and autophagy. Our
preliminary data indicate that these animals exhibit increased phosphorylation of RyR2, which we expect to drive
increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak, spontaneous SR Ca release and afterdepolarizations. When one
considers that these cellular changes occur in the environment of slowed conduction, which we identified using
optical mapping, these changes are highly proarrhythmic. Taken together, accomplishments of these studies
employing powerful approaches of innovative model organisms and novel genetic strains will no doubt prompt
development of innovative therapeutics for AF and postoperative AF."

Over the last 7 years of funding, this VA Merit proposal has studied caveolin biology in the setting of diabetes,

lipid-­rich microdomains of the plasma membrane continuously forming and dissociating under basal or 
stimulated conditions. Caveolae are cholesterol and sphingolipid-­enriched structures that form microscopically 
distinct flask-­like invaginations of the plasma membrane. Our laboratory and others have shown that the

receptors and signaling molecules to facilitate coordinated, precise, and rapid regulation of cell function. 
Recent evidence suggests that caveolins may exist outside of caveolae and may regulate signaling and 
membrane dynamics in distinct organelles. Little information exists regarding protein kinase A (PKA)

in subsarcolemmal mitochondria though little is known in the setting of diabetes. We hypothesize that, 
caveolin and PKA may, therefore, be a novel dyad integrating membrane and mitochondria signaling to 
maintain cellular and physiological homeostasis in the diabetic heart. The following specific hypotheses 
and aims are proposed: 
 
Aim 1: We hypothesize that mitochondria degrade when exposed to diabetic insults and that mitochondrial 
localized Cav-­3/PKA will sense cardiac metabolic load, tightly couple electron transport, limit generation of 
varied reactive species, and maintain mitochondrial structure and function. To test this hypothesis, we will 
determine the role of Cav-­3/PKA in mitochondrial function and structure and the therapeutic potential of 
mitochondrial-­targeted gene transfer in the progression of diabetes-­induced cardiac dysfunction. 
 
Aim 2: We hypothesize that plasma membranes degrade with diabetic insults, are less capable of healing and 
maintaining coupled insulin receptor signaling, and that membrane-­localized Cav-­3/PKA will regulate these

10768641,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common cancer in the US, causing tens of thousands of deaths

types (notably DLBCL). Plus, direct evidence exists to show that its over-expression causes DLBCL in human
DLBCL xenografts and transgenic mouse models. Interestingly, the tumors induced by over-expression of miR-
155 depend on the continued expression of the miRNA for survival, since if the miRNA is withdrawn, the tumors
rapidly regress via apoptosis. This property of “oncogene addiction” makes this class of miRNAs ideal targets

still lags behind, largely due to issues related to selective delivery and toxicity.
 Here we propose to exploit the striking nature of oncogene addiction to develop potential therapeutics tailored
to antagonize this crucial oncomiR in a safe and effective manner. We previously published an approach to
target anti-miR-155 peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to the acidic tumor microenvironment using pHLIP (pH Low
Insertion Peptide), with significant effects in a mouse model of lymphoma. pHLIP is a 36-amino acid peptide that
adopts an α-helical conformational change at low pH (< pH 6.5) that facilitates insertion of its C-terminus across
lipid bilayers in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Here we propose a multi-disciplinary project focused on
translating next-generation PNA and pHLIP technology to allow highly-specific targeting and improved efficacy
targeting oncogenic miR-155 in acidic tissues in miR-155-addicted cancers, with a favorable therapeutic window.
 Unlike most nucleic acids, PNAs are a synthetic DNA mimics in which the phosphodiester backbone is
substituted with a neutral N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine backbone. PNAs can bind single-strand targets with high
specificity and affinity and are not susceptible to proteases or nucleases, making PNAs ideal molecules for
targeting miRNAs. To further improve the effectiveness of antimiR PNAs, we will exploit a new class of PNA
analogs, designated gamma PNAs (gPNAs) that are conformationally pre-organized and so have advantageous
binding as well as solubility properties that should increase their effectiveness as antimiR agents. As proof of
principle for our stable next generation pHLIP-conjugated, chemically modified gamma PNAs (gPNAs) as cancer
therapeutics, we propose to test delivery and efficacy in lymphoma cancer models in this project (cell lines,
xenografts, PDX and GEMMs), with the ultimate goal of preparing a drug suitable for clinical trials. Investigation
of these methods to exploit miRNA addiction with novel oligomers targeted to the acidic microenvironment will
inform the development of molecularly targeted cancer therapeutics for lymphoma/leukemia and other tumors."
10768642,"The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasing
in Veterans. Diet plays an important role in shaping the intestinal microbiota and has emerged as an important
and actionable modifier of IBD. In addition, metabolites derived from nutrients by gut bacteria have been shown
to modify IBD progression. For example, pomegranate ellagitannins (ET) are broken down to ellagic acid (EA)
and further converted to urolithins by gut bacteria. Both EA and UA were demonstrated to improve symptoms of
IBD in chemically induced mouse models of colitis. We have recently shown that dietary pomegranate extract
(PomX) supplementation reduced colitis markers and downregulated colitis associated inflammatory pathways
in IL-10-/- mice. We also found that PomX and UA reduced pathobionts in wildtype mice. In addition, inter-
individual variations in urolithin production, so called metabotypes (A: only produce UA, B: forms urolithin B (UB),
or isoUA; 0: do not form any urolithins) have been well documented and associated with individual’s metabolic
health. It is our hypothesis that dietary PomX and/or UA suppress IBD pathogenesis by changing the gut
microbiome, strengthening the gut barrier integrity and inhibiting the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 intestinal T
cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine. Therefore, we propose to investigate whether dietary supplementation with
PomX and/or UA will prevent or alleviate colitis and to identify the mechanisms involved in PomX/UA-induced
suppression of colonic inflammatory pathways. The IL-10-/- mouse model, which mirrors the multifactorial nature
of IBD, is ideal to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation on colitis. To accomplish this, in aim 1 we will
investigate the effect of PomX in suppressing spontaneous colitis development in IL-10-/- mice, which either
produce UA (metabotye A) naturally, or lack bacteria forming UA (metabotype 0). We will also evaluate whether
UA will enhance PomX effects in metabotype 0 mice. Last, we will interrogate the potential mechanism of action
of PomX and/or UA supplementation on gut microbiome and host immunity by performing fecal shotgun
metagenomics sequencing, fecal and blood metabolomics, colonic tissue snRNAseq, cytokine RTqPCR, tissue
tight junction analysis and immune cell phenotyping in IL-10-/- mice receiving dietary PomX and/or UA. In aim 2,
we will investigate whether PomX and/or UA induced changes in the gut microbiome are responsible for their
effect on colitis suppression in IL-10-/- mice. Gnotobiotic IL10-/-mice will be colonized with naïve, or PomX,
and/or UA treated gut microbiome from human donors (metabotype A and B), and fed a high fat/high sucrose
(HFHS) diet for 12 weeks. We will investigate the role of donor microbiome metabotype to PomX treatment could
play in colitis susceptibility. In aim 3, we will evaluate the effects of PomX and/or UA on the intestinal T cell-
mediated immune inflammatory pathways associated with colitis. Rag1-/- mice will be pre-treated with dietary
PomX and/or UA and then injected intraperitoneally with CD4 naïve cells isolated from wildtype mice. After the
T cell transfer the mice will undergo the dietary intervention for 12 weeks and their course of colitis will be
compared to mice fed the HFHS diet. To establish whether PomX and/or UA effects are mediated through the
modulation of the microbiome or not, in vitro studies utilizing primary CD4+ cell lines will be used to evaluate
PomX and/or UA direct effects on TCR activated CD4+ cell phenotype, and on the proliferative, signaling and
cytokine responses. Our proposed research presents a novel approach using dietary PomX/UA to prevent or
attenuate colitis by targeting the intestinal microenvironment, created by bacteria and their metabolites leading
to selective interaction with the host immune system. Results from these preclinical studies will lay important
groundwork for future clinical studies to explore the use of dietary PomX/UA supplements as alternative and
adjuvant therapy to improve gut mucosa inflammation or alleviate relapse in IBD, thus reducing immune-
suppressing medications to a minimum in patients with mild to moderately active IBD."

10757378,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have
resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient
management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of
clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also
uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and
interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have
traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual
laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who
work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and
to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes
four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage
communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert,
interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from
fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and
respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply
novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in
patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4.
Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic
swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with
NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and
publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible,
well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and
by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries
and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated."

10769721,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ribosomal proteins (RP) are increasingly understood to play crucial regulatory roles in development and disease;
however, the way they do so remains unclear. The potential modes of RP action fall into two classes: effects on
the ribosome itself or extraribosomal functions carried out while physically separate from the ribosome.
Traditional loss-of-function approaches to address RP function fail to distinguish these modes of action because
most RP are essential for ribosome biogenesis and/or function and so ablation of such RP genes attenuates
both modes of action. Consequently, an unequivocal determination of the contributions of extraribosomal RP
functions to biological processes remains a critical gap in knowledge. Importantly, we have identified an RP,
Rpl22, which is not required for ribosome biogenesis or function, but nevertheless plays critical, selective roles
in hematopoiesis. Rpl22 not only regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) emergence in the embryo but also
regulates adult HSC function, as well as more distal stages of hematopoiesis including B and T lymphocyte
development. The basis for the selective requirement for Rpl22 in particular hematopoietic processes remains
unclear; however, we have recently determined that the capacity of Rpl22 to regulate fetal HSC emergence is
dependent upon its physical association with hnRNP-A1, which can regulate translation. Moreover, hnRNP-A1
selectively associates with Rpl22 molecules that are physically separate from the ribosome. Consequently, we
have an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the importance of the extraribosomal function of Rpl22 in
hematopoiesis. We hypothesize that Rpl22 regulates hematopoiesis chiefly through its extraribosomal activity,
by associating with hnRNP-A1, and regulating the translation, splicing and possibly the stability of RNA targets
that differ depending on the cellular context. Indeed, while Rpl22 controls fetal HSC emergence by regulating
the expression of Smad1, Rpl22 controls adult HSC behavior by regulating the expression of a lipoxygenase
(Alox12), which generates lipid species that activate PPARd, a master regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). As
FAO has been shown to regulate HSC self-renewal, we hypothesize that Rpl22 regulates Alox12 signaling to
maintain HSCs. In this proposal, we will test these hypotheses in two aims. Aim 1 seeks to determine how the
Rpl22/hnRNP-A1 axis exerts its functions in controlling HSC biology, and identify the specific Rpl22-regulated
fetal and adult hematopoietic processes that depend on Rpl22 association with hnRNP-A1. Aim2 focuses on
investigating the mechanism and role of downstream Alox12-driven FAO pathways through which Rpl22 controls
adult HSC function. In pursing these studies, we will integrate cutting edge structural analysis with the unique
strengths of zebrafish and a variety of novel mouse models, and verify core findings in human progenitors.
Together, these studies will provide the first insight into the novel, extraribosomal “moonlighting” functions
through which RP regulate biological processes, and may reveal the basis for the tissue specificity of Rpl22-
dependence displayed by particular hematopoietic processes."
10769844,"Project Summary
Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) by genome editing is a promising therapeutic strategy for β-
hemoglobinopathies. The focus of my work is to better understand the developmental regulation of γ-globin
expression and investigate the genotoxicities associated with genome editing of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) to induce HbF therapeutically. My recent studies have utilized functional genomics to
identify key DNA regulatory motifs in the γ-globin promoter that are essential for gene expression following
therapeutic genome editing or in non-deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). HPFH is a
benign, genetic condition in which point mutations or small deletions cause sustained γ-globin expression in adult
red blood cells. However, the regulation of γ-globin expression normally, and in some forms of HPFH, remain
incompletely defined. In parallel related studies, I have shown in HSPCs that Cas9-induced double-stranded
DNA breaks (DSBs) resulting from therapeutic genome editing to induce HbF can cause chromosome
segregation errors during cell division, leading to micronucleus formation and copy number abnormalities of the
telomeric chromosomal segment. Most cells with these abnormalities should be eliminated by endogenous DNA
damage surveillance mechanisms. However, micronuclei resulting from DSBs can also lead to stable
chromosomal rearrangements, chromothripsis, and malignant transformation. Hence, it is important to determine
whether these abnormalities persist after editing of HSPCs. For this K01 proposal, I will continue my two separate
but related lines of investigation to better understand the regulation of γ-globin transcription and the genotoxicities
associated with therapeutic genome editing to induce HbF. Specifically, I will map a newly discovered regulatory
element in the γ-globin locus and define the epigenetic changes and transcription factors important for deletional
HPFH, which is caused by kilobase-scale deletions of the extended β-globin locus, using population and single-
cell genomics (Aim 1). In parallel, I will investigate whether micronuclei and chromosomal abnormalities persist
after DSBs in HSPCs. Through whole genome sequencing, live-, and fixed-cell immunofluorescence, I will study
Cas9-induced chromosome instability, structural variations, and DNA damage sensing pathways in HSPCs in
vitro with the long-term goal of studying the persistence of chromosomal abnormalities in vivo (Aim 2). The
successful completion of this K01 career development award will form the foundation for my long-term career
goal of establishing an independent research program that investigates the mechanisms of gene regulation and
DNA damage sensing to leverage this information for improved genetic therapies. The proposed research and
training plans within the academic environment will ensure a successful path for independence."
10769894,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nearly 1 in 4 young adults meet Alcohol Use Disorder criteria. Current interventions tend to yield small
effects and there is a lack of efficacious, in-the-moment behavioral interventions. Technology and smartphone
apps have great promise but there are no moderate drinking apps with evidence of efficacy for young adults.
 Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is an important in-the-moment intervention target but estimating
BAC without technology and implementing moderate drinking strategies are both challenging. A recent R21
(AA023368, PI: Leeman) tested 3 moderate drinking technologies as solo interventions. Young adults were
randomized to use 1 of these technologies—1) smartphone breath alcohol device and app; 2) BAC-estimator
app, or 3) self-texting, drink counting procedure—in a lab alcohol self-administration session. While there were
no significant differences in alcohol self-administration based on technology, participants then had open
access to the 3 technologies for a 2-week period. Compared to baseline, participants reported nearly a drink
per drinking day less, on average, in the 2-week period. They used at least 1 form of technology on 72% of
drinking days, and 9 times total, on average, despite only being compensated for using each technology once.
 Participants often used more than 1 form of technology in a drinking episode and described barriers like
forgetting and using certain technologies in some contexts but not others. Based on these findings, the optimal
approach is for the 3 moderate drinking technologies to be developed and tested as a combined intervention.
In developing ways to facilitate moderate drinking technology use, we will explore “higher” and “lower tech”
options. Additional technology may optimize use of the 3 technologies. A new app could help users switch
easily among technologies and facilitate selection based on current context using tools like geospatial location.
However, these 3 technologies do not require much skill or cellular data and some people have limitations with
internet access or cellular data, thus “lower tech” options (e.g., phone alarms as reminders) are also appealing.
 Given the R21 tested the 3 moderate drinking technologies as solo interventions, as a combined
intervention, we lack feasibility data; preliminary efficacy data compared to a control condition; negative
consequence data versus baseline; and data on possible mechanisms. Thus, we need R34 support to formally
develop a combined, multi-modal intervention to prepare for an R01. We propose a 3-stage project, beginning
with formative research (N=25) testing brief, MI-based counseling revised from our R21 study, plus open use
of the 3 moderate drinking technologies for 2 weeks with “lower tech” facilitation and a formative interview. In
Stage 2, we will create an app as “higher-tech” facilitation and design a multi-modal attention control condition.
In Stage 3, we will conduct a pilot RCT to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, usability and preliminary efficacy of
a combined, multi-modal intervention. “Higher” and “lower tech” facilitation will be implemented. This research
will address gaps from lack of precision medicine and efficacious in-the moment intervention for young adults."

The Leukemia Research (LR) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), 
led by John C. Byrd, MD, and Ramiro Garzon, MD, has 57 members from 7 Departments and 4 Colleges 
(Engineering, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine). The LR Program remains focused on the etiology, 
pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of leukemia, with emphases on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). LR has demonstrated 
unique strengths in its ability to translate preclinical findings to clinical testing, and ultimately to clinical 
application. Given the breadth of basic, preclinical, translational and clinical, within the LR Program, we will focus 
on the following two specific aims: 1) To Explore and integrate genetic, epigenetic, non-coding RNAs, and 
immunosuppressive features of leukemic cells in order to enhance risk stratification and target identification; 2) 
To foster preclinical and clinical development of epigenetic, targeted, and immunologic therapeutics directed at 
the causes of leukemic transformation, its progression and ultimate focus on curing these diseases. LR Program 
members published 702 cancer-relevant manuscripts between 12/01/14 and 11/30/19. Of these, 33% were intra- 
programmatic (multiple authors from LR Program), 23% were inter-programmatic (authors from multiple 
OSUCCC Programs), and 77% were multi-institutional (authors from both LR and another institution). The total 
collaborative publications is 88%. LR Program funding stands at $11.7M in overall direct, cancer-focused 
funding, of which $6.3M is peer-reviewed, including $5.1M direct funding from NIH ($4.9M from NCI). Over the 
last 5 years, LR Program members have accrued 8,835 participants to trials; 1,582 to interventional trials 
(including 1,556 therapeutic trials) and 7,253 to non-interventional trials. Future plans include: 1) enhancement 
of collaborative science to further improve the quality of our discovery and translational work; 2) further dissection 
of the genetic subtypes of leukemia to potentially re-define how AML and CLL are classified and treated using 
precision medicine-based approaches; 3) integration of patient-friendly, targeted and immune therapies to 
develop curative treatment approaches; and 4) focused recruiting of mid-level funded investigators with 
dedicated research areas that complement the LR Program and also the Pelotonia Institute for Immuno- 
Oncology. Overall, our program is committed to support the development of a chemotherapy-free approach to 
treat leukemia. Therefore, this strategy will be prioritized over conventional chemotherapy approaches through 
early investigator initiated trials along with the BEAT AML and the Alliance consortia. Through a similar path, an 
MDS trial (Stop MDS™) will be been initiated and will focus on an area of unmet need. Last, our program will 
support the submission of programmatic grants such as SPORE and P01 that will allow us to achieve our 
strategic research goals. This will be achieved by providing pilot funding and coordinating shared resources that 
will facilitate such applications."
10819155,"ABSTRACT: Approximately 5-10% of older adults have aortic stenosis (AS) with anticipated doubling by 2050; with no available medical therapy to slow progression, treatment is limited to aortic valve replacement (AVR). While AVR has historically been reserved for symptomatic severe AS, cardiac remodeling and irreversible injury occur before the onset of symptoms and before AS is ""severe"" and contribute to death and persistent heart failure (HF) symptoms/rehospitalization in up to 40% of patients 1 year after AVR, suggesting that AVR before onset of irreversible changes to the heart is likely to improve post-AVR outcomes. Fortunately, randomized strategy trials are underway to test the benefit of earlier less invasive transcatheter AVR (TAVR) before symptoms and severe AS. However, earlier TAVR isn't a panacea; beyond inherent procedural risks, this will also lead to more repeat procedures (with risks/costs) when prosthetic valves degenerate. Echocardiography and standard biomarkers (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH], BNP) have limited sensitivity/specificity for detecting maladaptive remodeling and lack relevant biological insight. In preparation for this application, we identified circulating proteomic signatures of tissue/global cardiac phenotypes in the heart (e.g. LVH, fibrosis, systolic/diastolic function with cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR]/echo) in a group of 115 individuals across a spectrum of AS (mild to severe), defining subsets of biologically plausible and novel proteins associated with an increased risk of HF/mortality, with validation in a broader at-risk population without AS. Our central hypothesis is that myocardial remodeling/dysfunction early in the course of AS (mild-moderate; asymptomatic severe) will be accompanied by alterations in the circulating proteome pointing to known/novel pathways contributing to HF and providing an early molecular barometer for clinical surveillance and pharmacologic targeting. We will utilize state-of-the-art cardiac imaging alongside high-throughput proteomics on longitudinal samples from four cohorts of AS, including mild to severe asymptomatic AS, controls, pre- and post-TAVR sampling, and two randomized trials to: (1) develop/validate circulating proteomic signatures that reflect adverse myocardial remodeling/dysfunction relevant to AS surveillance and personalized timing of AVR; and (2) identify known/novel pathways underlying cardiac remodeling (before AVR) and cardiac recovery (after AVR) for downstream pharmacological targeting to reduce residual risk from HF. Our specific aims are: (1) identify whether proteomic signatures of myocardial remodeling/dysfunction are present early in AS before traditional clinical thresholds for intervention; (2) identify proteomic signatures of LVH regression after AVR in severe AS; and (3) determine whether proteomic signatures of cardiac health are associated with post-AVR outcomes and able to identify asymptomatic patients who benefit from prompt AVR. If successful, the current application will identify a set of circulating proteins (known/novel) linked to early cardiac remodeling phenotypes in AS for clinical surveillance, precision therapy, mechanistic study, and pharmacologic targeting."

Medication harm is a leading cause of injury and avoidable harm in health care systems across the world. This
is especially true for older adults, who are at higher risk for medication harm, especially around transitions of
care (TOC), as they often take multiple medicines and have several changes made to their medicines during
inpatient admission. There are major gaps and barriers for older adult patients and caregivers to achieve safe
medication use during and after care transitions. This proposed Learning Lab will empower patients and
caregivers in partnership with the healthcare system team, starting with analyzing the existing medication
safety work system, spanning the entire transition of care. This will lead to the design, development, and
testing of scalable human-centered interventions in a simulated environment with input from practicing
clinicians and patients as the end-users, followed by pilot testing in the clinical environment. To accomplish
this, the research team will follow the five-phase, systems-engineering methodology to achieve the following
aims: Aim 1: Problem Analysis – This aim uses a multifaceted approach to identify and understand the
causes and consequences of medication problems in transitions of care, including the needs and priorities of
patients and caregivers, and the operational complexities that shape and constrain care transition work. The
team will: Aim 1(a) study patients’ and caregivers’ experiences with recent hospitalizations, focusing on
medication changes, associated symptoms, and Social Determinants of Health-related challenges; Aim 1(b)
perform cognitive engineering analysis to identify cognitive work challenges and their associated information
needs involved in the care transition work at hospital and primary care sites; and Aim 1(c) use health
information exchange (HIE) data to identify patient- and system-level risk factors and develop risk algorithms
for unplanned hospitalizations and medication harm. Aim 2: (a) Design, Development, (b) Implementation,
and Evaluation. The team will: Aim 2(a) iteratively design and develop patient-driven interventions with inputs
from key stakeholders (e.g., members of the project’s Community Advisory Board); and Aim 2(b) implement
and evaluate promising solutions—first in a simulated environment (with realistic tasks) and subsequently in a
clinical setting. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a cross-system learning laboratory that brings
together older adults, caregivers, researchers, and healthcare teams in innovative ways to protect them from
medication harm. Our approach puts the focus on patients and caregivers, with attention to the Social
Determinants of Health, and engages them extensively in every step of the systems engineering process. The
learning laboratory infrastructure and pilot data from this proposal will create a strong foundation for sustained
stakeholder partnership that will spawn future funded studies to improve medication safety for older adults."

(13% Hispanic, 5% African American); 68% deliver all or part of their clinical services to socio-economically
underserved patient populations, and 9% practice in low to middle income countries. The aims for this
continuation proposal are to: 1) Continue the established annual CCGCoP Intensive Course, 2) Update the
current curriculum and learning assessments, 3) Develop and pilot a Self-directed Review Course to address
the need for course alumni to refresh their knowledge and skills with evidence-based cancer genomics content
and case-based activities 4) Evaluate the Intensive Course and Self-directed Review on participant
engagement, knowledge, case-based skills, learning experience and value to practice, and incorporate into
iterative improvements in the self-directed model. Fulfillment of these aims will further our efforts to grow the
number of clinicians with practitioner-level proficiency in genetic cancer genetics across the U.S. and
internationally. Additionally, our plan to develop and pilot a self-directed cancer genetics review course will
support ongoing quality improvement in GCRA for course alumni, and will serve as a framework for our future
development of a fully self-directed version of the intensive course to reach a broader national and international
audience of healthcare professionals."
10770465,"Abstract
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease. Responses to therapy and prognosis vary significantly
 from patient to patient, and biomarkers that can predict therapy response and prognosis are urgently needed.
 In an attempt to identify metabolic mechanisms of hormonal therapy for PCa, we discovered that
an important function of androgen receptor (AR) in advanced PCa is to upregulate the expression of
glutaminase 1 (GLS1) which is critical for glutamine utilization by cancer cells to compensate for their
inability to produce sufficient ATP and metabolic intermediates from glucose due to the Warburg effect.
Hormonal therapy targeting AR inhibits GLS1 expression and glutamine utilization, starving cells to death.
 GLS1 has two isoforms, kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC). Our work
demonstrates that early stage, hormone-sensitive PCa mostly expresses kidney-type glutaminase (KGA),
the weaker, AR-dependent GLS1 isoform, while late stage, therapy-resistant PCa mostly expresses the more
potent and AR-independent glutaminase C (GAC). We have shown that this switch in the expression of GLS1
isoforms is a molecular basis for the important clinical phenomenon including tumors’ initial sensitivity to
hormonal therapy and the eventual therapy resistance. Importantly, we also observed significant heterogeneity
in the GLS1 isoform expression from case to case. For example, while the majority of hormone sensitive
cancers expresses KGA, a minority expresses GAC. Similarly, while most cases of late stage PCa
express GAC, a minority expresses KGA. The heterogeneous expression of GLS1 isoforms of different
enzymatic activities by PCa of various disease stages was intriguing and prompted us to determine
their possible correlations with the heterogeneous clinical outcomes observed in PCa patients. We will study
the value of GLS1 isoforms as potential biomarkers with the hypothesis that tumors that predominantly express
KGA respond better to hormonal therapy and have better prognosis while those that predominantly express
GAC respond poorly to hormonal therapy and have worse prognosis. This hypothesis will be tested in large,
highly valuable patient tumor cohorts of hormone sensitive prostate cancer and CRPC. Additionally we will
test if differential expression of the GLA isoforms is associated with the two histologic types of PCa,
adenocarcinoma that is AR dependent and usually has a protracted disease course vs small cell neuroendocrine
carcinoma which is AR-independent and rapidly lethal."
10770988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The lack of successful regeneration after injury in the mature central nervous system is due to intrinsic and
environmental obstacles. Though progress in the field has been made, overcoming these barriers to result in
robust functional axon regeneration and recovery is still a significant challenge. We build upon preliminary data
and hypothesize that recurrent DREADD-mediated neuronal activation after injury is a means to enhance
functional axon regeneration. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal activation increases axon
regeneration via both mTOR activation and increasing dynamic microtubules. We will these our hypotheses both
in vitro using adult dorsal root ganglion neuron cultures and in vivo using dorsal root crush, dorsal columns
spinal cord injury (SCI)/peripheral nerve graft (PNG), and incomplete cervical SCI/PNG models. In Aim 1, we
will elucidate how repeated, chemogenetic neuronal activation enhances axon regeneration. In Aim 2, we will
assess if neuronal activation – alone or in combination with manipulations that increase dynamic microtubules

behind how neuronal activation enhances growth, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets; 2) determine
the extent to which neuronal activation enhances regeneration in different injury models (dorsal root crush, SCI);
3) determine if neuronal activation has disparate or similar effects in different populations of neurons (DRG vs.
CNS); 4) test whether meaningful axonal regeneration is facilitated using a unique, multi-faceted approach
that: a) uses chemogenetic neuronal activation – possibly along with further increasing dynamic microtubules
and/or mTOR activation – to enhance the axonal growth response; b) provides a more growth-permissive
environment after an injury (i.e. mitigation of the inhibitory matrix of the glial scar with chondroitinase;
transplantation of a PNG into an SCI cavity; chondroitinase digestion of plasticity-limiting perineuronal nets).
After the completion of these experiments, we will have identified novel therapeutic avenues to foster functional

10831917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The lack of successful regeneration after injury in the mature central nervous system is due to intrinsic and
environmental obstacles. Though progress in the field has been made, overcoming these barriers to result in
robust functional axon regeneration and recovery is still a significant challenge. We build upon preliminary data
and hypothesize that recurrent DREADD-mediated neuronal activation after injury is a means to enhance
functional axon regeneration. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal activation increases axon
regeneration via both mTOR activation and increasing dynamic microtubules. We will these our hypotheses both
in vitro using adult dorsal root ganglion neuron cultures and in vivo using dorsal root crush, dorsal columns
spinal cord injury (SCI)/peripheral nerve graft (PNG), and incomplete cervical SCI/PNG models. In Aim 1, we
will elucidate how repeated, chemogenetic neuronal activation enhances axon regeneration. In Aim 2, we will
assess if neuronal activation – alone or in combination with manipulations that increase dynamic microtubules
and mTOR activation – promotes functional axon regeneration. Collectively, we will: 1) elucidate mechanisms
behind how neuronal activation enhances growth, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets; 2) determine
the extent to which neuronal activation enhances regeneration in different injury models (dorsal root crush, SCI);
3) determine if neuronal activation has disparate or similar effects in different populations of neurons (DRG vs.
CNS); 4) test whether meaningful axonal regeneration is facilitated using a unique, multi-faceted approach
that: a) uses chemogenetic neuronal activation – possibly along with further increasing dynamic microtubules

repair after SCI."
10769111,"Project Summary/Abstract
We propose a training program that will recruit two postdoctoral scholars per year for a two-year fellowship
devoted to research on the pathophysiology of trauma. The goals of this training program are to nurture
talented individuals in the areas of basic, translational, and clinical investigation, to teach them to design and
implement successful research projects, and to provide them a background in the ethics and methods of
scientific research. We are particularly interested in training individuals who will become the next generation of
investigators in several areas related to the physiologic response to and recovery from trauma, burn, and
traumatic shock, such as inflammatory and immunologic factors, resuscitative mechanisms, sepsis,
hemorrhagic shock, organ system dysfunction, and wound healing and regeneration.
The training program includes two years of full-time effort conducting research under the supervision of one or
more of a large group of talented Research Training Faculty mentors, often involving collaboration across
disciplines and departments. Trainee appointments begin with a three-day course in the Responsible Conduct
of Research and in several other training activities geared toward protection of the rights and welfare of and
the regulatory requirements for conducting research with human subjects and for the humane care and use of
laboratory animals. In addition, fellows complete a Master’s of Public Health (MPH) degree, with an emphasis
in biostatistics, critical appraisal of medical literature, research methodology, project management, and
grantsmanship, as well as ongoing weekly seminars. Trainees are required to present their research at grand
rounds and research conferences, to submit abstracts to national meetings, and to publish their work.
Program leadership includes a Training Advisory Committee to assist the Program Director in recruiting and
selecting trainees, approving trainee research and didactic plans, matching trainees with Research Training
Faculty, and monitoring of program activities, and a Program Evaluation Committee to provide overall program
evaluation. The Diversity Recruitment and Retention Committee assists the Program Co-Director in efforts to
attract and retain members of underrepresented groups to increase the diversity of the training program.
All of the Research Training Faculty in the program are established investigators with current NIH or other
extramural funding and are experienced mentors of physician-scientists. Faculty members have diverse
interests, allowing multiple candidates to find appropriate mentors within the training program, and there is a
strong institutional history of multidisciplinary collaboration. Clinician-Scientist mentors provide career
guidance and additional support to trainees with regard to the multiple roles filled by contemporary academic
trauma and burn surgeons involved in research, clinical, educational, and outreach activities.
There is a growing demand for academic trauma and burn surgeons to guide subsequent generations of
providers and lead the development of innovative treatments. This grant is designed to help meet this need."

This new T32 training program in Immune Dysregulation is designed to successfully train the next generation of
Physician-Scientists, working at the interface of normal and pathologic immune function with end organ damage
to elucidate the root causes of immune dysregulation syndromes and to develop novel approaches towards their
diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. The program requests the support of 4 physician-scientist postdoctoral
trainees, who are competitively selected from various clinical fellowship programs at the Hospital of the University
of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Selection criteria include high
standards of competence, motivation and perseverance, and a strong commitment to a research career in
immunobiology. Recruitment of qualified, diversity trainees that includes URM is high priority.
 This program uniquely provides training in both adult and childhood immune diseases as it sits at the
nexus of Penn and CHOP and takes advantage of the Institute for Immunology, specialized centers in
Autoimmunity, and the Frontier Program in Immune Dysregulation to offer multi-disciplinary training in both basic
and translational research related to immune dysregulation. The program will be directed by 3 physician
scientists (Drs. Taku Kambayashi, Edward Behrens, and Warren Pear). Dr. Kambayashi will be responsible for
trainees at Penn. Dr. Kambayashi is a physician scientist in Transfusion Medicine and serves as a program
advisor for the MSTP program, the chair of the Immunology Graduate Group, and the director of the Physician
Scientist Program for Pathology residency. Dr. Behrens will be responsible for trainees at CHOP. Dr. Behrens is
a physician scientist in Rheumatology and serves as the Chief of Pediatric Rheumatology at CHOP. Dr. Pear
will provide general program oversight as the most senior member of the co-program directors. He is a physician
scientist in Molecular Pathology and serves as the Deputy Director of the IFI, Vice Chair of Research for the
Department of Pathology, and co-leader of the Immunology Program in the Abramson Cancer Institute. All co-
program directors run a successful NIH-funded lab in basic and translational immunology. The program will also
consist of an administrative structure that oversees the needs and improvement of the training program, assisted
by an Executive Committee, Internal Advisory Board, and an External Advisory Board.
 There are 25 faculty trainers to match the 4 requested postdoctoral slots. Diverse areas of research in
immune dysregulation are represented amongst our participating faculty trainers, ranging from immunity against
infection, autoimmunity, molecular and cellular immunology in various organ systems. Each faculty trainer
(except for the 3 junior trainers) has extensive experience in mentoring post-doctoral fellows into science-
oriented careers. As a catalyst for developing the next generation of principal investigators, this training program
will impact directly on improving treatment, decreasing costs, and most importantly, improving the lives of
patients with immune dysregulation, all of which are directly relevant to public health."
10773005,"Red blood cells (RBCs) play a vital role in gas transport—carrying O2 from the alveolar air to systemic tissues,
and CO2 in the opposite direction. Their task is central to many diseases of major public-health relevance, in-
cluding including heart failure, pulmonary disease (including COVID-19), vascular disease, and sepsis (hy-
poperfusion). An important component in the movement of these gases within the body is the transport of these
gases across of the plasma membrane (PM) of the RBCs. The dogma had been that all gases cross all mem-
branes merely by dissolving in and diffusing through membrane lipids. However, challenging this dogma was the
discovery of the first CO2 impermeable membranes, and the first evidence that a gas (CO2) moves through a
membrane protein (the water channel aquaporin 1, AQP1). In human RBCs, aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the Rh
complex (including RhAG) account for 90% of membrane CO2 permeability. Preliminary data on O2-offloading
from RBCs from knockout (KO) suggests that these two channels, together, are responsible for ~55% of O2
permeability (PM,O2). The addition of the membrane-impermeant inhibitor pCMBS to RBCs from the double-
knockout (dKO) mouse reduces PM,O2 by ~90%. Aging mice appear to gradually undergo a decrease in PM,O2 that
does not occur in dKOs. A surprising preliminary observation is that the knockout (KO) of one or both of these
channels reduces maximal O2 uptake rate (V?O2 max) without decreasing—and, in fact, often increasing—running
performance. This grant has two aims. Aim 1 is to determine the extent to which channels vs. lipid composition
contribute to the rate of O2 offloading (kHbO2). One approach is to study aging wild-type (WT) vs. KO mice. Another
is to examine mice with RBCs genetically depleted or replete in AE1, or depleted in MCT1. The third approach
is to examine mice of disease models or widely different genetic background. In each case, the investigators will
examine hematology, RBC size and shape, proteomics, lipidomics, and genomics. 3D macroscopic mathemati-
cal modeling will play a central role in data interpretation. Finally, the investigators will use exercise protocols to
to determine V?O2 max, critical speed, exercise economy, and speed of V?O2 kinetics. They will also examine cardio-
vascular and muscle parameters. In Aim 2, the goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of O2 movement
through AQP1, RhAG, and candidate O2 channels (e.g., AE1). The investigators will use an iterative approach,
the first step of which involves identifying prioritizing missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well
as other mutations that come forward in Aim 1. The investigators will use a novel neutral buoyance assay to
measure O2 uptake into oocytes and thereby assess these mutants channels. Molecular dynamics and molecular
biophysics will complete the iteration before choosing additional laboratory mutation for analysis. The proposed
research will reorganize thinking about O2 carriage by blood and could lead to therapies to improve exercise in
patients with diminished exercise capacity."
10773007,"Project Summary
Our chromosomes are continually bombarded with a variety of insults, resulting in damage that must be
repaired. By necessity, cells have evolved mechanisms to detect and repair broken strands of DNA, thereby
preventing loss of important genetic information. Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are a type of
damage that can result in particularly disastrous outcomes. If not corrected, DSBs can lead to gross
chromosomal rearrangements, which are the hallmark of all forms of cancer. Indeed, defects in HR-related
proteins are associated with several severe genetic diseases. Patients with these diseases often exhibit a
strong predisposition for developing cancers due to a loss of genome integrity. Surprisingly, DNA
replication is the primary source of DSBs, and as a consequence rapidly growing cells are especially
dependent upon homologous DNA recombination for survival. This dependence upon homologous
recombination for the survival of rapidly growing cells highlights the potential for using recombination
inhibitors as highly selective anti-cancer therapies. To exploit the clinical potential of homologous
recombination inhibitors it will be essential that we more fully understand the molecular underpinnings of
the proteins that are involved in regulating and controlling recombination.
 To help better understand the molecular basis of homologous DNA recombination we have developed
powerful new experimental platforms that allow us to directly visualize hundreds of individual DNA
molecules at the single molecule level. We are utilizing these unique research tools to probe the fundamental
basis for protein-nucleic acid interactions, with emphasis placed upon understanding reactions relevant to
human biology and disease. We have used these assays to study human RAD51, which binds to single-
stranded DNA forming a key recombination intermediate called the presynaptic complex. Here, we will
assess how complexes containing the tumor suppressor protein complexes BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2-
DSS1, and PALB2 promote homologous recombination by regulating the activities of the RAD51
presynaptic complex. We will also examine how the protein RAD52, which newly recognized as an
important target for anti-cancer drugs, interacts with RAD51, BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2-DSS1, and
PALB2. We will also study the protein RADX, which is emerging as a key player in genome integrity which
functions to downregulate RAD51 activity. We will accomplish these goals by directly visualizing these
processes in real-time using optical microscopy. These studies offer the potential for significant new
insights into how BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2-DSS1, PALB2 and RAD52 regulate homologous
recombination and support human genome integrity."

 Resistance to therapeutic agents is the predominant cause of high lethality of pancreatic cancer (PC).
Inadequate and heterogeneous blood flow and obstructive desmoplastic stromal compartment are the major
impediments to the delivery and intratumoral distribution of therapeutic agents and are the extrinsic determinants
of therapy resistance in PC. Intrinsic chemoresistance of PC cells is dictated by a unique population of drug
resistant cancer stem cells. Hence selective modulation of blood flow and extracellular matrix can lead to
improved delivery of therapeutic agents into the tumors, while elimination of CSCs can improve the sensitivity of
tumor cells to chemotherapy. Elevated endothelin (ET)-1 levels and overexpression of the two ET receptors
(ETAR and ETBR) are observed in tumors. Importantly, ET-1 is a strong vasomodulator and induces
vasoconstriction via ETAR is believed to be an important contributor to the tumor blood flow heterogeneity in
tumors. Our preliminary studies indicate that the components of ET-axis are expressed in pancreatic tumors in
various components of TME including tumor cells, blood vessel and stromal cells and CSCs. Further, targeting
of ETAR with a specific inhibitor BQ123 selectively enhanced perfusion and reduced hypoxia in xenograft
PC tumors, while prolonged inhibition of ET-axis in autochthonous tumors (in KPC mouse model of PC) with
dual specificity inhibitor (Bosentan) resulted in marked inhibition of desmoplasia. We also observed that ET-
1 exerts pro-fibrogenic effects on murine pancreatic stellate cells via ETBR. We hypothesize that: “Sequential
inhibition of ETBR and ETAR can modulate stroma and perfusion for enhanced delivery, distribution and efficacy
of therapeutic agents and clinically, combination of abraxane and gemcitabine will be more efficacious with the
modulation of ET axis”. Three specific aims are proposed. Studies in Aim 1 will determine the effect of selective
ETAR and ETBR antagonists BQ123 and BQ788, on the delivery and distribution of macromolecule (ABX) and
small molecule-based (GEM) therapeutic agents. Biodistribution of radiolabeled ABX and GEM will be studied
for quantitative estimation of tumor uptake. Further, we will decipher the mechanistic role of ET-axis-mediated
cross-talk between cancer and stromal cells in PC in the context of desmoplasia. Studies proposed in Aim 2 will
determine the impact of ET-axis targeting on the efficacy of ABX+GEM both in vitro (using unique cancer cell-
stellate cell co-cultures and tumor organoid cultures) and in vivo using genetically engineered mouse (KPC)
model of PC. Finally, Aim 3 is designed to clinically evaluate the safety and perform initial screening for efficacy
of combining the ET-axis antagonist Bosentan with FDA-approved combination therapy Gemcitabine (GEM) plus
Abrexane (ABX) in PC patients. Altogether, the proposed studies will demonstrate the preclinical feasibility of
eliminating both extrinsic and intrinsic determinants of therapy resistance by targeting a single signaling axis and
clinically determine the safety of combining ET-axis antagonism with approved chemotherapeutic regimens of
PC. The data generated from the three aims will form the basis of future Phase 1/II clinical trials in lethal PC."

American Indians (AI) have the largest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the nation with double the
prevalence compared to non-AIs. Programs developed and implemented in the general population to prevent
CVD may not be appropriate or effective for AI populations due to unique environmental barriers and cultural
differences. The PI, a member of the Cherokee nation, proposes a career development plan and research to
facilitate her development into a leader in interventions to prevent CVD and other negative health outcomes
among American Indians. The first specific aim is to adapt an existing Cherokee program to maximize reach to
more Cherokee Nation citizens and address primary prevention of CVD in Cherokee Nation (CN) adults. The
second aim is to conduct a pilot study to demonstrate acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention.
The third aim is to complete a rigorous career development plan including mentoring plans, training plans, and
pertinent coursework. The community-based participatory research project is centered in Tahlequah, Oklahoma
with the Cherokee Nation and built on a three-year research relationship between the tribe and the PI. Over this
time, the PI has worked with this community to evaluate a current Cherokee-created program, Remember the
Removal, that aims to improve the health and well-being of select young adult citizens through programs that
teach Cherokee culture, language and history along with improving diet and exercise. The new program, Journey
of Cherokees, to be developed with community participation, will build on the prior program’s foundation but
include expanded enrollment capacity, a larger age range, and flexible physical activity programs. The goal of
the proposed project is to advance the science of community-partnered generation of culturally specific health
interventions by promoting the power of cultural learning and cultural revitalization. The proposed research and
career development plan will position the PI to obtain R01 funding within the 5-year study period, and to become
a nationally recognized leader in innovative lifestyle interventions for preventing CVD and other negative health
outcomes among AIs."

Sperm must be motile and complete capacitation to be able to fertilize the oocyte. Both processes require
soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). sAC knockout mice are male specific sterile, and men with mutations which
disrupt sAC are infertile. In both mice and men, there are no other immediate phenotypes; thus, an acutely
acting sAC inhibitor which blocks sperm functions for hours would be an effective on-demand male
contraceptive without eliciting mechanism-based side effects that only manifest when sAC is absent for
months or years. Such a male birth control pill would be taken only when, and as often as, needed, shortly
before sex. The goal of the Weill Cornell Medicine Contraception Research Center (WCM-CRC) is to
develop acutely acting sAC inhibitors into on-demand birth control pills. Project 1 of the WCM-CRC
proposes lead optimization of a chemical series already validated in a preclinical animal model. In this
Contraception Development Research Project, we propose to develop additional leads, starting from
scaffolds structurally distinct from the series optimized in Project 1, into selective, potent, drug-like sAC
inhibitors. We propose to leverage our proven workflow of structure-based drug design along with
functional testing, to refine these novel chemical scaffolds into inhibitors with increased potency, selectivity,
long residence times, and drug-like properties. The ultimate goal of this Project is to develop additional,
structurally unrelated, sAC inhibitors as lead compounds to be subjected to the pipeline of refinement
cycles and in vivo studies described in other projects of this WCM-CRC."

The Physiology Core provides a series of graded technologies and expertise to investigators who wish to
address fundamental questions about transport processes that occur in the tubular structures of the nephron
and other relevant systems. To gain understanding of biological processes that mediate kidney function in
health and disease states, in light of the phenotypic diversity and functional complexity of this organ, the use of
strategies that allow specific nephron segments/cells/proteins to be studied in isolation under defined
conditions is required. The Core, through its three Subcores, offers expertise and state-of-the-art technologies
for studying the function and regulation of transport and other membrane resident proteins with progressive
degrees of complexity from single molecules to model systems to native epithelia. The Single Tubule and
Microperfusion Subcore provides tools and technologies to study the function and expression of transport
proteins and associated regulatory pathways in single nephron segments isolated from small mammals and
kidney organoids. The Electrophysiology Subcore provides expertise and a toolbox of electrophysiological
approaches to study the function and regulation of transport proteins at the molecular and cellular levels in
model systems and native epithelia. The Live-Cell Imaging Subcore offers imaging tools and technologies to
assess ion transport, changes in membrane potential, cellular volume, intracellular mediators, and signaling
molecules in immortalized cells and native preparations using chemical and genetically encoded fluorescent
sensors. The Core will apply a multipronged approach and collaborate with the O’Brien Consortium to share
specialized resources and technologies throughout the kidney research community, to lower the barrier to
entry for early-stage investigators and researchers new to the kidney field, and to advance kidney research
and discovery nationwide."

ABSTRACT
Kidney health equity is a growing area of research interest in the scientific community, and new resources are
needed to ensure this work harnesses the full spectrum of research (basic, clinical, and translational) with
excellence and rigor. The Resource Development Core (RDC; Co-Directors: Joe Coresh, MD, PhD and Jen
Pluznick, PhD) of the Johns Hopkins O’Brien Center to Advance Kidney Health Equity will develop new and
refine existing resources for the conduct of basic and clinical research relevant to kidney health equity. Mature
resources will be transferred to the Biomedical Resource Core (BRC) and shared with the broader scientific
community. We will work to anticipate the needs of the research community so that we appropriately prioritize
investments and will continuously develop new ideas at Johns Hopkins as part of a dynamic incubator space
connected to national needs. The RDC will validate all new resources and share them with the BRC for
maintenance and local and national dissemination. We will leverage the strength of Johns Hopkins in kidney
health equity which spans from basic science to clinical science to epidemiology, to advance two Aims. In Aim
1, we will develop new clinical science resources to advance kidney health equity. In this aim, we will build on
a strong foundation in this area in order to innovate and build new resources including metrics of social
determinants of health designed to generate momentum towards equity, validating and interpreting proteomic
findings, and including and calibrating risk equations to social determinants of health. In Aim 2, we will
develop new basic science resources which uncover mechanisms underpinning kidney health inequity. In
Year 1, our basic science efforts will focus on establishing two key resources for the research community
focused on brain-kidney crosstalk during social stressors, and gut microbiota and sex differences. We will
work to not only make mouse models widely available through the BRC, but critically, will also develop Sample
Banks (including tissues, blood, and urine) through which researchers can easily explore these models with
minimal logistical and financial burden. In Years 2-5, we will establish new models addressing kidney health
equity and likewise transfer to the BRC both mice and Sample Banks. Together, the two Aims of this proposal
will provide new resources to propel forward research addressing kidney health equity."

ABSTRACT
Disparities in kidney health are profound; and for decades, have been documented for socially marginalized
populations, yet little progress has been made to mitigate them. The overarching goal of the Johns Hopkins
O’Brien Center to Advance Kidney Health Equity (JHOC) is to harness the collective expertise of basic, clinical
and translational researchers at Johns Hopkins to serve as a national resource for investigators addressing the
fundamental question of: what are the underlying mechanisms responsible for profound disparities in kidney
health and how can they be mitigated? We will leverage the strengths and existing infrastructure of the Johns
Hopkins Division of Nephrology, the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research and the
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. JHOC will include; 3 integrated cores (Administrative, Biomedical
Resource and Resource Development); an Executive Committee; an Internal Advisory Committee, and a
Community Advisory Board. Together, we will (1) provide an innovative portfolio of research services,
resources, and tools for investigators to understand and ameliorate disparities in kidney disease; (2) develop
new and refine existing resources as part of a dynamic incubator space for the conduct of basic and clinical
research relevant to advancing kidney health equity; (3) transfer mature resources to the Biomedical Resource
Core to be shared with the community; (4) plan and execute an annual Summer Student Enrichment Program
which leverages a long-standing partnership with a Johns Hopkins program for students from
socioeconomically under-resourced backgrounds; (5) foster the careers of early-stage investigators by
promoting trans-disciplinary and cross-sector collaboration that will attract investigators from fields not
traditionally involved in kidney health equity research; and (6) collaborate with the National Coordinating
Center to prioritize external requests for resources and enhance national outreach. JHOC will support
investigators conducting pre-clinical (basic), clinical or population health research addressing kidney health
disparities, and will make recommendations to inform strategies, interventions, and approaches aimed at
achieving kidney health equity."

Project Summary
The widespread and increasing use of targeted kidney gene panels, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the genetic bases for chronic kidney disease and other kidney disorders has led to a much better understanding of the etiology of monogenic diseases. These approaches have provided patients with clear genetic diagnoses and in many cases have led to improved clinical care. In addition, having a genetic diagnosis has allowed patients to consider informing their relatives that they might also be affected. But there are many single nucleotide variants that have been discovered that are neither clearly pathogenic nor clearly benign; these are termed variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The aim of the proposed Variant Validation Core (VVC) is to investigate VUS discovered in patients with kidney disease or a kidney developmental disorder for potential pathogenicity. The WC will assist users in the efficient and cost-effective determination of the potential for pathogenicity of DNA/RNA/protein variants discovered in patients that cannot be classified as pathogenic or benign. The VVC will use in silica and cell culture approaches to assay protein function, RNA splicing, and gene expression by comparing wild-type to variants. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing will be used to generate appropriate mouse models carrying VUS; these will be analyzed for kidney disease or disorders. The experimental approach for each VUS brought to the VVC by a user will be tailored for 1) the particular gene and protein that are potentially involved; and 2) the particular disease or disorder that would likely develop if the VUS is indeed pathogenic. The VVC will be a valuable national resource for both clinicians and researchers who find VUS as part of routine clinical care or in larger research studies aimed at defining the genetic bases for diverse kidney diseases. The results of the experiments carried out by the VVC will be directly relevant to patient diagnosis and may be informative for clinical care, thus potentially impacting both patients and their families. The VVC will interact with the other O'Brien Cores at Washington University and will coordinate with the National O'Brien Consortium and Steering Committee to provide the highest quality services for users."
10915653,"Project Summary/Abstract: Metabolism Core
The Metabolism Core (Meta-Core) is a Biomedical Resource Core within the Washington University Chronic
Kidney Disease National Resource Center. Chronically injured kidneys have altered metabolism, and recent
data suggests that these metabolic changes play a causative role in progressive decline in kidney function.
The ability to interrogate metabolism is crucial to understanding chronic kidney disease pathophysiology, but
there are a number of barriers for kidney researchers to do so. First, many investigators interested in chronic
kidney disease do not have expertise in metabolism and metabolic assays. Second, many of these assays
require expensive equipment not readily available to many labs. To address these issues, the Meta-Core
faculty consisting of Leslie Gewin, M.D., Core Director, Brian Finck, Ph.D., Associate Core Director, Gary Patti,
Ph.D., Core Collaborator, and Leah Shriver, Ph.D., Core Collaborator, will perform consultations with Meta-
Core users to guide and design the best metabolic assay to answer the research question. Several assays will
be available to the Meta-Core users to interrogate metabolism at the cellular or whole kidney level. These
assays include Seahorse bioflux analyses with the use of primary cells or freshly isolated tubules ex vivo, both
more representative of the highly oxidative proximal tubules than commercially available primary human tubule
cells or conditionally immortalized tubule cells. We can measure oxidation of fatty acids or glucose/pyruvate in
kidney tissue ex vivo using radioactive substrate oxidation assays. The 3H-palmitate assay, not often
performed on kidney tissue, has advantages over the more commonly used 14C-palmitate assay as it detects
complete oxidation of long chain fatty acids through the electron transport chain and is easier to perform
(collect 3H2O rather than 14CO2). We can also refer users to the Nutrition Obesity Research Center’s high-
resolution respirometer (Oroboros Oxygraph 2k) to detect respiration in isolated mitochondria. In addition,
untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracer studies will be performed on primary cells in vitro and in
vivo. The Meta-Core faculty are all committed to sharing validated protocols and methods with the O’Brien
Consortium as well as larger scientific community. In addition, we will help train the kidney scientific community
how to generate primary proximal tubule cells and tubules and use the Seahorse bioflux analysis in a way that
yields consistent, reproducible results. In particular, the importance of validating cell number to use, post-
analysis correction for number of cells, and proper concentrations of reagents will be emphasized. The Meta-
Core will leverage the expertise and equipment of other Cores at Washington University to produce
complementary services for a reduced rate."
10772342,"Precise duplication of our genome and appropriate cellular response to genotoxic stress is critical to
maintaining genome stability. Origin Recognition Complex (ORC, composed of six subunits) and ORC-
Associated (ORCA) are required to initiate DNA replication and regulate heterochromatin organization. Multiple
subcomplexes of ORC and/or individual ORC subunits regulate different aspects of cell cycle progression and
thus play pivotal roles in the maintenance of genomic stability. In the last two decades, my (and my group’s)
research effort has been instrumental in understanding how these multitalented ORC proteins govern origin-
independent roles during the cell cycle. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand how ORC
executes and coordinates various aspects of cell growth, proliferation and survival. With our expertise and
experience in cell biological and biochemical characterization of ORC and strong preliminary data, we are
ideally positioned to pursue the following two projects: 1) The role of the smallest subunit of ORC, Orc6, in
replication progression and mismatch repair (MMR) 2) The role of pre RC factors in regulating DNA
damage response (DDR) and chromatin organization during G1. The smallest and the most enigmatic
ORC protein, human Orc6 is required for DNA replication and also coordinates cytokinesis. Our recent work
has shown the dispensability of human Orc6 in DNA replication licensing and identified an unexpected role for
human Orc6, which is to promote S-phase progression post pre-RC assembly and in MMR. The scientific
premise of program projects is based on data from our lab that ORC is required for licensing-independent roles
in DNA damage response. Our experiments are critical to establishing the new paradigm emerging ‘is human
Orc6 a component of ORC?’ We propose that hOrc6 plays a fundamental role in genome surveillance during
S-phase. The objective of project 1 is to answer fundamental questions on the biochemical roles of Orc6 in
regulating S-phase and during MMR. Our unpublished work shows that the largest subunit of human ORC,
hOrc1, shows robust accumulation at sites of laser-induced DNA damage. Orc1 is an AAA+ ATPase,
possesses a BAH domain, and binds to chromatin by associating with various post-translationally modified
histones. The objective of project 2 is to understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of ORC in DDR
and chromatin organization, using Orc1 as a tool, we probe into the coordination of these processes. This
proposal is conceptually innovative because we will rigorously dissect novel regulatory mechanisms of ORC
function in DDR and chromatin organization. This proposal is technologically innovative because it employs
state-of-the-art cell biological techniques, including super-resolution imaging combined with biochemical and
single-molecule biophysical approaches. Understanding how ORC governs multiple pathways, including DNA
replication, mitosis, and DDR is expected to uncover novel pathways that would be useful to prevent
tumorigenesis and key to allowing more effective therapeutic targeting to combat cancer."

Survival of children with single ventricles (“half a heart”) beyond the neonatal period has increased dramatically
with the staged Fontan palliation. Yet, long-term morbidity remains high. By the age of 40, 50% of Fontan patients
will have died or undergone heart transplantation. With >1,000 Fontan palliations performed in the US annually,
there is a burgeoning population of Fontan patients at risk for progressive heart failure and death. Factors that
contribute to onset and progression of heart failure in Fontan patients remain incompletely understood. However,
it is established that Fontan patients have poor exercise capacity, associated with a greater risk of morbidity and
mortality, in addition to decreased muscle mass, abnormal muscle function, and endothelial dysfunction
contributing to disease progression. In adult patients with two ventricles and heart failure, reduced exercise
capacity, muscle mass, and muscle strength are powerful predictors of poor outcomes, and exercise
interventions can not only improve exercise capacity and muscle mass, but also reverse endothelial dysfunction.
Limited exercise interventions in children with congenital heart disease have demonstrated that exercise is safe
and effective; however, these studies have been conducted in small, heterogeneous groups, and most had few
Fontan patients. Furthermore, none of these interventions have studied the impact of exercise on muscle mass
or mitochondrial function, or endothelial function. We propose a milestone-driven, randomized controlled
trial in pediatric Fontan patients to test the hypothesis that a live-video-supervised exercise (aerobic +
resistance) intervention will improve cardiac and physical capacity; muscle mass, strength and function;
and endothelial function. Adherence is a major limitation in pediatric exercise interventions delivered on-site,
with adherence rates as low as 10%, due to distance from site, transportation difficulties, and missed school or
work days. To overcome these challenges, we will utilize live-video conferencing to deliver the supervised
exercise sessions. In our pilot exercise interventions, this approach resulted in excellent adherence (>85%)
and improved exercise capacity and endothelial function. This proposal is designed to determine if the
intervention improves: (Aim 1) cardiac and physical capacity (primary outcome: VO2 max), (Aim 2) muscle mass
strength and function; and (Aim 3) endothelial function in pediatric Fontan patients. Our multidisciplinary team of
experts will assess the effectiveness of a live-video-supervised exercise intervention, rigorously designed to
maximize adherence and improve key and novel measures of health in pediatric Fontan patients associated with
poor long-term outcomes. The use of exercise as a non-pharmacologic treatment modality in pediatric Fontan
patients represents a paradigm shift, where standard therapies have failed. Our ultimate goal is the translation
of this model to clinical application as an ”exercise prescription” to intervene early in pediatric Fontan patients
and decrease long-term morbidity and mortality, in alignment with the NIH’s mission to develop evidence-based
data for new approaches to improve outcomes in youth with chronic conditions."

 Opioids and cannabinoids are the two most widely used and misused drug classes. Worldwide, an
estimated 53 million people misuse opioids. In the US, 2.6 million individuals meet criteria for opioid use
disorder and nearly 47,000 people died in 2019 due to opioid overdose. At the same time, global cannabis
(i.e., marijuana) use is also at record high levels - in 2018, 43.5 million individuals in the US reported past-year
cannabis use. Despite high rates of both licit and illicit use of these drug classes, there are no controlled data
on the effects of cannabis in one of the most high-risk groups – individuals with opioid use disorder. Thus, the
current project aims to explore how both acute (Study 1) and repeated (Study 2) cannabis administration
impacts 1) opioid abuse potential, 2) opioid withdrawal severity, and 3) opioid safety/physiological effects. Two
independent inpatient studies will be conducted during this 4-year project and each will utilize a randomized,
within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and will enroll samples of participants with moderate to
severe opioid use disorder (with current physical dependence) and limited past-month cannabis use. Study 1
will examine the effects of 7 acute cannabis doses, including a 6-fold dose range of THC (5, 10, 20, 30 mg),
THC/CBD doses across a 3-fold dose range (10:10 mg; 30:30 mg THC:CBD) and matched placebo on
outcomes related to 1) opioid abuse liability (i.e., ratings of high, drug liking) during an acute opioid challenge,
2) withdrawal severity (during acute instances of opioid withdrawal), and 3) safety/physiological effects (e.g.,
respiratory drive) of the drug conditions and combinations. Study 2 will explore the effects of repeated inhaled
cannabis (3 times/day for 6.5 consecutive days), across three randomized dosing blocks (two active cannabis
doses, matched placebo), to determine how a repeated cannabis dosing model impacts outcomes related to 1)
opioid abuse potential (i.e., ratings of high, drug liking) assessed during an acute opioid challenge; 2)
withdrawal severity (measured during acute instances of opioid withdrawal), 3) safety/physiological effects
(e.g., respiratory drive) of the drug conditions and combinations; and 4) cannabis tolerance and withdrawal.
Cannabis modulation of sleep quality during bouts of acute opioid withdrawal will also be explored. Both
studies will employ a full complement of pharmacodynamic outcomes, including subjective and observer-rated
measures, as well as a full battery of physiological and psychomotor outcomes related to safety and
impairment to fully assess the potential risk/benefit profile of cannabis in OUD. Overall, these timely and
innovative studies will provide the first empirical data on the effects of inhaled cannabis in an opioid-dependent
population. These studies will provide new controlled information on potential interactions relevant to clinical
practice, prescribing, and public safety."

 Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, epidemiologic data estimates about 2 billion people globally
are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Approximately 350 million people are chronic HBV carriers and at high
risk for the development of hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current anti-HBV treatment
options suppress the virus but do not eliminate the virus, requiring costly lifetime therapy. All FDA approved
therapeutic approaches fail to target the HBV covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA; associated with viral
persistence) or the virus capsid which is essential for virus proliferation. Our approach in this application is to
target capsid assembly, which is essential for replication, as DNA synthesis from cccDNA occurs exclusively
within the capsid encoded particle. HBV core proteins (Cp) constitute the subunits in viral capsid assembly and
Capsid Assembly Modulators (CAM) accelerate the kinetics of capsid assembly whereby they prevent pol-
pgRNA complex encapsidation and block HBV replication. CAMs also interfere with cccDNA transcription/de
novo formation during early steps of infection. As part of our ongoing HBV CAM discovery program NIH-
supported over the last 4 years, we have been successful in developing several highly potent (sub-micromolar)
class II CAMs with one of our lead compounds entering phase 1 clinical trials in October 2020. However, there
are numerous hurdles that could derail our efforts towards FDA approval. Here, we describe for the first time a
novel class of homo or hetero-dimer CAM displaying selective anti-HBV activity in culture in the picomolar range.
Because a dimeric structure linking two CAM moieties can interact with two distinct sites of one capsid or
eventually connect two (or more) capsids together, we hypothesized that these compounds would have a more
profound impact on HBV capsid assembly than known class I or II CAMs. Based on the potency and the unique
mode of action (MoA) we termed our new compounds as “class III” CAMs. We propose to evaluate these class
III CAMs by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To chemically optimize and characterize a unique series of CAM
homo/heterodimers made from novel monomers; 2) To characterize (structurally, biochemically, and biologically)
novel CAM homo/heterodimer binding interaction with HBV capsid; 3) To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) and
in vivo efficacy of novel CAM homo and heterodimers. Novel homo and heterodimers will be synthesized and
evaluated to reach maximum potency and drug-like properties. To differentiate our compounds from existing
class I and II CAMs, we will characterize structural and dynamical effects of our new CAMs by determining a)
their effect on the morphology of HBV capsids and their localization within cells, b) binding to HBV wild-type and
known mutant Cp, c) resistance profile and activity against major CAM resistant HBV strains and d) intra- or
inter-capsid connections. Results from the proposed studies will validate our novel class III CAM, which, when
combined with other modalities will provide pre-clinical proof of concept towards a novel therapeutic strategy to
eliminate HBV while reducing treatment duration and progression to HCC."
10774374,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although ovarian aging is a natural physiological process, cessation of ovarian function at midlife increases
susceptibility to the development of co-morbidities, such as osteoporosis, which decrease quality of life and
increases healthcare burden. There is currently no intervention for preventing/delaying this, highlighting an
unmet need for novel approaches, e.g. extending ovarian lifespan, to tackle this. Key mediators of ovarian
function are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and its receptor (FSHR). FSH is a glycoprotein hormone, with
two predominant glycoforms identified; partially glycosylated FSH (FSH18/21) and fully glycosylated FSH
(FSH24). FSH glycoforms have distinct functional properties, with FSH18/21 displaying faster binding kinetics
and more potent and distinct signal pathway activation than FSH24. Interestingly, age-related changes in human
pituitary extracts have been reported, with FSH18/21 predominant in women of reproductive prime and FSH24
predominant in peri-menopausal/menopausal women. The increase in less potent FSH24 coincides with
increasing ovarian resistance to FSH reported during peri-menopause. Yet, how these functional differences
in FSH modulate the actions of FSHR within the aging ovary remain unknown and will be explored by
this project. Increasingly important ways that G protein-coupled receptors direct signal and functional diversity
is via oligomerization (association of receptor protomers into dimers and oligomers), and endosomal trafficking.
Our recent work suggests that FSH18/21 and FSH24 distinctly modulate FSHR oligomerization, correlating with
differences in FSH glycoform-dependent cAMP production. Our preliminary data suggest that FSH glycoforms
may route FSHR to different endosomal compartments, with cAMP production dependent on FSHR
internalization. This project aims to determine how FSH glycoforms modulate FSHR oligomerization and
trafficking in young and aging ovaries, and functional impact thereof. The working hypothesis is FSH glycoforms
mediate distinct FSHR oligomerization signatures and FSHR trafficking within the young and aging ovary, with
defined functional consequences. Using a novel N terminal tagged FLAG-FSHR knock in mouse, high resolution
imaging and multiomics ATACseq and RNAseq approaches, Aim 1 will determine how FSHR oligomerization
and signaling is modulated in granulosa cells during folliculogenesis and aging, and how disrupting FSHR
oligomerization impacts FSH glycoform function. Aim 2 will determine how FSH glycoforms direct FSHR
endosomal routing and role of these compartment in signal activation and downstream functions. Successful
completion of these aims will elucidate how unique ovarian FSHR oligomerization and trafficking
signatures direct signal pathway activation and transcriptomic and functional outputs by FSH
glycoforms, during aging. This is the first step in the discovery pipeline to identifying novel strategies to improve
ovarian function and health in aging women."

Alport syndrome is a human hereditary glomerulonephritis, which in most cases, results in end-stage renal
disease. It is the most common inherited glomerular disease leading to renal failure and is caused by mutations
in any one of the genes encoding a3, a4, or a5 chains of type IV collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5,
respectively). There is large variation in the age of onset and severity of the disease, even between patients with
similar mutations. Studies in mice have shown that the renal phenotype is highly dependent on the genetic
background. It is widely accepted that modifier genes contribute to this variation, which could represent a source
of novel therapeutic targets in Alport syndrome and other renal diseases. We identified human-relevant modifier
genes in a small cohort of genetically diverse mice with a Col4a5 mutation (leading to X-linked Alport syndrome
(XLAS)) and validated that decreased expression of one of these genes, Fmn1, leads to a less severe renal
phenotype. We further found that two of the candidate modifier genes (Pik3r1 and Dgke) modulate other forms
of kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy and hematolytic urea syndrome. In this application we will
discover novel candidate modifier genes of XLAS by high-resolution genetic mapping in a large
genetically diverse XLAS mouse cohort and confirm the translational relevance of the modifiers in
humans. The functional impact and causality of the modifier genes will be assessed in preclinical mouse
models of XLAS and other forms of kidney disease. We will generate a large, genetically diverse XLAS
mouse population that, combined with our previous population, will allow us gene-resolution mapping of modifier
loci (Aim 1). Whole exome sequencing and targeted testing for the detection of the most likely candidate modifier
genes in human XLAS pedigrees will be conducted to confirm the translational relevance of the candidate
modifier genes found in our mouse studies (Aim 2). We will use available knockout resources and/or CRISPR-
Cas9 gene editing to test causality of as many as five candidate genes in the XLAS mouse model (Aim 3A). We
will further test these modifier genes for causality in mouse models of two common forms of kidney disease:
diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis syndrome (Aim 3B). Identification of the genes
responsible for the onset and severity of disease will provide meaningful insights into understanding the
molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide the basis for developing novel
therapeutic strategies."
10781907,"The community of women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is growing due to greater disease incidence
and treatment advances, with over 30% of women now surviving over 5 years (vs. just 4% in 2000). Managing
symptoms to maintain the highest quality of life (QOL) is the major goal of care in the metastatic setting. Thus,
research that addresses QOL, prognosis and survivorship in this burgeoning and underserved survivor group
is critically needed. BC treatment is associated with adverse body composition changes, specifically gains in
adipose tissue and reductions in strength and lean mass (LM). Excess adiposity contributes to inflammation
and insulin-resistance, which are theorized to promote tumor progression and loss of LM. Low levels of LM are
associated with chemotherapy toxicity, increased symptom burden and compromised survival in women with
MBC. Lifestyle interventions with early stage BC survivors result in reduced symptoms, improved biomarkers of
BC prognosis and enhanced quality of life (QOL). To date, women with MBC have been largely excluded from
these trials. Our pilot work in women with MBC demonstrates they are interested, capable, adherent and
benefit from participation in a lifestyle intervention. Our results show clinically meaningful improvements in
QOL, increased physical activity and strength. We also find improved trends in biomarkers of prognosis, as
well as mitochondrial function for women in the immediate intervention vs. control group. Further, our work
shows that inflammation-associated microRNAs are differentially expressed following participation in our pilot
trial, providing highly novel potential targets to explain mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions improve
QOL for these women. We propose a randomized atttention control trial in women with MBC (n=176) to test
the immediate and sustained effects of “Every Day Counts,” a 16-week lifestyle intervention based on current
lifestyle recommendations for cancer survivors. This trial is adequately powered to examine changes in: 1)
QOL - the primary determinant of care in the metastatic setting and (2) body composition, serum biomarkers of
prognosis/survival, and pertinent patient reported outcomes. We will also explore mitochondrial function and
novel microRNA signatures associated with inflammatory biomarkers and mitochondrial function. Every Day
Counts incorporates critical feedback and experiences from our pilot study with women with MBC. Our robust,
multidisciplinary study team applies an innovative, highly integrated physiologic model to examine the
mechanistic effects of the intervention on decidedly relevant outcomes of interest. The present study
challenges current clinical assumptions regarding the presumed ineffectiveness of lifestyle behaviors in the
metastatic setting, providing evidence that may inform a paradigm shift expanding the application and
relevance of the nutrition and physical activity guidelines to women with MBC. Importantly, this study will
provide clinicians with updated evidence and strategies to help make every day count for women with MBC
representing high impact for a currently underserved group of survivors."

In the current INIA period, we have developed multimodal brain MRI in mice, i.e. combining morphological,
structural and functional data. Our data demonstrate circuitry-specific alterations of brain morphology, and
reshaping of both structural and functional connectomes after 6 weeks excessive alcohol drinking. Our findings
are consistent with the human literature and demonstrate our ability to characterize in-depth whole brain plasticity
in a mouse model of alcohol drinking. We will build on these findings and methodologies to achieve three goals:
 Specific Aim 1. Longitudinal MRI biomarkers - Group level analysis: do alcohol effects on
neurocircuitry depend on drinking history, and/or sex? We will continue to use the EOD-2BC model and
C57BL/6 mice and incorporate female mice in longitudinal Experiment 1. We will acquire multimodal MRI images
at four time points (baseline; 6 and 10 weeks drinking; 4 weeks withdrawal) and apply quantitative multiparametric
analyses to investigate temporal and sex effects. Brains will be collected for histology, c-Fos analysis,
metabolomics and transcriptomics (to be used in Aim 3).
 Specific Aim 2. Connectome/behavior individual signatures – Subject level analysis: can we
classify and predict behavior and drug effects from MRI? We will move from group analysis to subject-level
analysis and correlate multimodal MRI data with individual behavioral patterns using machine learning
approaches. This is now feasible (GPR88 knockout mice/EOD-TBC,preliminary results). We will: Aim 2a. Identify
connectome features that classify and predict alcohol drinking/withdrawal behavior. We will build a predictive
multivariate model of the drinking trajectory at individual level, using longitudinal imaging data from Experiment
1. We will determine best MR-based connectome classifiers that discriminate drinking patterns and evaluate their
respective causal influence on the negative affect of withdrawal. Aim 2b. Identify connectome features that
predict drug treatment efficacy. We will study alcohol effects in male mice in longitudinal Experiment 2, which
will include a drug treatment. We have selected a GPR-88 agonist, which reduces alcohol intake. We will expand
the prediction model from Aim 2a to drug effects and include c-fos endpoints in the prediction (Kash/INIA-S).
 Specific Aim 3. Mechanisms: can we link connectome data with neuroimmune signaling? This aim
will be synergistic with INIA partners, using notably molecular data from the same mice (see Aim 1). We will: Aim
3a. Develop hypothesis-driven analyses to identify MRI correlates for neuroadaptations in extracellular matrix
(Lasek), microglia (Mangieri) and stress centers (AI, BNST, Kash). Aim 3b. Perform metabolomic profiling using
HR-MAS (high resolution magic angle spinning) 1H-NMR at our site, for regions of interest based on our
collaborative work. We will compare metabolic profiles of immune pathways with those obtained from mice
undergoing the CIE-protocol (Kroenke-Cuzon/INIA-S). Aim 3c. Integrate transcriptomic brain mapping
(Mayfield) with our MRI data to correlate altered gene expression and brain network remodeling in the EOD-TBC
model.
 In conclusion, Specific Aim 1 will strengthen validity of our MRI-based fingerprinting approach in mice,
address the yet poorly understood sex effect at whole brain level, and will be applicable to other mouse models
of AUD. Specific Aim 2 will establish signatures of alcohol effects and drug treatments, with potential for diagnostic
and patient stratification, confirm GPR88 as a target to treat AUD, and will be applicable to other INIA drugs.
Specific Aim 3 will bridge our “mesoscale” data with molecular and cellular mapping INIA projects."
10774539,"Biobehavioral Mechanistic Model of Alcohol Use Following Bariatric Surgery: The BREW ME Model
Abstract
Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is currently the most efficacious and durable intervention for Class III
obesity. While weight loss and metabolic outcomes after surgery are very good, unfortunately one deleterious
complication is a markedly increased risk of hazardous alcohol use after MBS (i.e., almost 1 in 5 patients
develop Alcohol Use Disorder). The understanding of mechanisms of hazardous alcohol use following MBS
are developmentally young, but there is growing evidence of the unique role of the microbial environment. Our
transdisciplinary research team has been at the forefront of advancing understanding of how the microbiome
and the rewarding effects of alcohol change following MBS. Although the mechanisms through which changes
in the microbiome influence post-surgical outcome remains unclear, the gut microbiome is increasingly
recognized for its bi-directional communication with the brain and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis may explain
the complex relationships between the gut microbiome, subsequent changes in the rewarding effects of
alcohol, and resulting risk for hazardous alcohol use. For example, the microbiome has been shown to impact
neurobiological reward systems and alter reward processing. Further, patients who experience strong reward
value of alcohol engage in more drinking behavior. Therefore, the rewarding effects of alcohol may be
influenced through the gut microbiome, leading to significant impacts on the post-surgical alcohol consumption.
Unfortunately, the extant literature is methodologically limited due to traditional assessments further limiting
understanding of these relationships. Thus, we propose a novel, multi-method, longitudinal design to
investigate the Biome-Reward as Mechanisms for EtOH Use (BREW ME) Model to assess the mechanistic
role of post-surgical changes in reward in the relationship between the gut microbiome and hazardous alcohol
use. This study will address many of the methodological limitations in the literature (e.g., cross sectional
design, reliance on self-reported drinking behavior) and will be the first to combine a microbiome and
ecologically valid, real-time assessment of the reward value of alcohol in MBS patients. Understanding key
relationships between these variables will aid the development of interventions that can be tailored to individual
patients based upon their risk profile and can then be implemented early to optimize surgery-related outcomes."
10774631,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for gonorrhea and chlamydia in Kenya, where nucleic acid
amplification testing (NAAT) is not feasible and most infections therefore go undiagnosed. While development
of low-cost point-of-care diagnostics is an urgent priority, low-cost and feasible interventions to control sexually
transmitted infections (STI) among MSM are needed now, as we await technology advance. In 2011, the WHO
recommended periodic presumptive treatment (PPT) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia
trachomatis (CT) infections for MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition due to condomless anal intercourse with
multiple sex partners or a recent STI exposure. More recently, trials in well-resourced settings have
demonstrated the efficacy of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) at reducing NG, CT, and
syphilis infections among high-risk MSM. In this R01 application, we propose a rigorous study to evaluate the
impact and cost-effectiveness of WHO-recommended PPT versus doxyPEP, compared to standard syndromic
treatment, among Kenyan MSM. Our highly productive research team, including collaborators from the
University of Washington, Aurum Institute, Nyanza Reproductive Health Society, and Partners for Health and
Development in Africa, has expertise in clinical STI care, epidemiology, research with MSM populations, and
intervention trials (MPI Graham and Sanders, co-Is Otieno and Kimani), NG and CT diagnosis and testing for
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (co-I Soge), infectious disease modeling (co-I Hamilton), and costing of
interventions (co-I Sharma). This study aims to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and impact on AMR in NG of two
interventions: WHO-recommended PPT given every 3 months and doxy-PEP taken 24-72 hours after
condomless sex, compared to standard syndromic treatment, for reducing STI burden among Kenyan MSM;
(2) assess the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of implementing WHO-recommended PPT and doxy-PEP
compared to standard care among providers and patients; and (3) model the health and economic impact of
scaling up WHO-recommended STI PPT and doxyPEP compared to standard of care on STI control among
MSM and their partners in Kenya. We will conduct an open-label randomized clinical trial with 2900 participants
to evaluate these two interventions versus the standard of care assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio, with 18 months of
follow-up and rigorous culture-based and molecular analysis of AMR in NG at three MSM-friendly research
clinics in Kenya. We will use multidisciplinary science to measure the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of
these two interventions, using a conceptual model based on Proctor’s Implementation Science Framework.
Finally, Aim 1 and 2 results will inform parameters to update a stochastic model of STI transmission and cost-
effectiveness analysis to project the impact of scaled-up STI PPT and doxyPEP in Kenya. This work will
provide the critical data needed to inform guidelines and improve STI control among these key populations in
sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-limited settings."

The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral
Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Mr. Zheng, a second-year
doctoral student at the University of Washington School of Nursing. The long-term goal of this training is for
this applicant to develop into an independent influential researcher in a research-intensive academic setting
with an innovative and productive interdisciplinary program. This research will be dedicated to integrating
physiologic measures into bio-behavioral interventions to reduce and ameliorate symptom burden in individuals
with advanced heart failure (AHF) and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. Individuals with AHF
experience severe refractory symptom burden despite maximum medical therapy. Cardiac transplant is the
optimal treatment option for AHF. However, organ shortage and ineligibility for transplant make MCS devices,
such as Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs), the only treatment option for individuals with advanced age
and comorbid conditions requiring permanent support, known as destination therapy (DT). The number of
patients attaining longer-term survival with DT-LVAD is rapidly growing with increased durability of mechanical
support, and expanded indications for DT-LVAD to include patients in earlier stages of heart failure. While
studies on sleep and sleep disorders among individuals with heart failure are extensive, investigating sleep as
an important clinical outcome for DT-LVAD recipients has not kept pace with the rapidly expanding therapeutic
indications and evolving technology advancements in MCS for AHF care. Better understanding of LVAD effects
on physical and psychological symptoms will be essential to effectively care for, and support LVAD patients
post-implant. The purpose of this prospective concurrent mixed-methods study is to describe changes in
objective and subjective sleep quality at 3 months in persons with AHF following DT-LVAD, and to determine
associations between change in sleep quality as they relate to changes in cognitive function, psychological
symptoms and health-related quality of life. Moreover, this award will prepare a pre-doctoral trainee through
advanced coursework and direct research experience, the use of mixed methods, focused analysis of
symptom changes observed post-LVAD implant, and discovery of highly relevant links among multiple sleep
and AHF-related symptoms. Findings generated from this investigation will provide foundational knowledge for
building a new program of research in symptom and symptom management science in AHF."

Globally, more than 900,000 people are diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) each
year, with more that 250,000 dying annually from this cancer. Infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), a
known risk factor for developing HNSCC, significantly impacts clinical prognostication. Specifically, for HPV-
negative HNSCC, the most lethal subtype of head and neck cancer, less than 30% of those diagnosed survive
for more than five years. The most common and lethal HPV-negative HNSCC subtype is oral cavity squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC). Importantly, most OSCCs are preceded by morphologically distinguishable pre-
cancerous lesions which are readily accessible for histological and molecular evaluation. This provides a unique
opportunity for intercepting this deadly cancer in the earliest stages of its development by halting the conversion
of oral precancer into invasive OSCC. Oral leukoplakia, the focus of this application, represents the most frequent
type of oral premalignancy, with one in every fifty people is expected to develop OL in their lifetime. OL’s low
malignant transformation rate of ~3.3% progressing to oral cancer and its highly variable natural history poses a
major challenge for surveying OLs and for intercepting their malignant conversion into invasive oral cancers.
To address this challenge, we hypothesize that the evolutionary transition from an OL into an OSCC is due to
the immuno-genomic interactions encompassing the acquisition of somatic driver events, the gain of
chromosomal instability, and the loss of effective immunosurveillance. We further hypothesize that the genomic
and immune landscapes of OL in patients who subsequently develop oral cancer (progressors) will differ from
those that do not develop oral cancer (non-progressors). The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the
molecular and immune mechanisms by which OLs progress to OSCCs, and to develop actionable and predictive
biomarkers. To achieve this objective, we will leverage well-annotated OL cohorts to generate the largest whole-
exome and whole-transcriptome atlas encompassing 300 OLs, including at least 100 cancer progressors and
100 non-progressors. Further, by utilizing a spatial multiplex immuno-fluorescence platform and an unbiased
RNA-sequencing approach for immuno-profiling, we will comprehensively map the immune landscapes of these
300 OLs and associate distinct immuno-genetic features with likely progression to OSCC. Lastly, our state-of-
the-art oral carcinogenesis mouse model will be used to model the transition of OL to OSCC at the single cell
resolution in order to understand the role of common genomic alterations and immune surveillance in this
process. Overall, this project will reveal the compendium of immuno-genetic changes that drive the evolutionary
transition from an OL to an OSCC and elucidate a set of targetable immune cell population(s) and novel immune
surveillance mechanisms, which can likely halt this malignant transformation."

with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There
is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve
quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality,
referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively
calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling
the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid
functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side-
effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using
4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT-
ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across
individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible
due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry

 The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated
methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the
4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in
clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop
methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust
calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT-
ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of
knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In
conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a
commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional
avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.
 Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly
incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade
platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer

10755267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an efficacious treatment for patients with symptoms of depression. However, the processes by which MBCT achieves its outcomes are not well understood. Drawing on literature on basic cognitive functioning and cognitive biases in depression, this K23 will use a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of MBCT vs. Health Education (HE) on affective inhibition (an important component of executive functioning (EF)), and a possible mechanism of action by which MBCT has an impact on depression symptoms. As a secondary aim, this project will also test the effect of MBCT vs. HE on affective updating and affective shifting (two remaining components of EF). In exploratory analyses, we will examine whether depression symptom severity covaries with change in affective EF (i.e., affective inhibition, shifting, and updating) overtime, and whether adherence to the treatment protocol predicts endpoint EF. To accomplish these goals, 76 adult participants with elevated depression symptoms will be recruited from the community and will be randomized to either an 8-week MBCT course at the Mindfulness Center at Brown University or an 8-week Psychoeducational Health Education Class (i.e., a control arm). Participants will complete validated computer-based tasks of affective EF at 5-assessments, 2 before, 2 during, and 1 after, the 8-week MBCT or HE programs. This project directly addresses NCCIH’s objective to advance the understanding of mechanisms through which mind and body approaches affect health, resilience and well-being. This project will directly address the candidate’s training goals of gaining clinical trials methods experience with mood disorders, expanding knowledge of mindfulness-based interventions (specifically MBCT), gain knowledge in neurocognitive assessment of individuals with depression symptoms, receive training in repeated longitudinal assessment, and further develop professional development, research ethics, and grants management skills. The candidate will complete a number of formal and informal activities (e.g., courses, workshops, conferences, directed readings, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentors) to meet the training goals. These training goals will assist the candidate to become a successful independent investigator examining cognitive mechanisms of mind-body interventions for depression and related disorders. The Mindfulness Center at Brown University and Butler Hospital are the ideal environments for this project, as they are leading institutions in clinical trials research and mindfulness-based interventions, with numerous opportunities for training and support services embedded within the systems."

Fibrous tissues of the musculoskeletal system (e.g., the knee meniscus) are plagued by their poor intrinsic
healing capacity. In the previous funding cycles, we developed enabling technologies including multi-fiber
scaffolds to introduce various temporal and structural signals towards the repair of meniscal tissue. We used
these scaffolds to engineer constructs with properties and organization similar to native tissues (1st cycle) and
then developed scaffolds to enhance endogenous tissue repair through the delivery of factors to recruit local
cells (2nd cycle). The overall objective of this renewal is to further improve endogenous meniscus repair with
engineered scaffolds through the appropriate temporal and spatial orchestration of factor delivery, to first (i)
soften nuclei in cells (via a temporary reduction in heterochromatin content) near the injury site and then (ii)
recruit and stabilize the phenotype of these cells within the repair scaffolds. We hypothesize that the delivery of
these factors will permit recruitment of viable endogenous cells from the meniscus to the scaffolds and that the
spatial control of these factors will improve scaffold colonization, even with thick scaffolds. We will employ
composite scaffolds (developed during the previous funding cycles) that provide a stable fiber fraction
(polycaprolactone (PCL), to provide an instructional pattern and mechanical stability), a sacrificial fiber fraction
(polyethylene oxide (PEO), to define initial scaffold porosity and provide early release of factors into the
environment), and an engineered hyaluronic acid (HA) fiber fraction (that degrades over weeks and releases
factors in a sustained fashion). To address our hypotheses, the first Aim will utilize in vitro microfluidic-
platforms to investigate the timing and dosing of nuclear-softening (Trichostatin A), chemotactic (platelet-
derived growth factor), and fibro-chondrogenic factors (transforming growth factor-β3) to alter nuclear
mechanics, cell recruitment, and promote resumption of the cellular phenotype of cells migrating into fibrous
scaffolds from meniscal tissue. In the second Aim, we will control release from either the entire scaffold (as
before) or from an internal layer (newly proposed) across a variety of scaffold thicknesses and release rates to
promote population of thick scaffolds. This Aim will be conducted using our recently developed subcutaneous
model of meniscus tissue repair. In the third Aim, scaffolds will be implanted into meniscal defects in Yucatan
minipigs to evaluate their efficacy in a clinically relevant defect model. If successful, these studies and
technologies will advance our understanding of the use of engineered scaffolds for endogenous meniscus
repair and provide a step towards clinical translation."
10792944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Substance use is a critical public health problem among college students in the US. Roughly 600,000 college
students report being in recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). To support students seeking to maintain
or attempting to initiate SUD recovery, a growing number of US higher education institutions (at least 138) have
established collegiate recovery programs (CRPs). CRPs have expanded by 500% from 2013 to 2020, but there
are no current evidence-based standards to guide college staff, administrators, and communities on how to
establish a maximally beneficial CRP. This is at least partly because little empirical evidence exists on CRPs’
design, development, and implementation. To address this critical gap, I propose a mixed-methods study to
investigate CRP programs and create a pragmatic, context-sensitive, implementation toolkit for colleges across
the US. In Aim 1, I will conduct an ethnography at four well-established, geographically dispersed CRPs (Texas
Tech University, Augsburg University, Penn State University, and University of California at Santa Barbara) to
identify core characteristics and related barriers to and facilitators of CRP best practices. In Aim 2, I will conduct
a national survey among CRP program directors (n=50) and students (n=500) to characterize current CRP
programming and the evolution of CRPs over time. The survey results will be compared and contrasted with a
smaller national survey completed 7 years ago. In Aim 3, findings from the ethnography (Aim 1) and national
surveys (Aim 2) will be used to develop a CRP implementation toolkit. The toolkit will provide colleges with
appropriate insight on strategies to best disseminate and implement evidence-based interventions and practices
for students who are contemplating or in SUD recovery. Through the award period, I will build upon my clinical
training as a SUD counselor, doctoral training in experimental psychology, and experience conducting research
in SUD treatment to develop new knowledge and skills in ethnography, SUD recovery among emerging adults,
survey design, and implementation of CRP best practices. My proposed research plan integrates coursework,
formal training, practical experience, applied training, and mentorship from experts (Drs. Keith Humphreys, Mark
McGovern, Christine Timko, John Kelly, Alison Hamilton, and Kitty Harris) in addiction recovery, mutual-help
organizations, SUD treatment, quantitative and qualitative methods, and implementation science. This Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will help me achieve my long-term career goal of being an
independent investigator with an established program of research focused on the development, testing, and
implementation of interventions for SUD treatment and recovery. In summary, the proposed research and
training plan will result in timely, innovative, and impactful findings on CRPs, ultimately leading to substantial
findings, high-quality publications, and improved health outcomes in the US."
10756478,"Uncontrolled Toxoplasma growth is the primary mechanism by which the parasite causes
severe and life-threatening disease. The parasite replicates by a process termed endodyogeny,
where two daughter parasites form within a single mother. A key step in endodyogeny is formation
of the daughter cell inner membrane complex, which is an unique organelle that lies directly
underneath the plasma membrane and is required for parasite motility and replication. During
daughter cell development, the nascent IMC emerges from a complex named the daughter cell
scaffold (DCS). Despite its importance, the DCS is poorly characterized and few of its constituent
proteins are known. Here, we hypothesize that the Toxoplasma F-box protein, TgFBXO1, is a
critical component of the DCS. To test our hypothesis, we will determine: i) how TgFBXO1 is
targeted to the DCS, ii) how TgFBXO1 regulates inner membrane complex development and
organization, and iii) which TgFBXO1-interacting proteins are important for inner membrane
complex development. Together, these studies will provide in depth mechanistic detail for a
protein complex that is critical for growth of an important protozoan pathogen. Furthermore, they
were serve as a springboard for future studies aimed at developing novel anti-parasitic drugs that
function by targeting this complex."
10898016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preclinical efforts to develop treatments for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease have been hindered by
two barriers: time-consuming behavioral assays that often lack sensitivity, and transgenic (TG) mouse models
with APP overexpression that do not accurately recapitulate human pathogenesis. To overcome the second
barrier, newly-developed humanized App knock-in (App-KI) mouse models express AD-related human genes at
physiological levels. App-KI mice have prominent brain pathology, but inconsistent, milder or absent behavioral
phenotypes in many traditional behavioral tests, including Morris Water maze (Saito et al., 2014). These
limitations of standard behavioral testing, including lack of sensitivity, low throughput, and reproducibility
represent key methodological barriers to proper development of therapeutics in newly developed App-KI mice.
Without a solution to this problem, it is likely that translational and preclinical research will struggle to develop
therapies in models of early pathogenesis or sporadic AD characterized by mild or subtle behavioral phenotype
and lacking overt clinical disease manifestation. To overcome the limits of behavioral testing, we propose to
implement machine-learning (ML) approaches that offer complete, unbiased, and robust behavioral
characterization of even subtle behavioral phenotypes. Specifically, we propose to upgrade and refine our novel
computer vision ML approach (Aim #1), to validate it in App-KI and TG AD mouse models (Aim #2), and to apply
it to mice receiving a newly-developed anti-Aβ antibody to validate our approach in a preclinical setting (Aim #3).
We recently published our first iteration of an ML package that developed the VAME neural network to identify
behavioral motifs. VAME will be further developed to provide rapid testing of large cohorts, unbiased identification
of disease-associated behavioral deficits, and reproducible phenotypes across experimental conditions and
laboratories. Our proposal thereby addresses key limitations of standard behavioral testing and mouse modeling,
vertically advances the methodology of behavioral neuroscience, launches innovative biotechnological
development, and opens new horizons for dementia-related research, including the adaptation of the approaches
to humans. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a new preclinical tool for diagnosis,
assessment, and disease monitoring in mouse models of AD. In conclusion, will establish a novel machine-
learning behavioral phenotyping platform with the power to non-invasively identify robust behavioral alterations
in App-KI models of AD, removing a key methodological barrier to the translational study of MCI, and increasing
the value of behavioral research broadly.
This award will critically support the PI to undertake immersive entrepreneurial training experiences at local
universities and at a startup company focused on developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases."
10911360,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Latinx (gender-inclusive term; includes Hispanics, Latino/a) experience a faster progression from chronic
kidney disease (CKD) to kidney failure and face a disproportionate burden of structural racism and
discrimination that contribute to kidney health disparities compared to non-Latinx Whites. Latinx individuals
constitute the racial and ethnic group most likely to start dialysis with a central venous catheter. Compared to
non-Latinx Whites, they are less likely to start recommended kidney replacement therapy (KRT) such as home
dialysis and kidney transplant. Reducing the number of individuals who start KRT with a central venous
catheter is critical because it is associated with a higher risk of fatal infection, non-fatal infection,
hospitalization, and mortality compared to permanent vascular access. The Advancing American Kidney
Health Initiative, a 2019 Presidential executive order, aims to improve access and quality of person-centered
KRT. In response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched kidney value-based
payment models to improve patient-centered care; however, these models do not address the structural racism
that operates across socioecological levels faced by racial and ethnic minorities with CKD. Our community-
partnered team assessed how structural racism operates across socioecological levels among Latinx with
kidney disease and in partnership with community, developed and tested NAVIGATE-Kidney, a multi-level,
language and culturally concordant community health worker (CHW) intervention for Latinx on hemodialysis.
We propose to partner with our community steering committees (CSCs) in Colorado and New Mexico to refine,
adapt, and test NAVIGATE-Kidney for Latinx individuals with CKD stage 4/5 (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2)
(Aim 1). We will determine the effectiveness of NAVIGATE-Kidney compared to standard care by conducting a
patient-level randomized controlled trial in 448 Latinx with CKD stage 4/5 (Aim 2). Our primary hypothesis is
that intervention participants will have a lower rate of central venous catheter use at KRT start (primary
outcome). Our secondary hypothesis is that intervention participants will have a higher rate of optimal KRT
starts (composite secondary outcome), higher patient activation, and lower decisional conflict (patient-centered
outcomes). To provide the most compelling data that will address structural racism, we will assess contextual
factors and implementation outcomes using the innovative PRISM (Practical Robust Implementation and
Sustainable Model) framework which aligns with parameters that policymakers consider to advance health
equity (Aim 3). We will conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation including a cost-effectiveness analysis
of NAVIGATE-Kidney to inform policy change (Aim 4). All the proposed work will be conducted in partnership
with our community steering committee and patient partners. We will set up CSC structures and procedures to
ensure authentic partnership, goal-setting, shared decision-making, and language equity."
10910169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term objective of this work is to determine the functional role of the bone marrow microenvironment
in regulating the plasma cell growth of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), using
multiple MGUS mouse models to define reliable biomarkers. Our findings should form the basis for designing
novel treatment approaches to prevent MGUS progression to multiple myeloma (MM). MGUS is a precancerous,
but clonal condition with aberrant DNA changes in plasma cells (PC). The prevalence of MGUS increases with
age. It is 3.2% at 50 years but rises to 9% for those older than 85, suggesting that risk factors associated with
aging play an important role in MGUS development. MGUS may progress to smoldering multiple myeloma
(SMM) and/or to MM, requiring therapy. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify and subsequently target
the risk factors associated with MGUS progression. By studying MGUS mouse models and primary human
samples from MGUS patients, we have demonstrated that bone marrow cellular senescence related to aging,
iron metabolism, and increased DKK1 in MGUS plasma cells are linked to MGUS progression. We hypothesize
that changes in the bone marrow microenvironment (ME) alter gene expression of MGUS plasma cells and
induce both bone destruction and immunosuppression resulting in MGUS plasma cell proliferation and disease
escape from effective immune surveillance. We propose three specific aims to prove this hypothesis: (1)
determine the role of cellular senescence of ME in MGUS progression; (2) determine the role of DKK1 in
promoting MGUS progression in adoptive transgenic mice; and (3) determine cellular and molecular mechanisms
of MGUS progression. Our goal is to discover novel therapeutic approaches to prevent human MGUS
progression."
10910170,"Prevent IgM MGUS Progression by Targeting the Driver Mutation
Project Summary
Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance of the IgM class (IgM MGUS) are at
increased risk for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), or primary light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) was
discovered in the 1990s as a primary differentiation response gene in myeloid precursors. A missense
mutation (L265P) changing leucine at position 265 to proline in MYD88 is found in ~90% of WM. This driver
mutation also occurs in >50% of primary extranodal lymphomas and ~29% of activated B-cell diffuse large B-
cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL), as well as in ~52% of IgM MGUS. No precancer-cancer pairs other than IgM
MGUS-WM have a single amino acid substitution like MYD88 L265P occurring in most precancer and ~90% of
cancer, making MYD88 L265P paradigmatic for the study of a single causative mutation in cancer prevention
and interception. We found that the RING finger protein 138 (RNF138) attaches lysine 63 (K63)-linked
polyubiquitin chains to MYD88 L265P, yet strikingly, it has little activity on WT MYD88. This posttranslational
modification on MYD88 L265P is essential to its oncogenic action. We have used a deep learning artificial
intelligence (AI) technology based on a neural network to virtually screen about ten million compounds. We
identified scores of primary hit compounds targeting a binding site near L265P in MYD88. We validated
primary hits from AI screening and evaluated their inhibition of MYD88 L265P ubiquitination and xenograft
tumorigenesis. One compound attenuated lymphoma growth from NHL cells with MYD88 L265P but not that
with WT MYD88. The E3 ligase RNF138 is primarily expressed in the testis and in immune cells, and its whole-
body knockout in mice does not affect physiological functions other than that in the testis. RNF138 deletion
attenuates tumorigenesis from WM and DLBCL cells with MYD88 L265P but not from cells with WT MYD88.
We hypothesize that targeting the MYD88 L265P-RNF138 interaction prevents IgM MGUS progression. In this
application, we propose two specific aims to identify and validate chemo- and immune-prevention agents to
target MYD88 L265P-RNF138 and prevent IgM MGUS progression into WM and NHL. In Aim 1, we will use
the AI-developed MYD88 L265P-targeting compound to prevent IgM MGUS progression. In Aim 2, we will use
DNA vaccines against RNF138 to prevent IgM MGUS progression. We expect to generate effective chemical
and immunological agents without overt toxicities for cancer prevention and interception against IgM MGUS
progression."
10911278,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mitigating progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) to avoid kidney failure is well known --
management of CKD and its multimorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular
disease). Yet unequal access to and utilization of quality medical and social resources present a
significant and under-addressed barrier to optimal management, especially in rural settings. As
advocated by the National Academies, we propose to address the endemic effects of structural
racism and systemic drivers of health by using an intervention that integrates medical with social
care for African Americans adults in rural eastern North Carolina. The intervention,
CommunityRx (CRx), systematically matches people to nearby community resources using
evidence-based algorithms at the point of care with a health care provider. CRx utilizes a three-
pronged approach to address integrated care among patients and caregivers: (a)
comprehensive, ongoing assessment of community resources (eligibility, capacity, quality) using
feet-on-the street (see Meaningful Active Productive Science in Service to Communities
(MAPSCorps) below) and phone survey methods; (b) integration of a simple automatic resource
referral process into routine, Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based clinical workflows; and (c)
availability of a community resource navigator. CRx for CKD (CRx-CKD) is an application of this
infrastructural approach to address CKD multimorbidity. Our community-engaged and
multidisciplinary health equity research team will leverage our infrastructural intervention and
implementation science expertise to test the effects of CRx-CKD through three related aims.
Aim 1 will contextualize implementation and effectiveness of a rural infrastructural integrated
care intervention by (a) building an inclusive model with system science to describe how
structural racism affects CKD progress on and its mitigation through integrated care; and (b)
conducting a network analysis to evaluate structures of clinic-community connectivity. Aim 2 will
optimize Crx-CKD implementation through the Consolidated Framework of Implementation
Research to ensure organizational readiness, fidelity, and acceptability. With aim 3, we will test
the effectiveness of the CRx-CKD intervention with a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled
trial at the clinic level. Three hundred seventy-five African American individuals with CKD
multimorbidity at the intervention clinics will be compared to 375 individuals at usual care clinics
for the primary outcome of reduction of the glomerular filtration slope decline and reduction of
albuminuria; other, secondary outcomes include control of blood pressure, control of blood
sugar, weight reduction, and blood lipid management."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the pediatric population
with a projected 20% increase in prevalence over the next 10 years. NAFLD in children is more likely than in
adults to be characterized by hepatocyte injury in portal regions, reflecting a more severe disease type. Latinos
are one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic groups in the US and are disproportionately affected by NAFLD,
including a prevalence of cirrhosis that is 9 times the national average. Omics data integration, including
genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome, can provide insight on
dysregulation of biological pathways and may help identify risk factors and early molecular indicators of NAFLD
risk and disease progression and severity. Studying these specific omics layers in the context of pediatric NAFLD
is particularly important to identify both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors which predispose children to
this disease. Environmental pollutant exposures are modifiable exposures that can cause liver injury and
contribute to NAFLD risk and disease progression and severity. Numerous widespread chemical pollutants have
been associated with fatty liver disease in animal models including persistent industrial pollutants, toxic metals,
pesticides, and plasticizers. Previous human studies underscore limitations such as small sample sizes, cross-
sectional study design, lack of gold standard imaging methods for NAFLD phenotyping, and lack of focus on
Latinos, who are disproportionally affected by NAFLD. Therefore, in response to RFA-HG-22-008, we propose
the first and largest longitudinal investigation to integrate multi-omic signatures, environmental exposures,
and social and behavioral factors to detect and assess molecular “profiles” characterizing the etiology and
progression of NAFLD in Latino youth. Our specific aims are to: (1A) Examine associations between multiple
environmental exposures and pediatric NAFLD risk and disease progression and severity in Latino youth; (1B)
Evaluate whether these relationships are modified by social factors, behavioral factors, and genetic
predisposition; (2A) Identify omics signatures that will serve as biomarkers of NAFLD risk and disease
progression and severity; (2B) Evaluate whether these signatures are modified by social and behavioral factors;
and (3) Integrate multi-omics data, environmental exposures, social determinants of health and clinical data to
identify precise risk profiles of NAFLD risk, and disease progression and severity. Collectively, this study will
increase our understanding of NAFLD risk and disease progression in Latino children, who face increasingly
higher burdens of the disease. Findings may have broad-reaching clinical and public health implications including
precision prevention approaches for pediatric NAFLD in high-risk populations."
10872238,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Synaptic connections between spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and hair cells in the cochlea are critical
for hearing and lost in many forms of hearing impairment. These synapses form prior to hearing onset and are
activated by supporting cell-induced, intrinsically generated activity that is prominent within the developing
cochlea. This periodic and spontaneous synaptic activity initiates SGN burst firing, which promotes SGN survival,
SGN maturation, and development of frequency tuning in central auditory circuits. Our prior studies revealed an
unexpected role for otic mesenchyme cells (OMCs) in establishing appropriate SGN-hair cell connectivity
through activation of POU3F4, a transcription factor associated with X-linked deafness. POU3F4 is expressed
only by OMCs in the cochlea. We found that, in OMCs adjacent to developing SGNs, POU3F4 upregulates Eph
receptor-A4 (EphA4) to promote SGN fasciculation. Subsequently, we discovered that POU3F4 is also
necessary for SGN survival. Recent data from Ca2+ imaging and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
experiments support a model whereby OMCs promote SGN development by regulating spontaneous activity
through POU3F4, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Semaphorin (SEMA) signaling. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that expression of these factors by OMCs promotes both prehearing spontaneous activity and the
establishment of hair cell–SGN synaptic connections to enable hearing. This hypothesis will be tested in three
aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of POU3F4 and OMCs in generating prehearing spontaneous activity.
In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which SEMA5A inhibits SGN spontaneous activity. In Aim 3, we will
determine how POU3F4 promotes IHC innervation. These studies will incorporate a range of Ca2+ imaging,
physiology, molecular profiling, and tissue culture techniques.
 We and others have documented mechanisms of SGN guidance and survival, but there is still limited
understanding of how SGNs differentiate and form synapses with hair cells. After acoustic overexposure, SGN
cell bodies can survive for long periods of time, but their peripheral processes retract away from the hair cells
without easily reconnecting. At present, how to re-establish these connections is not well understood. Successful
completion of these aims will define how genes expressed by OMCs control the formation of the first synapses
in the auditory pathway. By understanding the mechanisms of cochlear innervation during development, we will
begin to build a “toolbox” that could be used to develop molecular therapies for rewiring the damaged adult
cochlea. This research will also reveal key mechanisms required for the development and regulation of cochlear
spontaneous activity. Since neural activity is recognized as a crucial aspect of circuit formation, it is possible that
activity could be an important consideration in cochlear rewiring."

We submit “Multi-omics for obesity-associated liver disease discovery in Hispanics/Latinos: the Cameron
County Hispanic Cohort” (hereafter CCHC-Liver) in response to RFA-HG-22-008, as a disease study site
(DSS) that will participate in the Multi-omics for Health and Disease Consortium (hereafter, “the Consortium”).
Collectively, this Consortium will advance the science related to use of multi-omics technologies to study health
and disease in ancestrally diverse populations. CCHC-Liver will leverage the extant infrastructure of the CCHC,
a large, randomly ascertained, exquisitely phenotyped, longitudinal cohort of Hispanic/Latino (HL) participants
that have been consented for future contact. We will implement a longitudinal study of liver disease progression,
collecting serial specimens and measures of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF), social determinants of health
(SDH), and of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), assessed with serial transient elastography
(TE) and biomarkers (FIB-4, APRI)] .The umbrella term “MAFLD” encompasses a range of chronic liver diseases,
including non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis, and has no
approved drug therapy. Its prevalence is highest in HL populations, yet, longitudinal omics in accessible tissues
for liver disease, namely, whole blood (WB) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose (SAT), are
scarce,
particularly
inthe most vulnerable populations.To address this gap, we propose two Aims. 1) Consortium participation
as a disease study site (DSS). Together with the teams from RFA-HG-22-009 [Omics Production Centers
(OPCs)] and RFA-HG-22-010 [Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC)], we will work collaboratively to
complete three operational subaims to: develop best practices for the collection, harmonization, and integration
of longitudinal multi-omic, phenotypic, and environmental exposure data; develop best practices for data analysis
to detect and assess molecular “profiles” associated with healthy and disease states; and create a multi-
dimensional dataset that is available to the research community. 2) Design and implement a study of liver
disease progression in an understudied, high-risk HL population. In this aim we will 1) enroll 300 HL
participants, 200 with MAFLD and 100 without disease, consented for collection of data, future research use,
and broad data sharing from an extant population-based study; 2) collect phenotypic data and biospecimens
suitably preserved for omics data generation by OPCs across three time points; 3) submit biospecimens to the
OPCs for data production; 4) integrate data to identify changes in WB and SAT multi-omics associated with liver
disease progression; 5) perform causal inference in multi-omics to determine associations using Mendelian
randomization (MR); 6) combine MAFLD-associated genetic factors with multi-omics measures to evaluate
mechanistic frameworks via colocalization; 7) combine SDH and CMRF with multi-omics and MAFLD to assess
causal mediation; 8) characterize novel multi-omics signals via structural equation modeling; and 9) determine
global and local ancestry effects on multi-omics associated with liver disease progression."
10906979,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Improving quantification at high spatial resolution is driving technology developments in nuclear imaging.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
use radiation detectors, which performance can be improved when the image formation process is
understood. Optimizing optical mechanisms such as scintillation or prompt photon emission at the core of
these detectors is essential to advance the technology and is the focus of this proposal. Due to the complexity
of these phenomena and the difficulty to disentangle their components experimentally, research on radiation
detector optics relies on simulations integrating high and low energy physics. No simulators currently offer
the speed and fidelity necessary to understand image formation from the detector to the system.
 We propose to develop a radically different AI-based high-fidelity optical modeling framework,
allowing multidimensional optical information to be rapidly generated, collected, and processed at the system
level. By replacing individual photon tracking with a deep-learning approach, we expect to accelerate
simulations by several orders of magnitude in systems involving extensive optical photon tracking, such as
large detectors or fast timing detectors. We organize this R01 proposal in three specific aims focusing on
implementing this framework in the Geant4/GATE simulators and applying it to time-of-flight (TOF)
PET. GATE is a free opensource platform at the forefront of nuclear medicine simulation. We have a track
record of developing optical modeling strategies and created the LUT Davis model. This grant will design and
implement the optiGAN, a custom generative adversarial network (GAN) that will be trained with high-fidelity
simulations based on the LUT Davis model. New light transport features and crystal-photodetector interface
models mixing particle and wave optics will be developed and integrated into the optiGAN (Aims 1 and 2).
 We have extensively studied and developed Cerenkov-based radiation detectors, one of the prompt
photon emission mechanisms most pursued to achieve timing resolution below 50 ps and unlock
reconstruction-free PET. To develop prompt photon-based PET systems several questions must be solved:
how to improve the production and transport of these prompt photons with new materials, how to improve
their collection, and how to harness the prompt photon information for fast coincidence timing. These
questions motivate the development of innovative detector optics and algorithms for TOF PET, which we will
investigate with the optiGAN together with experimental and theoretical work (Aims 2 and 3).
 The objective of this grant is to enable a leap in detector technology through unprecedented simulation
capabilities and new strategies to leverage fast detectors in nuclear imaging scanners. Developing detector
technology now that enables the next generation of scanners to respond to clinical and research needs of
nuclear medicine is essential, as the integration of these advances requires years before commercialization."
10908635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early exposure to social disadvantage, specifically family and neighborhood financial disadvantage in utero and
through the first 3 years of life, is a powerful and potentially modifiable environmental determinant of risk for
childhood psychopathology. The ongoing Early Life Adversity and Biological Embedding (eLABE) study launched
in 2017 has aimed to elucidate mechanisms of this risk trajectory and guide preventive interventions. To date,
eLABE has detected powerful associations between prenatal social disadvantage and structural and functional
brain development at birth which are mediated through elevations in maternal cytokines and alterations in the
gut microbiome. These neonatal neurodevelopmental variations have been linked to elevations in markers of
psychopathology risk at age 2 years. Further, decreased caregiver nurturance mediated some aspects of this
relationship, with supportive caregiving mitigating child psychopathology risk. Our central hypothesis is that pro-
inflammatory immune and gut microbiome profiles evident in children exposed to prenatal and early life social
disadvantage induce neuronal effects that negatively impact structural and functional brain development leading
to increased risk for psychopathology. This renewal proposes to build upon the existing data to continue following
our unique and well-characterized sample of 377 children for whom we have assembled a rich, unparalleled
repository including comprehensive measures of social disadvantage (in utero and ages 1, 2, and 3 years) with
early life measures of inflammation, the gut microbiome, and brain development (structural, microstructural, and
functional MRI at birth and ages 2 and 3). In the next phase of eLABE, we propose to follow this sample into
school entry (age 6) and middle childhood (age 8), adding assessments of social disadvantage,
developmental/behavioral, inflammatory marker, multimodal MRI, and caregiver and social support measures at
both timepoints and one additional wave of the gut microbiome at age 6. We will utilize these data to test specific
hypotheses about mechanistic pathways to mental disorders that begin to clearly emerge in early childhood and
school age, and will utilize novel brain metrics to more directly examine the roles of neuroinflammation and
plasticity in this risk pathway. We will also examine the effects of caregiver and family, peer, and school supports
on this risk trajectory, including their role as possible resilience factors, and explore whether there are sensitive
periods for these effects. The results will provide the first systematic and intensive prospective examination of
the relationship of social disadvantage to chronic systemic inflammation, the gut microbiome, and their links to
brain development and behavior related to risk for clinical mental disorders. Critically, by targeting caregiving,
inflammation, and the gut microbiome as key mechanistic pathways, these data will also have tremendous
clinical and translational potential as they investigate potential mediators of risk and provide modifiable targets
for prevention of mental disorders."
10910146,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is the most common type of osteoporotic fracture. VCF burdens
include, but are not limited to pain, functional impairment, increased risk of future fractures, medical costs and
mortality. Only 1/3 of osteoporotic VCFs are symptomatic, and the remaining cases are found incidentally, thus,
the burden of VCF disease is significantly underestimated. Despite this, around 700,000 osteoporotic VCFs are
diagnosed annually in the US alone, resulting in an estimated annual economic burden of $13.8B.
 With an aging population, the rate of VCFs and its associated burdens are expected to rise. Therefore, it is
of utmost importance to develop screening tools for VCF assessment and identifying individuals at risk of VCF.
In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, BioSensics, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will
develop a cloud-based platform for automatic, opportunistic analysis of CT images that include spine. The
solution will stand by in the central imaging data server of a hospital, investigate each non-investigated spine CT
study, and flag the studies of patients that are detected to have osteoporosis or vertebra(e) at risk for fracture.
The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted to consider ordering a screening for vertebral
body compression fractures, bone mineral study or both, given the red flag from the analysis. Upon placing an
order, a full report will be presented to the physician.
 This process is reimbursable under two Common Procedural Technology (CPT) codes that are relevant to
the use of the proposed solution (CPT Code 77078 for bone mineral study using computed tomography, and
Code 0X36T for reporting an automated analysis of an existing computed tomography study for vertebral
fractures). The existing reimbursement CPT code and the significant added value of the proposed solution for
hospitals and clinical institutions - in terms of generating additional direct revenue from using the solution as well
as providing better care to patients at risk – will facilitate commercialization of the solution. In the longer term,
the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of medical images
that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and conditions at early
stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and better care for
those individuals at risk."

Obesity and associated metabolic conditions are a significant public health burden, costing the
U.S. ~$150 billion annually. Obesity is both a disease, affecting 1 in 3 Americans, and a risk factor
for other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and 13 forms of
cancers. Diet and exercise are the cornerstone of obesity prevention and treatment. However, a
considerable number of individuals are non-responsive to existing weight-loss interventions and
obesity rates continue to rise. Therefore, non-conventional approaches are needed to supplement
current weight-loss strategies. Daily exposure to low-oxygen conditions may aid in current weight-
loss strategies. Moderate (1500-3500 m) and higher (≥ 3500 m) altitude environments are
naturally hypoxic due to the lower atmospheric pressure (for reference, Denver, CO is ~1600 m
and Mt. Hood in Oregon is ~3500 m). Studies show that sea-level natives exposed to moderate-
or high- altitude continuously for 5 or more days lose weight, which is a consequence of prolonged
reductions in blood and tissue oxygenation that lead to increased energy expenditure and
decreased appetite. However, implementation of hypoxia as a means for weight loss has been
limited, to date, by the logistical constraints of traveling to remote locations or access to an altitude
chamber. A safe, less expensive, and more logistically feasible alternative is the use of
commercially available, low-oxygen systems at sea level, which create a normobaric hypoxic
environment. Whether in-home, overnight, normobaric hypoxic exposure, compared to
normobaric normoxic exposure, promotes body mass loss in adults with obesity remains
unknown. Furthermore, determinants of energy balance, including energy intake and expenditure,
and their relative contribution to normobaric hypoxia-induced weight loss have not been
investigated. The objective of the proposed double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial is
to evaluate changes in body weight and composition, assess determinants of energy balance
(intake and expenditure), and measure modulators of energy balance, following 8 wk of calorie
restriction (-500 kcal/d) in combination with either overnight exposure to normobaric hypoxia (8
h/night, 15% FiO2, ~2640 m) or normoxia (8 h/night, 21% FiO2), using a commercially available,
in-home tent system, in adults with obesity. Chronic (8 weeks), overnight (8 hours/night) low
oxygen exposure may provide a non-conventional approach to supplement current weight-loss
strategies, inform new strategies to accelerate weight loss, aid long-term weight management
efforts, and benefit metabolic health in individuals with obesity."
10768829,"Project 1 Abstract
We employ the prothrombinase complex, its substrate, prothrombin and its product thrombin as paradigms for
the enzyme complexes, zymogens, substrates and cofactors of coagulation to investigate generalizable
features establishing the molecular bases for their function. An emphasis is placed on addressing major
unanswered questions relating to allostery or how interactions or ligand binding to one site can affect function
at distant sites by combining biophysical studies with structural and functional measurements based on a
foundation of established mechanism to provide new mechanistic insights. The first aim extends previous
observations that despite irreversible cleavage of prothrombin to yield thrombin, the proteinase can exist in an
equilibrium between zymogen-like and proteinase-like states. We extend these findings in a direct
thermodynamic approach to understand how ligand binding at exosite 1 favors proteinase-like forms and
exactly counteracts liganding at exosite 2 on the opposite face of the molecule. The second aim expands to
mechanisms related to allosteric changes in factor Xa using a class of small molecules with previously unseen
behavior; they inhibit Xa function in solution but become poor and partial inhibitors of Xa when it is
incorporated into prothrombinase. Kinetic studies combined with structural work will seek to establish the
mechanisms underlying the putative allosteric modulation of Xa by this class of molecules. The third aim seeks
to provide an ultimate functional test of how proteolytic activation of factor V imparts Xa binding and cofactor
function by disrupting a tripartite inhibitory motif comprising two acidic regions (AR1 and AR2) flanking the B
domain interact with a centrally located basic region (BR). We propose to identify tight binding nanobody
probes to AR2 and BR. Probes that destabilize or stabilize the inhibitory structure are proposed to allow
cofactor function without proteolysis or prevent the development of factor function after proteolysis. The last
aim extends studies to factors IXa and VIII/VIIIa of intrinsic Xase to address peculiarities that set the proteinase
and cofactor of this complex apart from those of prothrombinase. With IXa, we pursue structural evidence that
suggests that the proteinase may distribute between forms with a distorted and open active site. In factor VIII,
we focus on a thrombin cleavage site at the junction of the A1 and A2 domains, that is essential for cofactor
activation but without a counterpart in factor V. We pursue the hypothesis that loss of cofactor function
associated with the removal of the cleavage site can be rescued by the insertion of a polypeptide spacer to
mimic the putative repositioning of the A1 and A2 domains that might follow cleavage. These strategies,
utilizing novel concepts, are all directed towards how ligand binding or other effects modulate conformation and
dictate function. The proposed approaches will shed new light on important yet poorly understood facets of the
biochemistry and biology of enzyme function relevant to normal hemostasis, in disease states and for
therapeutic targeting of reactions in thrombotic and vascular disease."

Overcoming methodologic barriers to analysis of observational clinico-genomic data in oncology
Project Leaders: Kenneth Kehl (DFCI); Deborah Schrag (MSK) Precision oncology, which seeks to identify
biomarkers to guide treatment selection for individual patients, has been applied increasingly in cancer
research and clinical care. Pursuing this objective requires access to large databases of tumors that have been
both molecularly characterized and clinically annotated. However, the absence of scalable methods for
gathering and analyzing the clinical endpoints necessary to pursue patient-relevant research questions has
been a major barrier to constructing such datasets. Key cancer outcomes, including response to treatment, are
generally not recorded in a structured format in “real-world” electronic health record (EHR) datasets. Extraction
of such outcomes from EHRs has historically required resource-intensive manual medical records review,
which has in turn has suffered from the lack of a standardized data model for medical record annotation across
studies. Real-world molecular testing and follow-up patterns, which may be correlated with endpoints of
interest, constitute an additional challenge to clinico-genomic analysis. Methods to reliably extract clinically
interpretable, reproducible endpoints from EHRs are necessary to advance precision oncology. The
overarching objective of this proposal is to develop, refine, and test such methods at scale. Towards this end,
we have developed the Pathology, Radiology/Imaging, Signs/Symptoms, Medical oncologist assessment, and
bioMarkers (PRISSMM) data model for extracting structured, reproducible cancer outcomes. PRISSMM
provides a rubric for abstraction of specific cancer outcomes from individual imaging reports and medical
oncologist notes and can be used by investigators at any health care system, agnostic to EHR vendor. These
outcomes include the presence of cancer within specific EHR imaging reports and clinical notes, including
assessments of tumor at specific body sites; progression/worsening; and response/improvement. Annotations
of individual reports along the disease trajectory can then be analyzed to derive relevant endpoints, such as
progression-free survival. Still, these “real-world” endpoints will only be useful if they (1) are acceptable to
diverse stakeholders; (2) can be extracted at scale; and (3) can be analyzed using methods that facilitate
unbiased inference. In this project, we will evaluate novel PRISSMM endpoints by measuring associations
among PRISSMM outcomes, traditional RECIST endpoints, and overall survival; train and validate machine
learning/”AI” models to extract endpoints at the scale of a large cross-institutional clinico-genomic dataset; and
develop best practices for time-to-event analysis given informative cohort entry and follow-up patterns in
clinico-genomic data. This project will advance methods for cancer outcome analysis based on real-world
evidence broadly and will enhance the utility and scalability of outcome extraction for the other P01 projects."

Integrating race, ethnicity, and genomic ancestry across GENIE to understand genetic and environmental
contributions to pan-cancer risk, prognosis, and outcomes.
Project Leaders: Ryan Hernandez (UCSF); Sasha Gusev (DFCI)
Despite significant advances in cancer biology and clinical oncology, race-based disparities in cancer outcomes
remain a long-standing challenge. Molecular mechanisms appear to play a role in some cancer disparities; a
notable example is the substantial excess of EGFR mutations in individuals of Asian ancestry with non-small cell
lung cancer. Racial differences have been identified in other cancers, including copy number alterations (CNAs)
that differ in frequency between African American and Caucasian women with triple negative breast cancer,
mutations in the EPHA6 and FLCN genes exclusive to African Americans with colorectal cancer, and recurrent
loss of function mutations in the ERF and KMT2D genes in African Americans with prostate cancer. Such exam-
ples have motivated the study of cross-population differences in cancer biology, especially in the context of
precision oncology. However, data from non-European individuals has been lacking, and most studies have
focused on a specific population or cancer type. Pan-cancer studies of genetic ancestry in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have identified ancestry-associated features across many cancer types, but have few individuals
from non-European populations, and only limited outcomes data from an outdated clinical context. The complex
relationship between race, genetic ancestry, somatic alterations, and clinical outcomes across cancers thus re-
mains largely unknown. The large-scale molecular profiling of tumors by AACR-GENIE presents an opportunity
to tackle these questions in thousands of non-European individuals with rich clinical outcomes in a contemporary,
real world clinical setting. The multi-institutional nature of GENIE also presents an opportunity to establish rigor-
ous methods and protocols for tumor-based ancestry inference across diverse platforms, and for analyses of
tumor-only somatic data from multi-ethnic populations. Finally, there is a history of biomedical research (including
cancer) focused on individuals of European ancestry. Such narrow focus has led to a deep understanding of the
role that select genes play in the etiology of various cancers but introduces bias into the selection of genes that
are interrogated with high throughput sequencing approaches. We will identify cancers for which there is a pau-
city of drivers among individuals with non-European ancestry compared to individuals with European ancestry.
We will utilize whole exome and RNA sequencing in diverse, driverless individuals to uncover new biology. In
collaboration with P01 co-investigators at AACR-GENIE institutions and our collaborators, these novel drivers will
be incorporated into future clinical sequencing panels."

Predictors of sensitivity to immunotherapy and targeted treatments based on real world evidence
Project Leaders: Phillipe Bedard (Princess Margaret); Nikolaus Schultz, (MSK)
Approvals of precision medicines directed against defined genomic targets and immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) for genomic signatures of immunotherapy benefit have transformed the outcomes of many patients whose
tumors harbor these alterations. However, there are unanswered questions about targeting uncommon driver
mutations, as well as the pan-cancer clinical actionability and optimal definition(s) of approved tumor agnostic
genomic biomarkers, such as tumor mutation burden (TMB) for ICI therapy. While each clinical scenario where
these questions remain may be individually rare, hampering the feasibility of prospective clinical trials to address
specific hypotheses, they collectively impact a substantial proportion of patients that might benefit from precision
medicine approaches. The AACR Project GENIE clinical-genomic database is ideally suited for curation of
clinical outcomes of relevant patients with genomic alterations, providing essential additional evidence for
prospective real-world clinical decisions in these scenarios.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Characterize the clinical outcomes of patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitor (ICI) therapy and their association with molecular biomarkers; 2) Evaluate the clinical outcomes of
patients with specific driver mutations treated with targeted therapies; and 3) Leverage observational GENIE
data to improve outcome prediction in the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge base. We will investigate
associations between TMB and clinical-pathological characteristics, genomic covariates, and treatment
outcomes with ICI therapy including progression free survival evaluated using PRISSMM methodology and
overall survival with ICI treatment. We will analyze genomic and transcriptomic data from a subset of samples
associated with outliers responses to ICI treatment. We will curate per patient efficacy outcomes for patients with
rare oncogenic driver mutations, including ERBB2 mutations and BRAF class II/III mutations, treated with
matched off-label targeted therapies to investigate tumor type specificity, variant sensitivity, and the impact of
co-mutations on treatment response. We will create an evidence-based framework within the OncoKB precision
medicine knowledge base to include observational data from GENIE and an outcome prediction tool for ICI
treatment with clinical and genomic covariates. The ultimate goal of this Project is to use observational data from
GENIE to develop a better understanding of predictors of sensitivity to immunotherapy and targeted treatments
to inform clinical decision-making."

Over the last two decades, we and others have documented the chronic and often debilitating experience
of ovarian cancer survivorship which may include poor health related quality of life (HRQOL), elevated
anxiety and depression, poor sleep, fatigue, multiple symptoms/side effects, existential concerns, and a
generally poor prognosis. Because of compromises to many aspects of HRQOL combined with low rates
of survival for the majority of these patients, development of innovative approaches for improving HRQOL
and potentially improving clinical outcomes is of paramount importance. This need is particularly true in
rural settings where women may have less access to clinic-based support systems. Despite the multiple
challenges experienced by ovarian cancer survivors, research targeting the potential efficacy of
psychosocial interventions in enhancing HRQOL has been extremely limited. Over the last several years
this research team has developed and piloted a web-based group conferencing intervention entitled
Living Well (Web-Enhanced Lessons for Living) targeting key concerns of ovarian cancer survivors and
developed with input from survivors. The overarching goal of the present submission is to examine the
efficacy of the Living Well intervention vs. a Health Promotion active control intervention in a randomized
controlled trial in 256 ovarian cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment and are less than
5-years post-diagnosis. We hypothesize that the Living Well Intervention will be efficacious in improving
HRQOL, decreasing perceived stress (primary outcomes) and in decreasing depressive mood, anxiety,
and fatigue (secondary outcomes). This application is highly innovative because it combines elements of
evidence-based psychosocial interventions in a novel way to target the needs of ovarian cancer survivors,
using a state-of-the-art web and video conferencing platform that allows wide dissemination, including to
rural survivors. This work is highly translational as it is a direct application of findings from mechanistic
stress-related research to testing an intervention to reduce stress in ovarian cancer survivors. The
significance of the application is that this intervention has the potential to overcome prior barriers to the
implementation of such psychosocial interventions and improve HRQOL, thus providing public health
benefits to an understudied and compromised cancer population with a high likelihood of recurrence."
10769755,"The goal of the proposal is to determine whether DNA DSBR are killing neurons. DNA repair bas been linked
directly to Huntington Disease (HD) onset by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in patients. CAG
expansion occurs in the process of repairing oxidative DNA damage, and its role for DNA repair was well
established in mouse models. During the past funding cycle, however, we have discovered that mhtt suppresses
DNA repair in brain cells in a cell-type and region-specific manner in the brains of HdhQ(150/150) animals. This
had modest effect on CAG expansion, but at the same time, resulted in the accumulation of DNA double strand
breaks (DSBs) that had gone undetected. DSBs are the most toxic of lesions, and if not repaired lead to cell
death. This raised the issue as to whether the unrepaired and previously unrecognized DSBs were responsible
for killing neurons. We have developed a new approach to defining DNA repair alterations in brain cells, called
repair fingerprinting. In Aim 1, we will use “repair fingerprinting” to determine whether DNA double strand breaks
are formed or repaired differently in astrocytes and neurons, and what pathways are involved. Repair
fingerprinting is an integrated three-arm approach to identify the landscape of DNA repair and extract which
pathways and machinery are responsible for the DSBR in brain cells. In Aim 2, we will determine whether cryptic
DNA double strand breaks are the primary driver of neuronal death in HdhQ(150/150) mice in vivo."

 Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal of all cancers and is largely resistant to all
therapies, including immune therapies (IT). Despite this resistance, there are no fewer than 12 open clinical
trials investigating treatment of PDAC with checkpoint blockade IT. There are multiple mechanisms that can
account for this resistance, including the acidosis of PDAC tumors, which is due to high rates of glycolysis in
combination with poor perfusion. Placement of activated T cells in acidic conditions profoundly inhibits their
effector functions. We have shown that neutralization of tumor acidosis with oral NaHCO3 in murine models of
PDAC can lead to dramatic improvements in response to checkpoint blockade. However, phase I/IIa clinical
trials with bicarbonate failed to dose escalate. Thus, there is a compelling need to develop clinically viable
alternatives to achieve the same result, viz. neutralization of tumor acidity in vivo in order to combine with IT. A
therapy designed to directly neutralize tumor acidity is a clinically-tested CEACAM6-targeted urease (L-
DOS47, Helix Biopharma). This cleaves endogenous urea into two NH4+ and one CO2, thus alkalinizing local
pH, and this agent will be our primary focus in the proposed studies.
 We will use these approaches to test the hypothesis that neutralizing tumor acidity with L-DOS47 will
be additive or synergistic with checkpoint blockade in mouse models of PDAC. Our preliminary data
support these hypotheses, yet there are gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled prior to embarking on
clinical trials combining L-DOS47 with immune therapy. Preliminary data have shown improved response to
checkpoint blockade in combination with L-DOS47 in Panc02 tumors; an immune competent model of PDAC,
and we plan to expand this to more biomedically relevant models in the current work. These will be addressed
in 3 Aims: Aim 1 will determine the in situ pharmacodynamics (PD) of these agents using molecular imaging of
1.1) pH and 1.2) enzyme activity in order to optimize dosing schema to achieve acid neutralization. In Aim 2,
we will combine these agents with checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1) to improve tumor control in
mouse models of PDAC engineered to express CEACAM6 (Panc02, UN-KPC960/961). A secondary endpoint
in this aim will be to develop imaging biomarkers of response that can be used prior to therapy to predict, and
during therapy to monitor, response. Aim 3 will address the fundamental question of HOW an acidic pH
induces T cell stasis. Preliminary data have shown that acidification of pHe induces a subtle, yet significant,
drop in pHi, which may be responsible for subsequent T-cell stasis. We will also investigate whether there is a
disruption of Ca2+ signaling dynamics, leading to altered NFAT distribution, and whether there is a differential
sensitivity of T-cells to acidosis, compared with acid-adapted or acid-naïve cancer cells and fibroblasts.
 At the completion of this study, we will have developed a clinically translatable approach to improve IT in
PDAC as well as an improved understanding of the mechanism underlying acid inhibition."
10769759,"ABSTRACT — Combination chemoradiation is utilized to treat multiple gastrointestinal (GI) cancers including
rectal cancer. Rectal cancer affects 40,000 people per year in the US. Approximately 85% of patients have an
incomplete or poor response to treatment increasing their risk of recurrence. We have found that poor responders
harbor sub-clones that are more resistant to treatment, and that the enzyme ST6Gal-1 is enriched in these sub-
clones. ST6Gal-1 is a Golgi glycosyltransferase that adds the negatively-charged sugar, sialic acid (SA), to
specific proteins destined for the cell surface. SA can have profound effects on the structure and function of
proteins. ST6Gal-1 is one of the most pervasively upregulated glycosyltransferases in cancer cells. ST6Gal-1
has been shown to specifically promote tumor cell survival and resistance via sialylation. In addition, ST6Gal-1
has been found in extracellular vesicles (ECVs) made by cancer cells. ECVs are particles with a lipid membrane
that contains RNA and protein cargo; thus, they are potential mediators of transferable resistance between
cancer sub-clones. The role of ST6Gal-1 and ECVs in resistance to chemoradiation has not been investigated.
The overall objective of this application is to ascertain the role of ST6Gal-1 in innate and transferable resistance
to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that ST6Gal-1 mediates
resistance to chemoradiation in individual sub-clones in rectal cancer, that this resistance is transferred
to other sub-clones via ECVs spreading resistance, and that this resistance is regulated by ST6Gal-1
cleavage by BACE1. We have found that ST6Gal-1 is increased in rectal cancer models after treatment with
chemoradiation. We will investigate our hypothesis with 3 aims: AIM 1 — Determine the role of ST6Gal-1 in
chemoradiation resistance in human rectal cancer. We hypothesize that ST6Gal-1 causes treatment
resistance after chemoradiation by inhibiting apoptosis. We will employ cell sorting, sequencing, and shRNA
approaches. We will also conduct studies to investigate its function in patient samples. AIM 2 — Determine if
ECVs carrying ST6Gal-1 transfer resistance to chemoradiation between sub-clones in rectal cancer. We
hypothesize that ECVs act as vectors that impart resistance to chemoradiotherapy from sub-clone to sub-clone
by trafficking ST6Gal-1, and thus, glycoprotein sialylation, in rectal cancer causing decreased apoptosis in the
recipient sub-clones. AIM 3 — Determine if BACE1 promotes chemoradiosensitivity in rectal cancer due,
in part, to ST6Gal-1 cleavage. We show that BACE1 mRNA is increased in tumors from patients who
completely respond to chemoradiotherapy. BACE1 is known to cleave ST6Gal-1, and we found through inhibitor
studies that BACE1 appear to regulate SA due to cleavage of ST6Gal-1 by BACE1. This research will evaluate
a previously unknown mechanism of resistance to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer, with future potential for
development of novel therapeutics that could target multiple resistant sub-clones across multiple GI
adenocarcinomas, where the standard of care is pre-operative chemoradiation treatment."
10769784,"Project Summary/Abstract
When parents quit smoking, their life expectancy is increased by an average of over 10 years, future tobacco-
related poor pregnancy outcomes are eliminated, their children have much lower odds of becoming adult
smokers, and their children may no longer be exposed to high levels of tobacco smoke, decreasing the odds of
contracting diseases caused by tobacco smoke exposure and resulting in fewer missed school days. Helping
parents and household members quit smoking also improves the financial resources of families, decreases the
risk of developmental delays, and lowers the risk of house fires. Parents who smoke are often medically
underserved, visiting their child's healthcare provider more often than they see their own clinician, if they even
have one. Despite this extraordinary opportunity for intervention, child healthcare settings deliver effective
tobacco dependence treatment to parents less than 2% of the time. Routinely delivered tobacco control to
parents in child healthcare settings would benefit the overall health of the nation. The goal of the proposed
study is to ensure that every parent who smokes tobacco or is a dual user of tobacco and e-cigarettes
and visits their child's doctor receives evidence-based assistance to quit. We propose testing an
innovative EHR systems platform (iEHR) in pediatric practices. The iEHR will facilitate universal screening
for household tobacco use and routine offering and provision, if desired, of tobacco cessation services. We will
compare this intervention to iEHR + navigator to test the effectiveness of additional support by a community
health navigator. The navigator will work with pediatric offices to assist household tobacco users in cessation
through telephone follow-up, ensuring access to services, and home visits, based on what they want to help
them quit smoking. This trial will address critical unanswered questions of effectiveness, sustainability, and
cost-effectiveness of a parental tobacco cessation intervention that supports delivery of tobacco cessation
services using iEHR, with or without a navigator. This proposal is in exact alignment with NCI's objective to
fund research to reduce the burden of cancer for patients and other affected persons through improvements in
early detection, prevention, healthcare delivery, quality of life, and/or survivorship related to cancer. Aims are:
A1. To compare parents' combusted tobacco quit rates, and adoption of tobacco free behaviors between the
two intervention arms (1°: iEHR+Navigator vs. iEHR; 2°: each intervention vs. usual care control)
A2. To establish the incremental cost per quit of the two intervention arms vs. usual care control
A3. To assess the delivery and sustainability of the interventions
Building on the success of past trials, this application will evaluate an innovative EHR-linked tobacco
cessation intervention addressing household tobacco use with and without navigator support. The
study is designed to yield fully-integrated, cost-effective, disseminable, and sustainable strategies to
optimize parental cessation outcomes throughout child healthcare settings nationally."
10769899,"The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the
literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold
structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the
same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR)
effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a
remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy
kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per
gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on
“active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks
to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking
on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution
and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the
correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on
GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects,
hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such
issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon
achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within
this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown
below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the
biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant
treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution
image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human
trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the
foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and
tumor-specific RT with less toxicity."

Cancer affects the health of millions of Americans. Studying molecular mechanisms that endow cells with
malignant properties is an essential component of advancing pre-clinical studies and a key part of efforts to
improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this COBRE submission is to establish the Center for Molecular
Interactions in Cancer (CMIC) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The mission of the
CMIC is to study molecular features and functional properties of biomolecules that drive cancer. The unifying
theme of research among Center members is the coupling of structural biology and high-resolution imaging with
precise, quantitative analysis of biochemical and cellular processes to understand how molecular interactions
govern the initiation, progression and treatment of cancer. In Phase 1 of this COBRE, we will pursue the following
aims: (Aim 1) establish the CMICcreating an organizational framework that ensures the success of junior
investigators as independent scientists and strengthens the research infrastructure at UAMS and its affiliate
institutions, (Aim 2) build a thematic, multidisciplinary COBRE center with unique collaborative opportunities and
strong research programs focused on understanding the molecular basis of cancer, and (Aim 3) implement a
plan for long-term sustainability of the CMIC. The organization of the CMIC will include 5 Research Projects, an
Administrative Core, and 2 new research coresthe Structural Biology Core and the Biomolecular Interactions
Core. The Administrative Core will oversee operation of the Center, including a Pilot Project Program to fuel the
pipeline of replacement Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and a formalized Faculty Development Plan that
includes individualized mentoring. The Structural Biology Core will help RPLs plan and execute structure-function
studies by ensuring high-quality sample preparation and providing access to world-class instrumentation and
computational resources required for high-resolution structural studies. The Biomolecular Interactions Core will
enable researchers to perform quantitative analysis of macromolecular interactions and dynamics down to the
level of single-molecules. Both research cores will assist users in experimental design, data analysis and
interpretation of results, while also providing training and educational outreach. The CMIC will address an
institutional priority at UAMS and contribute to the mission of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute by
creating a critical mass of investigators who are able to gain molecular-level insights into mechanisms that are
crucial for a deep understanding of cancer biology. Our long-term goal is to leverage faculty mentoring, strategic
recruitment, and cutting-edge core resources to develop a critical mass of investigators that will support a self-
sustaining center in which research advances our knowledge of cancer through precise and comprehensive
analyses of molecular events that impact malignant pathogenesis."

expertise, administrative background, and mentoring track record required to serve as Center Director. Center
Deputy Director, Dr. Fen Xia, will assist Dr. Eoff in the operational oversight of the Center, adding scientific and
administrative expertise to the CMIC leadership team. During Phase 1, the Administrative Core will develop an
organizational framework that provides a scientific and administrative infrastructure that serves the needs of
Center members. The short-term goals of the Administrative Core will be to coordinate all Center activities,
implement a Faculty Development Plan, develop 2 productive and efficient research cores, oversee a Pilot
Project Program to fuel the growth of the Center, facilitate interactions with the Advisory Committee and
institutional officials, maximize use of IDeA resources, and coordinate evaluation of all Center components.
These activities will enhance the ability of junior investigators to compete for NIH individual research grants or
equivalent extramural supportensuring the longevity of the Center by building a critical mass of successful
researchers interested in using structural biology and quantitative molecular approaches to address critical gaps
in our understanding of cancer etiology and treatment, which aligns with the long-term goal of transitioning the
CMIC to a self-sustaining, thematic center that increases the biomedical research capacity at UAMS and its
affiliate institutes. To achieve the short-term and long-term goals of the CMIC, Center leadership will pursue the
following Specific Aims in the Administrative Core: (Aim 1) establish an organizational framework to manage all
Center components and activities, (Aim 2) implement a Faculty Development Plan that includes formal
mentoring and structured training opportunities designed to increase the likelihood that junior investigators will
successfully compete for NIH individual grants and build capacity within the Center, and (Aim 3) support the
growth and evolution of the Center by overseeing a Pilot Project Program to fuel replenishment of the RPL

10769963,"Summary for the Structural Biology Core (Core B) led by Core Director Eric Enemark, PhD
 Our understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel therapeutics both rely on an atomic-level
understanding of the biomolecular structures and the dynamic interactions that govern function. The COBRE
Center for Molecular Interactions in Cancer (CMIC) will leverage available resources, expertise, and
institutional support to create a new Structural Biology Core (Core B) that is essential for the research mission
of the Center—namely, studying the structural features of biomolecules that impact their function in cancer. This
core will be directed by Eric Enemark, PhD, nationally recognized as a leader in the field of structural biology.
This new core does not duplicate existing core facilities or shared resources at the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences (UAMS). It will have experienced staff and state-of-the-art equipment. Our major goal during
Phase 1 is to provide highly-specialized support and educational opportunities to current and future CMIC
Research Project Leaders (RPLs), as well as other Center members, for studies that use structural approaches
to investigate biomolecules implicated in the etiology of cancer. To achieve this goal, we will pursue 3 Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will establish a new core facility for advanced structural biology, especially X-ray
crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In Aim 2, we will deliver state-of-the-art services for
CMIC RPLs, including collection, analysis, and interpretation, as well as assistance in the visualization and
reporting of the results. In Aim 3, we will provide training and education related to structural methodologies and
quantitative analysis of biomolecules, extending our efforts outwards from the CMIC to the broader research
community at UAMS and other campuses in Arkansas. An important long-term goal is to create a self-sustained
core by establishing a recharge mechanism and serving as a resource in future program project grants submitted
by CMIC investigators. The Structural Biology Core fits squarely within the theme of the Center as it will facilitate
rigorous and technically challenging investigations of macromolecules, complexes, and processes that drive
tumor malignancy and the pathways that influence therapy resistance."
10769964,"Summary for the Biomolecular Interactions Core (Core C) led by Core Director Kevin Raney, PhD
 Biological systems rely on dynamic interactions between macromolecules to maintain cellular homeostasis
and respond to metabolic cues. Determining the biophysical and biochemical properties of proteins, nucleic
acids, and other macromoleculesincluding the size and composition of multi-subunit complexes and dynamic
interactionsis central to understanding molecular mechanisms and biological function. Each Research Project
Leader (RPL) in the Center for Molecular Interactions in Cancer (CMIC) will use biophysical tools to quantify
the size, stoichiometry, and dynamic nature of macromolecules. The CMIC will leverage available resources,
expertise, and significant institutional support to create a new Biomolecular Interactions Core (Core C) that
will support an important research mission of the center – namely, to use precise and quantitative methods to
define how biomolecules function in cancer. Directed by Kevin Raney, PhD, a nationally-recognized leader in
the field of enzymology, the Biomolecular Interactions Core will be a unique, new core with experienced staff
and state-of-the-art equipment that does not duplicate existing facilities or shared resources at the University of

Ribosomes are composed of ribonucleoproteins and are essential for protein biosynthesis, which is one of
the most complex biological processes in the cell. In prokaryotes, mature ribosomes contain proteins (r-
proteins) and RNA (rRNA) that are assembled into the mature 70S ribosome. The 70S ribosomes are made
by two subunits, designated as the 30S (small) and the 50S ribosome (large) subunits. The small subunit is
composed of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and over 20 core r-proteins while the large subunit is composed
of 23S and 5S rRNAs, and more than 30 core r-proteins. Ribosome is not a stationary entity, rather it is
adapted to changing environments giving rise to ribosome heterogeneity. Additionally, several small
accessory proteins modulate the biogenesis, recycling, and function of the ribosome; many of these proteins
and their molecular functions remain to be discovered.
During protein synthesis, translational fidelity is maintained with high accuracy. However, the average
translation error rate is relatively higher (10-4 to 10-3 per codon) compared to transcription or replication error
rates. Maintaining proper translational fidelity requires cognate pairing of amino acids and tRNAs by
aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) synthetase and accurate decoding of mRNA codons by the corresponding aa-
tRNAs on the ribosome. Several core and accessory r-proteins drive the correct decoding of the codons to
maintain the translational fidelity. Various stress conditions such as nutritional and oxidative stresses often
lead to mistranslation and growth defects in bacteria. We have recently identified several factors including a
conserved novel protein, SprV (90 amino acids), in Streptococcus mutans (an oral pathogen) that is required
for translational fidelity, stress tolerance and adaptation. The major goal of this study is to understand at the
molecular level how SprV and other accessory proteins such as L9 (r-protein) and EF-P modulate
translational fidelity to alter physiology and biological fitness of oral streptococci."

The mission of the Protein Biotechnology Training Program (BTP) at Washington State University (WSU) is to
expand access to research opportunities and research-related careers by helping PhD trainees attain essential
experiences, skills, and knowledge in protein research and biotechnology creation, and by promoting research-
informed graduate education and inclusive research ecosystems. Our objectives are shaped by
recommendations from the National Academy’s 2018 report on Graduate STEM Education for the 21st Century,
from NIGMS’s T32 objectives, and from 34 years of BTP program experience. Our program connects
participants from five world-class graduate programs in four WSU colleges that share interests in protein-
focused chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, and molecular biology. This multi-department model creates an
environment where a 40–45 trainee cohort gains experience with transdisciplinary collaboration to generate
technologies and solve problems in training environments that cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion.
Our emphasis on biotechnology creation and industry engagement is conducive to trainee-centered, project-
based learning that builds skills that are applicable to a wide range of biomedical careers in private, public,
and academic settings. Our twelve core program components include didactic instruction in biotech
commercialization and rigorous research practice, a self-directed 2-3 month mentored internship with a
biotech company, a monthly professional development forum for trainees, a research-informed mentorship
training forum for faculty, connections with a biotech industry group, and a trainee-centered annual
symposium. Our activities help trainees attain career awareness and develop operational and professional
skills that complement technical achievements through increasingly self-directed mentored research.
Commitment to mentorship, mentorship training, and building safe, ethical, and inclusive research
environments are criteria for selection of our 41 faculty trainers.
In this application we show that our program has continuously evolved activities, mentoring, and evaluation
to better serve trainees, including our 120+ doctoral graduates. We shape graduate and mentored research
training at WSU with innovative implementation of mentorship training, multidimensional evaluation, and
project-centered course designs. If funded, we will continue a long-held practice of matching every NIH-
funded position with a unit-funded position (including associated tuition and fees, travel funds, annual
symposium support, and commitments for bridging funds and assistance with childcare expenses). With no
other predoctoral T32 program at WSU and being in a region that lacks other biotechnology training
opportunities, we are well positioned to deliver value to trainees, our institution, the region, and country."

Veterinary scientists are trained to be key contributors to One Health and are ideally situated to deliver
services in biomedicine, zoonotic diseases, agricultural systems, ecosystems health, and spontaneous models
of human disease. Exposure of DVM students to diverse research programs is a critical first step in promoting
their development in the scientific method. This training program is designed to build on the established and
successful DVM Summer Research Program that has a >20-year record of recruiting and comprehensively
immersing veterinary medical students in summer research experiences on the MSU campus. These research
experiences focus on three major areas that align with the NIH mission: (1) Microbial ecology and evolution;
microbial pathogenesis, microbial population structure and functioning in health and disease, Microbe-host-
environment interface biology; (2) Comparative medicine (oncology, inflammation, cardiology, theriogenology,
genetics, ophthalmology, orthopedics); and (3) Systems approach to population level investigations. The DVM
summer research program at CVM includes a carefully planned delivery of modules required to prepare
participating students for further training in the biomedical research. Our program promotes diversity in
composition and content and has provided an in-road to the successful development of an R25 to enhance
underrepresented minority recruitment into DVM classes. We have successfully recruited 50 students from
underrepresented groups over the last 10 years, with 31 of them being appointed as T35 fellows and 19 in the
R25 BRUSH program. Thus, the primary objective of this T35 education research program is to increase the
number of veterinary students from diverse groups who pursue biomedical research-related educational goals
and career paths relevant to the core mission areas of the NIH. Toward this end, the program is designed to -
1) provide summer scholars a research experience and an overview of career opportunities in academia,
government, and biomedical industry, 2) cultivate a science identity through mentor and peer networks, and 3)
provide a positive reinforced framework to help foster confidence required to pursue a career in science."

More than a third of pediatric adverse events have been attributed to diagnostic error—the failure
to establish an accurate and timely explanation of a child’s health problem. Within the pediatric
intensive care unit (PICU), a high-stakes, complex, team-driven environment, diagnostic error
rates vary between 8% and 25%. To improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision support (CDS)
tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, have been developed but
have failed to be adopted within the PICU. Implementation of CDS into an active high-risk clinical
context without a comprehensive understanding of how providers and staff interface with the
system can lead to patient safety consequences. These consequences can include disrupted
workflows, alert fatigue, and inaccurate documentation that can lead to direct patient harm. We
propose leveraging a currently built highly realistic immersive virtual reality PICU clinical
environment to assess implementation strategies on clinician acceptance of CDS tools to improve
diagnostic excellence within a patient safety learning lab. We will evaluate three aims using a
systems-engineering approach combining the expertise of LiveWell, an award-winning design
collaborative with user-centered design and human factors expertise, with the clinical knowledge,
implementation science expertise, and world-renowned virtual simulation program of Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). We will: redesign how clinicians interface with CDS
tools for diagnosis-intensive events within the pediatric critical care environment including
admission and clinical deterioration; develop and implement design-informed CDS tools for
diagnosis and to evaluate their appropriateness/acceptability and impact on diagnostic
uncertainty, accuracy, and timeliness within a digital twin immersive virtual reality simulation; and
establish best practice guidance for implementation of CDS tools in the critical care environment
to improve diagnostic excellence. Outcomes will include 1) appropriateness, acceptability, and
adoption of design informed CDS tools; 2) impact on diagnostic accuracy and timeliness in the
simulated clinical environment; and 3) a proactive implementation plan for the integration of
design informed CDS tools to improve diagnostic excellence into the critical care environment."

Currently, we can record non-invasive fetal magnetocardiographic (FMCG) signals with a magnetic sensor-
based system called SARA (SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment) installed at University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences. The study of the fetal heart, and in particular, the developing cardiac conduction system, has
been significantly aided in the last two decades by the introduction of FMCG. The American Heart Association
recently acknowledged the academic and clinic usefulness of this new modality. Several studies have shown
that FMCG can provide new relevant clinical parameters for assessment of fetal cardiac activity and also
supplement the parameters that are currently available. Despite all these benefits, the major hurdles facing
SQUID technology include system and maintenance cost, cryogenic helium cooling, a rigid one-size-fits-all array,
and a single position option for the mother. We have shown the feasibility of using uncooled biomagnetometer
for potential prenatal assessments based on microfabricated optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM). The
OPMs have many features similar to cryogenic SQUID-based systems as they measure the same field
components, and are compatible with standard magnetically-shielded rooms. This proposal is in response to
NIBIB’s PAR-19-158 Bioengineering Research Grants, where we apply a multidisciplinary integrative team
approach to we plan to design, test and validate a 24-channel OPM sensor system that fits over the maternal
abdomen. Performance of the OPM in a three-layered shielded room will be evaluated with respect to the data
quality of FMCG signals which will be compared to those obtained from a gold standard SQUID based system.
The overall goal is to demonstrate that with OPM systems (a) we can design a stand-alone flexible array for
maternal-fetal application (b) record the desired biomagnetic signals equivalent to SQUID sensors; (c) be able
to separate the signal into their constituents to extract FMCG and (d) quantify fetal heart signals and the relevant
metrics. We believe that with potential lower costs and maintenance requirements, the benefits of using fetal
biomagnetometery could be translated from the research to possible widespread clinical applications.
The specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Design and configure a bed-based stand-alone array of OPMs that conforms to the shape of the
maternal abdomen in order to obtain signals with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for fetal applications.
Aim 2: Extract and quantify the FMCG waveform components to compute a) PQRS and T wave detection
rates and cardiac time intervals (CTI).
Aim 3: Record and characterize FMCG of fetuses that have been referred with abnormal heart conditions
detected through routine ultrasound examination."

Parasitic worms (helminths) currently infect 1-2 billion humans and are the cause of widespread morbidity.
Helminth infections of livestock result in large economic losses. Meanwhile, the incidence of allergies is
increasing globally, but particularly in regions where helminths are absent. Although seemingly unrelated,
helminths and allergens are immunologically linked as they both induce a type 2 immune response. The
activation and regulation of type 2 immunity remain incompletely understood, especially in the small intestine
(SI). We recently discovered that rare chemosensory epithelial tuft cells are required for anti-helminth immunity
in the SI. Tuft cells activate group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which in turn secrete canonical type 2
cytokines to coordinate hallmarks of type 2 immunity, such as eosinophilia and tissue remodeling. Specifically,
IL-13 signaling in epithelial progenitors biases their lineage commitment towards tuft cells, leading to tuft cell
hyperplasia during helminth infection and in mice colonized with Tritrichomonas protists. This tuft-ILC2 circuit is
activated when tuft cells sense succinate secreted by Tritrichomonas, but the ligand and receptor mediating
helminth sensing remain unknown. Additionally, while the cells and intercellular signals of the tuft-ILC2 circuit
are emerging, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the circuit remain completely unknown,
especially within the epithelium. In this proposal, we examine how POU2F3 is regulated to induce tuft cell
hyperplasia (Aim 1), test the function of KIT signaling in tuft cells (Aim 2), and characterize novel tuft cell
ligands and the intracellular signals they activate (Aim 3). In addition to helminth infection, the tuft-ILC2 circuit
has recently been implicated in enteric virus infection and ileitis induced by bacterial dysbiosis. Therefore, the
regulatory mechanisms uncovered by this project promise to identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of
numerous SI pathologies."

This project will undertake an integrated set of data enhancements and user education, support, and outreach
efforts to expand the research and policy communities’ use of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), the PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS), and the PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement
(TAS). PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of US families that began in 1968. It
has collected data on the same families and their descendants for 42 waves over 54 years (as of 2022). PSID
provides long-term measurement, over the life course and across generations, of economic, social, demo-
graphic, and health processes, which has inspired researchers to investigate the dynamics of these processes
and their interrelationships. CDS was launched 25 years ago, in 1997, to collect data on children in PSID fami-
lies. Seven waves of CDS have been completed, with three waves (in 1997, 2002, and 2007) on the original
CDS cohort of children and with two major waves (in 2014 and 2019) and two follow-up Covid-focused waves
(in 2020 and 2021) on all PSID children aged 0–17 years. Nine biennial waves of TAS have been completed.
From 2005 through 2015, TAS collected data on members of the original CDS cohort; since 2017, TAS has
collected data on all young adults aged 18–28 years in PSID families. PSID data are an unparalleled resource
for research on topics of major scientific and policy interest, such as the intergenerational transmission of
health, development, and well-being, determinants and consequences of children’s development, cohort and
period effects on children’s outcomes, children’s time use, the transition to adulthood, and many other topics.
However, the complexity and richness of these data can be challenging for new users and even for many ex-
perienced analysts. The goal of this project is to make the use of these data easier and more efficient for all
users. The specific aims of this project are to: teach an annual course on PSID data analysis geared to new
users of the data; assist researchers who encounter complex problems by providing high quality, rapid re-
sponse user-support services and through online facilities for users; undertake a variety of enhancements to
PSID data and dissemination that will make it quicker and easier for both new and experienced researchers to
conduct research with these data; conduct an annual user workshop to foster exchange and interaction among
new and experienced researchers; and increase the size and disciplinary breath of the PSID, CDS, and TAS
user community by conducting a variety of outreach efforts. The activities in this project will further increase the
widespread use of the PSID, CDS, and TAS data, and will promote efficient and productive use of these data
by new and experienced users of the data archive."

10771568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In alignment with the national interest in increasing diversity in the biomedical science workforce, and the mission
of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to provide opportunity to the broadest possible student population,
we are submitting this first renewal proposal to fund the UIC Portal to Biomedical Research Careers PREP
(PBRC-PREP). In the proposed funding period, PBRC-PREP will support the aspirations of 30 (6 per cohort)
recent baccalaureates who are from populations underrepresented in the biomedical sciences and who are
highly motivated to obtain a PhD or dual degree (MD/PhD, PharmD/PhD) and enter a research career, but who
lack adequate research experience and scientific maturity to gain entry into top PhD programs. The PBRC-PREP
will continue to provide an intensive research experience and activities aimed at scholars improving their critical
thinking and written and oral communication skills, and to develop in the scholars a sense of belonging within
the scientific community. Three tangible outcomes envisioned for PBRC-PREP Scholars are that they (1)
become proficient in research, critical thinking, writing and communication skills, (2) develop competitive
applications for top PhD or dual degree programs, and (3) that they build a foundation that supports their success
in such programs and on into a biomedical research career. In the previous funded period 79% of PBRC-PREP
Scholars entered PhD, MD/PhD or PharmD/PhD programs. In the proposed project, we will build on this success
and strengthen our program based on scholar and mentor feedback and external evaluation. PBRC-PREP
Scholars will be recruited nationally and through an enhanced effort to recruit from the highly diverse
undergraduate populations at UIC and Illinois State University. The PBRC-PREP begins with a Summer Boot
Camp that integrates the research mentor selection process with skills development in critical thinking and oral

The Michigan O'Brien Kidney Translational Resource Center (MKTC) aims to provide an effective
translational research pipeline for research base investigators to develop novel, mechanistic treatment
strategies for patients with acute and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs).
The Primary Goal of the Applied Systems Biology Core (ASBC) is to be the catalyst of this process by
providing expert consulting services for integrative data mining of genome wide renal data sets. During the last
14 years, the ASBC team has developed a unique set of tools and skills to serve as the bridge connecting the
deep biological and clinical knowledge of the domain experts in the MKTC Research labs with the relevant
segments in large-scale molecular and clinical renal disease data sets. The Core supports a wide range of
research efforts by kidney researchers ranging from NIH training and career development grant awardees,
independent investigators and NIH-funded multicenter research networks.
The main objective of the ASBC is to empower investigators to mine and extract pertinent knowledge from
genome-scale data sets from human kidney disease and model systems in support of their research needs:
(a) Understand kidney development, function and injury in global molecular terms;
(b) Define molecular markers of functionally defined renal disease categories and their progression;
(c) Identify critical pathways for therapeutic focus;
(d) Functionally define patient populations for targeted clinical trials;
(e) Mapping molecular responses to treatments in trial participants back to pathways and model systems.
To meet this objective, the ASBC provides a unique set of tools and skills to the reginal, national and global
Kidney Research Community. Specific Functions of the Core will be to assist investigators in integrating the
rich genetic and molecular data sets in their focused, hypothesis driven research to concentrate these studies
on human, disease-associated mechanisms. This will be implemented with a two-tiered approach with the
ASBC team providing individualized search strategies using a suite of data mining and visualization tools to
link the research base investigators with molecular insights gleaned from human and model data sets.
Interactive shared data-mining will be performed by a systems biologist–biomedical/clinician scientist research
team using interactive or semi-structured work flows. In parallel, ASBC will employ standardized and
containerized workflows for large-scale data sets of kidney disease for semi-supervised data mining by
experienced center investigators.
The ASBC will serve as a bi-directional translational machine driving interactions between basic and clinical
scientists towards the rapid discovery and implementation of novel insights and therapies for kidney diseases."

The main goal of the University of Michigan O'Brien Kidney Translational Resource Center (MKTC) is to
provide an effective translational research pipeline to develop novel, mechanistic treatment strategies for patients
with kidney diseases. The continuing need of kidney researchers to mine and extract pertinent knowledge from
multi-scalar data sets has necessitated a new Data Analytic Services Core (DASC). DASC will support the
investigators by assembling large-scale data sets derived from the clinical cohort studies and trials, from model
system studies from the renal research community at large. The key objectives of the DASC will be to empower
investigators to independently mine multi-scale data sets, specifically to:
(a) Understand kidney development and injury in global molecular terms in human disease and models;
(b) Define molecular and clinical markers of diagnosis and progression;
(c) Identify critical pathways for therapeutic attack;
(d) Identify patient populations for focused clinical trials;
(e) Perform longitudinal analysis of multi-scale data linking molecular and phenotypic data;
(f) Identify subjects at risk of disease or disease progression; and
(g) Link specific cohorts with background health systems data to permit risk factor evaluation, prediction
 modeling, and outcomes analyses among those not recruited/sampled in specific cohort studies.
The data set(s) hosted by the DASC will span the full translational research pipeline from preclinical kidney
disease model system studies to the human cohort data sets derived. This data will be loaded into DASC-hosted
data mining and sharing platforms which have been developed to enable integration of multi-scale data sets to
be mined, analyzed, and shared by research base investigators. The data mining and analytic interfaces to
interrogate genetic, molecular, histological, or clinical features of interest have been specifically developed
towards the needs of the renal researcher. The DASC will continue this development trajectory while enabling
use by the MKTC research community. The core will provide a suite of independent and complimentary platform
approaches serving distinct needs of the research user personas we have defined in our reginal, national and
global kidney research community."
10915006,"ABSTRACT - RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT CORE (RDC)
The main goal of the University of Michigan O'Brien Kidney Translational Resource Center (MKTC) is to
provide an effective translational research pipeline that relies on a systems biology approach to develop
novel, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with kidney diseases. Our Resource
Development Core (RDC) will support the Applied Systems Biology Core (ASBC), the Data Analytic Services
Core (DASC) and the kidney research community at large by developing a unified platform and methods that
integrate multidimensional data, cohort selection and clinical trial design. The University of Michigan Precision
Health Initiative (PHI), which incorporates all data from Michigan Medicine patients in addition to social
determinants of health and biological samples, represents a unique resource that the RDC will expand upon to
develop the following pipelines:
a. Biomarker candidate selection, assay, validation, and incorporation into study design. The RDC will
establish a database and pipeline to provide investigators the most promising biomarkers, relevant assays
based on the outcomes investigated, in addition to guidance surrounding validation and quality control.
b. Cohort development. We will leverage the infrastructure of the PHI to build algorithms to identify and curate
with high confidence kidney-specific diagnoses, relevant clinical characteristics, laboratory testing, social
determinants of health, well as outcomes through integrating multiple data sources including billing codes and
natural language processing. The end-result will provide investigators the ability to easily identify relevant
cohorts and rapidly retrieve data in a format that is ready to analyze through a graphical user interface.
c. Kidney outcomes. We will establish a pipeline to incorporate United States Renal Data System (USRDS)
data into the PHI platform, enriching the Michigan Medicine dataset and providing confirmatory data for cohort-
specific analyses.
d. Novel metabolomic technologies and multi-omic integration. In addition to developing spatial metabolomic
platform, we improve tools for annotation of untargeted metabolomics data and identification of new
compounds and provide novel integrative analysis of metabolomics-proteomics-transcriptomics- epigenomics
data.
e. Clinical trial design. We will establish a workflow for kidney-specific clinical trial design and implementation,
as well as provide associated workshops through the highly successful Clinical Trials Academy.
The pipelines and workflows to be established by the RDC will provide investigators across the spectrum of
research stages – from bench (biomarker discovery) to bedside (clinical trial design) – the ability to integrate of
multidimensional data – from social determinants of health to organic biomarkers and outcomes – in
addressing the major challenges the management of patients with kidney disease."
10892278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. GC surgery is highly morbid,
and responses to the limited array of treatment options are poor. There is hope that recent genomic sequencing
data can be leveraged to develop newer, improved molecular therapies for GC, but rigorous mechanistic testing
is still needed to validate the therapeutic potential of targeting any newly proposed oncogenes.
 Immunotherapy is an exciting new therapy that has revolutionized oncology and shows tremendous
potential. In contrast to cytotoxic chemotherapies, which exhibit fractional killing invariably leading to resistance,
immune cells can infiltrate almost all anatomic sites to recognize and completely eliminate malignant cells in
primary and wide-spread metastatic disease. However, the immune system’s full anti-tumor killing potential can
be restricted by evasive measures by the tumor and/or intrinsic immunosuppressive mechanisms that limit
collateral damage to normal tissues during anti-tumor inflammatory reactions. In GC, little is known about how
cancer cells evade the system, and studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-
immune interactions have been limited by a lack of physiologically relevant in vitro human systems
where state-of-the-art genetic approaches can be applied. These mechanisms are important because they
would be essential to our understanding of GC tumorigenesis and the regulation of immunotherapeutic
responses. Such mechanistic insight on the immune system to GC is fundamental and significant to advance
and improve GC therapies. In this proposal, we utilize a series of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to create
novel forward genetically engineered models of the four major GC subtypes as defined by The Cancer Genome
Atlas project, including chromosomal instability (CIN), genomic stability (GS), microsatellite instability (MSI) and
Epstein-Barr virus-associated (EBV) in primary 3D human gastric organoids (Aim1 and Aim2). In a parallel
translational aim, we propose to use a second-generation patient-derived organoid model that allows tumor and
stroma to be preserved alongside each other to study interactions between tumor cells and their veritable
ecosystem of cohabiting immune cells in primary human gastric cancer (Aim 3). The overall goal of this project
is to investigate how genetic alterations contribute to gastric tumorigenesis and immunotherapeutic responses
using synergistic next-generation in vivo and in vitro models. Collectively, the results of this project will provide
new insights into fundamental aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-immune interaction
and enhance current GC immunotherapies.
 A team of expert mentors, advisors and collaborators will train Dr. Lo in new methods that are critical to
the success of this research. The combination of mentoring support, skills, and data obtained in the K99 phase
will provide Dr. Lo a springboard to achieving independence as an investigator in the R00 phase and beyond."
10746824,"Antibodies are crucial, central regulators of the immune response. They are particularly versatile
therapeutic agents due to their ability to both bind to a target with high affinity and direct the
immune system. Indeed, antibodies comprise a broad range of approved therapies across
disease indications, many of which are known to rely in large part on effector cell (immune)
response. Antibodies of the IgG isotype interact with FcγRs on effector cells and elicit effector
function through multiple cell types (e.g., macrophages, monocytes) and through multiple
processes, including phagocytosis and killing of diseased cells. The many possible design
parameters—constant region composition, FcγRs, cell populations, and antigen binding in
combination—have made precisely understanding, measuring, and manipulating effector
function an elusive goal. Our proposed work is centered around the hypothesis that two IgGs
can elicit distinct responses when present in combination from what would be suggested by the
response to either on its own. Using a computational model of antibody-FcγR interaction, we will
identify predicted cases of this emergent behavior. These combinations will be tested for their
binding and effector response in vitro and then in two models of antibody-targeted cell killing.
Finally, we will use the computational model of effector regulation to map how human and
mouse IgGs are related according to their effector response. In total, these efforts will provide
critical information for designing more effective antibodies with the goal of targeted cell killing
and provide a clearer view of how existing therapeutic antibodies function."
10746826,"ABSTRACT
 Little is known about the adverse psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on demographic groups that are
already facing significant health disparities. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI), who are
indigenous to Hawaii and other Pacific Islands, face significant health disparities, which often get overlooked
because of NHOPI being combined with low-risk Asian groups in national studies. Compared with Asians,
NHOPI are at markedly higher risk for mortality and morbidity due to cancer and cardiovascular disease. In
addition, tobacco and other substance use prevalence among NHOPI is much higher than among Asians. This
proposal seeks to examine ethnic differences in substance use behavior before and after the spread of
COVID-19 across Asians and NHOPI, with reference to Whites. In addition, we will test a new model that
attempts to explain the mechanisms of the potential increase in substance use post-COVID among emerging
adults (18-29 year olds). Informed by the theories of stress-coping, self-medication, and emerging adulthood
(EA), the central postulate of the model is that post-COVID increases in financial distress, EA stress, perceived
discrimination, loneliness/social isolation, COVID-related anxieties, and negative life events result in increased
generalized stress and poorer mental health among emerging adults, which in turn results in increased
substance use (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs). We hypothesize that NHOPI will show higher
exposure to post-COVID financial distress, EA stress, COVID-related anxieties, loneliness, and negative life
events, which will eventually lead to higher substance use among NHOPI. Our team has access to a cohort of
emerging adults (N=2335; 55% women; 45% Asian, 20% NHOPI, 24% White, 11% Other) from Hawaii,
originally recruited as part of research focused on tobacco control. Despite the tobacco focus, the study
collected extensive data on other substance use behavior, mental health symptomatology, and EA attributes,
which may be compared against post-COVID changes. We have collected 4 waves of pre-COVID data from
the cohort in 6-month intervals. The 4th wave of data collection was completed in January 2020, approximately
two months before the state of Hawaii halted all non-essential activities in response to the pandemic, including
tourism, a mainstay of Hawaii’s economy. The decreased tourism and closure of businesses have resulted in
Hawaii’s economy being one of the worst affected in the U.S. The current study plans to resume post-COVID
data collection from the cohort for additional 6 waves. The first of the 6 waves is about to be launched in
February-March 2021—approximately 1 year after the last pre-COVID survey—using institutional funds. The
current proposal seeks to continue data collection every 6 month for 5 more waves. Across the 4 waves of pre-
COVID data collection, we retained 89% of the baseline sample, almost all of whom have expressed interest
for continued participation in the study. In sum, this study is significant for seeking to advance knowledge about
the mechanisms of COVID-related health disparities and innovative for testing a new conceptual model."
10746829,"Project Summary
Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), also called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes, include the
receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA and glycine. They are involved in numerous neuropsychiatric,
neurologic, and inflammatory diseases. All Cys-loop receptor family members in metazoans contain three
structural domains: an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and an intracellular domain
(ICD). The ECD and TMD are architecturally conserved between receptor families. The ICD is poorly conserved
in both length and amino-acid composition and, for many subunits, contains large regions of predicted structural
disorder. Due to the challenge of working with the ICDs of pentameric receptors, they have been essentially
overlooked in terms of rigorous mechanistic characterization and direct exploration as pharmacological targets.
The ICD is involved in finetuning plasma membrane expression levels, targeting, and function, in part mediated
by protein-protein interactions (PPI) for example with chaperones. We envision that mechanistic knowledge of
chaperone-mediated modulation will uncover new PPI drug targets. Through our published studies of the ICD
we defined a linker that allowed for structure determination of the first in class structures of homo- and
heteropentameric GABAA receptors. We also established that the ICD alone assembles into pentamers,
establishing a novel role for the ICD in oligomeric assembly. Here, we propose a multi-layered approach
leveraging both soluble ICD chimeras and full-length receptors together with results obtained during the
previous funding period in careful consideration of recently-published pLGIC structures. We discovered that the
resistance to inhibitors of choline esterase (Ric-3) chaperone binds to a 24-amino acid L1-MX segment of 5-HT3A
subunits. With the new proposed specific aims (SA) we will: (SA1) determine the role of the L1-MX segment in
RIC-3 modulation of cationic pLGIC assembly, (SA2) identify novel protein-protein interactions mediated via
cationic ICDs, and (SA3) characterize the mechanism by which opening of cation-conducting pLGICs involves
translocation of the L1-MX segment through the MA-helix framed portals. In each aim, we will use biochemical
and electrophysiological methods, coupled with overexpressed and purified proteins or proteins in their cellular
environment. We anticipate that our studies will provide the basis for a novel class of targets for therapeutic
development, PPI modulators for pentameric channel intracellular domains."
10746762,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Forty percent of emerging adults (age 18-25) have overweight or obesity, which is unlikely to remit and
has significant health consequences. However, emerging adults are underrepresented in traditional weight loss
programs, drop-out at high rates, and have blunted weight loss outcomes. One potential way to improve
participation is to offer BWLIs in college health service centers to reduce barriers to participation.
Approximately 40% of emerging adults are enrolled in a postsecondary institution and college health centers
are used widely by students. Moreover, delivering an intervention with design features that are responsive to
emerging adult preferences and lifestyles may also improve intervention effectiveness and attractiveness. The
“small change” (SC) approach to weight loss addresses emerging adult barriers to engagement by focusing on
reducing calories through a few self-selected, specific changes to current obesogenic behaviors, requiring less
time and effort than traditional behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLI) and promoting autonomy and self-
efficacy. The SC approach has been used effectively for weight loss in other populations. The goal of this K23
is to develop and refine a novel and effective BWLI based on a SC approach that is designed for
emerging adults and for implementation in college health centers, an accessible care setting. To
achieve this research goal, I will develop a prototype BWLI for emerging adult college students (BWLI-College)
that will integrate 1) results from qualitative interviews with college stakeholder groups regarding perceived
barriers and facilitators of implementation in health centers and 2) previous findings regarding emerging adult
preferences for weight loss interventions (Aim 1A & 1B). Next, I will iteratively adapt the BWLI-College
prototype through 2-3 uncontrolled pilot trials with feedback from emerging adult students with
overweight/obesity (N=10/trial) to maximize feasibility, acceptability, and weight loss (Aim 2). Finally, I will test
BWLI-College against a one-session psychoeducational control group in a small randomized-controlled pilot
trial (N=60; Aim 3). This project will fill a critical need for an evidence-based weight management intervention
for emerging adults that can be delivered via college campuses. To complete this K23 research study, I
propose to receive training in 1) designing and testing obesity interventions, 2) the unique features of emerging
adult populations, 3) implementation principles and methods for the translation of obesity interventions to real-
world settings and 4) advanced statistical methods for longitudinal data from efficacy and effectiveness trials.
With this training and research plan, the comprehensive team of mentors I have assembled to facilitate my
progress, and the rigorous academic and training environment of Brown University and The Miriam Hospital, I
will be well-positioned to launch my career as an independent investigator dedicated to developing, testing,
and implementing novel obesity interventions to provide early treatment of obesity and prevent the associated
downstream health consequences in later adulthood."
10746763,"Summary
Despite tremendous progress in clinical genomics, nearly half of children with genetic disease never receive a
diagnosis. One reason is that patients are initially diagnosed based on symptoms and physical manifestations
but for many genetic conditions, those symptoms can vary dramatically even for patients with the same
mutation. When patients with the same mutation have different phenotypes, that also has implications for
treatment and prognosis, even when a molecular diagnosis is secured. The long-term goal of our research
program is to understand how genotype is translated to variation in phenotype using a variety of model
systems. In our previous funding cycle, we used an allelic series of Fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) mice and
showed that levels of Fgf8 gene expression and downstream signalling factors were non-linearly related to the
phenotype. Little change in phenotype occurs until Fgf8 drops below 50% compared to the wildtype, and then
below that level small changes in Fgf8 produce large changes in the mean phenotype and its variance. The
next step in our research advances this concept and helps generate a more mechanistic understanding of
variable penetrance and robustness. Specifically, we propose two conceptually related aims that address
distinct concepts in understanding the central question of how mutations perturb development to generate
varied phenotypic outcomes. In specific Aim 1, we test mechanisms by which gene interactions within a
pathway generate variable penetrance and expressivity. Our previous research has identified epistatic
interactions that may modulate FGF8, and in this Aim, we test these interactions directly. In Specific Aim 2, we
test how a mutation that affects a specific but ubiquitous process generates a multi-modal range of
phenotypes. This is important because genetic diseases often involve disruptions to mechanisms that operate
across diverse tissues and at many points in development and yet result in highly specific birth defects such as
holoprosencephaly or cleft lip and palate. As a model for this general phenomenon, we investigate the effects
of a null mutation in Nitric Oxide Synthase Interacting Protein (Nosip) in mice. NOSIP is an E3-monoubiquitin
ligase that modifies activity of target proteins with diverse developmental roles. In both aims, we employ a
highly innovative combination of imaging, morphometric, transcriptomic and experimental approaches to
integrate multiple levels of input (genetic, molecular, cellular) to understand how the effects of a mutation
cascade across levels from gene expression to cellular dynamics to influence organismal form."

The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts program launched in 2016,
bringing together more than 30 extant cohorts to investigate the roles of a broad range of early exposures on
five key child health outcomes. ECHO is now expanding to include new cohorts starting in pregnancy. We
propose to recruit the Environmental Factors in FEtal to Childhood Trajectories EFFECT cohort to participate in
the ECHO program. EFFECT will be a prospective birth cohort of 2,800 pregnant people, their partners, and their
children recruited in southern New York State over 7 years. The scientific premise of our cohort is that social
determinants of health (SDoH) impacting both parents before a child’s birth play a significant role in the
development of child obesity. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that in-utero chemical and maternal psychosocial exposures during
pregnancy interact to create differential childhood growth trajectories (growth latency and growth
spurts) from birth to age 5. We will leverage survey and biomarker data collected under the ECHO core
protocol to model the impact of concurrent in utero exposure to phthalates and maternal stress on childhood
growth trajectories.
Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that early life exposure to adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) are
associated with higher rates of child obesity and that this association varies by racial/ethnic
background. We will leverage specialized exposure data (psychosocial environment) and specialized outcome
data (obesity) to test the hypothesis that exposure to parental material hardships and psychosocial vulnerabilities
is associated with higher rates of child obesity, particularly for children from minority groups.
Aim 3: Recruit and retain a robust, diverse cohort of 2,800 families and implement the ECHO protocol
with high fidelity. We will partner with our extremely diverse patient population and leverage innovative
participant-centric technological support as well as committed community engagement to achieve this Aim.
Exploratory Aim 4: To measure the direct and interactive effects of preconception physiologic and
psychosocial exposures on child weight outcomes. We will measure the direct and interactive effects of pre-
conception adiposity and caregiver receipt of social support on early life measures of child obesity risk.
Our proposed cohort and study team are perfectly positioned to meet the current needs of the ECHO program:
1) to address solution-oriented scientific questions of high priority; 2) to increase the number of enrolled pregnant
participants; 3) to facilitate the enrollment of the non-gestational parent; 4) to facilitate collection of preconception
data; 5) to increase the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the ECHO cohort; and 6) to increase
diversity in race, ethnicity, career stage, and professional background of the research workforce."

The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response.
Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem,
specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer
medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical
practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of
cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood-
level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed
imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic
consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide
independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional
predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate
mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who
have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to
robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA-
Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor
duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an
integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and
evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the
model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify
consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My
extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to
accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary
team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park,
and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1)
computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data
integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3)
analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support
from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer
biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and
establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program."
10767361,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposed project focuses on understanding how mutations in beta cardiac myosin
with diverse and often opposing effects on myosin molecular function contribute to similar disease phenotypes
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy, hypercontractility, and tissue fibrosis.
Understanding disease mechanisms and the heterogeneity of phenotypes across multiple scales
(molecular, cellular, and clinical) will enable the development of better and more individualized therapies
for patients with HCM. The first aim of this proposal will clarify the mechanisms by which altered intracellular
forces affect intracellular signaling and CM hypertrophy. The second aim will use computational modeling to
examine how alterations to interrelated parameters of myosin function change force production temporally and
spatially. The third aim will define how altered extracellular mechanics affect CM and cardiac fibroblast
phenotypes. The proposal uses several innovative molecular, cellular, bioengineering, and computational
modeling tools to examine and contextualize the role of altered cellular mechanics in driving changes in cardiac
cell phenotypes. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human induced pluripotent stem cells provides a model system
to investigate the effects of specific mutations in a dynamic cellular context. Micropatterned engineered platforms
will be used to improve myofibril alignment and allow direct measurement of intracellular force production by
traction force microscopy. Molecular biology and transcriptomic techniques will be used to measure changes in
intracellular signaling and gene expression in response to mechanical perturbation. Another innovation is the
novel application of a vinculin tension sensor FRET probe to directly measure intracellular forces at sarcomere
Z disks and at cellular adhesions. Together these platforms will allow direct validation of temporal and spatial
cellular forces predicted using computational modeling (molecular myosin models and cell-specific finite element
models). Finally, investigating the effect of altered extracellular mechanics on CM function and cardiac fibroblast
activation in engineered environments will give insights into the effects of fibrotic remodeling. The research and
career development training plans will enable the transition of Dr. Vander Roest to an independent

10766242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recapitulation of normal lung function following a severe acute injury implies an inherent regenerative ability of
the lung. However, sources and relative regenerative capacities of lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells remain
unclear, especially in the human lung. Depending on the injury type and severity, several distinct progenitors
are activated and respond by proliferating and differentiating to aid in near complete recovery. Both airway and
alveolar stem/progenitor cells are activated and contribute to alveolar repair following severe injuries such as
influenza or bleomycin. To this end, recent studies from our lab have uncovered an airway epithelial progenitor
cell marked by elevated levels of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I protein, H2-K1. Despite
having a transcriptome highly similar to the mature club cells, the H2-K1high progenitors, unlike mature club
cells, selectively proliferate post injury and aid in improved oxygenation in injured mice after orthotopic
transplantation. However, mechanisms underlying early and selective activation of these progenitors remain
unknown. In addition, there are several more aspects of distal lung regeneration that are yet unclear. The chief
among them is whether the distal epithelial progenitor hierarchy that we observe in mouse lungs is maintained
in distal human lungs. The distal human lung airways have a higher proportion of basal cells and have more
heterogeneous secretory cell populations than the mouse airway epithelium. Furthermore, the human type 2
alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) have remarkable in vitro proliferative and regenerative capacity. Therefore,
there is an unmet need to understand the identity and regulation of distal human airway and alveolar
progenitors. To this end, our preliminary data show that a distal human secretory subpopulation that is
analogous to the mouse H2-K1high club-like progenitors can give rise to AEC2s in vitro. Conversely, we have
uncovered a novel and unexpected ability of mature human AEC2s to differentiate towards airway lineages in
vitro and in vivo, suggesting at least two sources of distal epithelial regeneration in the human. Therefore, it is
critical to clarify the identity and characteristics of both distal mouse and human epithelial progenitors primed
for alveolar repair. This proposal seeks to answer these questions through three aims: 1) Determine the
mechanisms underlying activation of H2-K1high progenitors in alveolar repair. 2) To identify distal secretory cells
as a source of alveolar cells post injury in the distal human lung. 3) Determine whether a subpopulation of
mature human AEC2s has reversible bi-directional potential to differentiate into alveolar basal cells. These
aims will utilize single cell mRNA and open chromatin sequencing, in vitro and in vivo manipulation of proposed
signaling pathways, and orthotopic transplantation of progenitor cells to clarify the epithelial stem/progenitor
cell hierarchy in distal mouse and human lungs. These studies will lay the foundation for interrogating several
novel signaling pathways to ultimately aid in our efforts to manipulate regenerative mechanisms to achieve
better disease outcomes."

10915656,"Project Summary
Breakthroughs in single-cell omics are providing unprecedented opportunities to investigate diverse biological
questions including tissue heterogeneity, cell activity dynamics, fate determination and cellular responses to
stress. Since first being described in 2009, single-cell technologies have developed rapidly, and currently most
laboratories are performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using equipment from 10X Genomics
based on droplet microfluidics. While powerful, this approach is expensive and relatively low throughput. An
additional drawback to single cell technologies is that they lose spatial information due to tissue dissociation,
so the physiological context cells in their niche is unknown. Understanding cellular gene expression in the
context of tissue organization and morphology is critical to understanding cellular function and this is
particularly true in chronic kidney disease (CKD) where injury, repair and fibrosis initiation occurs in the
tubulointerstitial niche. The SCORE Core is a Resource Development Core that will address these limitations
by developing and operationalizing cutting-edge technologies, and the computational pipelines required to
interpret resulting data, to support the Biomedical Resource Cores and the broad kidney research community
nationally. The aim of the SCORE Core is to develop new protocols and code that will illuminate the
pathobiology of CKD, beginning with split pool barcoding based single nuclei multi-omics and high resolution in
situ sequencing-based spatially resolved transcriptomics. We will develop protocols to employ simultaneous
high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for
measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, and the computational
pipelines to analyze the resulting data. In addition, the SCORE Core will develop the protocols for high
resolution in situ-sequencing based spatial transcriptomics using the Xenium platform. These protocols and
code will be highly enabling to users in our Center, and to the Consortium broadly. The SCORE Core will also
interact with the National O’Brien Consortium and Steering Committee to prioritize the development of future
cutting edge technologies as they become available."
10772644,"Climate change is increasing the risk of wildfires which frequently extend into the wildland-urban interface (WUI).
WUI fires burn a mixture of vegetation, structures and vehicles and there is a marked research gap regarding
population exposures and health effects. Woodsmoke contains a toxic mixture of known and suspect
carcinogens including but not limited to benzene, aldehydes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
However, wildland fire exposure monitoring has generally been limited to particulates for the general public and
PAHs for firefighters. Firefighters, a high exposure group, are requesting participatory research to measure WUI
fire exposures and effects and identify effective interventions. Silicone wrist bands can measure exposure
beyond PAHs, and urine metabolomics can identify both exposures and effects. While cancer or other diseases
caused by firefighting exposures can take many years to develop, metabolomic and epigenetic (microRNA and
DNA methylation) endpoints can serve as sub-clinical biomarkers of toxicity. Interventions of firefighter interest
include rapid provision of exposure data, improved personal protective equipment (PPE), more rapid dermal
decontamination, and administrative controls. We hypothesize that: a) use of silicone wristbands and targeted
urinary analyses (hydroxylated PAHs) will identify high-exposure settings and activities, and that untargeted
metabolomics will reveal novel environmental compounds of concern; b) the urine metabolome and microRNAs
will change acutely with exposures and cumulative exposures will be associated with long-term DNA methylation
changes in firefighters; and c) interventions chosen by firefighters will significantly reduce exposures. We will
test these hypotheses through evaluating firefighter exposures during WUI responses, measuring toxic effects,
and evaluating interventions to reduce exposures. Our fire service research champions have enrolled Los
Angeles County and Orange County firefighters who could respond to WUI fires in the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort
Study (FFCCS), a fire service-academic community-engaged research collaborative. For the proposed research
we will measure exposures of firefighters during WUI responses using silicone wristbands and pre- and post-
exposure urine for targeted (hydroxylated PAHs) and untargeted (metabolomics) analyses. Occupational
fireground characteristics (type of fire, PPE, time at fire, activities) will be recorded. Using urine and blood
collected at baseline and post-exposure, we will evaluate acute effects with changes in endogenous metabolites
(pre/post urine) and microRNA (pre/post blood). Longer-term changes in DNA methylation will be evaluated
comparing baseline blood samples to three years afterwards. Exposure reduction interventions selected by the
fire service will be evaluated comparing intervention and activity control groups with pre- and post-exposure
wristband and urinary PAH metabolite measurements. We anticipate that the proposed research will provide a
more complete measure of the WUI fire exposure and associated toxicity, and identify interventions that
significantly reduce chemical exposures to firefighters and inform overall public health responses."
10775767,"Project summary
While available tobacco smoking cessation aids, therapies, and public health efforts have reduced the overall
smoking rate, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders continue to have high rate of smoking. Recent
imaging research has identified key brain circuitries likely contributing to the high rate of smoking in these
patients, in an overlapping pathophysiological neural circuitry between schizophrenia and nicotine addiction.
Targeted correction of this overlapping circuitry may improve the patients' chances of success in quitting
smoking. The proposed study is to use a novel approach to design rTMS treatment that is based on a neural
circuitry mechanism on nicotine addiction in schizophrenia. The project will recruit patients with schizophrenia
spectrum disorders and randomize patients into active rTMS versus sham rTMS groups followed by fMRI
based target engagement outcome assessments. The proposal will use new stimulation site conceptualized to
be more closely linked to neural circuitry mechanisms of nicotine addiction in schizophrenia. The proposal will
include two phases as two separate projects. The first proposed project is a UG3 for two years. If the Go/Nogo
milestones are not met, the study will end. If all Go/Nogo milestones are met, it will proceed to a UH3 project
for another three years. The trial will test the proposed mechanism of action at brain circuitry level and
determine whether the new stimulation site will indeed significantly engage the proposed circuitry through
modulating its functional connectivity in the direction for helping patients to reduce and quit smoking."
10874678,"The ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is associated with accelerated aging and mortality as well increased vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although the causal links between APOE4, aging, and AD risk remain to be fully defined, candidate mechanisms include regulation of energy metabolism and systemic and neural inflammatory tone. Our recent findings demonstrate that nutritional approaches, including fasting mimicking diet (FMD), exhibit anti-aging and protective properties across several age-related conditions. Indeed, pathways identified to be beneficially regulated by FMD and related nutritional interventions overlap with pathways thought to underlie relationships among APOE4, aging, and AD. In this project, we investigate the central hypothesis that the dietary intervention FMD will protect against APOE4 phenotypes that drive age-related cognitive impairment and AD pathogenesis. We will investigate this hypothesis by studying systemic and neural effects of FMD and related dietary interventions across age in mice with human APOE genotypes both in the absence and presence of AD transgenes. Our studies will interrogate several potential mechanisms hypothesized to underlie gene X environment relationships between APOE and diet with emphases on brain energy metabolism and regulation of microglial activation profiles. We propose three aims. Aim 1: Do dietary interventions protects against APOE4-associated aging phenotypes? We test the hypothesis that nutritional interventions will improve systemic and neural outcomes in the contexts of aging and APOE4 genotype. Studies will test the ability of diet to prevent vs treat APOE4-associated phenotypes. We will test the efficacy of low methionine or high ketone diets assess the hypothesized abilities of a fasting-mimicking mitochondrial-derived peptide to mirror protective actions of FMB across APOE genotype. Aim 2: Do dietary interventions provide protection against Alzheimer pathology in an APOE-dependent manner? The second aim is conceptually parallel to Aim 1 but with a focus on diet and APOE genotype in the context of AD pathology. These studies will be conducted in male and female APOE3 vs APOE4 AD mice to determine potential sex differences and at two different ages to consider efficacies for both the prevention and treatment. Aim 3: Do dietary interventions improve glial phenotypes associated with again, APOE4, and AD? We investigate the hypothesis that the primary mechanism by which dietary interventions protect against APOE4 phenotypes is improvement in glial transcriptomic profiles and functions. We will interrogate the hypothesis that a key regulator of APOE-dependent differences is the TREM2-ApoE signaling pathway, which is linked to AD risk via actions on microglial phenotype and metabolic fitness. Completion of the proposed studies will yield preclinical data that define the interactions and underlying mechanisms among diet, APOE genotype, sex, age, and intervention timing, relationships that are essential to the effective clinical translation of dietary strategies to combat cognitive decline and AD."
10830487,"We established the pluripotent interleukin-1β (IL-1 β) cytokine as a significant player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease as it sets in motion a self-amplifying positive-feedback cycle in which neuronal stress induces synthesis of the neuron's acute phase protein β APP and release of its fragments sAPPa and Aβ. Both these proteins activate microglia and a progressive elevation of IL-1 β, which drives chronically enhanced formation of the hallmark aggregates of AD: A β plaques and, via IL-1 β -induced synthesis and activation of specific kinases, hyperphosphorylation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles in neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes. Interestingly, both events are dramatically enhanced in AD patients who inherit the Alzheimer gene from both parents (genotype ApoE4,4). Although these IL-1 β and ApoE genotype driven events favor negative outcomes, our progress in drug-development initiatives shows that they are amenable to treatment. Specifically, GFAP-binding chemical agents were shown to inhibit protein aggregation. Further, we discovered a novel function of the APOE£4 gene, which is a toxic gain-of- function exhibited by its protein product, ApoE4. We have demonstrated that ApoE4 competes with Transcriptional Factor EB (TFEB) for binding to the CLEAR DNA motifs, thus, hindering the transcription of three proteins crucial for lysosomal autophagy. We show this to be the case in brain tissues from AD 4,4, but not AD 3,3 patients. Now, importantly, we have identified a lead compound that binds to ApoE4 protein, obviating its interactions with CLEAR DNA and restoring the expression of three autophagy genes, that encode for production of p62, LC3B, and LAMP2 proteins. Now, we are prepared to further elucidate the role of IL-1 β in cellular pathophysiology, establishing its effects on kinases and kinase targets that manifest the modifications which drive predominant aggregate nucleation or propagation events. Our advanced molecular and histological approaches will be applied to confirm predictions of protein-protein interactions derived from proteomics approaches, particularly those involving GFAP. Moreover, these interactions can now be evaluated across brain regions and disease states to test their concordance with known AD parameters. Finally, we will elucidate the mechanisms of action of our identified novel small-molecule drugs targeted to ApoE4 in inhibiting all its pathognomonic interactions with other ApoE4 targeted DNA sequences. Successful completion of our proposed work promises a preventive strategy for foiling the known dramatic role that ApoE4 plays in Alzheimer neuropathogenesis. 
RELEVANCE: Successful completion of this proposed work will obviate the many pathognomonic aspects of inheritance of the Alzheimer gene (APOEE4) in the 1 in 4 individuals in the US, i.e., 80 million, who inherit one or both copies of this gene. Through the action of our specific drug candidates to inhibit the ApoE4 protein we will, therefore, restore the lysosomal autophagy necessary for efficient clearance of large aggregates, which, as we reported, is repressed in the brains of those who inherit one or both APOE4 genes."
10932247,"Social safety net programs are critical upstream factors that can offset economic stress and affect people’s ability
to access basic shelter, health care and food-related needs, which are particularly salient among parenting
women who use drugs. Parenting women, especially Black and Indigenous women, are over-represented among
people living in poverty, highlighting the need to understand how social safety net programs affect them. They
usually they are primary child caregivers, and many with opioid use disorder (OUD) in such roles do not seek
treatment or stay in treatment due to lack of resources while fulfilling caregiving roles. Research suggests that
individual safety net programs affect behavioral outcomes (e.g., alcohol use outcomes), including among women,
but the effects of these programs on opioid outcomes remains underexplored. In addition, the joint impact of
these programs on opioid-related outcomes has not been studied. Programs include Unemployment Insurance
(UI), Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programs (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),
the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and Medicaid. Nearly 75% of people living in poverty receive at least one
safety net program, and program eligibility varies widely by state. We propose a mixed-methods convergent
parallel design to comprehensively evaluate the separate and combined effects of UI, SNAP, TANF, EITC, and
Medicaid (including pathways and mediators), on opioid-related outcomes among low-income parenting women.
We will leverage the restricted National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2013-2022 to address
NIDA’s RFA-DA-23-051 to examine how state social safety net programs influence, and can ameliorate, multiple
opioid outcomes in low-income parenting women. We will test for differential policy effects by race and ethnicity
and potential multi-level mediation mechanisms. Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Examine the separate and
combined effects of state social safety net programs (UI, SNAP, TANF, EITC, Medicaid) on opioid outcomes
among low-income parenting women in restricted NSDUH data. In this Aim, we will update, expand and leverage
a recently validated multi-program state safety net calculator that fully accounts for interactions between eligibility
and generosity in social safety net programs. Aim 2. Investigate potential multi-level mediators of the relationship
between social safety net programs (e.g., state-level food insecurity and child care cost burden) and opioid-
related outcomes among low-income parenting women in restricted NSDUH data. Aim 3. Explore variations in
the administration of state social safety net programs and their effects on the daily lives of low-income parenting
women who report past-year nonmedical opioid use via qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and
parenting women. This mixed-methods study will extensively examine the separate and combined impact of
state social safety net program eligibility and administration on parenting women’s opioid-related outcomes.
Findings will have concrete real-world impact providing actionable and politically feasible recommendations for
changes in these programs to reduce opioid-related burden and promote women’s wellbeing."

 Opioid overdose deaths reached the highest level ever in 2021. Medications to treat opioid use disorder
(MOUD) can markedly reduce overdose risks when taken for long enough. More than 650,000 people
receive MOUD in Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) annually. Unfortunately, on average, less than half of
patients stay in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment for the recommended minimum 1 year of time. OTP
retention and outcome quality measures (i.e., “audit and feedback”) may improve treatment retention rates
and outcomes. Quality measures can also help monitor the effect of new OTP reimbursement and regulatory
policies. Eventually, OTP quality measures could be incorporated into the Federal government’s public
facing healthcare provider Compare website. However, research is needed to determine how to most
effectively create and disseminate OTP quality measures. The literature on audit and feedback points to
three features that influence the probability that measures will result in improved quality: (1) the
characteristics of the measures and benchmarks, (2) the knowledge that providers have about how to
improve the measures, and (3) the control that providers have over the factors that matter to improve the
measure. This study will test approaches for optimizing each of these factors.
 NIDA RFA-DA-23-046 is supporting multi-project OUD Quality Measurement and Management Research
Centers that pair researchers with partner organizations that have an OUD quality measurement and
management strategy that research could advance. RTI International, University of California Los Angeles,
and Beacon Health Connecticut are the research organizations leading this study. They are partnering with
two organizations that need to develop an effective OTP quality measurement and management system:
BayMark Health Services and the Los Angeles County Division of Substance Abuse Prevention and Control.
 The team is implementing three inter-related research projects with the following overall aims:
Overall Aim 1. Create and psychometrically test OTP measures of retention, overdose emergency
department visits, overdose hospitalizations, and mortality with benchmarks and toolkits describing how
OTPs can improve retention.
Overall Aim 2. Test the effect of the giving OTPs quality measures and information on how to improve
retention (a retention toolkit), with and without quality improvement training, by conducting a clustered
randomized trial that assigns OTPs to receive either: (1) retention and outcome measures with the toolkit; or
(2) retention and outcome meaures with the toolkit as well as quality improvement (QI) training (i.e., NIATx)
(Arm 2), or (3) treatment as usual (Control Arm).
Overall Aim 3. Test the effect of aligning OTP-level and LA county population-level OUD measures on
retention and outcomes in LA county relative to other counties in California."

The rate of cannabis legalization in the U.S. has increased rapidly in recent years. This has led to the
proliferation of non-combustible cannabis products, like edibles (cannabis-infused food products), that do not
involve inhaling toxic smoke, can be used with discretion, and have no smell. While popular in recreational
states, these products pose unique public health challenges. Although edibles are packaged as appealing food
products and are perceived to be less harmful than other cannabis products, there is an increased risk for the
overconsumption of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in cannabis. While smoking
cannabis results in an immediate high, intoxication from consuming edibles can be delayed up to two hours or
more and last up to 12 hours. This can lead to consuming more than the recommended serving, which can
result in unexpected, stronger, and longer-lasting highs as well as severe intoxication, cardiovascular effects,
and psychotic episodes. Since cannabis is regulated on a state-by-state basis, there is substantial variation in
the regulation of product packaging and warnings that inform consumers. Furthermore, little research has been
conducted on edibles, resulting in significant gaps in understanding how packaging and warnings impact
product appeal, knowledge, harm perceptions and willingness to try edibles. This R01 will address these gaps
by testing the impact of cannabis edibles product packaging and warnings using controlled, experimental
designs. First, we will content analyze text and visual packaging elements of a sample of products marketed
online. We will conduct two experiments to evaluate the impact of these elements on product appeal and harm
perceptions (Aim 1). Next, we will convene an expert panel that will evaluate existing edibles warnings and
develop an expanded warning to convey additional information about dosing and acute consequences. This
warning will be paired with an icon to increase attention. Warnings will be tested in an experiment to evaluate
their impact on communicating knowledge (Aim 2). Finally, in a combined experiment, we will test the impact
of the edible warning developed in Aim 2 in the context of package marketing (identified in Aim 1) on appeal,
knowledge, harm perceptions and willingness to try edibles in a nationally representative sample (Aim 3).
Given the rapid pace of legalization, coupled with the responsibility of informing consumers about safe
consumption and the risks of use, the scientific evidence generated from this study will be timely and is
urgently needed by state policymakers as they develop informed regulations, including best practices for
communicating knowledge to minimize harms. This application is directly responsive to NIDA’s research
priority areas outlined in NOT-DA-19-065 (Public Health Research on Cannabis), including the impact of
cannabis industry practices like marketing and warnings on cannabis use and outcomes."

Enteroviruses are the leading cause of viral meningitis in children and recent outbreaks of emerging non-polio
enteroviruses (NPEVs) have been associated with a polio-like paralysis named acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).
Discovery and characterization of cellular components that are critical for neuropathogenesis hold promise for
revealing new approaches to treat enterovirus disease. In recent years, multiple receptors have been identified
for EV-A71 and EV-D68, NPEVs, which are most commonly associated with AFM. Using unbiased genome-
scale screens, we have identified the phospholipase PLA2G16 as an entry factor acting immediately
downstream of receptor engagement following NPEV infection. How the multiple receptors and PLA2G16 work
together to enable infection in cell types relevant for neuropathogenesis is, however, largely unknown. Infection
of cell types present in the central nervous system is critical for developing severe neurological forms of
disease following infection with NPEVs. Although mouse models have been widely used to gain insights into
enterovirus infection processes, genetic and physiological differences between human and rodents limit their
translational potential. Moreover, species incompatibilities in host factor interactions of these human
enteroviruses necessitate overexpression of human receptors, mouse-adapted strains or neonatal infections.
In work that forms a foundation for this proposal, we have developed from pluripotent stem cells human spinal
cord organoids that recapitulate some of the cell diversity of the human spinal cord. Importantly, we have
pioneered an approach to functionally connect motor neurons in spinal cord organoids with human skeletal
muscle and cortical neurons in a preparation we named assembloids. These motor assembloids form
functional neuro-muscular junctions and can control muscle contraction. Here, we propose to systematically
study the role of known host factors in cell lines derived from neural tissue on EV-A71 and EV-D68, discover
novel host factors by performing unbiased genome-scale genetic screens in neural cell lines, and compare cell
lineage tropism and effect on neuronal function during enterovirus infections of cortico-motor assembloids.
Our results will reveal the role and relative contribution of a distinct set of critical receptors and broad-acting
host factors to infection by multiple enteroviruses, discover and provide details on the molecular mechanism of
novel host factors in neural cell types, and leverage a unique neural organoid system to uncover the specific
tropism and functional effect on human neural-muscular circuits during infections with the paralytic
enteroviruses EV-D68 and EV-A71."

 Although targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors have made a major impact on survival for
some patients with advanced cancer, the majority of patients do not respond to standard of care treatments.
Abundant evidence indicates autophagy is induced by chemotherapy and targeted therapy, and also limits the
efficacy of immunotherapy. Clinical trials testing autophagy inhibitor combinations show encouraging preliminary
results with increased response rates when compared to standard of care approaches. New autophagy inhibitors
are entering clinical trials. Preclinical studies and the available clinical data indicate that tumors can overcome
autophagy modulating therapies producing resistance. There is a critical unmet need to understand
mechanisms of resistance to autophagy-modulating therapy. Using melanoma as a model we have
discovered that extensive lipid raft induction is induced by autophagy modulating therapy. This is especially
pronounced with lysosomal autophagy inhibition, which induces the expression of key proteins (LDLR, SR-B1,
and UGCG) in the cholesterol and sphingolipid salvage pathways (CSSP). At least one of these enzymes,
UGCG, can be targeted with an FDA approved therapy eliglustat and preliminary results indicate combined
autophagy inhibition and UGCG inhibition produces synergistic antitumor activity in vivo. This proposal will test
the hypothesis that the increased expression of CSSP and subsequent lipid raft formation induced by
autophagy-modulating therapy promotes cell survival, and may be a key druggable vulnerability that can be
targeted to improve therapeutic outcomes in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage the longstanding
collaboration between Dr. Amaravadi (oncologist, autophagy expert) and Dr. Speicher (systems biology expert).
We also recruited Dr. Meenhard Herlyn, a melanoma expert who has developed a humanized mouse model and
bank of patient-derived xenografts, as well as Dr. Phyllis Ginotty, a biostatistician who has worked closely with
this team for years. In Aim 1 we will define the mechanism by which autophagy modulation regulates the
cholesterol and sphingolipid scavenging pathways (CSSP). We will determine the effects of chemical or genetic
manipulation inhibition of key CSSP genes in lipid-depleted and precisely reconstituted media on tumor cell
survival. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of UGCG as a driver of resistance across melanoma therapy
combinations in in vivo models. We will utilize a panel of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models generated from
BRAF mutant and NRAS mutant melanoma patients to determine if targeting UGCG results in decreased lipid
raft assembly, that overcomes resistance to clinically relevant therapies. Impact: These studies will determine
how two key resistance mechanisms to cancer therapies, autophagy and altered lipid metabolism, intersect. Our
results should uncover new therapeutic vulnerabilities in melanoma as well as other cancers and should identify
new therapeutic combinations incorporating CSSP inhibitors to be tested in future clinical trials, which could
significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients."
10932253,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is an escalating public health concern that has resulted in over 570,000 overdose
deaths between 1999 and 2020. Exposure to prescription opioids (such as oxycodone) is frequently an
initiating factor in OUD, with 9.9 million people reporting misusing prescription opioids annually (Centers for
Disease Control). While many individuals can use opioids as prescribed, a subset of individuals transition to
problematic drug use, which is defined as continued drug intake despite negative consequences and is a
hallmark feature of OUD. These individual differences have been modeled in rodents: most subjects will readily
self-administer opioids but will suppress drug intake when drug seeking is paired with punishment such as a
foot shock (punishment-sensitive). Conversely, ~20-30% of individuals will persist in drug seeking despite this
punishment (punishment-resistant). Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences
in punishment-resistant drug seeking is critical for understanding susceptibility to compulsive drug
use in OUD. The ventral pallidum (VP) has emerged as a central brain area for encoding the relative value
and motivation for rewards and translating this motivation into action. Recent work has also established that
VP activity is necessary for drug seeking and relapse, and critically modulates reward seeking under conflict.
The VP is an incredibly heterogeneous nucleus, with distinct neurochemically- and anatomically-defined
populations playing discrete and dissociable roles in behavior. However, our understanding of how the VP
subpopulations work in concert to orchestrate motivated behavior in the context of OUD is severely limited by
the inability to identify functionally-relevant VP populations. Here we will use state-of-the-art omics platform to
obtain high resolution cellular information of comprehensive cell types in the VP and their role in OUD. Our
long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular and neural circuit basis of punishment-resistant opioid self-
administration, and to leverage this understanding to develop targeted therapies to prevent or reverse the
transition to punishment-resistant opioid intake in patients with OUD. The outcomes of this proposal will lay the
foundation for this goal by creating a comprehensive cellular atlas of the VP and characterizing transcriptional
adaptations induced by self-administration of oxycodone (Aim 1), and by profiling ensembles of VP neurons
that are activated in the context of oxycodone self-administration (Aim 2). By profiling transcription factor
binding using cutting edge “calling card” technology, we will establish whether transcriptional profiles
distinguishing punishment sensitive- and resistant- individuals emerge with repeated self-administration, or
whether these differences are antecedent to opioid exposure and only revealed upon introduction of
punishment (Aim 3). This work will help inform future therapies for OUD and will identify molecules capable of
modulating functionally-relevant ensembles of VP neurons as a therapeutic strategy for OUD."

Using CRISPR/Cas9 engineered cells, rapamycin-dependent relocalization and long-term live imaging we have pinpointed the precise contribution that this protein makes to enhance the fidelity of chromosome segregation which will enable us to understand why this protein rescues CIN in tumorigenic cells and its future potential as a therapeutic target. MCAK/Kif2C is also strongly associated with centrosomes where it has the potential to suppress MT outgrowth and influence centrosome separation. We have identified two other poorly studied centrosome-associated kinesins, Kif25 and Kif9, that function in centrosome cohesion and centrosome satellite positioning respectively and that also impact centrosome separation and positioning. Altered centrosome positioning in cell culture has limited effects on cell viability. However, Both Kif9 and Kif25 are widely expressed in vertebrates. Because Kif25, in particular, is most highly expressed in brain it affords an opportunity to investigate the role of centrosome cohesion in vertebrate development and neural stem cell division using morpholinos directed against Kif25 introduced into early zebrafish embryos. We aim to use live and fixed-cell imaging tools and transgenic cell lines to investigate, with precision, the contribution that these kinesins make to preserving the fidelity of the genome and to long-term cell fate. Ultimately this knowledge base can be leveraged to develop new therapies that target kinesin enzymology or MT dynamics."

Patient-specific computational models of deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been used to understand the effects
of electrical stimulation on brain structures and pathways in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. These 3-dimensional (3-D), image-based, biophysical models provide a visual representation of neu-
ronal activation patterns around the DBS electrode and in connected distal regions. As a result, they are con-
ceptually attractive in both clinical practice (for targeting and postoperative programming) and in research (for
mechanistic insights and hypotheses development). However, despite their widespread use in research, and
recent introduction into clinical practice, the direct assessment of model accuracy is lacking. At present, it is
unknown if the spatial extent of stimulation effects predicted by the patient-specific computational DBS models
reflect genuine neuronal activations in the human brain. Consequently, recent clinical studies have shown poor
correlations between predictions from simple volume of tissue activation (VTA) DBS models and general PD
clinical outcomes. Driving force (DF) predictor DBS models incorporate more realistic axonal trajectories into the
local anatomy; however, it is unclear if the additional complexity of DF models improves the clinical accuracy of
the simulations. To test this, we have developed an experimental paradigm to quantify the degree of axonal
pathway activation by subthalamic DBS in PD patients. Intracranial cortical evoked potentials (cEP) and periph-
eral motor evoked potentials (mEP) can differentiate activation of several neighboring neural pathways by DBS.
Modulation of DBS settings (active contacts, amplitude, pulse width) alters the amplitude of cEP and mEP.
Therefore, by changing the DBS settings, pathway recruitment can be quantified, and the activation predictions
for different modeling methods can be compared. The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant proposal is to
determine the accuracy of patient-specific DBS models (VTA and DF) compared to in-vivo electrophysiologic
measurements in PD patients. We hypothesize that DF models are more biophysically accurate than VTA mod-
els. We will test this using two different electrophysiological measurements (cEP in Aim1; mEP in Aim2), and we
will identify which model components are the most critical to the model simulations. In Aim 3 we will compare
neural pathway activations predicted by the models to clinical DBS side effects (resulting from corticospi-
nal/bulbar tract activation that can be experimentally measured and predicted by the models). This will allow us
to determine the level of model accuracy that is necessary for clinical use in individual patients. The optimal
modeling approach systematically characterized in this proposal will provide the first validated standard for clin-
ical and research applications of DBS models."

 We aim to develop a new therapeutic strategy for one major form of JAK2V617F-induced
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV), with a focus on targeting PV-initiating cells
(cancer stem cells in PV). A curative therapy for PV is still lacking. The proposed studies are based on our
preliminary finding that the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) plays a key role in survival
regulation of PV-initiating cells. The Alox5 pathway is known for producing inflammatory (asthma-causing)
leukotrienes, and an FDA-approved human anti-asthma drug called Singulair (Montelukast) blocks
leukotriene receptor binding to reduce the inflammatory response. We have found that Singulair inhibits the
growth of JAK2-V617F-expressing cells in vitro and in mice. Thus, Singulair could be an effective new agent
for treating PV. We hypothesize that leukotrienes produced in the Alox5-pathway play an essential
role in survival regulation of MPN-initiating cells in PV, and Singulair antagonizes the action of
leukotrienes to act as a potential new therapeutic agent for PV. Testing this hypothesis is of clinical
significance and would benefit: 1) PV patients who have not progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML);
2) PV patients who are in clinical remission of AML with residual JAK2V617F-expressing cells and may
relapse with time; 3) PV patients who had bone marrow transplantation for treating AML progressed from
PV but still have residual JAK2V617F-expressing cells; and 4) the individuals who have detectable
JAK2V617F transcripts in myeloid cells but have not developed clinical symptoms of PV. Because the Alox5
pathway is known to produce leukotrienes, one plausible mechanistic explanation of action of Singulair is
that it eradicates PV by blocking receptor binding of leukotriens to PV-initiating cells. We also need to know
the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Singulair inhibits PV-initiating cells and PV development. In
fact, our preliminary studies show that JAK2V617F regulates the Alox5 pathway involving two Alox5
downstream genes, beta-catenin (as a stimulator) and Blk (as a suppressor), and it will be important to
investigate whether Singuliar regulates these two genes in PV-initiating cells. Finally, it is critical to
determine whether Singulair inhibits the growth of human PV-initiating cells. The specific aims are: 1) To
determine whether the survival of PV-initiating cells is dependent on leukotrienes and whether a blockade of
leukotrienes by Singulair reduces their effects on PV-initiating cells; 2) To determine the molecular
mechanisms by which Singulair inhibits PV-initiating cells and PV development; and 3) To determine
whether Singulair blocks the Alox5 pathway in human PV-initiating cells and reduces engraftment of human
PV-initiating cells in immunocompromised mice. Broadly, Singulair is a potential therapeutic agent for solid
tumors as Alox5 is associated with tumorigenesis in the colon, lung, pancreas, liver, esophagus, skin, etc."

The proposed Advancing Health Equity Through Innovative Community Capacity Building, Data Science &
Delivering Community-Centered Structural Interventions & Outcomes: Drexel's ComPASS Coordination Center
(C3) will provide oversight for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the Community Partnerships to
Advance Science for Society (ComPASS) Program, a first-of-its-kind national effort to advance community-led
health equity structural intervention research. Acting as its backbone, the C3 will administer and coordinate
multiple components of the ComPASS Program through its three interdependent cores (Administrative, Data,
and Capacity-Building) including creation and facilitation of a national Health Equity Research Assembly
(HERA), establishing Communities of Practice (CoPs) and related affinity groups to foster cross-intervention
and multi-sector collaboration and co-learning, planning and delivery of a virtual kick-off and in-person annual
meetings, developing content for the programmatic website, oversight of data collection, harmonization,
reporting, and sharing processes, and delivery of expert-lead trainings, one-on-one and group consultations,
and technical assistance for ComPASS grantees. Our diverse team of investigators and staff has a sustained
history of working with community-based organizations (CBOs) to conduct health equity research and develop
and evaluate structural interventions in partnership with communities experiencing health and social inequities,
who have been traditionally underserved, neglected, and/or mistreated by the academic and research
enterprise. Our collective work spans urban and rural settings, local, national and global contexts, and a variety
of racial, ethnic, Indigenous, immigrant, border, faith, disability, and sexual and gender minority communities.
The C3 will play a critical role in ensuring NIH’s investment maximizes its impact, providing community
grantees the tools, resources, and network they need to conduct high-quality, impactful structural interventions
in their communities, ensuring the successes and lessons learned from those interventions are promoted
widely and scaled up (as appropriate), and rebuilding community trust after decades of neglect and harm.
Moreover, our overarching goal is to help CBOs in the ComPASS Program (and beyond) to advance health
equity in their communities and achieve the sustainability needed to ensure long-term benefits."

Homeostatic regulation of excitability and synaptic efficacy works in conjunction with acutely induced Hebbian
plasticity to maintain neuron firing within limits and thus preserve network stability and information flow. There
is general agreement that homeostatic plasticity can affect intrinsic properties (action potential duration
controlling neurotransmission) or synaptic properties (unitary synaptic current amplitude, for example) and
involves diverse molecular mechanisms. Dysfunctional homeostasis has been invoked as a basis for brain
diseases such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Despite major effort, the molecular underpinnings of
various forms of homeostatic adaptation are still not clear. In this project, we will examine various aspects of
neuronal homeostasis with relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders. The first question is how neuronal
inactivity initiates local signaling near postsynaptic CaV1 channels and causes propagation of signals to the
nucleus to regulate alternative mRNA splicing (AS) and thus affect spike duration. We will extend our findings
on how one ASD-related gene (CACNA1C, L-type Ca2+ channel subunit) controls the expression of another
(KCNMA1, BK channel subunit). Our data suggest that signaling to the nucleus via bCaMKK (encoded by
CAMKK2) plays a critical role in AS through effects on localization of the splice factor Nova-2. In another
subproject, we will clarify how the same activity silencing affects synaptic properties, and the striking
switchover of postsynaptic glutamate receptors from Ca2+-impermeable to Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors.
We will decipher how various signaling pathways, generating both negative and positive feedback, work in
coordination to trigger a damped oscillatory response of synaptic properties following TTX silencing, a novel
observation from our group. We will take studies of homeostasis to recurrent circuits in cultured hippocampal
slices, using an all-optical approach to visualize reallocation of presynaptic weights following inactivity and their
postsynaptic consequences. Each of the Aims are of relevance to disease states such as ASD and
schizophrenia. Using a mouse model of Timothy Syndrome, a rare form of ASD, we will probe how
physiological phenomena are altered in a pathogenic setting, for example exploring why inactivity-driven BK
splicing is much more severe in Timothy Syndrome neurons and probing how this affects higher order
functions of relevance to ASD."

The Virginia Commonwealth University Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (VCU PREP) will
continue to prepare underrepresented scholars for highly competitive doctoral programs in the biomedical and
behavioral sciences, through specific aims and measurable objectives. In Aim 1, 5 qualified applicants (with an
undergraduate GPA greater than 3.0) will be recruited annually for each of 7 positions in VCU PREP.
Acceptable candidates will be academically competent, but may lack the research preparation and/or rigorous
academic coursework for admission to the nation’s most competitive PhD programs. VCU PREP candidates
will be recruited through the NIGMS website, the VCU PREP website and LinkedIn page, interactions with
faculty at partner Minority Serving Institutions, and using our email list of biology faculty members and
department chairs at primarily undergraduate institutions. Additionally, recruitment will be achieved by alerting
unsuccessful applicants to VCU PhD programs about PREP. These outreach activities will be complemented
by recruitment through the dissemination of program information at national meetings, such as the Annual
Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) and Society for Advancement of
Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). In Aim 2, VCU PREP Scholars will
participate in an intensive, positive mentored research experience. Each Scholar will be matched with a highly
qualified VCU faculty mentor, according to the Scholar’s research interests. VCU PREP Mentors are selected
based on their peer-reviewed external funding and publication records, and an excellent record of training and
mentoring success. Mentors will participate in a mentoring workshop, facilitated by VCU faculty trained through
the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research. Expected outcomes for Scholars
include presentations at a local and national research symposium, and preparation of a written research
proposal and a final research report, with a published manuscript as an ultimate goal. In Aim 3, Scholars will be
provided with an individualized program for academic enhancement. They will have one-on-one training in oral
communication and scientific writing, develop an individual development plan (IDP), and begin to explore
career possibilities. Scholars will participate in an introductory Ready, Set, Research workshop series, and in
workshops on Quantitative Skills, Graduate School Admission, Wellness, and Career/Professional
Development throughout the year. Students will participate in an interactive journal club to develop Analytical
and Critical Thinking Skills. Scholars will take courses to prepare them for graduate school, selected jointly by
the Scholar, Program Directors, and Research Mentor, and will have training in the responsible conduct of
research and data reproducibility. In Aim 4, a rigorous evaluation and tracking system will be implemented for
longitudinal follow-up of VCU PREP Scholars. We expect VCU PREP training to result in the transition of 75%
of scholars to highly competitive doctoral programs, with at least 80% persistence to degree."
10871841,"Project Summary: Legionellosis (Legionnaires’ disease) is a form of atypical pneumonia with a steep rising
incidence in the United States. The mortality rates of patients stagnate around 3-30% despite treatment.
Legionellosis is caused by facultative, intracellular bacteria of the Legionellaceae family, which reside in natural
and engineered aquatic habitats. Inhalation of contaminated aerosols can lead to infection, evasion of pathogen
eradication and continuous replication in Legionella containing vacuoles inside alveolar macrophages (AMs).
The ensuing inflammation promotes an infiltration of myeloid cells and lymphocytes into lungs. These immune
cells communicate with each other via cytokines. Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine formed by
non-covalent interactions of the subunits p28 and EBI3. IL-27 is induced by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)
activation in mononuclear phagocytes (AMs, monocytes, dendritic cells). IL-27 ligation with its unique receptor
chain, IL-27RA, on lymphocytes initiates STAT1/STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-27RA signaling initiates pleiotropic
programs, which can first intensify acute inflammation and later limit prolonged T cell activation. Our preliminary
data support the new concept that IL-27 is a critical player of the host response to Legionella infection. IL-27 is
elevated in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of human patients with Legionnaires’ disease and IL-27RA deficient
mice are more resistant to infection. Here, we propose to test the central hypothesis that IL-27 is produced by
Legionella infected mononuclear phagocytes and initiates dichotomous programs in lymphocytes, that include
the protective activation of NK cells and adverse T cell-mediated immunosuppression in lungs. Aim 1) To pinpoint
the cellular source(s) of IL-27 during Legionellosis within the subsets of lung mononuclear phagocytes. We aim
to assess the contribution of relevant PRR immunosensors for IL-27 induction by L. pneumophila. Samples from
Legionnaires’ disease patients will be studied for associations of IL-27 with the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and soluble
markers of immunopathology. Aim 2) To characterize the functional consequences of constitutive IL-27RA
ablation in infected IL-27RA-/- mice, and to study the host response programs by single-cell, multi-dimensional
proteotranscriptomics (CITE-Seq/Total-Seq). We will also evaluate neutralizing IL-27 antibodies and an
engineered decoy receptor to improve pneumonia severity in mice. Aim 3) Based on preliminary data, we aim to
study the altered inflammatory response of our novel conditional mice with NK cell-specific deletion of IL-27RA.
We will investigate whether NK cell maturation is associated with a switch of IL-27RA controlled transcriptional
programs through engaging non-STAT phosphoprotein signaling. Aim 4) To investigate the roles of IL-27RA in
conventional and unconventional T cells with a mechanistic focus on co-inhibitory/co-stimulatory receptors during
lung infection with L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae in mice. In summary, the proposed studies will test the
novel concept that IL-27 plays a critical role for the lung host response and outcome of Legionellosis and that IL-
27RA initiates selective programs in NK cells versus T cells."
10745931,"Although one in four children with autism remain minimally verbal past age five, we do not know all
the factors that limit spoken language in these minimally verbal children with autism. One powerful

and imprecise. But because producing intelligible speech is a prerequisite to acquiring spoken
language, there is an urgent need to understand how CAS may affect speech movements and
intelligibility in minimally verbal children with autism, and to develop interventions that incorporate
strategies to address CAS, when present. This project proposes three studies to investigate the

compare a group of 11 minimally verbal children with autism who meet criteria for CAS to a group of
11 who do not meet criteria for CAS. We hypothesize that facial movement tracking, a non-invasive
method to investigate speech motor function, will reveal that the +CAS group show lower movement
consistency and precision than the –CAS group. Next, we investigate the relationship of clinical signs
of CAS to speech movement parameters and to intelligibility. We hypothesize that more severe CAS
predicts lower movement consistency and precision, and lower intelligibility, in an additional group of
22 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. Finally, we use the previous investigations to inform
treatment for a group of 20 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. First we identify the speech
movements for each child that are both disordered and degrade intelligibility,. Then, we create a set
of mono- and bisyllabic stimuli involving these movements and train participants on a subset of them

The MYC family proteins are comprised of three paralogs termed c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc. The MYC proteins
play a fundamental role in cell proliferation and oncogenesis by regulating cellular processes such as gene
transcription, protein translation, cell cycle progression, and cell death. While N-myc and L-myc drive
oncogenesis in a small number of cancer types, the requirement of c-myc is widespread in a broad range of
human cancers. MYC protein levels are highly regulated by Aurora A: both c-myc and N-myc bind to Aurora
kinase A to “escape” proteasomal degradation. With the support of SBIR Phase I, we have successfully identified
novel small molecules that 1). directly target the MYC:Aurora A binding interface, 2). potently degrade both
endogenous N-myc and c-myc (henceforth “MYC degraders”), 3). are metabolically stable and orally
bioavailable, and 4). are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of tumors dependent on either N-myc or c-myc.
For the SBIR Phase II period, we plan to advance pre-clinical development of our MYC degraders with an
emphasis on treating c-myc-dependent cancers. We propose two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Test the efficacy of SSTA-315 across c-myc dependent cancers, while in parallel develop
derivative c-myc degraders with improved potency and efficacy.
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the safety profile of SSTA-315 (or an alternative lead MYC degrader) in IND-enabling
GLP toxicity studies.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will complete IND-enabling safety studies for our lead MYC
degrader, preparing for the IND registration with the FDA as the immediate next step. Given that MYC proteins
are deregulated in most human cancers, our MYC degraders have potential to impact the lives of millions of
cancer patients in U.S. and represent a significant market opportunity."

About 15% of Americans have hearing loss due to noise exposure. The classical explanation is trauma to the
cochlear hair cells. An additional mechanism of noise-induced hearing loss is cochlear synaptopathy. There
are no effective treatments used clinically to prevent hearing loss via either mechanism after traumatic noise
exposure. Recently, we identified that endolymphatic hydrops occurs after blast or noise trauma, and that
endolymphatic hydrops correlated with cochlear synaptopathy. Our central hypothesis is that endolymphatic
hydrops is a surrogate marker for swelling of auditory nerve dendrites that occurs in response to glutamate
excitotoxicity. We will test this hypothesis with three aims. First, we will determine whether swelling of auditory
nerve dendrites correlates with endolymphatic hydrops. We will measure the volume of scala media in vivo
using volumetric optical coherence tomography and vibrometry (VOCTV). We will simultaneously image
auditory nerve fiber terminals in vivo with two-photon microscopy and measure their diameter. Second, we will
determine whether acute hair cell dysfunction is necessary to produce the physiological consequences of
cochlear synaptopathy. We will measure basilar membrane vibratory tuning curves using VOCTV to assess
cochlear physiology. We will also measure the wave 1 auditory brainstem response (ABR) peak-to-peak
amplitude to assess auditory nerve physiology. Third, we will determine whether the inciting mechanism of
cochlear synaptopathy is glutamate, endolymphatic hydrops, or dendritic swelling. We will measure scala
media volume, cochlear gain, and synaptic counts after noise or hypotonic challenge in mice with impaired
transduction or impaired glutamate release at the IHC-auditory nerve synapse. Therefore, we are proposing to
definitively prove or disprove our hypothesis. Furthermore, we will understand the physiological consequences
and mechanisms of endolymphatic hydrops and synaptopathy."

Dr. Latha Palaniappan, MD, MS is a well-recognized clinical researcher with a long track record of funding,
expertise, and mentoring in patient-oriented research (POR) in cardiometabolic disease. As a newly-appointed
Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, her extensive clinical research and teaching experience will help
her mentor and train the next generation clinical and translational scientists in POR. Although Dr. Palaniappan
is currently the lead investigator of two NIH-funded clinical trials, she is seeking support to pursue novel
mechanistic research directions in cardiometabolic health, particularly in adults of normal weight with Type 2
diabetes, which affects over 3 million Americans and is associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. In
addition, this K24 proposal will leverage Dr. Palaniappan’s breadth of experience to provide an innovative and
dynamic setting to train mentees in POR. Her mentees can leverage the existing research platform available
through two large, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), namely STRONG-D (normal weight) and IMPACT
(overweight/obese), and an existing institutional biobank (Stanford GenePool). These biobanked samples will
provide the basis for her future research direction which will focus on mechanistic differences in cardiometabolic
health in three groups: normal-weight patients with diabetes (STRONG-D), overweight/obese (IMPACT)
individuals with diabetes, and normal weight normoglycemic individuals (Stanford GenePool). She will use
human induced pluripotent stem cells, metabolomics, and exosome profiling. The Specific Aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Characterize cardiometabolic health across the three groups (n=40 in each group). We hypothesize that
normal-weight people with diabetes (NWD) will be most cardiometabolically unhealthy followed by overweight/obese
PWDs, followed by normal-weight normoglycemia.
Aim 2: Investigate the functional differences in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), specifically in
cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells across the three groups (n=3 in each group). We hypothesize that individuals
with normal weight diabetes will exhibit more dysfunction in cardiomyocytes (less cardiac contractility) and
endothelial cells (less nitric oxide output).
Aim 3: Examine metabolite profiles across the three groups (n=40 in each group). We hypothesize that NWDs will
have more hepatic gluconeogenesis metabolites than overweight or obese individuals with diabetes.
Aim 4: Evaluate and compare exosome profiles across the three groups (n=40 in each group). We hypothesize that
NWDs will express more anti-angiogenesis miRNAs (miR-320) than overweight/obese individuals with diabetes after
controlling for weight.
This proposal will identify new pathways for intervention to predict, prevent and treat mortality and morbidity in
normal weight diabetes."

Although adipose inflammation is associated with obesity, its role in reprogramming adipocytes and other cells 
in adipose towards the development of obesity’s metabolic comorbidities including steatosis remain unclear. The 
complex intracellular (stromal, vascular, immune, and adipocyte) interactions within adipose tissue ultimately 
regulate its size by balancing adipocyte triacylglyceride (TAG) lipolysis and synthesis. The inflammatory signaling 
of and between these cell types may also influence adipocyte responses to cAMP modulators. To understand 
the convergence of these interactions, we previously identified cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a 
secretory molecule that increased adipose inflammation and lipolysis. Wild type mice on a high fat diet (HFD) 
demonstrated 7-fold higher LIF and IL-6 adipose mRNA than matched animals on normal diets. When 
recombinant LIF was administered to wild-type mice, it caused >50% loss of fat mass through JAK/STAT3-
dependent reprogramming of adipose tissue, increasing lipolysis and amplifying inflammation by altering the 
expression of other cyto/adipokines. JAK inhibitor treatment of rLIF-administered mice suppressed adipose loss 
through 1) inhibition of adipose inflammation as determined by decreased STAT3 phosphorylation, 2) decreased 
adipocyte lipolysis, and 3) inhibition of cyto/adipokine changes. To establish the importance of this signaling 
pathway to adipose inflammation, we selectively silenced LIF receptor (LIFR-α, gene LIFR) or STAT3 in 
adipocytes and assessed murine development in diet-induced obesity. Both models had decreased adipose 
inflammation resulting in a 50% increase in adipose mass and a ~75% reduction in total hepatic TAG levels 
compared to controls, limiting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis in these mice. 
Conversely, with adipocyte silencing of the JAK/STAT counter-regulator SOCS3 in mice on HFDs, we observed 
the opposite phenotype with a ~30% reduction in adipose mass compared to controls. We hypothesize that a 
LIFR-α/JAK/STAT3-dependent Cytokine-Adipose-Hepatic Axis facilitates adipose inflammation, leading to 
increased lipolysis and altered expression of other cyto/adipokines. The activation of this axis limits adipose 
expansion, resulting in TAG mobilization from adipose to the liver and ultimately contributing to 
NAFLD/steatohepatitis. This inflammatory-driven axis also affects adipose responses to systemic metabolic 
change, sensitizing adipocytes to lipolytic regulation by other cAMP modulators. Finally, we present preliminary 
data that the IL-6 family of cytokines signal through JAK/STAT3 inducing the expression of adenylyl cyclase 5 
(ADCY5) to reprogram adipocytes in regulating lipid mobilization. SA1 will evaluate the contribution of the LIFR-α/JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade in adipocytes to the Cytokine-Adipose-Hepatic Axis. SA2 will use a genetics-based approach to verify that cytokine-mediated reprogramming of adipocytes in promoting lipid mobilization 
requires ADCY5 function. SA3 will use single cell RNA-Seq techniques in our multiple mouse models to identify 
non-adipocyte contributors to inflammation-regulated obesity and NAFLD."

 Recent studies on the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (gustatory cortex, GC) have demonstrated its role
in integrating sensory, affective, and cognitive signals associated with the experience of food. Indeed, GC
neurons do not just encode the chemosensory features of gustatory stimuli but can also process hedonic value
(i.e. liking or disliking) and information on multisensory stimuli anticipating taste. Understanding how GC
performs the complex integration of chemosensory, affective, and anticipatory information is one of the major
efforts in the field.
 It is generally believed that GC achieves this level of integration by processing inputs from sensory and limbic
areas including the gustatory thalamus (VPMpc), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the mediodorsal thalamic
nuclei (MD). While the functions of VPMpc and BLA have been studied, very little is known regarding the
contribution of MD in taste. Using mice as a model system, the proposed research will rely on multiple
experimental approaches to test the general hypothesis that the MD conveys taste quality, reward-related, and
associative signals that contribute to processes in the GC that can impact taste-related behaviors. Specific Aim
1 will use electrophysiological recordings and behavioral training to characterize the taste and taste-predicting
cues response profile in the MD. Specific Aim 2 will combine neural recordings, behavioral training and
chemogenetic manipulation to unveil the effect of MD inputs on GC response profiles pertaining to taste quality
and taste-predicting anticipatory cues. Finally, the experiment in Specific Aim 3 will rely on a behavioral task and
chemogenetic manipulation to determine the role of the MD-GC connection in helping to establish incentive
values of neutral auditory cues in the acquisition of cue-taste associations.
 Altogether, the results obtained from these experiments will provide a comprehensive system-level
investigation on the role of MD in taste processing. If successful, this work will lead the way for the MD thalamus
as a potential crucial brain region involved in the integration and communication of behaviorally relevant
chemosensory information."

Craniofacial anomalies accompany a third of all birth defects, with isolated or nonsyndromic clefts of the lip and
palate (CL/P) alone occurring in 1/700 births worldwide. These isolated CL/P have a complex etiology including
both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors such as folate intake and smoking have been
shown to affect maternal environment, however, maternal genetic effects have been difficult to model and study.
The objective of this proposal is to study the first-ever protective maternal genetic effect on palatogenesis. To
our knowledge, a protective maternal genetic effect in a mouse model has not been described for any birth
defect. Our data show that Specc1lDCCD2/+ and Thm1aln/+ single heterozygotes resulted in ~20% (n=45) and 0%
(n=24) CP respectively. In contrast, Specc1lDCCD2/+;Thm1aln/+ double heterozygotes showed ~33% CP (n=30).
However, this occurrence of CP was observed only when the cross was performed with Specc1lDCCD2/+ mothers.
With Thm1aln/+ mothers, the same cross resulted in 0% CP in both single (n=20) and double heterozygotes
(n=25). Since, a Specc1lDCCD2/+ male crossed with wildtype female still resulted in ~20% CP in Specc1lDCCD2/+
heterozygotes (n=20), we ruled out a negative effect by Specc1lDCCD2/+ mothers or protective effect by Thm1aln/+
fathers. Thus, we hypothesized that the Thm1aln/+ female provides a protective maternal genetic effect for CP.
We will test our hypothesis by investigating the maternal environment in Aim1 and by determining the molecular
nature of the protective effect in Aim2. The maternal environment will be evaluated by embryo transfer
experiments and generation of uterine-specific Thm1 heterozygosity. The molecular nature of the protective
effect will be determined by assessing epigenetic, trancriptomic, and proteomic changes in maternal and
embryonic tissue. Both Thm1 and Specc1l deficiency affects ciliogenesis. Thus, our cellular and molecular
studies will focus on cytoskeletal and ciliary signaling changes underlying the protective effect. These studies
will generate novel insights and testable hypotheses regarding the role of maternal environment in the etiology
of the isolated CP complex disease."

Project Summary
All forms of the incurable plasma cell malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM), and Waldenstrom’s
macroglobulinemia (WM) emerge from a precursor condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undermined
significance (MGUS). Genetic analyses of MGUS cells have provided evidence that it is a genetically advanced
lesion virtually indistinguishable from MM. The risk of conversion of MGUS to MM is approximately 1% per year.
The mechanisms underlying the MGUS to MM or WM transformation are unclear. One possibility is that
precancerous cells alter the bone marrow microenvironment and/or immune system to facilitate the conversion
to overt malignancy. The Bioinformatics Core will provide in-depth genomic analysis of tissues from a spectrum
of plasma cell dyscrasias, including invaluable serial samples of purified tumor cells and whole bone-marrow
biopsies from patients with MGUS enrolled in observational clinical trials and followed over the past 20 years.
The core will also analyze experimental samples obtained from Research Projects 1 and 2 of the Cancer
Prevention-Interception Against MGUS Progression (CAP-MGUS Center) that aim to understand and treat
premalignant changes in the plasma cells, immune system, and microenvironment in order to eliminate and/or
delay the onset of malignant transformation. The Myeloma Center at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (UAMS), where the core will be housed, is a unique resource for laboratory and clinical investigation
of plasma cell dyscrasias with a long history of studying the biology of these diseases. The Bioinformatics Core
will use innovative bioinformatics techniques in the context of a large clinically and molecularly annotated archive
of primary plasma cell dyscrasias, to identify molecular correlates associated with the conversion of the benign
asymptomatic MGUS to MM or WM. These discoveries will form the basis for hypotheses that will be tested in
the CAP-MGUS Center projects, from which additional molecular data from experimental systems will be
analyzed in the Bioinformatics Core."
10744737,"The overarching theme for our research program over the past 20 years has been to better understand the
etiology and pathogenesis of lung injury, repair and remodeling, with a particular interest in how the immune
response shapes pathologic and homeostatic processes in the lung. Our laboratory has contributed seminal
studies related to 1) chemokine-mediated angiogenesis in cancer and lung fibrosis, 2) eicosanoid regulation of
lung fibrosis, 3) eicosanoid regulation of innate immunity in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), 4) chemokine regulation of lung fibrosis, 5) fibrocyte functions in lung fibrosis, 6)
matricellular protein regulation of lung fibrosis, 7) proteomic, microbiome and other biomarker studies in lung
fibrosis, 8) role of viral infections in “idiopathic” lung fibrosis, 9) role of viral infections in mediating pneumonitis
and fibrosis post-HSCT and 10) studies of secondary bacterial infection post-influenza. Our work has utilized
animal models to carry out mechanistic studies and has utilized patient-derived materials to confirm relevant
pathways, identify therapeutic targets and characterize novel biomarkers. Based on our previously published
observations and novel preliminary data, our laboratory is broadly focused in 4 main areas. The first is to study
innate immune signaling in regulation of secondary bacterial infections post-influenza. The second is to explore
interactions between the lung microbiome and innate signaling receptors in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.
The third is to explore the role of myeloid-specific heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor (HB-EGF)
signaling in regulation of lung fibrosis. The fourth is to further understand the viral etiology and pathogenesis
of lung pneumonitis and fibrosis as a complication of HSCT. This outstanding investigator award mechanism
will allow us to extend our studies in each of these areas and will allow for mechanistic understanding of the
role of immune signaling in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, pneumonitis and lung injury, especially following viral
infection. It will also allow our laboratory to complete proof of concept and validation studies needed in both
animals and humans to advance new therapies to the clinics for treatment of lung diseases."
10744739,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Distant metastasis is the cause of most cancer deaths. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancer. These
patients develop hundreds to thousands of metastases that appear suddenly and progress rapidly to fill the
liver and lungs. This stage of the disease is rapidly lethal, poorly understood, and grossly understudied.
Long-term Objectives: Characterize what drives and/or accelerates the metastatic stage of pancreatic cancer
in patients, and use this knowledge to design new and effective treatment strategies.
Research Design: This proposal is designed to deeply characterize how a metabolic enzyme named PGD
drives pancreatic cancer metastasis. We recently discovered that sugar (glucose) activates PGD, and once
PGD is activated it strongly stimulates metastatic tumor growth. Understanding how cancer cells use glucose
to activate PGD and how PGD then promotes tumor growth is important: it could lead to the first effective
treatment strategies against the most common and most lethal stage of disease progression.
Research Methods: Experiments will use a powerful set of metastatic pancreatic cancer cells and tissues that
were collected from individual patients who died of the disease. Unique three-dimensional experimental
platforms will allow us to investigate how these cancers learned to form metastatic tumors in the patients.
Experiments will specifically focus on how the metastatic cells process glucose into metabolites that activate
the PGD enzyme, and how the activated PGD enzyme is then able to enhance metastatic tumor growth.
Aim 1: Determine how glucose fuels high PGD catalytic activity in distant metastases.
Aim 1 will investigate how an unusual series of metabolic reactions convert glucose into metabolites that
activate PGD. Our recent work was the first to detect these reactions in humans. That is because they are only
operational in the metastatic cancer cells. Their function is to support PGD-driven metastasis.
Aim 2: Define the mechanism whereby PGD is constitutively activated in distant metastases.
Aim 2 will investigate how activated PGD is able to accelerate the rates of both glucose consumption and fatty
acid biosynthesis in the metastatic cancer cells. This not only strongly promotes metastatic tumor growth, but
also maintains PGD in a perpetually activated state that cannot be switched off in the presence of glucose.
Aim 3: Investigate how PGD reprograms the epigenome to activate the metastatic transcriptome.
Aim 3 will investigate how PGD is able to control the “epigenome”, which refers to small chemical modifications
within chromatin that regulate expression of the genes encoded in the DNA sequence (the “transcriptome”).
PGD reprograms the pancreatic cancer epigenome by accelerating glucose consumption. The metastatic cells
break the extra glucose down into the smaller epigenetic chemicals. The chemicals are then used to increase
expression of numerous genes that enhance metastatic tumor growth and bestow treatment resistance."

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a precancerous condition in which a person
has moderately elevated levels of an abnormal immunoglobulin (Ig) protein (called M protein) in the blood.
MGUS patients have a cancer risk ~6.5 times as high as the control population. MGUS may progress to
multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, or plasmacytoma. MM, WM, a large portion
of NHL, and AL amyloidosis are incurable diseases. CLL and plasmacytoma are rarely cured. The significance
of MGUS calls for a cancer prevention-interception U54 Specialized Center dedicated to this precancerous
condition  MGUS affects ~1% of the population, MGUS progresses to cancer or other associated blood
disorders persistently at a rate of ~1% per year, and ~90% cancer/disorder that progressed from MGUS are
incurable. All patients with MGUS are potential candidates for cancer prevention and interception. We
hypothesize that cancer-driving molecules and the bone marrow microenvironment promoting MGUS
progression are suitable targets for precision cancer prevention and interception. We propose to establish the
Cancer Prevention-Interception against MGUS Progression to Cancer (CAP-MGUS) Center as an agile and
effective network infrastructure dedicated to preventing MGUS progression. This Center will undertake
collaborative research focusing on immunologically and chemically targeted agents that prevent or intercept
the oncogenic process in patients with MGUS or smoldering diseases. We propose three aims to achieve the
CAP-MGUS Center’s overarching goal. In Aim 1, we will functionally validate several oncotargets in tumor
initiation and progression to invasive cancer and ascertain their suitability for targeted intervention strategies.
In Aim 2, we will discover innovative immuno- and chemo-prevention and interception agents through in vitro
and in vivo efficacy evaluation. In Aim 3, we will develop new projects by identifying novel targets for cancer-
preventive or interceptive interventions against MGUS progression. Collectively, we expect to obtain
chemoprevention and immunoprevention agents for further development or earlier phase clinical trials."

10912010,"SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex genetic disease associated with over 160 genes
coupled with numerous environmental factors. In most cases, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) most
strongly associated with COPD do not alter the protein coding sequence of genes but instead map to non-coding,
but often transcribed, regions of the genome, including UTRs and introns. Our collaborative work to date has
focused on how 5' and 3' UTR RNA structures are affected by SNPs and has revealed that many sequence
changes modulate RNA structures and alter translation of COPD-associated genes. Understanding of the
interrelationships between RNA structure and gene expression is in its infancy, has primarily focused on the
based-paired secondary structure of exons, and has been severely limited by our inability to fully explore RNA
structure in cells. We have developed three novel chemistry-based RNA structure probing strategies that allow
us to (i) investigate precursor mRNA structure in cells, (ii) identify regions in UTRs that likely adopt true higher-
order tertiary structure, and (iii) determine through-space contacts in RNAs and develop three-dimensional
models of their complex structures. These technologies open broad and long-term research areas into how
complex RNA structures modulate gene expression and how RNA structure is changed by SNPs associated with
disease. Another critical, allied development has been collection of extensive population-wide transcriptomic
(RNA-seq) data of COPD patient lung and blood tissues through consortia in which we participate. Based on
these transcriptomic data and their analysis, we have characterized important changes in both splicing and
polyadenylation of COPD associated genes; both processing events have important consequences on gene
expression. Our program also leverages substantial exploratory work that shows that RNA structure in coding
sequences of genes associated with COPD modulates their translation. For this proposal, we are now in a unique
position to leverage novel technologies and transcriptomic analyses to interrogate how RNA structure regulates
mRNA translation of COPD-associated genes. We expect to identify RNA structures that comprise robust targets
for RNA therapeutics designed to alter post-transcriptional gene regulation of protein expression. This project
will ultimately reveal new principles for how RNA structure regulates protein translation and alternative splicing
and will identify RNA regulatory structures in the human transcriptome associated with COPD."
10767516,"Anesthesiology research has grown well beyond a search for drug mechanisms of action. The
expertise of anesthesiologists now extends to all aspects of perioperative care, and this competing
renewal has been written with that in mind. Our fundamental mission is to provide talented and
dedicated individuals with adequate time to delve into cutting edge research under the guidance of
highly successful mentors. Dr. Schonberger has served as the Program Director for this T32 Training
Program since 2021, and he was joined in program leadership by his close colleague Dr. Helene
Benveniste, Professor of Anesthesiology at Yale. Dr. Benveniste continues to serve as co-Director on
the proposed renewal of this post-doctoral training program which will enter its 15th year.
 Our post-doctoral training program employs 5 tracks: Neurobiology, Vascular Biology,
Immunology/Inflammation, Biomedical Engineering, and Clinical Research. In this renewal, as in
previous iterations of the program, we request a total of three slots. Trainees will dedicate two-years of
between 80-100% of their work effort to research training, whether it be laboratory research, didactic
training, preparing manuscripts and grants, or attending meetings and conferences. The five tracks are
designed to provide trainees with a breadth of basic science and clinical research opportunities in areas
that are directly relevant to anesthetic practice.
 Preceptors have been strategically selected and have the following qualities: i) a history of
outstanding training and mentorship – for younger Preceptors, a history of excellent interactions with
junior house staff and an exciting and clinically relevant research program are deemed sufficient for
inclusion; ii) research focus in one or more of the five selected training tracks; iii) a clear desire to train
productive clinician scientists in Anesthesiology. Preceptors with expertise across multiple scientific
areas can provide a richer and more interdisciplinary training experience, which will be profoundly
beneficial to trainees after they emerge from the T32 program to begin independent careers.
 Since assuming the role of PI, Dr. Schonberger, in collaboration with Dr. Benveniste, has further
strengthened the training environment with increased frequency of scientific and social meetings for all
trainees, the creation of an external advisory board, increased collaboration with Yale’s internal Office
of Physician Scientist and Scientist Development, and a renewed focus on long-term improvements in a
diverse pipeline through recruitment of summer students through Yale’s Diversity, Inclusion,
Community Engagement, and Equity (DICE) program. To date, we are extremely pleased with the
progress of our current and former trainees, and we hope that the NIGMS will continue to support this
remarkably successful program."

The rise of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms globally has become a critical public health priority due to the
devastating consequences that it may have to the world health and economy. Antibiotic resistance (AMR)
threatens the progress of medicine in all areas, and as such, the issue has reached the highest level of
government, including the Office of the US President and the United Nations. AMR is a top public health
priority for both CDC and WHO and has been designated as the “silent” pandemic. Houston is the home to the
largest cluster of healthcare institutions in the world, the Texas Medical Center (TMC), with more than 9,200
hospital beds and 10 million patient visits per year. The Houston area’s strong history of outstanding infectious
diseases research and training includes a focus on AMR and antibiotic stewardship. The combined efforts of
the recently formed Houston Methodist Center of Excellence for Infectious Diseases and the existing Gulf
Coast Consortium (GCC) for Antimicrobial Resistance have resulted in an active, multidisciplinary and
comprehensive research and educational program amalgamating the endeavors of AMR researchers and
creating the resources, personnel, funding and fertile ground to develop an ambitious, innovative, unparalleled
AMR training program. We propose to establish the AMR Training Program in the Texas Medical Center
(AMR-TPT) that trains postdoctoral scholars, clinical residents/fellows and PharmD fellows from eight
institutions in the TMC (Houston Methodist Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Rice
University, University of Houston, and Institute of Biosciences and Technology of Texas A&M University) on
advanced aspects of AMR research. We will take advantage of the strong administrative expertise of the GCC
on successful T32 programs in other areas and the educational activities already in place, combined with the
expertise of world-class AMR researchers. AMR-TPT seeks to leverage and create resources to train the next
generation of scientists and clinician-scientists (MDs, PhDs and PharmDs) focused on tackling the pressing
AMR public health crisis. The highly collaborative environment provides the perfect opportunity for trainees to
acquire the skills, expertise and intellectual abilities to foster innovative research that has a strong translational
component and could be developed to directly influence patient care. Along with a highly interactive AMR
Foundations course and myriad career/professional development opportunities, the proposed training grant
includes expertise in and a focus on i) molecular basis of resistance, ii) bacterial genomics and bioinformatics,
iii) diagnostics, iv) pharmacological aspects of resistance, v) microbiome science, vi) clinical epidemiology and
biostatistics of AMR and vii) antibiotic stewardship. We believe we are poised to continue developing a unique,
innovative and comprehensive training program that truly provides trainees with exceptional tools and abilities
and creates a strong cohort of new world-class AMR leaders and researchers."
10767551,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Boxer Training Program in Hematology has a strong track record in preparing physicians and
postdoctoral scientists for independent, research-oriented careers in hematology. This is due to a combination
of our rigorous training environment and robust mentorship in hematology research. This program draws on the
research interests and expertise of 41 well-funded faculty members in the University of Michigan Medical School
Departments of Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Pathology, Surgery, Pharmacology, Cell and Developmental
Biology, Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Biological Chemistry, Anesthesiology, Physical Medicine,
Learning Health Sciences, as well as the Life Sciences Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Institute for
Social Research, and the Schools of Engineering, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Social Work. Active areas
include molecular, cellular, translational, and clinical research of: 1) the pathophysiology of the immune system;
2) normal and malignant hematopoiesis; 3) hemostasis, thrombosis, and vascular biology; 4) blood and marrow
transplantation; and 5) erythrocyte physiology and disease. A Selection and Monitoring Committee will recruit
MD, MD/PhD, and PhD trainees with strong academic credentials who desire a scholarly career encompassing
hematology research and teaching. MD candidates will have had 3 years of house officer training in Pediatrics
or Internal Medicine and a year of clinical training in Pediatric or Adult Hematology/Oncology. PhD candidates
will have a major interest in hematology-related research. Six trainees per year will commit a minimum of 2
years under supervision of a faculty mentor, developing expertise in posing feasible scientific questions,
acquiring skills to answer these questions, and critically evaluating data obtained. During their research training,
trainees are continuously mentored and evaluated semiannually by a Mentoring Committee. Trainees present
the results of their investigations, participate in discussions of data obtained by their colleagues, and attend
relevant research seminars and interact with faculty members in basic, translational, and clinical sciences. In
addition, the program will annually provide two, short-term training opportunities for medical students to
participate in mentored research for a 12-week period. This will offer the opportunity to develop interest in
hematology and enhance the pipeline for students. The Boxer Training Program provides a detailed strategy
for recruitment and training of diverse and underrepresented individuals, as well as delivering oversight through
individualized development plans and advisory committees. Overall, this program will fulfill a critical need to train
the next generation of academic hematologists who will bridge the gap between laboratory and clinical research."
10767600,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Respiratory diseases account for approximately a quarter of all pediatric clinical consultations and hospital
admissions in the U.S., and pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Additionally, there
is clear evidence that childhood lung diseases are a strong predictor for adult respiratory disease and
prevention/treatment of childhood respiratory diseases has the potential to significantly reduce disease burden
and costs in later life. Despite this, basic, translational, and clinical research involving studies of the
mechanisms of pediatric respiratory diseases and their therapies lags behind research in adult pulmonary
disease. This lag is partially attributable to a shortage of trained investigators in pediatric respiratory diseases.
Our T32 multidisciplinary training program in the Eudowood Division of Respiratory Sciences at Johns Hopkins
University has a strong track record of preparing young investigators; specifically, in its 19 year history, our T32
program has had exceptional outcomes: 97% retention during training and a 90% board pass rate on first
attempt. Of the 29 graduates who received T32 funding, 26 are currently active faculty members at academic
institutions or in government settings (FDA), and the remaining 3 work in commercial medical research-related
settings. The goals of our T32 program are to: (1) produce outstanding independent scientists who
investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of pediatric pulmonary disorders; (2) encourage and enable
post-doctoral fellows to pursue academic careers in research; (3) train physician-fellows to fill one of the
most important health-related needs of the nation: translational pediatric pulmonology research; and (4)
develop national leaders in pediatric pulmonology. This T32 program renewal provides 3 years of training in
pediatric lung-related research at the postdoctoral level for qualified candidates with an MD, MD/PhD, or DO
degree and 1-3 years of training for qualified candidates with PhD degrees. This proposal incorporates
strategies to recruit underrepresented minorities (At this time 24% of current and graduated fellows are URiM.).
Each trainee has an individual development plan program created in consultation with a Steering Committee, a
mentor, a mentorship team, and scholarship review/advisory committees. This training program is the result of
an extensive collaboration between research faculty members at Johns Hopkins. These research scientists
offer mentored training in 5 Research Discipline Groups: (1) cystic fibrosis, epithelial transport, mucus
rheology and transport; (2) lung injury and development; (3) clinical outcomes in pediatric pulmonary
diseases; (4) infectious diseases and global health; and (5) asthma, allergy and inflammation. The tutorial
relationship between mentor and trainee is central to the program's research training experience, and will be
supplemented by formal training in clinical investigation, preparation of grant applications and the responsible
conduct of research, presentation of original research at meetings and in peer-reviewed journals."

10769663,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION (CRTEC)
Since receiving one of the first NCI designations as a Basic Laboratory Cancer Research Center, the Salk Cancer
Center (SCC) has initiated, implemented, and enhanced cancer-focused education, training, and mentoring at
all levels. The CRTEC Core is led by Geoffrey WahlGEA, Professor and SCC Deputy Director for Education and
Training, and overseen by a committee of diverse stakeholders. CRTEC ensures that SCC training, education,
and outreach activities incorporate the latest scientific advances, technologies, and methods relevant to the two
SCC Research Programs, and that these efforts are well-aligned with the SCC strategic plan. Through four
programmatic goals and two operational goals, CRTEC ensures that SCC training, education, and outreach
programs are available to the entire cancer workforce career spectrum and effectively communicate SCC
research and opportunities to the external community. The four programmatic goals are to: 1) implement high
quality research and training programs, 2) develop professional skills for career success and advancement, 3)
support fellowship and grant applications, and 4) increase the number of scientists from diverse populations in
collaboration with the Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) Core. In support of these goals, the Core works with SCC
leadership, seminar committees, NCI T32 leadership, and Shared Resource Directors to deliver broad education
and training opportunities. These include inviting speakers to present seminars encompassing topics that span
both basic and clinical cancer science, and providing workshops on the most advanced microscopic,
transcriptomic, epigenetic, informatic, metabolic, and other techniques. To support career success and
advancement of SCC members, the Core develops and implements programs that enable SCC trainees and
faculty to stay abreast of the most exciting cancer science, to effectively relay the importance of their discoveries
to broad audiences, and to develop career skills through mentoring and coursework. The Core works with the
Grants Development Department to provide fellowship- and grant-writing training and support and to develop
multi-PI and complex grant proposals. Beyond the SCC, continued focus will be placed on outreach to K-12
schools through creative strategies, such as interactive hands-on experiences and real time social media
interactions with bench researchers. Finally, the Core collaborates with the PED Core and the Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion Department to develop programs to expand opportunities for women, minorities, and individuals
underrepresented in the biomedical workforce. Finally, the two operational goals are to: 1) ensure robust
processes to identify opportunities and implement new initiatives, and 2) evaluate existing programs to determine
those that should be modified, expanded, or discontinued."
10769664,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY (PED)
The Salk Cancer Center (SCC) values diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the research workforce, as we
believe it improves science by promoting unique perspectives, enabling healthy social engagements and
cooperation, and facilitating innovation. For the first time in our history, we have enshrined these values into the
top level of the SCC Strategic Plan. Importantly, the Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) has equal weight and
importance as the other four elements of the SCC Strategic Plan, namely Science, Infrastructure, Education &
Training, and Philanthropy. This is critical because SCC goals can only be achieved if the SCC membership,
leadership, and stakeholders represent the diversity of the nation. Over the past several years, the Salk Institute
and SCC have systematically evaluated our DEI efforts, beginning with a comprehensive climate survey
developed and administered by an outside organization. This was followed by a series of town hall meetings
seeking more detailed input from the Salk community. The SCC sought additional input from our External
Advisory Board and a broad section of SCC faculty and trainees. From these efforts, the SCC identified four key
opportunities to establish a sustained DEI-oriented culture. These are to: 1) increase diversity in SCC leadership
and committees, 2) recruit more diverse candidates across all stages of the scientific workforce, 3) secure public
and private funding to support DEI activities, 4) and improve awareness about SCC efforts related to DEI.
Importantly, we are making systematic and significant steps toward seizing these opportunities. The SCC is the
most significant scientific organization at Salk, bringing together diverse research interests and resources across
the Institute. Thus, the SCC will implement the PED with the understanding that leadership by example will, in
turn, contribute to a sustained cultural change across the Salk Institute as a whole. The PED aims to create a
diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment, foster a sustained, long-term commitment to DEI, and identify and
fund existing and new opportunities intended to increase DEI across the SCC. Efforts spearheaded by the SCC
will include: 1) advocating for the recruitment, promotion, and retention of faculty and trainees from diverse
backgrounds into leadership positions, 2) networking and training within and outside the Salk Institute to help
develop future leaders in DEI, 3) expanding trainee networks through courses, conferences, and organizations
focused on diversity, and 4) identifying and pursuing targeted funding opportunities through governmental and
private philanthropic opportunities. Finally, we will implement a plan to broaden awareness of Salk’s many DEI
efforts within the research community. Salk is one of the premier research institutes in the world, generating
future thought leaders across disciplines. Our efforts will provide new opportunities for the SCC, and by extension
the Institute, to play leadership roles in academic endeavors, to diversify and inspire the next generation of the
STEM workforce, and to ensure that underrepresented trainees thrive in STEM fields and ascend to leadership
positions."

process that is essential for survival, likely becomes dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as drug
addiction. While the full encoding of cue-reward associations require a distributed network of brain nuclei

salience to environmental cues such as those that become associated with repeated drug use. In this
application, we propose to state of the art deep brain two-photon imaging in awake and behaving mice to study
how the encoding properties within these circuits emerge and are altered during primary reward exposure as
well in associative learning. These experiments will provide important mechanistic information to explain how
reward circuits encode and control the development and expression of cue-reward associations relevant to
addiction."

 Environmental agents, endogenous cellular processes, and many cancer therapies induce accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal double-strand breaks
(DSBs). DSBs are hazardous and if repaired erroneously or left unrepaired lead to cancer and disease. DSB
repair pathways counter these breaks, yet little is currently known about the molecular details and structural
transactions underlying the strategies and efficiency of mutation-prone or mutation-free repair that promote
adverse human health outcomes. The long-term goal of our research program is to uncover fundamental
mechanisms that enable DSB repair within multiprotein repair complexes. As part of the Center for Molecular
Interactions in Cancer (CMIC), this COBRE Research Project will uncover strategies of DSB repair that are
relevant to breast, ovarian, and other cancer types. We will test the central hypothesis that DNA polymerases
(pols) λ and θ coordinate an alternative microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway, contributing to
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers.
To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will employ time-resolved X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) alongside biochemical and biophysical techniques to study the molecular features of pol λ and pol θ
activity during MMEJ. Aim 2 will study cellular mechanisms of pol λ-mediated DSB repair and the impact on
PARP inhibitor resistance. Aim 3 will develop small-molecule inhibitors to modulate DNA pols involved in DSB
repair. This cutting-edge approach also will yield fundamental discoveries into DNA repair mechanisms by
employing the state-of-the-art research environment and resources available in the COBRE-supported Structural
Biology and Biomolecular Interactions Cores. Completion of the research project will enable me to develop new
approaches for my research program. Innovative models of DSB repair will be pursued using advanced
structural, biophysical and molecular biology techniques. Our work is significant because it will provide new
insights into how pol-mediated reactions contribute to the repair of DNA damage known to impact cancer
progression and resistance to therapy. Studying DNA polymerases involved in DSB repair will provide insight
into how these reactions could be modulated to provide therapeutic approaches to impact cancer and disease."

 The metastatic processes of breast cancer are complex and remain a key area of intense research.
TGFβ/SMAD signaling has been identified as a critical pathway that can be targeted to impact breast cancer
tumorigenesis and metastasis. We made the exciting discovery that breast tumor kinase (BRK)—a non-receptor
tyrosine kinase (nRTK) that is overexpressed in most invasive ductal carcinomas, including the triple-negative
subtype, and linked to proliferation, metastasis, and cancer development—catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of
SMAD4, a transcription factor that is a major transducer of TGFβ signaling. Under normal cellular conditions,
SMAD4 interacts with SMAD2/3 to form the SMAD complex and promote the transcription of genes involved in
cellular homeostasis. However, we found that BRK-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD4 inhibits the formation
of the SMAD complex and instead induces an interaction between SMAD4 and the nucleosome remodeling and
deacetylase (NuRD) complex. NuRD is an epigenetic regulator that represses transcription and has been
implicated in triple-negative breast cancer tumorigenesis. Based on our preliminary findings and previously
published reports, we hypothesize that BRK-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD4 facilitates interactions with
the multi-subunit NuRD complex that result in targeted chromatin modification and dysregulation of canonical
TGFβ-stimulated transcription, which promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis. We will test our hypothesis in the
following Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Identify macromolecular protein interactions between BRK-phosphorylated
SMAD4 and the NuRD complex, (Aim 2) Determine how the BRK-phosphorylated SMAD4 with NuRD complex
dysregulates canonical TGFβ-stimulated transcription, and (Aim 3) Determine whether BRK-mediated
dysregulation of canonical TGFβ signaling promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. The proposed work
is significant because the oncogene BRK is highly expressed in >85% of human invasive ductal carcinomas,
including the triple-negative subtype. In alignment with the scientific theme of the Center for Molecular
Interactions in Cancer (CMIC), we will elucidate novel molecular features of BRK and SMAD4 that fuel pro-
malignant signaling in breast cancer. COBRE support will help establish my independent research program
through mentoring, career development, and access to Research Cores that are key to the success of the project."

 Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer types and claims the lives of more Arkansans than any other
cancer. Most lung cancers metastasize, which leads to poor prognosis. Studying mechanisms that drive
metastatic potential is key to unlocking new strategies for the treatment of this deadly form of cancer. The major
goal of this COBRE Research Project is to investigate the role of a non-canonical Rho GTPase, Rnd3, as a
mediator of lung cancer metastasis. Rnd3 has been proposed as an independent marker for lung cancer-related
survival. Our data show patients with lung adenocarcinoma expressing low levels of Rnd3 have significantly
higher survival probability rates compared to those with high levels of Rnd3. Yet, the impact of Rnd3 on the
molecular features of lung cancer remain obscure. We found that suppressing Rnd3 expression in lung
adenocarcinoma cells decreased cell migration and invasion, two hallmarks of metastasis. We then made the
exciting discovery that Rnd3 regulation of both cell migration and invasion occurs independently of ROCK1
signaling, one of the best-studied regulators of Rnd3 activity. Our findings support the idea that Rnd3 is regulated
by a novel pathway in lung cancer. Rnd3 is not regulated by the canonical Rho GTPase cycle. Rather, this non-
canonical GTPase is regulated at the transcriptional level and by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that
affect Rnd3 localization, stability, and protein–protein interactions. The molecular features of Rnd3 regulation
are understudied and not well defined. The central hypothesis for this COBRE project is that Rnd3 regulation in
lung cancer occurs through a ROCK1-independent mechanism that alters both the phosphorylation status and
localization of Rnd3, resulting in increased metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we
will pursue the following Specific Aims: (Aim 1) elucidate ROCK1-independent regulation of Rnd3 in lung cancer,
(Aim 2) delineate the roles of PTMs as determinants of Rnd3 function in lung cancer, and (Aim 3) investigate in
vivo the role of Rnd3 in mediating lung cancer metastasis. The proposed work is significant because lung cancer
is the major cause of cancer death in the US, and metastasis is a key driver of this outcome. The proposed
research aligns with the scientific theme of the Center for Molecular Interactions in Cancer (CMIC). The
COBRE support will help establish my independent research program by providing mentoring and access to
Research Cores that are critical to identifying the molecular basis of Rnd3-mediated control of metastatic
potential in lung cancer."

Through this new NIH-funded biomedical center at the University of Kansas (KU), we aspire to leverage big
data to improve women’s health. A strong and diverse inaugural group of Research Project Leaders, spanning
the laboratory sciences and social/behavioral sciences would lead the research. Their goals include:
improving the detection and treatment of ovarian cancer; developing a better understanding of estrogen’s link
to neurodegeneration; providing women, who are at higher risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, with tools they can use
to improve their lifestyle and reduce disease probability; additionally, two different projects seek to improve
women’s health by studying lifestyles, overall health, and the impact of health-improving innovations (i.e
telemedicine) in a geographic and sex-differentiated context so that limited public health funds can be
leveraged for maximal public good. The Center would enable progress on these projects and others at the
interface of data science and women’s health by providing a strong administrative structure organized around
the following Specific Aims: 1) Advance five RPLs’ research programs (through mentoring, grant-writing
support, and professional development) 2) Engage additional research faculty (through three new tenure-track
hires and a unique Research-Engaged Faculty Fellows Program); 3)Bolster Big Data research with core lab
support (through two initiatives, the development of a new core lab focused on Biomedical Datasets and
Services, and a voucher program, supported by university matching funds, that leverages KU’s 17 existing
centralized research core lab facilities.) The well-planned theme, excellent inaugural project leaders, close
coordination with university administration, and experienced Center Director and Associate-Director all lend
strong credibility that the goals would be achieved. The successful completion of these aims will markedly
increase the biomedical research capabilities on our campus, establishing at our institution a unique center that
leverages data science for advancing women’s health research."

ABSTRACT
The proposed program will provide innovative educational resources to help redress significant
nationwide deficits in science, mathematics, and literacy learning, especially for grades 6-8
students with disabilities (SWD). These new resources will improve and extend the: 1)
multimodal STEM text sets: 2) virtual teacher professional development – communities of
practice (vPD-CoP); and 3) scenario-based assessments (SBAs) of scientific argumentation
developed by the current NIGMS/SEPA Linking Science and Literacy for All Learners program,
and that have garnered state and national recognition. Multimodal STEM text sets (1) are
coherent collections of content and instructional resources pertaining to an anchor phenomenon
and line of inquiry that support learners’: a) Engagement with a grade-band level complex
anchor text; b) Development of the science and disciplinary literacy skills called for by the
shared Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core State Standards
(CCSS) or state equivalents. The vPD-CoPs (2) help teachers, learn about, develop, and
implement multimodal STEM text sets for their diverse grade 6-8 learners. The SBAs (3) provide
quantitative data about the instructional interventions, and help teachers understand scientific
argumentation practices and include them in their instruction. Preliminary evidence supports the
hypothesis that appropriate instructional support with multimodal STEM text sets, helps diverse
students (particularly SWDs) engage with grade-band level complex anchor texts and improve
scientific argumentation skills that can be measured with SBAs. The proposed program will add
mathematics and research-generated data to all the program resources, and the effects will be
rigorously tested over five years with quantitative data from thousands of diverse students
nationwide, and with qualitative data of instructional implementation by teachers of science,
mathematics, English language arts and special education in diverse school settings,
nationwide. These resources and the research data will be disseminated widely by the program
website, in high profile journals, in books and reports, and at regional and national meetings, to
have a lasting impact upon inclusive and effective education for diverse students’ participation in
the biomedical workforce and contributions to society. The program faculty and consultants are
experienced educator/researchers in science, literacy, mathematics and special education with
a strong independent evaluation team and institutional support."
10746783,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists are an important class of antidiabetic drugs with an
attractive clinical profile – including improved glycemic control, weight loss, and decreased risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events. While there is substantial variation in the magnitude of individual patients’
responses to these drugs, there are no validated approaches to identify patients most likely to have the largest
responses and derive the most clinical benefit. This application proposes a genome-wide association study in
the Old Order Amish population to identify genetic variants that predict individuals’ pharmacodynamic
responses to GLP1R agonists. Based on preliminary data from the Principal Investigators’ research, the
proposed project will measure pharmacodynamic endpoints related to beneficial effects of GLP1R agonists.
Overweight/obese otherwise healthy volunteers will be recruited from the Old Order Amish population in
Lancaster County, PA. In order to assess pharmacodynamic responses, research participants will undergo two
frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGT). The first FSIGT will be conducted at baseline
prior to administration of drug. The second FSIGT will be conducted after six weeks of treatment with
semaglutide (0.25 mg/wk X 4 wks; 0.5 mg/sk X 2 wks). The proposal proposes two specific aims:
• Specific Aim #1. To identify genetic variants associated with effects of a GLP1R agonist to enhance glucose-
 stimulated first phase insulin secretion in the two FSIGTs (before and after administration of drug).
• Specific Aim #2. To identify genetic variants associated with the effect of a GLP1R agonist to accelerate the
 rate of glucose disappearance as assessed in the two FSIGTs (before and after administration of drug).
Genotyping will be conducted using a high-density array with comprehensive coverage of DNA sequence
variants. The project will leverage a global imputation panel generated from whole genome sequence data on
~ 100K subjects including 1,025 Amish individuals obtained through the NHLBI-sponsored Trans-Omics for
Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. Previous genetic studies conducted in the Old Order Amish population
have been highly predictive of observations in the general population and relevant patient populations. Based
on these precedents, we anticipate that genetic variants in this study are very likely to be predictive of clinical
responses of GLP1R agonist-treated type 2 diabetic patients. The proposed study is a step toward the long-
term objective of identifying genetic biomarkers to predict an individual patient’s response to GLP1R agonists.
Availability of predictive biomarkers would enable physicians to prescribe optimal therapies for each individual
patient based on predictors of beneficial response. This type of Precision Medicine approach, based on
predictive pharmacogenomic biomarkers, would be a transformational advance in the way diabetes drugs are
prescribed."
10747302,"Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) is a paradoxical approach for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) whereby testosterone levels are rapidly cycled between supraphysiologic and castrate concentrations.
Understanding how BAT works at the molecular and cellular levels might help in rationally combining BAT with
other agents to achieve increased efficacy and tumor responses. Previous observations suggest that
supraphysiological testosterone (SupraT) induce DNA double strand breaks (DSB). It has been speculated that if
left unrepaired, DSBs may lead to cellular crisis and apoptosis. In this proposal, we provide novel evidence that
unrepaired DSBs induced by SupraTs are routed to the autophagosomes where they activate cytoplasmic nucleic
acid sensors that trigger the downstream interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and innate immune pathways. Based
on our preliminary data, we propose a novel idea that: i) Unrepaired DSBs induced by SupraTs are routed for
specialized autophagic degradation termed nucleophagy; ii) SupraTs induced autophagosomal DNA can activate
cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways~ specifically the nucleic acid sensing pathway (cGAS-STING and RIG-I
pathway); iii) Activation of nucleic acid sensing pathway by SupraTs would be more pronounced in prostate tumors
that have DNA repair defect; and iv) BAT might activate innate and adaptive immune cells specially, in a subset of
patients having DNA repair defect. In this proposal, we will determine the role of nucleic acid sensors in mediating
immune signaling by SupraTs in PCa. Utilizing tumor biopsies from PCa patients receiving BAT, we will evaluate
whether nucleic acid sensor mediated innate immune signaling serves as a molecular determinant of treatment
response. To test our hypothesis, we will utilize several innovative tools and resources including CRISPR-Cas9
generated knockout cellular models, GeoMx Digital Spatial profiling of immune landscape in the tumor
microenvironment, unique patient derived prostate cancer xenografts models, a humanized mouse models that has
functional innate and adaptive immune cells, and serum and tumor biopsies from patients receiving BAT. We think
these unique resources position us well to undertake the proposed work with immediate clinical impact. We have
assembled a team of experts in basic and clinical prostate cancer biology and immunotherapy who will provide their
unique expertise to successfully accomplish our goals. Successful completion of the proposed work will generate:
a) mechanistic insights into modulation of immune response by SupraTs, b) valuable clinical insights into activation
of immune cells by BAT, c) novel tumor- and serum-based markers that can be utilized for the development of
biomarkers predictive of therapy response, and d) provide a rationale for strategically utilizing BAT to activate
immune response and combine it with immunotherapeutics that empower the adaptive immune system such as
immune checkpoint blockade and T-cell therapeutics to achieve synergy."

10771144,"Hypoxic resistance to radiation therapy has been known for over a century. However, effective image-guided
approaches to target resistant hypoxic tumor regions have been lacking. A recent publication of the results
from a Phase II clinical trial in France indicates that positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluoro-
misonidazole (FMISO) to define region-of-interest (ROI) for hypoxic tumor targeting was shown to fail in
improving tumor control and treatment outcome. The long-term objective of this proposed research project is to
develop novel integrated multi-modality imaging approaches to effectively guide radiation delivery for
significantly improving therapy precision and treatment outcome of resistant hypoxic tumor regions. Our recent
work in animal studies using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) images (EPRI) of absolute pO2 has
demonstrated that targeting the hypoxic regions of tumors with extra radiation dose (i.e., boost in dose
painting) increases tumor cure. This involved novel 3D rapidly printed radiation blocks and conformal animal
radiation. We showed improved tumor cure by comparing uniform radiation delivery of the dose to all tumors
sufficient to cure 15% of tumors (determined in separate experiments) and then randomized to receive extra
doses of radiation to either (1) all hypoxic tumor volumes determined by the EPR pO2 image (pO2 < 10 torr) or
(2) equal volume dose boosts to better-oxygenated tumor. The results showed that treatment (1) offered a
significantly better outcome, including sparing critical organs from damage caused by high dose radiation. This
demonstrates that EPR pO2 images have the potential to guide improved radiation therapy of hypoxic tumors.
Unfortunately, EPR images are currently not available for routine uses in clinical practice. We hypothesize that
using EPRI pO2 images as the gold standard, novel quantitative hypoxia parametric imaging methodologies
based on PET-FMISO data can be established, incorporating consideration and correlation of data from other
clinically available hypoxia-related imaging methods such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) and Iodopamidol diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (Idia-CEST or
ICEST) pH MRI. These clinically available MRI studies will sharpen the hypoxic tumor region definition for
more effective radiation boost delivery in improving treatment outcomes. We will initially pursue the following
specific aims in animal studies: (1) Implementing and validating novel quantitative multi-modality PET/MR/EPR
imaging methodologies; (2) Developing statistical methodologies for deriving modified parametric images by
integrating multi-modality PET and MRI data in order to emulate EPR images; (3) Employing the established
methods developed in Aim (2) for validation in delivering improved precision radiotherapy of hypoxic tumors to
achieve better treatment outcomes using multi-modality parametric imaging."
10771145,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Myocarditis, pathologic inflammation of the heart, is a serious cause of sudden cardiac death affecting
patients of all age groups. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies to cytotoxic T-cell
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) or programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-1 ligand (PD-1L) used as novel cancer
therapeutics to release intrinsic brakes on T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Although ICIs are now relied
upon to treat many advanced cancers, fulminant myocarditis has been reported as a life-threatening side effect
of these drugs, leading to severe arrhythmias, heart failure and death. Under histopathology, an acute
lymphocytic infiltrate is found in the heart, and multiple lines of evidence point to a T-cell and antigen-mediated
phenomenon. In this proposal, Dr. Zhu’s preliminary data in ICI myocarditis patients and a germline PD-1
knockout mouse model of ICI myocarditis (MRL-Pdcd1-/-) demonstrates a population of clonally-expanded
cytotoxic effector CD8+ T-cells thought to play a critical role in this disease, with upregulation of the chemokine
RANTES (CCL5) and its receptor (CCR5). Dr. Zhu hypothesizes that ICI myocarditis is caused by the clonal
expansion of cytotoxic effector CD8+ T-cells in the heart, whose pathogenesis is potentiated by signaling from
CCL5, and she will aim to test this hypothesis using single-cell RNA-seq/single-cell TCR sequencing and T-cell
adoptive transfer experiments (Aim 1), as well as and ex-vivo/in-vivo knockdown of CCR5 in MRL-Pdcd1-/- mice
(Aim 2).
 Although T-cell clonal analysis of patient heart tissues suggest the existence of a cardiac-specific antigen
in ICI-induced myocarditis, the identity of such antigen(s) remains elusive. Understanding the culprit antigens in
this disease may lead to novel insights in T-cell mediated myocardial damage. In the second part of her proposal,
Dr. Zhu hypothesizes that ICI-induced myocarditis is an autoimmune disorder caused by cardiac-specific auto-
antigens that trigger the activation/clonal expansion of T-cells, leading to myocardial inflammation. In Aim 3,
she will utilize the novel computational algorithm called GLIPH (Grouping Lymphocyte Interactions by Paratope
Hotspots) to identify candidate pathogenic antigens in ICI myocarditis. Dr. Zhu’s work will bridge a major
knowledge gap in the field of cardiac inflammation and identify culprit T-cell subsets and disease-causing
antigens in ICI myocarditis and T-cell induced myocardial injury. The completion of this proposal will provide a
platform for Dr. Zhu’s successful transition to an independent physician scientist investigating immune
mechanisms in cardiac inflammation/toxicity."
10771207,"Despite the well-recognized cognitive deficits in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the mechanisms underlying the
neuropathophysiology remain unclear. The clear lack of translation from findings in mouse models to the clinic
manifests the inherent species differences in the development, architecture and function of rodent and human
brains, and underscores the urgent need to develop and use human model systems to study aspects of human
brain disorders and to bridge the translational gap to the clinic. Our long-term goal is to develop and use human
cellular models to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits associated
with NF1. Recent advances in the field of epigenetic reprogramming, stem cell biology and genetic engineering
has rendered us a unique opportunity to model neurodevelopmental disorders such as NF1 in a manner that is
highly complementary to murine transgenic approaches by that maintains fidelity with complex human cellular
contexts. The objective of the current study is to harness such tools to characterize the abnormalities in
neurodevelopment and neuronal network activity caused by NF1-associated mutations and determine the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Neurofibromin 1 (NF1 encoding protein) - regulated biological
processes in different cellular contexts. Based on the preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory, we
hypothesize that disease associated mutations in NF1 affect proliferation and cell fate commitment of human
neural progenitor cells that control neuronal output; and impair neuronal network activity through a potentially
human-specific mechanism. The hypothesis will be tested using two complementary cellular models: 1) human
brain organoids will be used to investigate the role of Neurofibromin 1 in human neural progenitor cell types,
especially the outer radial glial cells that are largely absent in the rodent developing cortices. A multidisciplinary
approach will be used to characterize cell type-specific defects in neuroepithelial cell expansion, migration,
differentiation, and the mitotic properties of cells; 2) induced neuronal (iN) system, which was developed by the
applicant and others, will be used to dissect the cellular mechanisms underlying the irregular neuronal network
activity observed in cultures consisting of NF1 mutant neurons. The current study would be the first systematic
investigation of Neurofibromin 1 completion of the proposed project function in the neural system using a human model system. Successful will provide novel knowledge on the role of Neurofibromin 1 in different neural
cell types that are relevant to the pathophysiology of NF1. Given the high prevalence of Autism in NF1, the
proposed research also has the potential to shed light on the key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
idiopathic Autism."
10771248,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sleep is an active process requiring the participation of delimited nodes of sleep-promoting cell populations.
Work over the last twenty years has demonstrated that galanin expressing neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic
(VLPOGal) neurons are necessary for normal sleep and cortical slow wave activity. There remain however
several fundamental gaps in our understanding of the cellular and synaptic basis by which VLPOGal neurons
are regulated. One highly influential circuit model for behavioral sleep-wake control is the `flip-flop' model of
sleep-state switching, which proposes that sleep-wake transitions are regulated by a reciprocal inhibition
between sleep-promoting VLPOGal neurons and monoaminergic and cholinergic wake-promoting nodes of the
forebrain and brainstem. The findings that reciprocal anatomical connections exist between the VLPO and
monoamine and cholinergic neurons and that these cell groups exhibit, respectively, sleep- and wake-active
firing profiles have provided general support for the model. However, the VLPO receives afferent inputs from
many other sources including non-cholinergic and non-monoaminergic neurons directly involved in sleep and
wake regulation. We have recently found that activation of GABAergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus
potently promotes arousal by directly inhibiting VLPOGal neurons. Here we seek to extend this finding by
identifying other potential synaptic drives that control arousal levels, including both long-range and local
synaptic drives. To this end, while it has been appreciated for some time that VLPOGal neurons are under local
synaptic control, the details of this intra-VLPO circuit remains largely uncharacterized. We have found that
VLPOGal neurons are directly inhibited by a group of local GABAergic neurons. We propose that this local
GABAergic circuit serves as common entry node through which afferent wake- and sleep-promoting pathways
control VLPOGal neurons, with the specific hypotheses that this occurs by 1) direct and feedforward inhibition to
produce arousal and 2) disinhibition of VLPOGal neurons to produce sleep. The current proposal thus seeks to
identify, first in vitro and then in vivo, the long-range afferent inputs that directly or indirectly regulate VLPOGal
neurons to drive behavioral and cortical arousal via the local GABAergic network. To do so, we will first
employ in Specific Aims 1 in vitro circuit mapping and focal deletion of GABAergic transmission in VLPO
neurons to determine the necessity of the local GABAergic circuit for the control of VLPOGal neurons. In
Specific Aim 2 we will identify with in vitro recordings the postsynaptic neurons in VLPO that are targeted by
wake- and sleep-promoting inputs. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will use in vivo optogenetics to test whether the
afferent inputs to the VLPO first identified in vitro slices are necessary to produce sleep and wake behavioral
changes and fiber photometry to examine the state-dependent activity of these afferents to VLPO. Given the
large knowledge gap this proposal seeks to fill, we expect results from this collaborative work to provide
important and novel insights into the brain circuitry supporting sleep and wake regulation."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. Full transcriptome defines
clinically relevant “subtypes” of disease and the basal-like subtype of PDAC is associated with advanced
stage, metastasis, resistance to treatment, and poor patient survival. The mechanism by which the tumor
microenvironment drives PDAC subtype differentiation remains uncharacterized. Understanding the cancer-
extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promotes the basal-like state could uncover cancer
vulnerabilities and lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. We found that inactivation of the
histone demethylase gene Kdm8 reprograms PDAC cells into a highly metastatic state. Morphologically, Kdm8
inactivation reduces the expression of genes defining the classical PDAC subtype and drives a profound loss
of differentiation in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Importantly, the enzymatic function of Kdm8
requires molecular oxygen and hypoxia diminished the phenotypic changes induced by Kdm8 inactivation. We
noted a global upregulation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation upon the inactivation of Kdm8,
supporting the involvement of its demethylase function in regulating the chromatin and cell state. In human
PDAC, KDM8-regulated gene signatures are an exceptionally good predictor of the disease subtype. Our
preliminary results suggest that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment restricts the demethylase function
of Kdm8, thereby suppressing the classical PDAC subtype while promoting a basal-like state and metastasis
through epigenetic reprogramming. We hypothesize that a hypoxia-KDM8-chromatin axis plays a critical role in
PDAC subtype determination and metastatic ability.
In the proposed study, we aim to determine the mechanism by which Kdm8 controls PDAC subtypes and
metastatic progression and the mechanism by which hypoxia suppresses Kdm8 function to promote chromatin
reprogramming and PDAC metastasis. Overall, our study will fill the major gap in our understanding of how
hypoxia within the PDAC tumor microenvironment promotes the basal-like molecular subtype and metastasis.
Our mechanistic study will uncover fundamental insights into the role of KDM8 in subtype determination and
may discover novel vulnerabilities of the basal-like PDAC state. The long-term objective is to gain a better
understanding of the key cell-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promote the aggressive or
basal-like PDAC subtypes."

The regenerative capacity of stem cells diminishes as we age. In the case of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs),
this loss manifests as a sustained dormancy phase without regenerating new hair follicles. Although we have
gained substantial insight into the molecular differences between young and old stem cells and their niches, a
major roadblock in identifying key genes underlying age-related changes in mammals is the lengthy process
of generating experimental genetic models (e.g., overexpression or knockout mouse lines) and then aging
them—the combination of which delays experiments by years. As such, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of the specific genes and pathways that drive age-related changes in HFSCs. Furthermore,
although there is evidence suggesting that old stem cells can be rejuvenated, specific genes that can lead to this
reversion are unknown. Addressing these knowledge gaps will substantially advance our understanding of stem
cell aging and provide a starting point for developing therapies for age-related declines in stem cell functions.
This proposal capitalizes on the expertise, tools, and techniques we have established to rapidly test multiple
candidates to identify genes that drive or suppress age-related dormancy in HFSCs and delineate the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying these age-related changes. Findings from us and others show that
secreted factors from dermal fibroblasts play a key role in regulating the extended dormancy seen in old HFSCs.
We have already nominated one such candidate gene, Gas6, which we have shown can reactivate dormant
HFSCs when overexpressed. In Aim 1, we will focus on delineating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which Gas6 drives HFSCs towards more youthful behavior. In Aim 2, we will aim to identify additional genes that
regulate HFSC aging. To enable gene testing in old mice directly and to enhance our throughput, we have
established a strategy for rapid, in vivo genetic manipulation directly in old wild-type mice by delivering targeted
genetic cargo with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This strategy provides a practical route to manipulate
a relatively large number of genes in vivo, which has previously not been practical in the context of mammalian
aging. We will also use SHARE-seq, a powerful method we developed to assess both transcriptome and
chromatin changes in the same single cell. We will combine these techniques to gain insight into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which Gas6 and other genes function to enhance the function of old HFSCs.
Collectively, these discoveries will contribute to the basic understanding of stem cell changes that occur with
age, provide the research community with much-needed tools to accelerate aging research in vivo, and pinpoint
potential genes that can be harnessed to revert or halt age-related defects in HFSCs and beyond."

DNA replication checkpoint is a cell signaling pathway operating in all eukaryotes that monitors normal S phase
progression and in response to perturbed DNA replication, activates cellular responses to prevent irreversible
replication fork arrest, genomic instability, and cell death. The checkpoint senses the perturbed replication,
maintains the genomic stability under stress and thus functions as an important anticancer barrier. Many
anticancer drugs work by interfering with DNA replication and their efficacy is therefore influenced by the
checkpoint status of cancer. Despite its importance in disease prevention and cancer chemotherapies, we still
do not fully understand the checkpoint initiation process at the replication forks, nor do we know exactly how the
checkpoint protects the fork functions under stress. As an established model for studying the cellular
mechanisms that are conserved in humans, fission yeast offers several benefits for this research. The goal of
this project is to investigate the newly screened checkpoint mutants in fission yeast with particular emphasis on
two objectives: (1) understand the mechanistic underpinnings of checkpoint initiation at the perturbed forks, and
(2) uncover the essential molecular details of the checkpoint-regulated fork protection. As a starting point, we
have developed a combined approach of forward genetics and biochemical analysis and have identified several
new mutants with various checkpoint initiation defects under replication stress. We have also screened a large
collection of mutants that are defective in fork protection. Guided by our strong preliminary and published data,
we will conduct in vivo and in vitro studies under the first objective to investigate how the checkpoint sensor
kinase Rad3(ATR) signaling is affected by mutations in the Rad3-Rad26 complex, the RecQ helicase Rqh1, the
Smc5/6 complex, and the RPA complex. Under the second objective, we will investigate how the activated
checkpoint regulates DNA polymerase e on the leading strand and other yet-to-be identified targets for fork
protection. The long-term goal of this research program is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
replication checkpoint that involves three primary areas of inquiry: First, by using our newly improved genetic
method, replication proteins with conserved checkpoint functions will be identified. Second, reconstitution of the
checkpoint pathway in vitro using purified proteins that can properly recapitulate the in vivo data we and others
have obtained. Third, as we show in the studies on Rqh1, conservation of the checkpoint mechanisms in human
cells will be evaluated. Overall, this research program will bring much improved clarity to the molecular
mechanisms of the replication checkpoint in fission yeast as well as in mammalian cells. The proposed research
is significant because of its relevance to genome instability, oncogenesis, and cancer chemotherapies."

Mutations that impair function of the CRB1 gene are among the most prevalent causes of inherited retinal de-
generation. The events leading to degeneration when CRB1 is lost are unknown. To answer this question it is
essential to understand the function of CRB1 at each site where it is expressed within developing and mature
retina. This knowledge will reveal the functions of CRB1 that are most responsible for retinal pathology,
thereby pinpointing therapeutic strategies to prevent pathology. The objective here is to determine how distinct
CRB1 isoforms and CRB1-expressing cell types contribute to disease pathology in the Crb1null mouse model of
CRB1 disease. The central hypothesis is that a photoreceptor specific isoform, known as CRB1-B, needs to be
present and functional to prevent outer limiting membrane pathology and visual impairment. The rationale for
this work is that systematically evaluating CRB1 function at each time and place where it is expressed will es-
tablish a rational strategy for gene replacement therapy with a high likelihood of effectively halting degenera-
tion. To test this hypothesis three Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1: Determine the contribution of specific
Crb1 isoforms to disease-related phenotypes. Preliminary studies defined 3 major mRNA isoforms of the
mouse Crb1 and human CRB1 gene: CRB1-A, -B, and -C. To systematically test their function the PI's labora-
tory has generated mouse mutant strains that remove specific isoforms, either individually or in combination.
These mutants will be subjected to anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral analysis, thereby estab-
lishing the contribution of each isoform to specific aspects of the CRB1 mutant phenotype. Aim 2: Determine
how each Crb1-expressing cell type contributes to disease-related phenotypes. Conditional Crb1null mu-
tant mice will be generated that allow removal or re-expression of all isoforms in a cell type-specific manner.
These mice will undergo the battery of phenotypic tests noted for Aim 1 above, thereby establishing the role of
each CRB1-expressing cell type in distinct aspects of disease pathology. Aim 3: Rescue disease-related
phenotypes using isoform- and cell type-specific Crb1 re-expression. Preliminary data suggest a critical
role for the photoreceptor-specific CRB1-B isoform in onset and rescue of disease pathology. This Aim will test
the working hypothesis that restoring CRB1-B to photoreceptors will produce functional rescue in the Crb1null
disease model. This work will be significant because it will clarify the molecular and cellular aspects of CRB1
expression that are required to prevent retinal pathology. Once we know the consequences for retinal pathol-
ogy when specific sites of CRB1 expression are lost or restored, it will become clear which of these sites would
be most beneficial to target for CRB1 replacement therapy. Thus, the proposal is expected to yield innovative
new strategies for gene therapy which could be rapidly deployed to pre-clinical testing."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common, costly, and responsible for high mortality and long-
term morbidity. Unfortunately, our understanding of patient susceptibility and the underlying pathobiology of
ARDS is incomplete, resulting in imprecise ARDS diagnosis and the inability to accurately track its progression.
Exhaled breath contains hundreds of volatile organic and inorganic compounds (VOCs and VICs), many of
which are related to inflammatory and metabolic processes in the lungs and other organs. The goal of the
proposed project is to refine and test a novel, portable micro-gas chromatography (micro-GC) device that can
non-invasively and serially sample the lower respiratory tract for VOCs and VICs at the point of care. The
overarching hypothesis is that exhaled VOCs/VICs will exhibit dynamic patterns that can indicate the presence
of ARDS and track the disease trajectory. The team has developed a preliminary portable micro-GC device
and used it to measure exhaled VOCs, and they discovered VOC patterns distinguishing ARDS from other
causes of acute hypoxic respiratory failure in a small group of adult patients. To advance the device for clinical
use, they must now validate these preliminary findings and obtain robust time series data to identify the breath
biomarkers that enable disease trajectory monitoring. They will also evaluate the added benefit of measuring
VICs within the system, which they expect will improve device accuracy by providing additional inflammation
markers. In Aim 1, they will validate VOC breath biomarkers that identify ARDS patients and predict changes
in clinical status and outcomes. First, they will quickly refine their preliminary GC devices to enhance clinical
utility in exhaled VOC measurement. Then they will prospectively recruit 400 patients with acute hypoxic
respiratory failure and longitudinally measure VOCs and obtain other clinical and physiologic data for up to 10
days. They will also develop algorithms for GC signal analysis and test the algorithms that use VOC patterns to
identify ARDS. They will further validate algorithms that use dynamic changes in VOC patterns to predict
clinical trajectory. In Aim 2, they will Identify additional VIC breath biomarkers using new VIC detection
modules and develop enhanced breath signatures using both VOCs and VICs to detect ARDS and monitor its
trajectory. Once they integrate the new VIC detection modules into the existing GC devices, they will collect
VICs in patients recruited into the ongoing prospective longitudinal (in addition to VOCs). They will again
leverage machine learning approaches to develop and validate algorithms that identify ARDS from VOC/VIC
patterns, compare with algorithms using VOCs alone, and track dynamic changes to predict changes in clinical
status and outcomes. The innovative point-of-care gas analyzer will bring molecular diagnostics to the bedside,
enabling more accurate ARDS diagnosis that allows for earlier initiation of treatments to improve outcomes, as
well as novel ARDS trajectory monitoring to inform prognosis and downstream critical care decision-making."
10778484,"Worldwide, there are an estimated 300 million individuals who are carriers of the sickle cell β-globin gene (a
condition known as ‘sickle cell trait’ (SCT)). While generally regarded as a benign condition, SCT has been
shown to be associated with venous thrombosis and chronic kidney disease. We propose that harsh biophysical
conditions within venous thrombi or in the inner renal medulla induce sickling of SCT red blood cells (RBCs) that
promotes activation of coagulation and reduced RBC deformability while increasing RBC adhesiveness. To test
this hypothesis, we will use both human SCT blood samples as well as heterozygous (AS) Townes sickle cell
mice to study the RBC-dependent mechanisms that lead to venous thrombosis and chronic kidney disease. We
have established that AS mice develop larger experimental venous thrombi than control animals. Additionally,
like their human counterparts, AS mice manifest early onset glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria with age-
dependent reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Sub-contracts with the University of Alabama at Birmingham
and Johns Hopkins University will augment the recruitment of human subjects with SCT at UNC Chapel Hill.
Blood from all subjects will be analyzed in the UNC Blood Research Center using a panel of laboratory assays
that mimic the biophysical environments encountered by RBCs in the kidney or within newly formed blood clots.
The mouse model studies will be used to test the ability of anti-sickling, anti-thrombotic and anti-adhesive
therapies to prevent/reduce enhanced venous thrombosis and renal dysfunction observed in the AS mice."
10773088,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are a set of major morphological, neurobiological, and cognitive
abnormalities in offspring exposed to alcohol in utero. A common cognitive manifestation of alcohol exposure
during neural development in humans, and in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), are deficits
in spatial learning and memory. In moderate PAE, which accounts for the most common and underestimated
form of PAE, spatial deficits are marked by an inability to accurately discriminate between spatial locations or
recall previously learned spatial relationships. Systems-level monitoring of neural populations in the
hippocampal formation has unraveled a critical role for this circuit in the generation of spatial memories and
their subsequent recall. The well-characterized spatial and oscillatory organization of hippocampal spiking is
thought to play a critical role in these processes. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the
neurobiological mechanisms of spatial learning and memory impairments after moderate PAE. While the
behavioral phenotype of altered spatial behavior after moderate PAE is well established, there is still a critical
need to identify the systems-level mechanisms including the neural circuitry and brain dynamics involved in
such deficits. A multi-level understanding framework for the study of spatial impairments is essential in
developing a complete understanding of the impact of PAE on nervous system function and toward the
development of targeted interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify these systems-level
alterations by monitoring large ensembles of hippocampal neurons and their oscillatory dynamics during both
spatial learning and memory and in “offline periods” of rest and sleep. In two aims, we will test our central
hypothesis that PAE induced perturbations to spatial learning and memory are a consequence of a loss in
the expression of distinct hippocampal ensemble codes for place and their synchronization and organization
within hippocampal oscillations during rest and sleep. The aims of this R01 represent a critical step towards
our long-term goal of identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of spatial learning and memory deficits after
moderate PAE but will also provide critical insight into the systems-level impact of moderate PAE on
hippocampal population activity. The relationship between hippocampal population activity and spatial
learning and memory is well established in a wide range of species including humans. Thus, this proposal
has the potential to provide a novel scientific framework whereby new strategies for interventions can be
developed and tested in preclinical models but can also be developed for human patient populations."
10773089,"Abstract
Repeated alcohol exposure can be a potent neuroinflammatory stimulus. Alcohol activates microglia within the
brain via toll-like-receptors (TLRs); this activation leads to production of inflammatory mediators which contribute
to dependence and abuse 4,5. Fast spiking parvalbumin positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons (PVIs) are critical
for normal brain function. PVIs are often surrounded by specialized extracellular matrix molecules called
perineuronal nets (PNNs) which protect and buffer them from inflammation and oxidative stress. Notably,
increased PNNs are implicated in alcohol use disorder (AUD), which may be due to a ""locking in"" of critical
neuroplasticity mechanisms that underlie habitual behavior such as drug seeking in the face of adverse
consequences 2. Our preliminary data show that mice with microglial-specific ablation of the critical TLR adaptor
molecule myeloid differentiation primary response 88 [MyD88] (Cx3cr1-CreBT-MyD88f/f [hereafter called ""Cre+
mice""]) exhibit decreased proinflammatory responses (e.g. IL-1, TNF) to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection
compared to Cre- controls, as expected. Surprisingly, however, in response to LPS, male (but not female) Cre+
mice exhibit increased numbers of PVIs and PV/PNN interactions within the frontal cortex. Cre+ male mice further
exhibit markedly increased alcohol intake in an acute drinking-in-the dark (DID) protocol compared to controls,
consistent with findings from previous INIA-Neuroimmune projects using MyD88-/- (knockout) mice and chronic
alcohol paradigms 6. Taken together, these data suggest microglia critically regulate PVI number and/or
PNN envelopment in response to inflammatory signals via MyD88 signaling, and that increased PVI/PNN
interactions in the absence of MyD88 may underlie increased drinking in Cre+ mice. The overall goal of
this proposal is to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if microglial-MyD88 regulates the number of PVIs
and/or PNN interactions directly in response to chronic alcohol by assessing the phagocytosis of PVI-specific
inhibitory synapses and PNNs by microglia. Aim 2 will determine if microglial-MyD88 regulates the number of
PVIs and/or PNN interactions indirectly in response to chronic alcohol by assessing the ""secretome"" of microglia
and the production of PNN components by astrocytes and PVIs. Aim 3 will determine the role of PVIs and/or
PNN interactions in excessive drinking behavior in mice with and without microglial MyD88 by assessing the
impact of (1) degrading PNNs and (2) chemogenetic inhibition vs. activation of microglia on excessive drinking.
This is an innovative new project designed to complement existing strengths of several other INIA-Neuroimmune
investigators. If completed, these data would be the first to show a direct role for microglia in PVI/PNN
development and their role in excessive drinking, which could lead to novel treatment options."

Numerous studies in mice and humans have established the proximal airway basal cells (BCs) as the major
multipotent stem cell population that maintains the integrity of pseudostratified epithelium through
differentiation to secretory, ciliated and goblet cells. Chronic pathologies affecting the respiratory epithelium
can bring about profound changes in BC biology, including BC exhaustion and dysfunction in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as emergence of proliferative BC-like populations in cystic
fibrosis and cancer. Healthy luminal epithelial cells in the lung and trachea exhibit distinct apical-basal polarity,
and we have found that loss this polarity stimulates signals that promote aberrant BC expansion. In particular
our observations indicate that deletion of apical-localized transmembrane protein Crumbs3 leads to the
dysregulation of the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz (Yap/Taz), which have emerged as essential
regulators of developmental and disease processes in the lungs and other organs. Our preliminary
observations lead us to hypothesize that aberrant nuclear Yap/Taz initiate and sustain intrinsic and extrinsic
signals in a microenvironment that promotes BC expansion. Analyses of polarity defective airways has
revealed an interesting Yap/Taz-Neuregulin-1(Nrg1)-ERBB positive feed-back signaling cascade that we
hypothesize promotes BC proliferation and self-renewal. We have also mapped notably changes in the
extracellular matrix microenvironment that we hypothesize stimulates distinct Integrin-relayed signals that
promote Yap/Taz activity, as well as identified a novel mesenchymal cell population that we hypothesize
mediates these microenvironment changes in response to aberrant epithelial polarity. We propose that
crosstalk between mesenchymal cells, extracellular matrix and the airway epithelium support aberrant BC
expansion in response to polarity damage. We propose to study and target the intracellular signals mediated
by Yap/Taz (AIM 1) and extracellular matrix alterations (AIM 2) that promote BC expansion, and further define
how mesenchymal crosstalk contributes to phenotypes associated with epithelial polarity damage (AIM 3). Our
studies will offer important molecular insight into aberrant BC expansion in airway disease, and if successful,
will reveal potential biomarkers and avenues for therapeutic intervention or targeting of these poorly
understood diseases, and potential new methods for expanding BC ex vivo for future regenerative therapies."

Arboviruses are transmitted from insect vectors to humans, yet the molecular mechanisms that govern this
critical step in the viral life cycle are not completely understood. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has undergone
several natural adaptation events, acquiring mutations in the viral glycoproteins that have increased its
infectivity and transmission, yet how the glycoproteins promote infectivity, spread, and disease in vivo is
unclear. We harnessed the power of in vivo viral evolution and identified a new evolutionary intermediate in β-
strand c of the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein that led to increased transmission in mosquitoes and increased
replication and pathogenesis in mice, indicating that these glycoprotein regions are crucial for promoting viral
infectivity and disease. Preliminary studies from our lab show that E1 β-strand c plays essential roles in virion
thermostability, fusion, and cholesterol-dependent entry. Moreover, using viral evolution we have identified
host-specific genetic interactions between CHIKV E1 and E2. Based on these preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that CHIKV E1 and E2 drive distinct mechanisms of entry into insects and mammals and that
temperature and lipid composition in mosquitoes drives viral adaptation. Our overall goal is to understand the
fundamental mechanisms by which the CHIKV structural proteins regulate alphavirus infectivity and
dissemination in insects and mammals, and to elucidate what drives the adaptation of the glycoprotein in
insects. Here, we use complementary biochemical, genetic, in vitro and in vivo approaches coupled with deep
sequencing technologies to establish how the CHIKV structural proteins function to promote entry and CHIKV
pathogenesis and transmission in vivo (Aim 1), and to establish how temperature and host lipids impact
CHIKV-vector interactions in mosquitoes (Aim 2). Understanding the discrete mechanisms of how the viral
structural proteins regulate infectivity in insects and mammals, and how host lipids impact adaptation is
essential to understanding how arboviruses are transmitted, spread, and cause disease."

More than one million HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) children are born annually, with the majority in sub-Saharan
Africa. HEU infants are at an increased risk of poor linear growth, infectious morbidity, and mortality compared
to their HIV unexposed uninfected peers. Breastfeeding reduces but does not eliminate poor health outcomes in
HEU infants, despite improving maternal health with antiretroviral treatment. The biological mechanisms for
vulnerabilities in breastfed HEU infants remain unclear. There are significant gaps in our understanding of how
HIV infection affects breastmilk composition and the role of breastmilk composition in the development of poor
growth among HEU infants. It is biologically plausible that systemic metabolic dysfunction associated with
maternal HIV infection may alter metabolite levels in breastmilk and thereby affect infant outcomes. We
hypothesize that HIV will alter the maternal plasma and breastmilk metabolome and that these alterations will
be associated with the infant gut microbiome and infant growth.
We propose to leverage the Tunza Mwana Kenyan birth cohort (NICHD 5R01HD096999) including lactating
women living with and without HIV and their infants. Utilizing existing maternal plasma and breastmilk samples
from 60 cohort participants (30 with HIV and 30 without HIV) and prospective infant growth monitoring, we will
expand this unique cohort performing targeted metabolomics and machine learning to characterize metabolic
relationships between the mother-breastmilk-infant triad and to identify metabolomic profiles in plasma and
breastmilk associated with the infant gut microbiome composition and growth.
Specific Aims are to 1) determine how maternal plasma metabolites correlate with breastmilk metabolites, and
how plasma and breastmilk metabolites are associated with HIV in early (3 weeks) and later (6 months) lactation,
2) evaluate how breastmilk metabolites influence infant gut microbiome composition and diversity at 3 weeks
and 6 months, 3) identify maternal plasma and breastmilk metabolites and infant gut microbiome compositions
associated with growth to 24 months of life.
Career and Learning Objectives are to 1) acquire foundational and advanced skills in epidemiology and
biostatistics, 2) develop core competency in the conduct and interpretation of multi-omics studies, and 3)
strengthen skills in longitudinal cohort studies and clinical-translational trials. By accomplishing these learning
objectives and through the achievement of the specific aims in the research plan, the applicant will be well-
positioned to attain competitive external funding to implement future studies assessing the maternal-
breastmilk-infant triad and nutrition and growth outcomes.
Study Impact: This work will identify key elements in breastmilk that are disrupted and lead to profound effects
on infant health. New data generated on maternal metabolomic and infant gut microbiome profiles associated
with infant growth will inform potential targets for intervention."

AAFCO Advanced Inspector Training Seminar
PAR-19-306
The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a voluntary membership
association of local, state, and federal agencies charged by law to regulate the manufacture and
distribution of animal feeds.
The AAFCO Inspection & Sampling Committee ensures that the Advanced Inspector Training
Seminar (AITS) is made available to State Feed Programs to utilize for field staff training needs.
Common agenda topics are centered on Regulatory Authority, Investigative Techniques, Federal
Contract Work, Medicated Feeds and Labeling Requirements, and Emergency Response.
All personnel employed by state government agencies which perform inspections in feed facilities
are invited via email to attend the meeting, and up to sixty (60) attendees, on average, are accepted
as attendees. Historically, State Feed Programs have been limited on travel due to available
resources provided by their agency, therefore, the Association generally attempts to keep
registration costs as minimal as possible to increase the opportunity for field staff to attend.
AAFCO intends to utilize grant funding to ensure AITS provides the attendees with a robust
training on regulatory topics and professionalism subjects that have been identified as necessary
in order for animal feed inspectors to perform their duties satisfactorily."
10768768,"A long sought goal of medical research is to identify ways to increase the effectiveness of the
immune response. Here, we present a means of increasing myeloid cell function by increasing cell
expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We show that 1) under natural circumstances in
both humans and mice, myeloid cells increase their production of ACE in response to immune
challenge. This is an adaptive response that allows the cells to better respond to the challenge. 2)
When this process is exaggerated by using genetic means to augment ACE expression in either
macrophages or neutrophils, the result is a marked increase in the ability of mice to mount both an
innate and adaptive immune response against a variety of immune challenges. This increase in
response is directly due to the catalytic activity of the over-expressed ACE protein. 3) The enhanced
immune response is the result of ACE-induced metabolic changes that increase oxidative
phosphorylation and increase myeloid cell ATP. This is quite different from the well described myeloid
metabolic effects of LPS. That ACE affects cell levels of ATP is a very new finding based on mass
spectrometry and chemical analysis of ATP levels in two lines of mice. In contrast, myeloid cells
genetically lacking ACE have reduced ATP and reduced immune function. 4) Similar to the genetic ACE
KO, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) reduce neutrophil superoxide and anti-bacterial response in both humans
and mice. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the level of ACE expression by myeloid cells,
myeloid cell ATP content, and effectiveness of the immune response. Understanding how ACE affects
myeloid cell immunometabolism will reveal a totally new biochemical means of enhancing myeloid
function that might ultimately be manipulated to enhance human response. In Aim 1, we examine the
detailed metabolism of myeloid cells with increased ACE expression to identify changes affecting
immune function. In Aim 2, we will study the role of the transcription factor PPARα in inducing the
immune phenotype of myeloid cells expressing increased ACE. We also ask how ACE activity induces
increased cell PPARα. In Aim 3, we study whether ACE acts as an autocrine or paracrine factor and
whether we can characterize the peptide product of ACE responsible for affecting cell metabolism and
increasing the immune response of myeloid cells."

macrophages or neutrophils, the result is a marked increase in the ability of mice to mount both an
innate and adaptive immune response against a variety of immune challenges. This increase in
response is directly due to the catalytic activity of the over-expressed ACE protein. 3) The enhanced
immune response is the result of ACE-induced metabolic changes that increase oxidative
phosphorylation and increase myeloid cell ATP. This is quite different from the well described myeloid
metabolic effects of LPS. That ACE affects cell levels of ATP is a very new finding based on mass
spectrometry and chemical analysis of ATP levels in two lines of mice. In contrast, myeloid cells
genetically lacking ACE have reduced ATP and reduced immune function. 4) Similar to the genetic ACE
KO, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) reduce neutrophil superoxide and anti-bacterial response in both humans
and mice. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the level of ACE expression by myeloid cells,
myeloid cell ATP content, and effectiveness of the immune response. Understanding how ACE affects
myeloid cell immunometabolism will reveal a totally new biochemical means of enhancing myeloid
function that might ultimately be manipulated to enhance human response. In Aim 1, we examine the
detailed metabolism of myeloid cells with increased ACE expression to identify changes affecting
immune function. In Aim 2, we will study the role of the transcription factor PPARα in inducing the
immune phenotype of myeloid cells expressing increased ACE. We also ask how ACE activity induces
increased cell PPARα. In Aim 3, we study whether ACE acts as an autocrine or paracrine factor and
whether we can characterize the peptide product of ACE responsible for affecting cell metabolism and
increasing the immune response of myeloid cells."

The 21st century workforce is experiencing increasing job demands while employers optimize job resources to meet regulatory, fiscal and productivity standards. This is perhaps most apparent in today’s healthcare system, wherein the workforce is under constant stress to cope with rapidly changing care delivery approaches, widespread adoption of electronic health records, and increased reliance on publicly reported quality metrics. In May 2019, the World Health Organization defined burnout as an occupational phenomenon. Unfortunately, burnout is underrecognized by those who suffer from it, and it typically goes undetected until employees’ performance deteriorates or catastrophes occur in workplace. Therefore, this project’s overarching goal is to develop a data-driven technology for predicting impending burnout before its effects on health and work performance become manifest. As a case study, this project will establish predictability of burnout in registered nurses (RNs). In hospital settings, 35%-45% of RNs report burnout primarily driven by increased work demands (higher patient acuity), work inefficiencies, interpersonal conflict, moral distress, and low level of control over decisions that affect their work. Burnout in RNs is associated with poor patient outcomes (increased risk of medical errors, hospital-acquired infections), lower quality of care, increased absenteeism and poor patient satisfaction. Within this context, the proposed project’s vision and aims are presented. This project’s vision is to develop a technology to predict burnout in RNs (as a case study) by combining workplace, psychological, and physiological factors, and exploring the barriers to adopting such a technology. This effort focuses on the following aims: Aim1. To create a unique, open- access, de-identified dataset that transforms the science of burnout internationally and informs the interaction of continuous physiological measures (measured from smart watches) and repeated (quarterly) psychological (measured using validated rating scales) and work-related factors (administrative databases) for predicting burnout (Aim 2) in RNs at Mayo Clinic’s Florida (Cohorts-A&B) and Rochester (Cohort-C) sites. Aim 2. To develop an analytical framework combining probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and multitask learning (MTL) to derive interpretable predictions of burnout. PGMs addresses the challenge of inherent stochasticity of burnout manifestation across individuals, and MTL will identify common burnout factors predictive of burnout risks (high, medium and low). Predictability established using Cohort-A will be validated in Cohorts-B&C. Aim 3. Explore barriers (bioethics and administrative) to adopting burnout prediction technologies by assessing perspectives of RNs, nurse supervisors and hospital administrators."

The Partnership between New Mexico State University (NMSU), an Institution Serving Underserved Health
Disparities Populations and Underrepresented Students (ISUPS), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred
Hutch), a Comprehensive Cancer Center, has matured into a strong, mutually beneficial partnership from its
start as a U56 (2002-2007) and three cycles as a U54 (2007-2023) Partnership. Over the past twenty years,
NMSU has increased its commitment to cancer research, and Fred Hutch has expanded its efforts in cancer
prevention, education, and health disparities. The Partnership has expanded and adapted opportunities for
research, education, training, and community engagement for historically excluded communities (HECs) in the
U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest, responding to its mission of improving cancer health equity. Population
health sciences and transdisciplinary studies are the focus of joint Research Projects to a greater extent than
in previous cycles. Expansion of the research education portfolio parallels an increased breadth of cancer and
health disparities Research Projects. Lastly, the Partnership has amplified the voices of the communities it
serves through community engaged research practices. The Partnership’s goals for the next U54 cycle are to
further increase excellence in cancer research, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination portfolios
while working towards accomplishing larger transformational changes within the Partnership. This competing
renewal application formulates and implements three Guiding Principles for the Partnership: Restructuring
Scientific Environments, Restructuring Scientific Processes, and Restructuring Scientific Engagement. These
principles bring new opportunities to strengthen equity, inclusion, and diversity across all activities proposed by
this U54 Partnership is support of the following three Specific Aims (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio
of robust cancer Research Projects that span clinical, basic and population health sciences (2) Implement,
evaluate, and improve our research education programs for current and future scientists from historically
excluded communities (HECs) (3) Collaborate with community organizations on outreach programs in New
Mexico and Washington State that work with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities.
To achieve these aims, the Partnership has assembled innovative cancer Research Projects that address an
unmet regional needs and benefit from strong community input. Each Core - Administrative, Planning and
Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Resource for AcademIc
SuccEss (RAISE) - has also proposed activities to implement the Guiding Principles. The Partnership
formulated activities that are highly integrated across Research Projects and Cores to provide the necessary
resources to participants while advancing progress to meeting the Partnership’s mission."

The immune system can distinguish healthy cells from tumor cells, as the latter expresses tumor associated
antigens (TAAs). In the context of CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses, recognition of TAAs occurs through
the presentation of TAAs via major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) on tumor cells and their interaction with T-
cell receptor (TCR) on the CD8+ T cells. Impairing this event will ultimately reduce or annihilate the CD8+ T-cell
mediated tumor cytotoxicity. However, reduction or loss of antigen presentation is a frequent and essential
mechanism used by tumor cells to escape immune recognition and destruction, including genomic deletion of
MHC-I genes, transcriptional suppression of antigen presentation-associated genes, and dysregulation of tumor
antigen processing by 26S immunoproteasome. Despite the recent success in immunotherapies based on direct
blockade of immune checkpoint proteins (PD-1, CTLA-4 and PD-L1), a majority of patients with solid tumors do
not experience durable clinical benefits. The mechanisms of tumor resistance against immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) involve low levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suppressive immune cells (Tregs, MDSCs
and macrophages), and adverse tumor microenvironment. Aberrations in the antigen processing and
presentation machinery (APM) genes correlate with poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, therapeutic intervention
of tumor antigen presentation would be a promising therapeutic approach to improve responsiveness towards
immune checkpoint blockade. In a screen for small-molecule compounds from herbal medicine that potentiate T
cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we identified atractylenolide I (ATT-I) that significantly promotes tumor antigen
presentation of both human and mouse colorectal cancer cells and thereby enhances the cytotoxic response of
CD8+ T cells. In syngeneic mouse colorectal tumor models, treatment of ATT-I in combination with PD-1 antibody
markedly enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. We propose that targeting the function
of immunoproteasome with ATT-I promotes tumor antigen presentation, empowers T-cell cytotoxicity, and thus
elevates the tumor response to immunotherapy. In this application, we will 1) determine the molecular
mechanism by which ATT-I promotes antigen processing and presentation in colorectal cancer cells; 2) evaluate
the effect of ATT-I treatment on intra-tumor immune cell infiltration, activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and their
interaction with tumor microenvironment in colorectal tumors; 3) assess the therapeutic activity of ATT-I in
enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (ICB) using genetically engineered
mouse models of colorectal cancer and human ex vivo colorectal tumor organoid models."

The Resource for AcademIc SuccEss (RAISE) Core is a Shared Resource, available to support all
Partnership participants. The RAISE Core will have two areas of emphasis: individualized career support for
Early Stage and New Investigators (ESIs/NIs) and serving as the Ombudsperson for all participants.
The Core will act as a foundation that supports the individuals that make up the Partnership. The RAISE Core
Leads have a extensive and complementary experience that allows them to act as coaches and advisors and
identify appropriate resources to support Partnership faculty and staff. By providing individualized support for
ESIs/NIs, the Core will directly address needs and knowledge gaps to enable faculty to increase their cancer
research capability, become more effective collaborators and enhance their research on cancer health
disparities. Regular individual meetings with ESIs/NIs will allow RAISE to provide advice, information, and
access to professional development activities in a safe setting and timely manner. At any time, ESIs/NIs may
request resources and/or activities for career growth. Such resources may include course release time for
manuscript or proposal preparation, registration and travel for a focused professional development workshop
and faculty coaching.
The heart of the Partnership is training and research collaborations between New Mexico State University and
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. The Ombuds can serve to strengthen and improve collaborations and
mentee-mentor relationships by facilitating communication to reveal differing expectations and work toward
agreement of shared expectations. This increases cancer research capability because time in conflict is
minimized and time and focus on research and education is maximized. This in conjunction with individualized
faculty mentoring creates an environment that encourages the professional development of faculty and
supports their engagement with the Partnership’s Guiding Principles (see Overall)."
10931702,"ABSTRACT
Cancers are characterized by alterations to cellular metabolism that promote tumorigenesis, however our
understanding of how these metabolic changes are enacted and how they mechanistically support cancer cell
function remains lacking. While some metabolic changes reproducibly occur as a direct result of oncogenic
mutations, other metabolic alterations occur over time through adaptive metabolic protein expression changes
that allow cells to surmount metabolic deficiencies during cancer progression. Notably, this latter group is
predicted to be enriched for functionally important metabolic changes, suggesting that their identification would
have particularly relevance for cancer research. However, detailed understanding of which metabolic
alterations are the result of adaptations is hampered by the lack of models for directly studying reproducible
metabolic adaptations in cancer. Additionally, data on differences in cancer-related adaptations based on race
or ethnicity that contribute to health disparities are lacking. Here, we propose to address this knowledge gap
by investigating the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation system that we have recently established, where loss
of function mutations in the tumor suppressor succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) selects for cells with
concordant expression of components of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, which ultimately
supports cell metabolism and cell proliferation. Using this system, we will investigate the metabolic drivers of
complex I adaptations in SDH deficient cells (Aim 1) and use polyomics measurements of gene expression
processes, such a epigenetics, transcription, and proteostasis, to identify the cellular processes that enact
adaptive changes to complex I expression (Aim 2). We will also take a systematic approach using state-of-the-
art statistical methods to leverage publicly available patient tumor datasets containing polyomic measurements
and patient metadata in order to identify adaptive changes to metabolic protein expression during cancer
progression (Aim 3). This multidisciplinary Full Project also addresses the Partnership’s Guiding Principles
(see Overall section) for inclusive mentoring of diverse research teams and for research dissemination to
underserved communities, helping to educate and provide opportunities for next generation of researchers."

It is well established that phytonutrient-rich foods are cancer preventive and that diets high in phytochemicals
such as carotenoids, tocopherols, and chlorophylls are associated with decreased cancer risk and recurrence.
Historically, traditional dietary patterns across multiple cultures have been plant-based and phytonutrient-rich.
As dietary patterns have westernized, they have become less plant-based and thus less phytonutrient-rich. In
parallel, communities that previously consumed plant-based diets have experienced increased risks of cancer
and cardiometabolic disorders. The Hispanic/Latinx community in southern New Mexico has been particularly
impacted by cancer health disparities making it imperative to develop effective and sustainable strategies to
improve diet quality. This Full Project builds upon an ongoing collaboration between investigators at New
Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) to develop and
implement a “kitchen-to-lab-to-table” research model. Here, we extend our research by partnering with the
NMSU Cooperative Extension Service. We will create new content focused on prevention of cancer and other
chronic diseases by increasing fruits and vegetables, improving diet quality, and improving portion control
using culturally congruent materials. We will create a Community Action Board comprised of community
members served by NMSU Cooperative Extension in southern New Mexico. Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To
optimize carotenoid, tocopherol and chlorophyll content and bioavailability by changing cooking methods and
ingredients in 15 culturally congruent southern New Mexican recipes. Aim 2: To develop and test the effects of
a culturally adapted 6-session curricula delivered through the NMSU Cooperative Extension Service in two
Southern New Mexico counties using a randomized, waitlist-controlled, crossover trial design (n=60). The
research will build upon our “kitchen-to-lab-to-table” research model of working with communities with low
incomes and limited resources with high cancer health disparities to identify culturally appropriate methods to
improve diet intake and quality. Study results will be used to continue to develop evidence-based methods to
inform culinary practices to disseminate to communities, and to design community-based dietary interventions
to improve the health of vulnerable communities. The research will establish a new “kitchen-to-lab-to-table”
model to collaborate with Hispanic/Latinx communities in southern New Mexico with high cancer health
disparities and to identify culturally appropriate methods to improve diet quality. Study results will be used to
continue to develop evidence-based methods to inform culinary practices to disseminate to communities, and
to design community-based dietary interventions to improve the health of vulnerable communities."

Smoking prevalence among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults in New Mexico is more than twice as
high as non-SGM adults, suggesting that existing SGM-related disparities in tobacco use will persist well into
the foreseeable future unless sustained efforts are undertaken to address them. Helping young adult tobacco
users to quit is a critical piece of SGM-directed tobacco control interventions, yet there have been few efforts to
develop tailored treatments specifically for this population. This is a critical gap given that this is a population
whose access to and use of traditional cessation treatments involving counseling and pharmacotherapy is
poor. SGM young adults in New Mexico (NM) are likely to experience unique influences on tobacco use and
cessation tied to both their ethnic and SGM identities, in addition to other aspects of their identity. An
intersectional focus is critical for developing interventions to address high rates of tobacco use among SGM
young adults in New Mexico that are acceptable, accessible, and effective. To address these needs, we have
adapted an avatar-led, digital Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program for SGM young adult
smokers at all stages of readiness to quit. This program (called Empowered, Queer, Quitting, and Living, or
EQQUAL) showed great promise in a single-arm pilot trial: 93% satisfaction and a 23% biochemically-
confirmed quit rate. In this study, we propose to develop a version of the program that is culturally tailored to
SGM young adults in New Mexico (EQQUAL-NM) and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=120) to
preliminarily evaluate acceptability and efficacy of EQQUAL-NM relative to the National Cancer Institute’s
QuitGuide program. We hypothesize that, compared with QuitGuide, EQQUAL-NM will show a trend toward
greater satisfaction, number of logins, biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence nicotine and tobacco
abstinence, and psychological flexibility (i.e., ACT’s theory-based change mechanism). We will also explore
readiness to quit, sexual orientation, gender identity, and Latinx ethnicity as moderators of treatment effects.
This project is significant: (1) it focuses on an NIH-defined disparities group with a high prevalence of tobacco
use that has been underserved in treatment research; (2) it addresses SGM individuals’ desire for a program
tailored to their unique needs and challenges in a readily scalable and accessible format; (3) if proven
effective, EQQUAL-NM would be highly disseminable online and via SGM community-serving organizations in
NM. It is also innovative: (1) it is the first self-guided digital cessation treatment culturally tailored for SGM
young adults in New Mexico, (2) there are currently no other SGM-tailored treatments available in Spanish, (3)
its novel treatment approach advances the science of ACT for tobacco cessation by testing effectiveness for
users at all stages of readiness to quit; and, (4) use of avatars and interactive games as engagement
strategies is substantially different than existing treatments. This project will generate all the pilot data needed
to support an R01-level project testing the effectiveness of EQQUAL-NM in a fully-powered trial."
10757035,"A major gap in our understanding of infectious diseases is the lack of information about molecular interaction
networks between an infecting pathogen and the human host, which has yet to be accomplished for a bacterial
infection in humans. The purpose of this application is to define an interactome on a transcript level for the
primary skin pathogen, Haemophilus ducreyi (HD), in experimentally infected human volunteers using RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolomics. HD causes chancroid, a genital ulcer (GU) disease that facilitates
HIV transmission and is as a major cause of cutaneous ulcers (CU) in children in yaws-endemic countries.
Efforts to eradicate HD-associated CU with antibiotics failed due to environmental reservoirs. To study the
biology of HD, we developed a model in which the HD GU strain 35000HP and its derivatives are inoculated
into the skin of the upper arm of adult volunteers. Whole genome sequencing shows that most CU strains are
nearly identical to 35000HP, indicating that our model is highly relevant to GU and CU. In the model and in
natural chancroid, HD resides in an abscess where it is surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and
macrophages and remains extracellular by evading phagocytosis. In our new preliminary data, we show
that an interaction network exists between HD and the host and that differential host and bacterial transcript
expression correlates with metabolomic changes at infected vs. wounded sites. HD primarily upregulates the
expression of genes involved in adapting to anaerobiosis and uptake and utilization of metal ions and
alternative carbon sources, such as ascorbic acid, consistent with the idea of “nutritional virulence.” Our new
metabolomics data show that ascorbic acid pathways are upregulated in lesions. Thus, we hypothesize that
the host regulates its gene transcription to phagocytize and limit nutrients to HD, that HD regulates its
gene transcription to counteract these host defenses, that host gene expression correlates with
metabolomic profiles at infected sites, and that bacterial genes that are involved in adaptation to the
metabolic niche created by the host response will be required for virulence. Our specific aims are 1) to
define the metabolome and the interactome between HD and the human host in infected tissue and to
correlate the host transcriptional response to metabolic changes in lesions; 2) to identify the cells responsible
for the host transcriptional response using single cell RNA-seq; 3) to determine whether the HD genes
involved in exploitation of the host niche are required for virulence in humans and the mechanism(s) by which
these genes contribute to virulence. The importance of this study is that we will be the first to determine an
interactome at a site of a bacterial human infection, define the host cells responsible for the transcriptional
response, correlate the host response to metabolomic changes in lesions, and study how HD exploits these
metabolites. We will provide new insights into the interaction between a model extracellular bacterium and the
human host and unmask novel strategies to control HD-associated CU."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, all of which are important therapeutic targets. TNBC is the most
difficult-to-treat subgroup of breast cancers and is resistant to many current cancer therapies. The present
situation of poor prognosis with limited therapy options in TNBC emphasizes an urgent need for more effective
therapeutics. The ability to escape from the surveillance by the immune system is regarded as one of the
essential hallmarks of cancer cells. Recent exciting discoveries have identified many important signals and
mechanisms mediating cancer cell immune evasion. Immunotherapies have been developed to target these
signals, revolutionizing the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
represent the major components of the tumor microenvironment in TNBC. Recent studies demonstrate that the
blockade of a “don’t eat me” signal CD47 leads to direct phagocytosis of living cancer cells by macrophages,
and significantly inhibits the engraftment of various malignant hematopoietic and solid tumor cells in mice that
lack T, B, and NK cells, indicating a critical role of macrophages in cancer immunosurveillance. Targeting TAMs
in the tumor microenvironment represents a new class of promising cancer immunotherapy. While inducing
anticancer functions of TAMs holds considerable promise for cancer treatment, there are several barriers that
need to be overcome to achieve desired efficacy for treating TNBC. In preliminary studies, we found that TAMs
can be reprogrammed by small molecule antineoplastic compounds to induce their phagocytic ability against
TNBC cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating the reprogramming of macrophages
remains unclear. The overall objective of the proposed study is to understand the underlying mechanisms of
macrophage-mediated immunosurveillance in TNBC and to develop strategies to effectively treat TNBC by
exploiting tumoricidal roles of TAMs, with a combination of in vitro and in vivo preclinical TNBC models. In Aim1,
we will assess the efficacy of reprogramming macrophages in TNBC treatment by using metastatic TNBC models
and chemotherapy-resistant patient-derived xenograft models. In Aim2, we will study the molecular mechanisms
by which macrophages are reprogrammed by dissecting the functions and roles of Pattern Recognition Receptor
signaling pathways in macrophage reprogramming and characterizing TAM subgroups in TNBC tumors. In Aim3,
we will determine the effects of targeting macrophage cell surface molecular machinery on activating TAMs for
TNBC treatment. Successful completion of the proposed studies should shed light on the basic principles of
cancer cell immune evasion and inspire the development of novel therapeutics for TNBC treatment."

Research Summary
Two major activated macrophage phenotypes, classically activated macrophages (M1), which are pro-
inflammatory and bactericidal, and alternatively activated macrophages (M2) which, are anti-inflammatory and
reparative, play critical roles in various diseases including wound healing, myocardial infarction and cancer.
The importance of macrophage phenotypes and function make them an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic
target. However, in vivo detection of these cells remains challenging due to the heterogeneity and complexity
of the macrophage phenotypes. Efficacious and specific in vivo tools are greatly needed. Few imaging
methods have been developed to tackle this issue. Mannose receptors are a well-established marker for M2-
like macrophages, which recognize and bind to terminal mannose, fucose or N-acetylglucosamine on the
surface of pathogenic viruses, bacteria or fungi. We hypothesize that by screening and optimizing mannose-
based ligands targeting the mannose receptor we will identify a highly efficacious magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) probe that can differentiate M2-like macrophages from M1-like macrophages. Therefore, the goals of this
proposal are 1) to develop an MRI probe targeting mannose receptors to detect M2-like macrophages and
validate it in a mouse model of wound healing, and 2) to apply the optimal probe to longitudinally track M2-like
macrophages in mouse models of myocardial infarction and lung carcinoma, with the ultimate goal of
translating this technology for human use in a future study.

10930884,"Project Summary / Abstract
The treatment of children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) involves the primary surgical repairment of the cleft,
followed by secondary treatments like pharyngeal flap surgery and speech therapy for the purpose of
improving speech outcomes and quality of life. India has the second highest number of children born yearly
with CLP in the world, second only to China. In lower- and middle-income countries like India, most of the
children with CLP live in rural areas and remain untreated after the primary surgical impairment of the cleft.
A study conducted from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reported that 50-55% of children with
CLP require follow up surgery to improve speech, but the vast majority of these children are not treated due
to limited access to clinical services. In most rural CLP cases in India, intervention ends post-primary
surgery and patients and their families accept poor speech outcomes as a consequence of the disorder.
This is unfortunate as, many times, these speech problems are correctable via the secondary surgery or
speech therapy; however, the resources and know-how for determining who would benefit from these
interventions are clustered in urban areas and those in rural regions are unaware that additional treatment
is possible. To determine if secondary surgery or speech therapy are necessary, clinicians listen for signs of
hypernasality in the speech produced by children. This is a subtle cue in the speech that indicates the
presence of correctible velopharyngeal dysfunction resulting in reduced speech intelligibility. This is a highly
specialized skill that community healthcare workers in rural clinics have not been trained in. As a result,
children in rural areas go without the benefit of secondary interventions that have the potential to improve
speech outcomes and quality of life.
 We propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile health (mHealth) application for the
identification of children with CLP who would benefit from interventions to improve communication
outcomes in the rural areas of India. This is a multidisciplinary, collaborative project between Arizona State
University, the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, and All India Institute of Speech and Hearing. We
will use an existing database of speech from children with CLP in Kannada, a primary language in India, to
develop a hypernasality prediction algorithm for the Indian language; we will integrate this algorithm within
an mHealth app (R21: SA1). We will work with AIISH to perform an initial in-clinic evaluation of the app and
the algorithms (R21: SA2), then refine the app and algorithms based on this evaluation (R33: SA3). Finally,
we will disseminate the mHealth app to community health workers for evaluation in rural clinics (SA4 and
SA5). Milestones for development of the app and initial validation and usabililty of the app will be achieved
in order to move from the R21 to the R33."
10869970,"Ischemic stroke is a major healthcare burden and there is an important unmet need for new treatments that
can be applied beyond the narrow acute phase of injury after which ischemic tissue becomes infarcted. A
hallmark of natural wound responses after stroke is the formation of compartmentalized lesions that contain
non-neural cell cores that lack specialized glia cells that are fundamental to supporting neural circuits and
barrier functions. In organisms capable of neural regeneration such as zebrafish and the mammalian neonate,
immature glia cells readily repopulate lesion cores to effectively drive neural repair, but this competency is lost
in adult mammals. With the overall goal of promoting scar-free glia repair in stroke to transform lesion cores
into neural regeneration permissive environments, this project’s main objective is to use cutting-edge intravital
imaging methods to longitudinally track cell graft evoked changes in wound repair outcomes following cortical
strokes to identify critical graft parameters that lead to effective glia-repair. Our hypothesis is that multiple
intravital imaging modalities can be used to effectively track temporal changes in grafted cell number and
phenotype as well as quantify graft induced alterations to microvasculature density, perfusion, and permeability
in lesion cores. Grafting cells during the sub-acute injury phase to alter the nature of adult central nervous
system (CNS) wound healing and drive glia repair represents a novel and potentially transformative strategy
that would have broad impact for treatment of stroke and other CNS injuries. In the first aim, we will
longitudinally track differences in glia repair in cortical strokes directed by neural progenitor cells (NPC) and
immature astroglia grafts. Priming grafts into proliferating immature astrocytes prior to transplantation may
accelerate and better guide glia repair processes. Using two-photon microscopy (2PM) we will evaluate graft
cell number, density, and morphology and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify graft induced
changes in vascular density and quantitative blood flow in and around stroke lesion cores. To evaluate return
of CNS barrier functions we will quantify the leakage of intravenous contrast agents using 2PM. In the second
aim, we evaluate the effect of post stroke grafting timepoint on glia repair outcomes. This project will provide
mechanistically validated, proof-of-principle evidence into how cell grafts, including immature astrocyte grafts,
can remodel lesion cores by directing angiogenesis and restoration of glia barriers. This project will advance
our understanding of cell transplantation and certify a toolkit for evaluating transplant functions in vivo that will
position us to pursue advanced stroke functional recovery studies in future work."
10851807,"Despite the currently available effective prophylactic vaccines, human papilloma virus infections remain the most common cause of venereal disease. Human papilloma virus-associated diseases are particularly prevalent in medically underserved segments of the population. Despite decades of research, there are no strategies that can limit the spread of human papilloma viruses. The productive viral life cycle of these viruses has been studied extensively, but research has almost exclusively focused on the contributions of viral and cellular proteins and protein-coding mRNAs. However, most of the cellular transcriptome does not encode proteins. Some non-coding RNAs likely represent functionally irrelevant transcriptional noise but several classes of non-coding RNAs serve important regulatory functions. Long non-coding RNAs have only recently emerged as critical modulators of many cellular regulatory circuits. Human papilloma viruses replicate their genomes to high copy numbers and generate progeny virus in terminally differentiated epithelial cells. We showed that expression of the long non-coding RNA DINO increases during epithelial differentiation and that ectopic expression of the long noncoding RNA DINO in a patient-derived, human papillomavirus episome- containing cell line causes an increase in viral genomes. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that DINO plays a previously unanticipated role in regulating the differentiation-dependent life cycle of human papillomaviruses. We will deploy a combination of biochemical, cell and molecular biology approaches to define the biological activities of DINO in human papillomavirus genome replication in dividing and differentiated viral episome-containing, patient-derived cell lines. The results from our studies will yield novel molecular insights into the differentiation-dependent life cycle of human papillomaviruses."

10908648,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a common phenomenon defined as the presence of somatic mutations in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their expansion in the absence of overt hematological
disease. CH-mutant mature, myeloid cells are believed to generate an inflammatory microenvironment
promoting the fitness advantage of mutant HSPCs. These, in turn, would expand at higher rates and differentiate
into more elevated numbers of myeloid cells, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop between inflammatory
signaling and clonal expansion. Yet, whether CH-mutant HSPCs can also trigger cell-autonomous inflammatory
signaling to provide a selective clonal advantage for themselves remains unknown. CH increases the risk of
hematological malignancy, cardiovascular disease, and mortality from solid tumors. Due to these adverse
outcomes and the high prevalence of CH in the elderly, there is an unmet need to develop novel therapies.
Targeting inflammation specifically in mutant HSPCs —to avoid disruption of general immune responses— may
be a potentially effective strategy. My predoctoral research (Aim 1) aims to identify inflammatory mediators of
CH-mutant HSPCs and evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets to restore oligoclonal hematopoiesis. To
find novel, cell-autonomous inflammatory pathways in CH, I have designed an sgRNA library to target
inflammation-associated genes. Using this library for high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screening, I have identified
both general and genotype-specific inflammatory dependencies of CH-mutant murine HSPCs. In this proposal,
Specific Aim 1.1 seeks to validate the negative selection hits, demonstrate that, when present, the hit genes
confer a selective advantage to CH-mutant HSPCs versus wild-type counterparts, and delineate the specific role
of credential top hits in clonal expansion. In Specific Aim 1.2, I will use small molecule inhibitors targeting
the candidate genes —both ex vivo and in mice— to identify gene expression and cytokine profile changes
spanning the hematopoietic cell subsets. I will then assess differences between genetic and chemical approaches
concerning their efficiency in achieving adequate target inhibition. My postdoctoral research (Aim 2) will focus
on the role of inflammation at the nexus of aging and CH by uncovering the transcriptional and epigenetic
mechanisms by which age-related inflammation promotes CH and potential malignant transformation to
leukemia. Overall, these two projects, which will use human samples to validate the mouse findings, will lead to
developing new therapies targeting inflammation to halt or revert CH and mitigate its clinical sequelae. I, the
applicant, will conduct this proposal in the laboratory of Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK), one of the world's leading institutions in cancer treatment and research. MSK's rich environment
and abundant resources in conjunction with the support of the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School,
guarantee the successful completion of the proposed research and career development plans."
10745663,"Neurovascular coupling (NVC) links increases in neuronal activity with a rapid and spatially restricted increase
in local blood flow. Knowledge on the cellular mechanisms driving NVC has been focused on transient
exteroceptive sensory stimulation and limited to superficial dorsal brain areas (cortex). Thus, less is understood
on NVC dynamics of deeper brain regions, which can be activated by slow, sustained, and widespread stimuli
(e.g., physiological disturbances of bodily homeostasis). Derangement in homeostatic processes is a key driver
of pathological mechanisms in prevalent diseases such as neurohumoral activation in heart failure (HF). To
address this critical gap in our knowledge, we developed a novel experimental approach that enables
interoceptive-induced NVC during a challenge to bodily homeostasis. Our preliminary data show that contrary to
the canonical NVC response, a systemic and physiological homeostatic challenge (acute salt-loading)
progressively increased vasopressin (VP) neuronal firing, evoked activity-dependent vasoconstriction and
decreased local blood flow in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). The salt-induced inverse NVC (iNVC)
response was slow, sustained and widespread, and mediated by the dendritic release of VP within the SON.
iNVC resulted in local tissue hypoxia, which evoked further excitation of VP neurons. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that iNVC is a physiological process that contributes to positive feedback
modulation of the VP neuronal population so that the physiological disturbance can be efficiently corrected. Still,
the precise signaling mechanisms and cellular targets mediating this novel physiological modality of NVC, and
more importantly, whether an aberrant iNVC response contributes to exacerbated VP neuronal activity
characteristic of prevalent cardiometabolic diseases, such as HF, remains unknown. Using a multidisciplinary
approach, in Aim 1 we will elucidate the precise signaling mechanisms and cellular targets mediating activity-
dependent iNVC in the SON (neuron-to-vessel signaling). In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms and
targets by which the iNVC evokes the positive feedback modulation of VP neuronal firing activity (vasculo-to-
neuron signaling). Finally, in Aim3, we will elucidate mechanisms contributing to exacerbated iNVC-mediated
positive feedback regulation of VP neurons in a disease state (HF). Both in vivo and ex vivo novel approaches
(2-photon imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and ex vivo cannulation of SON arterioles) will be used in
novel transgenic rat models that enable visualization (eGFP) and manipulation (opto- and chemogenetically) of
VP neurons in the SON. The activation of acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) and modulation of astrocyte
glutamate transporters will be investigated as key molecular targets. We expect results from this work to
contribute to a better understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying NVC responses in different brain
regions and under different activity-dependent modalities. Moreover, we anticipate our studies to unveil novel
pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets for the treatment of highly prevalent cardiometabolic diseases.

10745710,"Abstract
Global challenges to human health include a well-documented decline in human fertility and a dramatic increase
in the prevalence of obesity related metabolic disorders. There is now compelling evidence that these health
challenges are associated with environmental chemicals that can influence endocrine activity. However, this
premise has evolved from studies with acute single chemical exposures in altricial, genetically restricted, animal
models. The proposed study will address the central hypothesis that exposure to a real-life mixture of
environmental chemicals, prior to and throughout pregnancy, results in transgenerational epigenetic effects in
offspring that affect metabolism and reproduction. The proposal will use a unique, real-life chemical exposure
and a translationally relevant animal model whereby sheep are exposed to biosolids. Humans are exposed to a
wide mixture of environmental chemicals, at typically low concentrations, throughout their lifespan. Grazing
pregnant sheep on pastures treated with biosolids generated from human sewage provides a precocial model
with a developmental trajectory similar to humans. This provides a novel approach to examine the effects of
environmental chemical mixtures to which we are all exposed. The specific aims are: (1) to characterise lifetime
changes in metabolic function of male and female offspring spanning three generations (i.e. F1, F2 and F3)
following F0 exposure to biosolids treated pasture; (2) to assess changes in reproductive potential of male and
female offspring across three generations (i.e. F1, F2 and F3) following F0 exposure to biosolids pasture; (3) to
determine epigenetic changes, and their functional relationships, to transcriptional networks governing
transgenerational effects of maternal biosolids exposure on offspring metabolism and fertility. This
comprehensive analysis will provide proof-of-concept data on the effects of real-life chemical exposure in a
relevant experimental paradigm. This will significantly enhance our ability to predict and inform policy
development with the aim of ameliorating detrimental effects of environmental-chemical exposure and to improve
metabolic and reproductive health."
10744309,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuft cells are a specialized epithelial cells (EpCs) that initiate airway type 2 inflammation (T2I) through their
generation of IL-25 and pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). We previously
reported that airway tuft cells are indirectly activated by common aeroallergens through damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), including the release of ATP and the activation of P2Y2 on tuft cells. Because tuft
cells recognize tissue damage, and are detected in settings of airway injury in mouse and humans, we and
others have speculated that they may have a role in lung repair, but thus far no such function has been
demonstrated and the mechanism(s) by which tuft cells develop in the distal airways are unknown.
 Our preliminary data demonstrate an important feed forward loop by which tuft cells promote airway
remodeling. We find that, in the setting of established inflammation, murine tracheal tuft cells generate CysLTs,
activate several airway epithelial progenitor populations that express the leukotriene E4 receptor OXGR1, and
drive aberrant airway remodeling. Importantly, we find that elements of the tuft cell and regenerative pathways
seen in the murine trachea, are also expressed in allergen-challenged murine lung, and in the sinonasal
mucosa of patients with the chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). This grant aims to define
tuft cell and CysLT influence on wound repair in these settings, and to define the functional sequelae. To
examine this, Aim 1 and 2 will use two murine models of tracheal and lung T2I. Several fate-labelled reporter
mice will be tracked and crossed to null strains. Bulk and scRNA-seq will be used to define the altered
molecular pathways in regenerating epithelium and several functional assays will be tested. Aim 3 will assess
airway repair in patients with CRSwNP using scRNA-seq, spatial multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization,
and ex vivo analysis. The resulting information will allow us to understand immune epithelial cross talk in the
human airway and the role of CysLTs and OXGR1 in driving remodeling."
10756926,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) infect >90% of the population and cause >30,000 cervical, anogenital, and
oropharyngeal cancers annually. HPV vaccines have been available in the US since 2006 but only 54% of 11-
12 years-olds are vaccinated - well below national goals of 80%. As the title of the PAR to which this applica-
tion responds suggests (PAR-19-360), “Linking the Provider Recommendation to Adolescent HPV Vaccine Up-
take” is a key strategy for increasing adolescent HPV vaccination. Many studies show that a primary driver of
low adolescent HPV vaccination is a poor quality HPV vaccine recommendation from providers. While many
interventions to address this have been developed, few have been found in rigorous trials to increase vaccina-
tion and also be feasible to implement in busy clinical settings. An exception is the Physician Communication,
or PCOM, intervention developed by our group. PCOM focuses on teaching providers to use a 2-step verbal
communication process for their recommendation:1) start the vaccine discussion using a “presumptive” format
(i.e. “Let's get the HPV vaccine done today”) and 2) use motivational interviewing (MI) techniques to address
parental vaccine hesitancy, if needed. In a large, cluster-randomized trial, PCOM increased adolescent HPV
vaccine initiation rates among 11-12 year olds by 8 percentage points (PP) more than controls– a relatively
large effect size for a vaccination intervention. Limiting broad dissemination of PCOM is the significant level of
research team facilitation needed to teach practices how to use the PCOM components. To address this, we
propose to develop a “Virtual” version of the PCOM intervention (“PCOM-Virtual”) and test it for non-inferiority
to the original PCOM intervention (“PCOM-Standard”) for increasing adolescent HPV vaccination. By using
Dissemination & Implementation (D&I) science principles throughout the process and collecting information on
how contextual practice, provider and patient factors influence PCOM use, we anticipate creating a “shelf
ready” version of PCOM with an associated “User Manual” to foster dissemination. Our Aims are to:
 1. Develop the “PCOM-Virtual” intervention using principles of D&I Science from existing prototypes.
 2. Compare the efficacy of “PCOM-Virtual” vs. “PCOM-Standard” in improving adolescent HPV vac-
 cine utilization. A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial will be conducted in 30 primary care practices in
 Kansas – a locale with some of the lowest adolescent HPV vaccination rates nationally.
 3. Examine whether practice, patient and provider characteristics are associated with variability in
 the efficacy of PCOM-Virtual and PCOM-Standard. Mixed methods and the PRISM framework will facili-
 tate understanding how context influences the interventions' implementation to inform a User Manual.
By creating an easily implementable version of the PCOM intervention, and disseminating it widely we believe
we can have a substantial impact on adolescent HPV vaccination levels."

 The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which bitter tastants
are detected and encoded. The experimental plan takes advantage of the fruit fly Drosophila as
a model system, which allows molecular genetic analysis of taste genes and incisive
electrophysiological analysis of taste function.
 The proposal takes advantage of a major advance in electrophysiology. Previous
electrophysiological analysis of insect taste via ""tip recording"" was limited to the period during
which taste neurons are in contact with a tastant. Technical innovation has now made it
convenient to record the activity of taste neurons before, during, and after stimulation. It is now
possible to analyze features of taste coding that have not been examined before.
 The first aim will determine the spontaneous firing frequency of taste neurons, and the
molecular determinants of the frequency. It will examine whether inhibition of bitter taste
neurons by bitter tastants occurs widely and represents a new degree of freedom for taste
coding.
 The second aim proposes a precise and quantitative physiological analysis of OFF
responses, which could not be observed with conventional electrophysiological analysis. The
prevalence of these responses will be determined systematically. The study will test the
hypothesis that the magnitude and dynamics of OFF responses carry information about the
identity and intensity of taste stimuli. This aim should also provide information about the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying OFF responses. Together this analysis should provide
insight into a long-overlooked feature of taste coding.
 The third aim will define another remarkably understudied feature of taste coding: the
inhibition of bitter neurons by sugars. It will quantify the inhibition of both spontaneous activity
and OFF responses. The analysis will determine whether the inhibition depends on the quality
and quantity of the sugar stimulus. The aim is also designed to provide insight into the
mechanism of inhibition.
 Diseases carried by insects afflict hundreds of millions of people each year. These
insects detect their human hosts largely through their chemosensory systems. Advances in
understanding these chemosensory systems may lead to new means of manipulating them and
of thereby controlling these insect vectors of human disease."

 Disruption of protein homeostasis causes cardiomyocyte (CM) dysfunction and death, and is increasingly
recognized to play a causal role in human cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins
modify diverse protein substrates and expand the functional diversity of the proteome. An extensive body of work
has suggested the exciting potential of targeting these protein modifiers to combat cardiac disease. However,
the functional role of NEDD8, a novel Ub-like protein, remains poorly understood in the heart. Neddylation
covalently attaches NEDD8 to target proteins via NEDD8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes. Over the previous funding
cycle, we discovered that neddylation is dysregulated in the failing hearts of patients and animal models of
cardiac diseases. We further demonstrated that a balance between neddylation and deneddylation is essential
to cardiac homeostasis, as evidenced by the fact that perturbation of deneddylation precipitated the heart to
cardiomyopathy and heart failure, whereas blockade of neddylation in the developing heart caused ventricular
noncompaction and perinatal lethality. Although it is becoming apparent that neddylation is essential for organ
development, its functional importance in fully differentiated, postmitotic tissues is not clear. This grant addresses
a novel linkage between neddylation and mitochondrial integrity in adult CMs. Pharmacological inhibition of
neddylation promoted mitochondrial fusion, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and impaired
mitochondrial respiration in neonatal CMs. Deletion of NAE1 (a regulatory subunit of the NEDD8 E1 enzyme) in
adult CMs also resulted in mitochondrial elongation and impaired mitochondrial quality. Mechanistically,
neddylation modifies various cellular proteins to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Conditional
knockout (KO) of NAE1 in adult mouse hearts resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and ultimately
premature death. In clinical trials, administration of the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 to cancer patients elicited
severe cardiotoxicity. These compelling published and preliminary data form the basis of our central hypothesis
that neddylation is required for normal heart function through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and
mitophagy. Using the newly generated inducible NAE1KO mice and MLN4924, Aim 1 will establish the
significance of neddylation in the adult healthy and failing heart and determine the impact of neddylation on
mitochondrial function. Aim 2 will dissect the molecular basis by which neddylation controls mitochondrial
dynamics and will test if normalization of mitochondrial morphology benefits the NAE1KO heart. Aim 3 will
elucidate novel Parkin-independent mechanisms by which neddylation regulates mitophagy and test whether
restoration of neddylation attenuates cardiac dysfunction in NAE1KO mice. This study will be the first to establish
an unappreciated role for neddylation in regulating mitochondrial fitness and function in adult CMs. Moreover, it
will provide novel insight into the potential cardiotoxicity of neddylation inhibitors that are currently being applied
in cancer therapy, thus advancing the field of cardio-oncology."

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most mutagenic and cytotoxic insults to the genome. DSBs are
repaired through homology directed recombination (HDR), which is predominant in S and G2 phases, and also
by error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is active in all cell cycle phases. In cancer cells,
heightened activity of these repair pathways has been linked to radioresistance. The transcriptional repressor
ZEB1 is a well-established driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both normal
development and tumor progression. Recent studies suggest that ZEB1 plays new roles in the regulation of the
DNA damage response (DDR), via enhancing the stability of the checkpoint kinase CHK1, and in regulating the
repair of DSBs through the transcriptional silencing of polymerase theta, a major driver of microhomology-
mediated alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ). We have discovered that ZEB1 is rapidly recruited to DSBs induced
selectively in euchromatic genomic regions in a DNA-PK-dependent manner, and is essential for the
recruitment 53BP1 to these sites. The recruitment of ZEB1 to these break sites was associated with local
chromatin modifications permissive for NHEJ repair. Consequently, depletion or deletion of ZEB1 suppressed
canonical NHEJ in cell-based DSB repair assays, and significantly increased both DSB-associated hyper-
resection and HDR, This correlated with ATM-independent increases in chromosomal aberrations and
enhanced sensitivity to IR. On the other hand, loss of ZEB1 was associated with decreased sensitivity of
BRCA-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), indicative of restoration of HDR in these cell population,
presumably through inhibiting 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs and stimulation of hyper-resection. Importantly, we
found that ZEB1-dependent recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB is significantly amplified in hypoxia. Based on these
novel observations, we hypothesize that ZEB1 promotes DSB repair via both direct and indirect mechanisms
and this is critical for promoting therapeutic resistance to IR and for conferring sensitivity of BRCA-deficient
cells to PARPi; on one hand, ZEB1 directly promotes c-NHEJ through the recruitment of the anti-resection and
c-NHEJ repair protein 53BP1 to euchromatin-bound DSBs. On the other hand, ZEB1 facilitates the repair of
DSBs through augmenting the DDR and through indirectly enhancing c-NHEJ repair through its chromatin-
modifying as well as transcriptional silencing activity. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on understanding the
mechanism(s) by which ZEB1 regulates DSB repair. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of ZEB1 on the
therapeutic response of breast cancer to IR and PARP inhibitors in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and in
xenograft mouse models of breast cancer. In Aim 3, we will determine how ZEB1 modulates the therapeutic
response of hypoxic breast tumors to IR and PARPi. Understanding how the ZEB1/53BP1 axis regulates DSB
repair in normoxia and hypoxia will allow us to exploit this axis as a biomarker to predict IR/PARPi sensitivity
and well as to target the axis to decrease therapeutic resistance."

the VVC also maintains a plasmid archive of all viral vectors that have been submitted to the Shared Resource.
The plasmid library of packaging plasmids and transfer plasmids for our stock vectors is available at no cost to
SCC investigators as a resource for cloning purposes or for packaging viral vector constructs in their own. The
VVC is used by 35% of SCC members (11) who are responsible for 62% of all Salk utilization based on

 B cell tolerance is key to the development of an immune system tolerant to self, but the mechanisms that
enforce this process are not yet clearly understood. The overarching goal of our studies is to elucidate the
molecular pathways that regulate B cell selection at the developmental checkpoint between the immature and
transitional cell stages, enforcing the process of tolerance in autoreactive bone marrow B cells while promoting
the differentiation of nonautoreactive cells and their bone marrow exit. By studying Ig knock-in mouse models
of central B cell tolerance we documented that the RAS, ERK, and PI3K signaling molecules, which are
GTPases, MAP kinases, and lipid kinases respectively, are active to a higher basal level in nonautoreactive
than autoreactive immature B cells. Our studies have found that while both ERK and PI3K are necessary for
the in vitro differentiation of immature B cells into transitional B cells, only the in vivo activation of PI3K in B
cells, but not that of ERK 1) abrogates central B cell tolerance, including receptor editing and clonal deletion, 2)
supports the exit of autoreactive B cells from the bone marrow, and 3) promotes their further maturation and
activation. Taken together, these findings establish that the PI3K pathway can override central and early
peripheral tolerance in mouse autoreactive B cells, even when these cells possess high avidity for the self-
antigen. The goal of this grant is to define the mechanisms by which PI3K controls this central checkpoint of B
cell selection in mice and whether it similarly functions in human B cells. Experiments described in Aims 1 and
2 will utilize mouse models of tolerance to investigate whether and how FOXO1, CXCR4, and ERK translate
PI3K function in immature B cells. RNAseq analyses of nonautoreactive B cells and of autoreactive B cells that
either break or make tolerance will aid the discovery of additional PI3K mediators in this process. Patients with
gain-of-function mutations in PI3K have been recently discovered, and they often exhibit autoantibodies and
other autoimmune manifestations. Experiments in Aim 3 will utilize two complementary and novel approaches
to determine the ability of gain-of-function mutations in PI3K to break central tolerance in human B cells.
Overall, these studies are significant because they will generate a deeper mechanistic understanding of how
the primary B cell repertoire is formed and how B cell tolerance can be breached during the development of
autoreactive B cells, raising the autoreactive capacity of the primary B cell repertoire and, consequently, the
risk for autoimmunity."

 Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It affects more than 360 million people
worldwide and broadly impacts their quality of life. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a
large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.
 During the prior granting period (12/01/16-11/20/21), we focused on three specific aims: 1) To optimize
phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss by implementing hierarchical surface
clustering and audioprofile surface analysis in AudioGene; 2) To explore physics-based protein modeling as a
tool within the Deafness Variation Database; and 3) To determine whether genetic modifiers of specific
deafness-causing genes can be predicted by hierarchical surface clustering
 In this competitive renewal, our overarching goals are to further improve the clinical care of persons with
hearing loss and to provide a more robust foundation for gene-specific precision medicine for this population.
We will achieve these goals by addressing current knowledge gaps as reflected in the following specific aims:
  Specific Aim 1. To complete gene-specific natural history studies (NHS) of non-syndromic forms of
 hearing loss by integrating phenotypic and genotypic data using AudioGene and OtoSCOPE
 Hypothesis: The natural history of non-syndromic hearing loss is gene specific and can be defined by
 integrating the hearing loss phenotype (phenome) with the associated genotype (genome) for the
 various types of non-syndromic hearing loss.
  Specific Aim 2. To refine ACMG guidelines for hearing loss by making them gene specific and by
 implementing a combination of deep learning and physics-based protein modeling to improve
 variant classification
 Hypothesis: While general guidelines exist for variant classification, guidelines that are disease-
 specific and even within a disease, gene specific, will facilitate variant annotation. In particular,
 variant calling for missense variants can be refined by applying deep learning and physics-based
 modeling to predict free-energy changes associated with missense variants.
  Specific Aim 3. To identify genetic modifiers of select types of non-syndromic hearing loss
 Hypothesis: The presence of genetic modifiers is supported by gene-specific differences in ethnically-
 based population studies and can be validated using murine models of hearing loss.
 The successful completion of these specific aims will refine our understanding of the biology of hearing
and deafness, improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss, provide a strong foundation for gene-
based precision medicine for the hearing impaired, facilitate the design of clinical trials to test novel therapies
to treat gene-specific types of hearing loss, and potentially identify new targets for gene therapy for deafness."

Pre-erythrocytic (PE) malaria vaccines that completely prevent infection in malaria non-endemic regions have
often failed to achieve equally high-level protection when tested in endemic regions. Data from animal models
and humans has identified certain factors that may be contributing to this difference. Active or previous
Plasmodium infections rank highly amongst these factors because infection is known to significantly impact
innate and adaptive immune responses to malaria vaccines. We hypothesize that previous malaria exposure is
a key driver of the suboptimal immunity observed in clinical trials of PE vaccines in endemic areas. However, a
full assessment of how such conditions affect pre-erythrocytic immune responses is lacking in large part
because much of the protective immune repertoire against PE malaria exists as tissue resident memory T cells
in the liver, which is inaccessible in human clinical trials. Here, we propose to address this question of malaria
vaccine hyporesponsiveness in endemic regions by performing vaccine studies in previously-infected versus
naïve non-human primates (NHP) where we can study the tissue-specific response down to the single cell
level and integrate these with data from peripheral blood samples from similarly-vaccinated human clinical trial
participants in endemic and non-endemic regions. Our exhaustive studies in NHPs will be specifically guided
by hypotheses derived directly from human data. The emerging high-density data will then be used to identify
mechanisms, build models and formulate concrete hypotheses that can then be validated across a number of
clinical trial samples with the overall goal of elucidating patterns or biomarkers that map with protection/lack of
protection and immunogenicity/lack of immunogenicity in malaria-naïve and -experienced volunteers. Thus, we
aim to: 1) define protective liver-resident PE immunity at the single cell level; 2) identify the mechanisms by
which previous malaria exposure impacts baseline and innate immunity; 3) build models of the complex
interplay between baseline, innate, and adaptive immunity and; 4) use these to identify strategies to overcome
hyporesponsiveness to PE vaccines in endemic areas. This U01 project combines an inter-institutional, inter-
disciplinary team of basic, translational, and clinical scientists from within and outside malaria whose unique
expertise, resources, and collaborative style will create breakthroughs insights about this highly complex yet
critically important vaccine challenge."

Approximately 30% of people with epilepsy are refractory to current anti-seizure medications and sudden
unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) occurs in ~1:150 per year for individuals with severe refractory generalized
convulsive seizures (GCS). The long-term goals of our research program are to identify novel molecular targets
with disease-modifying effects that may increase longevity in those susceptible to SUDEP. Evidence from the multi-
center MORTEMUS study on SUDEP indicates that patients experienced a series of events promoting hypoxic
and hypercapnic (HH) fluctuations in blood gases, from which they were unable to autoresuscitate and succumbed
to terminal apnea. However, the relationship between SUDEP risk and the efficacy of the autoresuscitation
response is unknown. The objective of the proposed project is to elucidate mechanisms of autoresuscitation failure
in relation to SUDEP risk. The central hypothesis is that alterations in the network of chemosensitive
cardiorespiratory neurons increases the probability of autoresuscitation failure and SUDEP risk. Our rationale is
that SUDEP is often associated with a preceding GCS, but demise has also been associated with prone positions
with no evidence of seizure. A variable or decline in autoresuscitation efficacy may explain succumbing to one
GCS and not previous seizures or failing to arouse in situations of changing air supply. Our specific aims will test
the hypotheses that maladaptive modulatory control of key central autoresuscitation centers disintegrates the
network chemoresponse, causing deterioration of the response and the autoresuscitation response to fail. Upon
conclusion, we will have delineated mechanisms underlying autoresuscitation failure in the context of epilepsy in a
clinically relevant animal model of SUDEP. This information will offer new research avenues for understanding
SUDEP, assessing risk and identifying therapeutic opportunities."

We hypothesize that oral microbiota influence squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC) development,
potentially related to carcinogen metabolism. The human oral cavity hosts a diverse microbiota, including
bacteria and fungi. In the previous R01 cycle, we made the novel discovery that oral bacteria are associated
with SCHNC. In this competitive R01 renewal application, we focus on oral fungi (the mycobiome). Oral fungi
activate carcinogens and promote inflammation and oral carcinogenesis. Fungi are commonly isolated from oral
cancers and pre-cancers. Furthermore, patients with fungal Candida clinical infection have increased risk for
SCHNC. Despite this evidence, there is limited knowledge about the direct relationship of oral fungi with
development of SCHNC in the general population.
Our ultimate goal is to identify microbial determinants of SCHNC which may lead to novel microbially-based
approaches for SCHNC prevention. Our specific aims are 1) to test if oral fungi influence the development of
SCHNC, 2) to test if oral fungi and bacteria jointly influence the development of this disease and 3) to determine
whether oral fungi and bacteria contribute to oral microbial functional pathways for carcinogen metabolism. The
study includes 339 incident SCHNC cases and 339 nested controls in the NCI-PLCO, ACS-Cancer Prevention
Study-II and the Southern Community Cohort Study.
More than 468,000 SCHNC cases and 323,000 related deaths occur annually worldwide. Knowledge gained
from this study will increase our understanding of the etiology of SCHNC. The study will serve to identify high-
risk subjects, based on oral microbial status. Pre-diagnostic microbiota found in this prospective study may lead
to new microbial approaches for personalized prevention of this disease."

All stages of neoplastic disease, from its development to metastasis, are intertwined with cancer immune
evasion. The epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of the tumor immune landscape are intensely
investigated as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) dictate the post-
transcriptional mRNA fate and are often targeted by regulatory molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and
RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Tumor cells have been shown to evade this tight regulation by mutating or
truncating these regions. The first such identified events have shed light on somatic regulatory mechanisms that
could potentially affect tumor immune evasion, response to immunotherapy, and patient management. However,
the transcriptome-wide detection, validation, and functional characterization of 3'UTR somatic events and their
effects on the tumor immune landscape are still pressing -yet unmet- needs.
In this project we will deploy an in silico/experimental framework that combines massively parallel variant
validation, spatial transcriptomics, and bioinformatic detection/functionalization technologies to characterize
Pan-Cancer and transcriptome-wide 3'UTR somatic mutation/truncation events, as well as to assess their
potential as immunoediting mechanisms, markers for patient stratification, and novel therapeutic targets.
Aim 1: By efficiently integrating raw multi-omic datasets, we will identify somatic 3'UTR mutations and truncations
in more than 10,000 cancer patients across 33 cancer types. We will prioritize all 3'UTR variants affecting gene
expression in cis, delineating the 3'UTR-mediated regulatory landscape across cancer types. Aim 2: We will
identify mutations and disrupted circuitry affecting cancer immunophenotypes and the tumor microenvironment.
We will utilize extensive post-transcriptional data/experimental resources to uncover the regulators (miRNAs,
RBPs) and mechanisms involved in such immunoediting events. Aim 3a: We will validate up to 20,000 somatic
3'UTR events using a massively parallel sequencing technology. Prioritized interactions will be investigated in
vitro as well as using a biomimetic 3D device to characterize their effects on gene regulation and T-Cell killing,
while patient samples will be investigated using spatial transcriptomics. Aim 3b) We will assess the translational
potential of the leading 3'UTR events and genes as predictors of immunotherapy response using Deep Learning
models, against an extensive cohort of >300 cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibition.
We are uniquely suited to perform this in-depth characterization, since our research team comprises leading
post transcriptional regulation and immune-oncology researchers, while the relevant resources (in silico,
experimental, samples) are already in place. We will perform the first Pan-Cancer and transcriptome-wide
investigation of tumor immune evasion by 3'UTR somatic mutations and truncations. We will use an innovative
in silico-experimental framework to identify 3'UTR events, miRNAs, and RBPs that can be used as markers for
efficient patient stratification as well as novel immunotherapeutic targets."

based precision medicine (SPM) research at the Tulane Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Sex-
Based Precision Medicine (COBRE in SPM) and assist Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project
Leaders (PPLs) in obtaining independent research funding. The study of sex and gender differences is a
discipline in itself, with its own concepts and methods that apply across cells and tissues as well as clinical and
population health. This critical aspect of SPM requires the use and knowledge of quantitative methods including
biostatistics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics to design and analyze studies to assess the interactions of sex

stresses, access to healthcare). With David Crosslin, PhD, Associate Professor in the Division of Biomedical
Informatics and Genomics in the John W. Deming Department of Medicine, Tulane University School of Medicine
as Director of the SPMRC, the SPMRC will support and foster these activities through the following aims:
Aim 1: Discovery: To provide SPM RPLs, PPLs, Tulane University investigators, and collaborators with
the methodological resources to conduct SPM basic and clinical science studies.
Aim 2: Implementation: To provide RPLs, PPLs, Tulane University investigators, and collaborators with
the methodological resources to conduct state-of-the-art SPM implementation trials and studies.
Aim 3: Dissemination: To engage the scientific community in the ongoing adoption, use, and
improvement of the SPMRC.
The aims proposed will place the SPMRC at the forefront of SPM. The SPMRC will complement but not duplicate
existing resources at Tulane, including the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center
Statistical Core, the Tulane Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health (BIRCWH) Women’s
Health Resource Laboratory, and the Tulane Center for Bioinformatics & Genomics. In addition to tracking
consultations for evaluation of impact, researchers utilizing SPMRC resources will be asked to cite a DOI and
grant number, which will track usage within publications. We will report on all publications, presentations, grants,

10773120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although widely used and accepted in oncology practice to determine patient eligibility and physical tolerance
for clinical trial participation, performance status—the single most powerful prognostic and key clinical
decision-making tool across all solid tumor types—has one very significant limitation: its subjectivity. Because
of the association with survival, performance status scores are routinely assigned by the clinician as a
prediction of survival (prognostication). These subjectively determined scores are also used to evaluate fitness
capability for treatment, as a stratification and selection factor for clinical trial eligibility, to assess ability to
continue treatment on a clinical trial protocol, as a global indicator of quality of life, and to evaluate eligibility
and allocation of healthcare funds for hospice and home care services. We propose to examine the association
between continuously and objectively measured physical activity (PA) and clinician-assessed performance
status scores, overall patient survival, and clinical outcomes of significance (i.e., symptom burden, quality of
life measures, death, disease progression, treatment termination due to toxicity, hospitalizations and
emergency room visits, and referral for supportive/hospice care). This project will harness the technological
capacity of a system (CYCORE) that links home-based monitoring sensors to a cyber-infrastructure and can
send data in real time to the patient's healthcare team. To determine if objectively assessed PA levels are
associated with health care provider-assessed performance status scores and overall survival, we will recruit
75 patients for each of four performance status groups (levels 0-3). They will provide PA-related data for 7
days by wearing two PA devices—one commercially available and the second research-grade. We will
correlate those data with physician-assessed performance status scores and survival outcomes. To evaluate
the feasibility of long-term and continuous PA monitoring and the associations with clinical outcomes in
advanced cancer patients, we will recruit 100 patients who, for 6 months, will wear a commercially available PA
device and will provide PA- and self-reported data from their personal smartphone. We will correlate those data
to multiple clinical outcomes. Our long-term goal is to eliminate the subjectivity in performance status
assessments."
10773121,"SUMMARY:
The ability to inhibit drinking is a significant challenge for recovering alcoholics, especially in the presence of alcohol-
associated cues. Repeated alcohol exposure induces neuroadaptations that persist beyond acute withdrawal, and which
increase alcohol’s incentive salience, leading to escalation of alcohol intake and aversion-resistant alcohol seeking. Alcohol
use also causes deficits in cognitive functions associated with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which further fuel
compulsive drinking and relapse. In rodents, alcohol seeking activates specialized networks within the ventral (infralimbic,
IL) and prelimbic (PL) regions of the mPFC, which play largely opposite roles in the control of relapse behavior. While
activation of the PL drives reinstatement, neurons in the IL facilitate extinction learning and inhibit drug-seeking through
their projections to the Nucleus Accumbens shell, as well as the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the synaptic
mechanisms that drive maladaptive plasticity in these circuits during the transition from controlled to compulsive alcohol-
seeking remain largely unclear. The experiments in this application will provide a better understanding of network-specific
mechanisms through which chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal affect executive cognitive functions of the mPFC and
diminish inhibitory control over goal-directed behavior.
In Aim 1 we use patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation to determine changes in long-range
glutamatergic inputs from the BLA onto identified projection neurons in the IL and PL following extended access to alcohol,
as well as under postdependent conditions. We will use Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP2) with Fos2A-
iCreER mice to express channelrhodopsin selectively in those BLA afferents to the mPFC that are activated during withdrawal,
and we will determine how alterations in these inputs develop over time (from goal-directed to compulsive alcohol-
seeking). We will perform voltage-clamp recordings from retrogradely-labeled neurons that project back to the BLA, and
we will determine alcohol-induced changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptor function and presynaptic release following
reinstatement. Experiments in Aim 2 will use combinational retrograde Cre delivery and a Cre-dependent reporter to label
the same IL and PL projection neurons for high-resolution morphometric analyses of spines and glutamate receptor
expression in order to compare changes specifically in those neurons that contribute to relapse behavior (visualized via
co-labeling for the activity marker phospho-CREB) and those that do not (pCREB-negative cells). In Aim 3 we will again
use TRAP2 mice to test whether optogenetic manipulations of specific ensembles in the mPFC, or of inputs from the BLA
to the mPFC (each again TRAPed during withdrawal) can reverse alcohol-induced cognitive deficits and reduce drug-
seeking.
Taken together, these studies will provide important novel information about alcohol-induced synaptic changes in
networks of the IL that contribute to cognitive flexibility and cue-induced reinstatement."
10773125,"The human malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax is geographically the most widespread of all
the Plasmodium species. P. vivax is a major cause of morbidity in endemic regions of Asia, Oceania,
Central and South America, as well as the horn of Africa. In these regions, P. vivax infections in pregnant
women significantly contribute to early pregnancy loss, reduced birth weight and infant mortality. Notably, P.
vivax is a major concern in an arena of malaria eradication due to its unique biology. Specifically, P. vivax
sporozoite infectivity of hepatocytes does not always lead to the onset of schizogony and transition to blood
stage disease, as is the case for P. falciparum. Rather, a sporozoite can enter a host hepatocyte,
dedifferentiate and then lie dormant within the host hepatocyte for weeks, months or even years, before
reactivating. This dormant or latent liver stage form is known as the hypnozoite and in continued efforts
towards malaria elimination and eradication, the hypnozoite is a formidable foe. Indeed, the endemicity of P.
vivax throughout tropical as well as temperate climate zones is attributed to the parasite’s ability to form
hypnozoites, which after reactivating, case relapses of blood stage infection and concomitant transmission.
Antimalarial drugs almost exclusively target the symptomatic blood stage of the life cycle and do not target
the hypnozoite and thus treatment of P. vivax blood stage infections with standard drug regimens allows for
further relapses and will not aid in disease eradication.
 Historically, the only approved drug active against P. vivax hypnozoites was primaquine although an
improved 8-aminoquinoline drug, tafenoquine, has recently received approval for the treatment of relapsing
malaria. Unfortunately, primaquine’s short half-life, long dosage regimen and incompatibility with glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, prevent its use for mass elimination campaigns. Thus, there is a
need for novel interventions that will negatively affect hypnozoite formation, survival and relapse. Thus, the
research in this proposal aims to shed biological insight on the hypnozoite. This application aims to address
three critical biological questions pertaining to P. vivax hypnozoite biology and answering these questions
should aid in the discovery of novel interventions to prevent hypnozoite relapse and the continued spread of
P. vivax disease.
 Specifically, are there intrinsic factors that are pre-programmed in the P. vivax sporozoite that
determine its fate once it reaches the liver to become either a replicating schizont or a dormant hypnozoite?
How does the dormant hypnozoite manipulate its host cell in order to maintain its long-term residency? Can
we develop a model of hypnozoite relapse in order to gain insight into the triggers that promote hypnozoite
reactivation? Using a human-liver chimeric mouse model alongside innovative methods of single cell
isolation and transcriptional profiling, we hope to being to address these challenges."

There are currently no disease modifying therapies for AD but many disease-relevant pathways remain under-
explored. This proposal seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms relating tau and TDP-43 pathology in
the context of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by combining human neuropathology and gene expression
data with biological validation in a C. elegans model of proteotoxicity. Under the mentorship of Drs. Brain
Kraemer and Dirk Keene, this training and research plan will build on Dr. Latimer’s expertise in neuropathology
and prepare her for a career studying the proteotoxic pathways relevant to AD using C. elegans as a model
system. C. elegans represent an ideal system for investigating mechanisms of human disease given their ease
of transgenic modification, short life cycle, and recapitulation of the progressive neurodegeneration that is
characteristic of human proteinopathies. The five-year training plan includes research mentored by an
established team of experts and instruction in C. elegans research techniques, classification of TDP-43
proteinopathy, implementation of quantitative algorithms for immunohistochemistry in human tissue, and
analysis and interpretation of RNA-Seq data. This training will provide Dr. Latimer with the interdisciplinary
skills and knowledge necessary to achieve her long-term career goal to succeed as an independent physician
scientist with the expertise to advance the field of AD pathophysiology using C. elegans models of
proteotoxicity to link human pathology with the underlying mechanisms.
Data from human cohorts suggest a role for TDP-43 in the clinical expression of AD neuropathologic change.
This proposal will address the hypotheses that tau and TDP-43 synergize to drive neurodegeneration and that
targeting both toxic proteins may have stronger protective effects than targeting either alone. The project builds
on Dr. Latimer’s previous work with Drs. Kraemer and Liachko demonstrating the synergism between tau and
TDP-43 in a C. elegans model of combined proteotoxicity, and autopsy data in the Adult Changes in Thought
(ACT) study, a unique, longitudinal community-based cohort of older adults recruited from the Seattle area, in
which TDP-43 pathology is associated with dementia and increased pathologic tau. Dr. Latimer will test known
genetic modifiers of tau or TDP-43 neurotoxicity in the tau/TDP-43 C. elegans model (Aim 1) and determine
whether TDP-43 and tau pathology correlate in human brain tissue, leveraging data from the ACT autopsy
cohort (Aim 2). She will then use neuropathology data to select cases for RNA-Seq analysis in the ACT cohort
to identify novel modifiers of tau and TDP-43 proteotoxicity that can be biologically validated in the tau/TDP-43
C. elegans model (Aim 3). Completion of the aims will set the stage for future independent funding using
human genetic and neuropathologic data coupled with C. elegans models and lay the foundation for a new
generation of AD therapeutics that can be further evaluated in other cohorts and model systems."

We propose the clinical translation and validation of an innovative “radiofrequency (RF) penetrable”
dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) insert technology that can be placed within any stand-
alone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system for acquiring simultaneous PET/MRI data. For this
proposal the Stanford team will work with industry partner “PETcoil” to address technical developments
required for translational studies, ensure industry level standardization of end user software and
technology, and acquire first in-patient simultaneous PET/MRI data using this novel PET insert. PET/MRI
exhibits some attractive features. First, combined PET/MRI is uniquely capable of providing excellent
anatomical soft tissue contrast and multi-parameter information in a single a scan and, as a result,
PET/MR is now commonly used for characterizing disease in regions such as the brain, head and neck,
breast, liver and pelvis. Second, MRI does not introduce ionization radiation in a PET/MR study. This
significant reduction of radiation dose makes PET/MRI an attractive modality for pediatric patients and
those requiring recurring PET studies. Third, PET/MR imaging can occur simultaneously, unlike
sequential PET/CT, resulting in temporal in addition to spatial correlation of PET with MR data. Despite
these attractive features, the adoption of PET/MRI has been slow since its introduction in 2011. One main
reason for this slow adoption is the high cost of procuring an integrated PET/MRI system, which is about
$5M for the machine and another $1.5–2M for required room renovations to host the machine. The
resulting cost (~$6-7M) is simply not affordable for most institutions. Furthermore, the permanently
integrated PET/MR system designs offered by vendors such as GE and Siemens yield sub-optimal spatial
resolution and sensitivity performance for the PET system component, especially for neurological imaging
applications. The proposed brain-dedicated PET ring offers higher photon sensitivity and spatial
resolution, and can be inserted into any existing MR system; thus a user only needs to procure the insert,
and MR system modifications or room renovations are not required, reducing the entry costs roughly 10-
fold. We have realized a 1st generation brain dedicated PET insert for simultaneous PET/MR and are
completing a 2nd generation version, both with a spatial resolution of 2.7x2.7x2.7 mm3 and the latter
achieving a photon sensitivity of >6%. In addition, this insert approach is “RF penetrable,” an important
and novel concept enabling collection of PET/MR data using the MR system’s built-in body coil for RF
transmission through the PET ring insert into the patient, and only a RF receiver coil resides inside the
insert, thus facilitating the lower cost insert concept for achieving PET/MR. We will translate and validate
the 2nd generation brain PET insert and work with our industry partner to standardize our data processing
workflow. If successful, this project will enable more widespread dissemination/accessibility of PET/MRI."
10746786,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
 There is a great need for new treatments for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD affects over 1% of
US adults, leading to disability, hospitalization, and surgery. IBD is characterized by damage to the “lining” of
the intestine, also known as the intestinal epithelium. Intestinal epithelial damage leads to inflammation,
bleeding, and an increased risk of colon cancer. Since a damaged intestinal epithelium is the defining feature
of IBD, we want to understand what genes preserve intestinal epithelial integrity in order to better treat IBD.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked hundreds of genes with small individual effects to IBD,
but it is unclear how these genes cooperate to increase susceptibility to intestinal injury and inflammation.
 We have a mouse model to study the role of two IBD-associated genes, A20 and ABIN-1, in intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs). We were the first to show that A20 and ABIN-1 work together to maintain a healthy
intestinal epithelium by preventing IEC injury. We grew intestinal organoids from the intestines of these mice.
Intestinal organoids are miniature replicas of the intestinal epithelium grown in a dish in the lab. Using this
system, we discovered that IECs lacking A20 and ABIN-1 are exquisitely sensitive to cell death from tumor
necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is one of the primary death signals in the intestine, and antibodies against TNF are
commonly used to treat IBD. We have dramatic evidence that A20 and ABIN-1 cooperate to preserve intestinal
well-being, but we still need to understand the specific ways in which they preserve IEC health. We will use the
mouse model and our organoids to determine which inflammatory cells injure IECs in the absence of TNF. We
have evidence that inflammatory cells secrete a factor or factors other than TNF that kill A20 & ABIN-1
deficient IECs. This could be a very important clue as to why some patients with IBD do not respond to anti-
TNF neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, A20 and ABIN-1 might cause epithelial injury by altering how
intestinal stem cells “differentiate” or mature into other IEC subsets. Two subsets of particular interest are
paneth cells and goblet cells, but there are many other subsets that we will study using our unique system.
 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we will also grow intestinal organoids from IBD and non-IBD
patients and test susceptibility to cell death. Using the organoids, we can attempt to rescue cell death with
small molecules and drugs that are currently in clinical trials. We will analyze IEC subsets in the organoids, and
see how TNF and other stimuli perturb IEC subsets. Lastly, we will work on “editing” human organoids with a
technique called CRISPR/Cas9, to improve our ability to study other genes in IBD. The long-term goal of these
studies is to identify approaches of treating IBD that protect epithelial cells from injury, rather than simply
suppressing the immune system."
10746787,"Atherosclerosis pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving hyperlipidemia and inflammation, as well as hyperglycemia. Individuals with type 1 diabetes show a four-fold increase in cardiovascular disease risk that has persisted despite the spectacular advances in drugs for risk factor management and insulin therapy4. Thus, new strategies and approaches are necessary. Because insulin is administered to diabetic patients subcutaneously, rather than into the portal vein, which is physiological, the liver remains relatively under-insulinized. We considered the possibility that this could contribute to the pro-atherogenic milieu, even beyond hyperglycemia. The long-term goal of this project is to develop drugs that mimic key atheroprotective effects of insulin on the liver. In our preliminary data, we identify Cyp7b1 as an exquisitely sensitive target of insulin in the liver: Cyp7b1 was increased by acute insulin stimulation; reduced by insulin deficiency; reduced by hepatic knockout of the insulin receptor; and one of only four genes significantly altered in all three conditions. CYP7B1 plays a central role in cholesterol, oxysterol and bile acid metabolism6-8. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that insulin induces CYP7B1 to maintain lipid homeostasis and suppress inflammation, and that this regulation is lost in type 1 diabetes, leading to atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) determine the extent to which restoration of Cyp7b1 in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes can prevent atherosclerosis; and (2) define the signaling pathways by which insulin regulates Cyp7b1. We expect to find that CYP7B1 reduces atherosclerosis in diabetic mice via two mechanisms: (1) reducing oxysterols and vascular inflammation; and (2) reducing dietary cholesterol absorption (via modulation of the bile acid profile) and plasma cholesterol. Validation of our hypothesis could lead to the development of drugs that mimic insulin action on CYP7B1. Such drugs, which would restore homeostasis in type 1 diabetes, could be more effective than present lipid-lowering therapies as they would lower both plasma cholesterol and inflammation."
10746788,"1 Background/Rationale: An alternative pre-exposure prophylaxis modality of growing interest is based on the
 2 premise that prevention can be safely achieved by passive immunization with broadly neutralizing anti-HIV
 3 antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV envelope. A pan-neutralizing antibody could provide a feasible means to
 4 prevent HIV infection worldwide.
 5 Objectives: Our hypothesis is that by rational engineering of near pan-neutralizing bNAbs against the CD4
 6 binding site (CD4bs) bNAbs N49P7 and N49P9.3, using rare resistance variants of HIV as guides, a pan-
 7 neutralizing with clinically relevant pharmacokinetic profiles can be made. Such a pan-neutralizing antibody
 8 would even cover variants that are cross-resistant to other anti-CD4bs bNAbs (3BNC117 and N6). We have
 9 preliminary data demonstrating that N49P7 and N49P9.3 are near pan-neutralizing and exhibit novel structural
10 features (e.g., N49P7 has access to the highly conserved inner domain) that can be used to guide improved
11 bNAb design. These unique features provide the closest possible starting point for building a highly potent pan-
12 neutralizing antibody. In parallel, our collaborators have developed techniques to engineer bNAbs, increasing
13 the potency of PGT121 approximately 50 times, while retaining favorable qualities (solubility and non-
14 auto/polyreactivity). The specific aims of this proposal are 1) Engineer N49P7 and N49P9.3 to improve
15 neutralization of HIV-1 viruses resistant to CD4bs bNAbs; 2) Downselection of bNAb variants from Aim 1
16 based on in vivo pharmacokinetics and biophysical properties; 3) Test engineered N49 bNAbs in two
17 humanized mouse models using resistant viruses to determine their efficacy in preventing HIV-1 infection.
18 Methods: Our plan is to make a collection of N49P7 and N49P9.3 variants with greater potency and breadth
19 using yeast surface display, focusing on selecting variants with enhanced recognition of recombinantly
20 produced gp120s and SOSIPs derived from neutralization resistant viruses. Combinatorial libraries with input
21 from x-ray crystallography, antibody lineage analysis, neutralization escape residues, and liability analysis will
22 also inform design. Emphasis will be placed on reduction of auto/polyreactive properties by aggressively
23 negatively selecting against those binding membrane proteins, immunogenic prediction algorithms, and
24 germline reversion. After 3 rounds of engineering, we will produce 48 mAbs as human IgG1 containing the “LS”
25 half-life extension and evaluate the bNAbs for in vitro neutralization. Thereafter, 8 bNAbs will be tested for
26 auto/polyreactivity, expression titer, biochemical behavior, and in vivo half-life. The top two bNAbs will be
27 tested in humanized mouse models for ability to protection against cell-free and cell-associated HIV challenge.
28 Impact: The development of a single, fully pan-neutralizing antibody with desirable PK and solubility properties
29 absent discernable polyreactivity would be a major advance in efforts to develop approaches for immune-
30 based treatment and prevention of HIV."
10805526,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with a median
survival of up to 20 months. Males have a 1.6-fold higher incidence of GBM compared to females and worse
disease outcome. Standard-of-care treatment and immunotherapies, which are currently in clinical trials, have
had limited success improving patient outcome. An immunosuppressive microenvironment facilitating tumor
progression and restricting anti-tumor immune response likely underlies therapeutic resistance. Although
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs) accumulate in patients with malignancies and play a critical role in the
establishment of this immunosuppressive milieu, the mechanisms by which individual MDSC subsets promote
tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. In pre-clinical models, I demonstrated that monocytic MDSCs (mMDSCs)
infiltrated tumor at higher rates in males, while granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs) were more abundant in the
peripheral circulation of females. Furthermore, there were more immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumors
of male patients and gMDSC gene signature associated with poor prognosis of female patients. MDSC subset
variation also determined sex-specific therapeutic response in preclinical models, including to fludarabine and
anti-IL-1β. I also established that complement component 1q (C1q) is highly expressed by gMDSCs and elevated
in females. Based on these observations, I hypothesize that MDSC subsets promote GBM progression via
distinct mechanisms in a sex-specific manner and that their targeting will improve the efficacy of T cell-activating
strategies. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mMDSCs and gMDSCs have distinct roles in local and
systemic immunosuppression in a sex-specific manner. This aim will investigate the changes in tumor growth,
vascular density and immune activation status by adoptively transferring MDSC subsets and selectively depleting
MDSCs in bone marrow chimeras. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the unique gene expression
signatures of MDSC subsets makes them susceptible to distinct drugs that can be combined with checkpoint
modulators. Sub-Aim 2A will examine the efficacy of drug candidates on MDSC activity in vitro and in vivo, while
Sub-Aim 2B will attempt to achieve durable anti-tumor immune response by combining MDSC targeting
strategies with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-OX40. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that gMDSC-
derived C1q promotes MDSC lineage commitment and systemic immunosuppression by evaluating tumor
progression and checkpoint response in the absence of C1q. Sub-Aim 3A will use C1qa knockout bone marrow
and C1q receptor inhibitors to determine MDSC fate. Sub Aim 3B will use pharmacological inhibitors combined
with checkpoint modulators. These studies lay the foundation for my future research program and the
development of novel immunotherapies for GBM by addressing variations in anti-tumor immunity, repurposing
drugs and defining targetable pathways. These results are broadly applicable to other cancers and can lead to
advanced treatment opportunities and improved patient outcome."
10746909,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Research Plan: Tumor evolution is a fundamental obstacle to cancer treatment, as malignant cells adapt to
treatment and change during progression. Understanding these adaptations is key to not only identifying
vulnerable gene targets, but also intervening during the optimal time window, before the targets become
obsolete. Charting this evolution requires understanding the genetic and epigenetic events that drive or
accompany disease progression, but these are largely unmapped in many malignancies. A case in point is diffuse
glioma, an incurable brain cancer composed of distinct cellular states that dramatically change in relative
abundance during glioma progression, ultimately changing the response to treatment. Efforts to decode glioma
evolution have been limited: while we have characterized the distinct glioma cell states, we have not found their
genetic and epigenetic drivers or measured how these affect cell states abundance throughout progression. To
this end, we have developed novel single-cell technologies to concurrently profile in the same cell i) the
transcriptome and epigenome (specifically, DNA methylation) and ii) the transcriptome and genome (DNA
mutations) at an unprecedented detection rate.
 First, by combining genotype with cellular state data, I will define how somatic mutations dysregulate
transcriptional patterns, resulting in cellular states (Aim 1a), and characterize how somatic mutations dictate
glioma lineage structure (Aim 1b). By combining this with my postdoctoral work – characterizing how epigenetic
diversification contributes to transcriptomic diversity – I will create the first multi-dimensional model of glioma
evolution. Second, I will use our method to measure single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptional profiles in
samples taken longitudinally from the same patients. This will test the hypothesis that dysregulated epigenetic
patterns contribute to glioma progression, and it will not only provide a multi-dimensional model of glioma
progression, but will also provide epigenetic markers to track progression in the clinic (Aim 2). Finally, I will
improve diagnosis in the clinical setting by designing a tool that infers cell state composition, progression and
likely response to treatment based on data from the bulk DNA methylation assay that is routinely done in the
clinic (Aim 3). These studies will pave the way towards novel glioma treatments, accurate diagnoses and optimal
timing of treatment.
Career Development Plan: I have outlined a 5-year career development plan to meet my goal of becoming an
independent investigator in cancer biology who focuses on intrinsic determinants of tumor progression and
response to treatment. I have assembled a Mentorship Committee of leaders in the field, with whom I will train
to close remaining knowledge gaps in multi-omics evolution and how to leverage my results to support clinical
care. Finally, the Broad Institute constitutes the ideal environment for attaining my scientific and career goals,
given their outstanding research communities and track records of training independent scientists."

Neuroscience research must be transdisciplinary, drawing on the knowledge and practices of such diverse fields
as biology, psychology, engineering and computer science. This transdisciplinary approach is further supported
by the innovative ideas that stem from a diverse population with a broad set of perspectives. As with many other
science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine (STEMM) fields, the field of neuroscience needs to
implement strategies that more effectively support individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue further studies
or careers in research. Underrepresented groups (URGs) are less likely to transition from graduate school to
postdoctoral training and postdoctoral training to scientific positions in academia or industry. We posit that a
sense of belonging promotes academic and professional success generally and that to support recruitment and
retainment of URG trainees, issues like stereotype threat, lack of representation, microaggressions, and imposter
phenomena need to be countered with mentorship and strategic access to professionals to build a diverse and
representative network. Social capital is an additional necessary support to promote professional advancement
of URG trainees. To maximize impact on professional advancement, we will focus on graduate students and
postdocs and their potential transitions to postdocs and scientists, respectively. Our goal is to increase
successful transitions and ultimately diversify neuroscience. Our program, Pathways to Neurosciences, was
designed as a social sciences study, using a theory of action that describes psychosocial mechanisms that
we hypothesize our program will activate that would lead to desirable outcomes. Our evaluation plan was
designed in parallel to maximize useful data for others desiring to design similar programs, and to prioritize
iterative data collection that will document how program elements operate over time, as a function of the
interactions among elements and participants. In Aim 1 we will establish the Pathways to Neurosciences
program and Subaim 1a will utilize a year 1 pilot cohort to optimize program components and processes,
including refining ongoing participant surveys. A strength of our plan is that we will in Subaim 1b continue
evaluations and adjustments throughout the project. Aim 2 is to determine whether and how the program leads
to the hypothesized mechanisms in our theory of action, which are professional networks, safe spaces for
interaction, and productive dynamics of interactions. In Aim 3 we will evaluate whether our desired short- and
long-term outcomes are achieved by the program compared to control groups. Through this program and strong
institutional support, we hope that Pathways to Neurosciences graduates will have increased opportunities
and exhibit increased persistence in science and leadership. Ultimately, we will disseminate program design,
processes, and insights to others to enable the creation of similar optimized programs at their own institutions."

The progesterone receptor gene (PGR) is an estrogen receptor-α (ER) target gene. Thus, expression of
progesterone receptors (PRs) in luminal breast cancers is a marker of active ER and predicts good response
to endocrine therapy. However, recurrence of ER+ breast cancer occurs in ~40% of node-positive patients.
Although breast cancer treatments that halt cancer cell proliferation, such as tamoxifen, are initially very
effective, they fail to target slowly proliferating cells, including cancer stem and progenitor cell populations
(CSCs) that contribute to recurrence. Resistance to endocrine-based therapies also develops over time.
Clinical research supports a role for PR in endocrine failure, but the mechanisms are unknown. In fact, PRs
have a profound impact on ER activity, although they are grossly understudied relative to ER. Two PR isoforms
are equally expressed from the PGR gene in breast tissues: full-length PR-B and truncated PR-A. In normal
tissues, PR isoforms most often function as A:B heterodimers. Imbalanced expression of PR isoforms typifies
ER+ breast cancer, and thus reflects the presence of either A:A or B:B homodimers with overlapping and
distinct functions. Both isoforms are also heavily modified by signaling pathways commonly elevated in breast
cancer. In response to MAPKs or CDKs, PRs are phosphorylated on Ser294 (p-PRs) and enact gene
programs associated with poor breast cancer outcome. ER+ breast tumors with PR isoform imbalance express
abundant p-PRs, indicative of activated mitogenic signal transduction and aberrant SR function.
This proposal addresses the hypothesis that p-PR modulates disease progression through ER-dependent and
ER-independent functions. Together, these PR-driven events confer endocrine resistance, heighten insulin
sensitivity, and increase breast cancer stem cells. We propose that p-PRs control these phenotypes through 2
primary mechanisms: 1) modulating ER function by regulating the adapter protein, insulin receptor substrate
(IRS-1), increasing insulin sensitivity, resulting in endocrine resistance; and 2) evoking an oncogenic p-
PR/FOXO1 signaling axis that is mediated by phosphorylated FOXO1 molecules. In this pro-signaling context,
PRs can switch from inhibitors of ER function to activating ER partners at distinct target genes that drive
advanced cancer phenotypes. PRs are thus under-exploited drivers of ER+ breast cancer progression.
The proposed aims are 1) to determine how p-PRs alter global SR gene programs and to test the role of the
insulin-receptor substrate-one (IRS-1) as a key ligand-independent p-PR-induced gene; 2) to determine how
the p-PR/FOXO1 axis drives ER+ breast cancer; and 3) to determine the contribution of p-PRs to ER+ breast
cancer progression in vivo using patient-derived xenograft models. There is an urgent need to delineate the
actions of PRs as drivers of proliferation and cell fate transitions/plasticity that promote ER+ tumor progression.
The discovery of targetable actions of PRs will help pave the way for development of durable combination
endocrine therapies that block both ER and PRs, improving outcomes for patients with ER+ breast cancer."

The most useful application of PET imaging in CNS drug development is to measure occupancy of new drug
candidates at target binding sites (e.g., receptors, transporters, and enzymes). These target occupancy (TO)
studies -often starting in primates and progressing to Phase 1 in humans - are very helpful for in vivo dose-
finding, deciding whether to advance a candidate compound to more costly later phase trials, and optimizing
the design of later phase studies. Current State of the Art: A common and informative approach to analysis of
TO data is the “Lassen plot”. The Lassen plot yields two point estimates: a fractional occupancy of the target
by the drug (ODrug) and the nondisplaceable uptake of the tracer (VND). Assumptions underlying this popular
method are that (a) both measures are uniform across the whole brain and (b) the PET tracer binds to the
identical population of target sites as the candidate drug. Technology Gap: There are important cases in
which one or more assumption of the Lassen plot is violated. In such cases, (1) the outcome of the TO study
may be biased, (2) manual intervention may be required, (3) proper interpretation will depend on prior
knowledge of the spatial distribution of target subtypes, and in any case, (4) the standard method offers little to
no information on regional variation in ODrug.
Basic development in the lab: In our research group at Yale, we have developed an extension of the
standard Lassen plot that provides information about local variation in ODrug and VND. The outcomes of our
new “Lassen Plot Filter” (LPF) algorithm are voxel-by-voxel estimates of ODrug, VND and EC50 (i.e., `occupancy
images', `nondisplaceable uptake, and drug affinity, images'). We believe these novel images represent much
more informative outcomes of TO studies than standard measures for identifying precise locations of maximal
specific action of drugs. For example, when assumptions are violated, occupancy images will be less biased
than point estimates. The new images could serve as richer endpoints to drive go/no-go decisions on
candidate compounds based on drug action at specific brain locations of greatest therapeutic interest.
Academic-Industrial Partnership. Our industrial partner, a company with extensive experience in conducting
TO studies, will provide us with very valuable archival data in humans and nonhuman primates for testing and
validating our LPF algorithm.
In the present project, we will (1) Analyze simulated data with known occupancy distributions. (2) Re-analyze
archival data that represent different cases and/or violations of standard assumptions. (3) Perform
circumscribed studies in primates to confirm the biological interpretations of our new images. The work will be
complete when we have fully characterized and optimized the performance of our LPF algorithm. In the long
term, our goal is for a validated version of our voxel-by-voxel analysis of TO studies, to be adopted widely, to
the benefit of end-users, to speed drug development."

Obesity is a complex disease, and innovative treatments that enhance initial and long-term weight loss are
needed. One novel treatment approach uses a biobehavioral framework, focusing on time-based energy intake
goals (how energy intake is distributed across the day). Time-based dietary goals are believed to promote
synchronization of biological and behavioral circadian rhythms, and determining the health benefits of these
goals is an objective of NIH’s nutrition strategic plan. Empirical testing of this time-based strategy is limited,
and what has been conducted has been short-term (< 3 months) interventions. That said, current findings
support that eating more energy earlier in the day and less energy later in the day increases weight loss during
obesity treatment. The effect usually starts early in treatment and increases over time, but sustained impact is
unexplored. One mechanism for this relationship is enhanced appetite regulation. Within a reduced energy
diet, goals that provide a morning-loaded energy distribution result in lower hunger, reduced desire to eat,
and/or greater fullness ratings than goals that provide an afternoon/evening-loaded energy distribution.
However, the relationship between appetite regulation changes and weight loss has not been examined.
Finally, chronotype, an individual’s preferred timing of daily activities thought to reflect circadian rhythms, may
moderate the effect of time-based dietary goals. No investigation has examined the influence of chronotype on
the relationship between distribution of energy intake and weight loss. To address these gaps, we will test the
more longer-term (12 months) effect of time-based energy intake goals on weight loss. We will explore if
enhanced appetite regulation is a mediator of the relationship and whether chronotype moderates the effect.
For this, 174 adults with overweight or obesity will be randomly assigned to one of three, 12-month lifestyle
interventions: 1) Morning (a morning-loaded energy distribution); 2) Evening (an afternoon/evening-loaded
energy distribution); or 3) Standard (no guidance on energy distribution). All conditions will receive the same
reduced-energy, low-fat dietary prescription, in which the guidance on the eating window length and the
number of eating occasions is identical; a physical activity goal; and a cognitive behavioral intervention.
Assessments will occur at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months on anthropometrics, diet (24-hr recalls with time-stamped
digital images verifying timing of intake, combined with continuous blood glucose monitoring to objectively
assess for length of the eating window and number of eating occasions), sleep regularity (actigraphy), appetite
regulation as assessed via ecological momentary assessment, and chronotype. We anticipate that Morning will
have the greatest percent weight loss, earliest midpoint of energy intake, greatest sleep regularity, and better
appetite regulation at 12 months. We will explore if appetite regulation mediates the relationship between time-
based energy intake goals and weight loss, and if chronotype moderates examined relationships."

It is well-established that premenopausal females have blood pressure that is ~10mmHg lower
than that of males. We previously reported that an evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptor,
OLFR558, is expressed in the kidney; we have now uncovered that OLFR558 is required for sex
differences in blood pressure. OLFR558 localizes to renin-containing juxtaglomerular cells in the
kidney, and to vascular smooth muscle cells. KO females exhibit increased blood pressure (and
increased pulse wave velocity), whereas KO males exhibit decreased blood pressure (and
decreased renal expression of renin, and, decreased plasma renin activity). As a result, blood
pressure is similar in KO males and females. Our understanding of OLFR558’s role is currently
hindered by our poor understanding of OLFR558 ligands. The central Aim of this proposal is to
advance our understanding of OLFR558 ligands in order to better develop our understanding of
OLFR558 physiology. In Aim 1, we will work to better understand putative endogenous ligands
of OLFR558. To date, we have identified 18 ligands which activate OLFR558 in vitro; however,
it is unclear how many of these ligands circulate at levels that activate OLFR558 in vivo (Aim
1a). Of note, several of these ligands modulate additional pathways; thus, we will measure
blood pressure responses to each ligand in both OLFR558 WT and KO mice to define the
OLFR558-mediated response (Aim 1b). Several of the best ligands for OLFR558 are produced
by microbiota; in Aim 2 we will determine if the commensal microbiome influences OLFR558
signaling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will leverage our recent success in discovering novel synthetic
OLFR558 agonists with high potency and selectivity, as well as a novel OLFR558 antagonist.
These novel probes will be used as research tools to selectively manipulate OLFR558 activity in
vivo; at the same time, this Aim will explore the therapeutic potential of these novel ligands."

Although substantial progress has been made in attracting individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in
biomedical research (URiBR) to STEM careers, the number of URiBR students in biomedical graduate programs
remain suboptimal. Attrition along the career development path attenuates the impact of diversity programs
targeting early stages of the pipeline. Reasons for this attrition are many, but include under-preparation,
insufficient mentorship and networking opportunities, and lack of belonging stemming from inadequate
representation at the faculty level. Weill Cornell Medicine has a longstanding institutional commitment to
diversity, equity, and inclusion, scientific excellence, and mentoring the next generation of scientists and
physician scientists. The proposed program, Advancing Success and Persistence in Research Education,
ASPiRE will augment current WCM efforts by focusing on a population not targeted by existing pathway/capacity
building programs: postbaccalaureate scholars. ASPiRE will leverage existing programs, relationships with local
and regional partner institutions (Cornell University, Hunter College, Brooklyn College) and WCM presence at
national graduate and medical school recruitment meetings to recruit talented scholars who will benefit from
additional support to be competitive for admission in PhD and MD/PhD programs. The selected scholars will be
paired with a primary research faculty mentor based on their career interests, collegiate research experiences
and the expertise of the faculty member. An additional faculty member, at an academic rank different from the
research mentor, will serve as a career mentor. In addition, the scholars will be paired with current 1st or 2nd year
URiBR graduate students who will serve as near-peer mentors. This tiered mentorship structure will ensure that
our scholars have mentors and advisors at multiple levels of the professional development spectrum and thus
exposure to the many factors and considerations along the academic scientific career path. The experiential
research training will be complemented with professional development advising, coaching and skill building. We
will also provide the expertise of an educational psychologist who will meet with students collectively and
individually to assess and build personalized academic success strategies relevant to their roles as research
trainees, graduate school applicants and future graduate/medical students. We expect that the combination of
research education, career development coaching, tiered mentorship and community building activities will yield
short- and long-term dividends. In the short term, we expect scholars to progress successfully to PHD or MD/PhD
programs within two years of program participation. In the long term, we project that program participation will
produce longevity as academic research faculty."

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold great promise to restore movement to paralyzed people. But BCIs
cannot yet provide reliable performance across the long timespans and varied settings needed for real-
world applications. Maintaining robust BCI performance over many days is challenging because brains are
highly plastic. Plasticity during extended BCI practice leads to changes in how neural activity relates to move-
ments—the brain’s encoding of BCI movement. How the brain’s encoding changes is influenced by the decod-
ing algorithm used by the BCI to map neural activity into movement. These interactions create complex dynam-
ics where methods that improve performance in the short term may produce problems longer-term. Indeed, our
preliminary data suggests current adaptive decoding methods used to maintain performance over time lead the
brain to form encoders where very few neural signals control movements, which make BCI vulnerable to cata-
strophic failure with loss of a single neural signal. The long-term vision of this proposal is to expand the engi-
neering tools available to produce robust, high-performance BCIs by building tools that account for and even
leverage plasticity. To enable this vision, this proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that decoder-en-
coder interactions can be used to jointly optimize BCI performance and robustness. We focus on robustness of
BCI systems to signal loss and changes in task context. We will use an animal model where monkeys move
cursors with activity from motor cortices, which has repeatedly informed clinical BCIs. We will leverage novel
micro-electrocorticography implants that allow us to longitudinally monitor and manipulate cortical dynamics to
advance our understanding of plasticity in multi-day (10 days) BCI training. We will test our overarching hy-
pothesis across three aims. If our hypothesis is true, there must be relationships between decoders and prop-
erties of encoders that are related to robustness. Aim 1 will determine whether decoders influence how infor-
mation is structured in an encoder, which influences how robust BCIs are to signal loss. Aim 2 will determine
whether decoders influence the specificity of learned encoders to BCI movements, which influences how ro-
bust BCIs are to changes in tasks. Finally, if our hypothesis is true, it requires computational tools that can opti-
mize multiple goals in a BCI. Aim 3 will test a novel decoder training paradigm we developed that can consider
multiple objectives. We will compare our novel method to established single-objective methods to determine
whether multi-objective methods can improve robustness without compromising performance. Across all aims,
we will perform offline analyses and online perturbations to measure robustness to signal loss and changes in
neural state and behavioral task. Together, these studies will identify how critical plasticity computations can
be influenced through the decoder. Pairing this with tests of novel decoding methods will establish new frame-
works to build encoder-informed decoders and pave the way for BCIs that can leverage brain plasticity."
10775129,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children globally. Disruptions of fetal development processes are
hypothesized to give rise to asthma, therefore, prenatal interventions may help reduce its short- and long-term burden.
Randomized clinical trials, including our Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), have suggested that
maternal vitamin D supplementation can help prevent asthma in the offspring. However, in these trials, not all children
benefited from maternal vitamin D supplementation, and not all treated mothers had sufficient vitamin D levels. This
variability in vitamin D response suggests complex mechanisms underlying the potential protective effect of maternal
vitamin D on childhood asthma that are currently not well-understood. Our long-term goal is to uncover the molecular
mechanisms that can enable the precision prevention of childhood asthma. The objective of this application is to
identify the multi-omic determinants that modulate the influence of maternal vitamin D supplementation on childhood
asthma outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that the effect of maternal vitamin D intake on offspring asthma status is
modified by the genotypes of and the epigenetic modifications on the major regulators of vitamin D metabolism and
signaling. In Aim 1, we will determine the joint role of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels and vitamin D metabolism
and signaling genotypes in modulating the effect of maternal vitamin D supplementation in childhood asthma
outcomes. We will measure DBP levels in the VDAART cohort and use the existing VDAART genotyping data. We will
use Mixed Graphical Models and Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks to model the contribution of DBP levels,
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels and vitamin D genotypes to the effect of maternal vitamin D intake on childhood
asthma, and create polygenic and polyexposure scores for individual risk prediction. In Aim 2, we will identify the
longitudinal epigenetic markers that modulate the effect of maternal vitamin D on childhood asthma. We will measure
DNA methylation on VDAART mothers pre- and post-vitamin D treatment and use existing cord blood methylation
data. We will perform epigenome-wide association studies, integrate their results with ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data,
and perform mediation analyses to identify the longitudinal maternal epigenetic marks that potentially mediate the
effect of maternal vitamin D intake in childhood asthma. In Aim 3, we will determine the pharmacogenomic drivers of
individual differences in maternal vitamin D response and its effect on childhood asthma. We will integrate genomics,
transcriptomics and epigenomics from VDAART to identify the vitamin D-responsive pharmacogenomic expression and
methylation quantitative trait loci (PGx-eQTLs and PGx-mQTLs). We will develop a network-based statistical method to
identify the colocalization of these PGx-QTLs, perform colocalization using orthogonal approaches, and identify
endotypes through which maternal vitamin D targets childhood asthma. Within each of the above aims, we will
leverage the strong non-white representation among VDAART participants to address health disparities in vitamin D
response and asthma outcomes across the population. Our research plan is innovative in its use of highly granular
multi-omic data and cutting-edge integrative methods, and the outcomes of each aim are of high translational potential."

While single-cell methods for analyzing gene expression are becoming a standard tool for unpacking cellular
heterogeneity and understanding complex tissues in health and disease, other molecular features, especially
open chromatin landscapes via ATAC-seq, but also surface protein abundance and the presence of CRISPR
guides, are rapidly expanding in their application. Indeed, commercial platforms for generating diverse single-
cell data sets have led to an immense increase in scale of these data, and methods for split-and-pool based
assays and decreasing sequencing cost all presage an exponentially increasing corpus of future large-scale
datasets. We developed ArchR, an analysis infrastructure specifically designed for analysis of large-scale single-
cell (sc) ATAC-seq data sets that enables a diverse suite of complex analysis (including QC, doublet removal,
iterative TF-IDF clustering, approximation methods for large-scale data sets, trajectory analysis, RNA-seq
integration, track visualization, marker peak identification, etc.), all with minimal computing hardware
requirements. We estimate that ArchR has thousands of active users and is rapidly becoming the “go to” analysis
software for large scATAC-seq data sets. To further extend the utility of ArchR for analyzing multi-omic data sets,
we will first engineer substantial improvements to computational efficiency of underlying single-cell
computational infrastructure. To do this, we will (1) encode our fundamental matrix operations in C++ to enable
streaming data matrix access, thus reducing memory requirements and effectively “lifting the cap” on the number
of cells capable of being analyzed through rapid on-the-fly calculations of diverse operations and (2) implement
and benchmark efficient on-disk storage using bitpacking algorithms. These data structures and atomic operation
libraries will be shared with the genomics community (and are being integrated into the popular Seurat package),
allowing repurposing of these performance improvements. Second, we will develop, implement, and benchmark
powerful analytical tools for the analysis of large, diverse, and/or multi-omic datasets. We will enable the handling
of diverse independent and simultaneously acquired (multi-omic) data types including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ADT
(CITE-seq), and CRISPR-based perturbation methods. We will develop accurate methods for cross-manifold
data linkage for distinct data sets, forced-projection and regression analysis, multi-modality cell clustering, joint
analysis of single-cell molecular data sets with CRISPR-based perturbations, single-cell inference of enhancer
function via correlation and the “ABC” model, and identification of continuous differentiation trajectories and
chromatin “potential.” Finally, we will develop plug-and-play cell type specific deep learning models for prediction
of the regulatory effects of noncoding sequence changes. These models will learn single-cell chromatin
accessibility profiles from DNA sequence to predict the cell type-specific effects of noncoding sequence changes.
We will create a user-friendly system for training, deployment, and sharing sequence-based models of cell type-
specific chromatin accessibility, bringing cutting-edge machine learning for functional genomics to wide use."

African-Americans and Hispanics of Puerto-Rican origin bear a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity
and mortality, despite decades of attention to asthma disparities. The advent of biologic therapies offers a
promising route to narrow these disparities. However, despite the well documented disparities in asthma
treatment and outcomes, little is known about the use of biologics in these minority groups. Furthermore, ethnic
minorities have been grossly underrepresented in trials that form the evidence base of the efficacy of these
drugs. The goal of this Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00 MOSAIC) is to
expedite the candidate's transition to an independent investigator who possesses unique expertise in the use
of mixed methods in pharmacoepidemiology and disparities research. Through the application of rigorous
qualitative methods and sophisticated non-experimental designs, the candidate will determine patients’
attitudes and beliefs about biologics and providers motivators for prescribing, and evaluate how these influence
real-world utilization patterns and effectiveness of biologics, with focus on treatment effect heterogeneity by
race/ethnicity. In the K99 phase of this award, the candidate will obtain focused training needed to accomplish
these goals. In the R00 phase, the candidate will conduct a prospective cohort of patients with severe asthma
and assess how time-varying patient factors and provider factors influence biologic initiation, adherence, and
discontinuation. The aims are to 1) Describe biologic use and identify differences in use across racial/ethnic
groups, 2) Compare the real-world effectiveness of these biologics on asthma-related outcomes; and
determine effect modification by race/ethnicity, and 3) Identify patient- and provider factors that influence
biologic use and adherence over time. Findings from this R00 study will form the basis for further research
such as using mediation and decomposition analysis to partition any identified differences in biologic use or
patient outcomes to the various sources of bias. This will be helpful as we identify interventions which are likely
to be effective in eliminating disparities related to biologics use. These activities will also establish the
candidate's portfolio for applying mixed methods to generate evidence on interventions to reduce disparities in
minority patients with severe asthma."

Despite treatment, a significant proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) do not experience clinical
improvement (i.e., lack treatment response). In analyses of data from the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE)
Study, a randomized controlled trial testing the potential of medical and surgical therapies to improve and
maintain β-cell function, members of our team have demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in treatment
response at the level of the β cell using gold standard measures from hyperglycemic clamps. We know little,
however, about contributing factors to heterogeneity of T2D treatment response and lack tools to prospectively
identify treatment responders and non-responders. A major reason for this is lack of circulating biomarkers that
predict or reflect treatment response at the level of the β cell. Epigenetic regulation of genes important in glucose
and insulin metabolism by short non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) may mediate improvement or
preservation of β-cell function with treatment, and circulating miRNAs may be predictive biomarkers of treatment
response. In the β cell, regulation of gene expression by miRNAs is crucial to both insulin secretion and cell
turnover. In addition, miRNAs secreted into the circulation may reflect tissue-level differences in expression
and/or participate actively in inter-organ crosstalk. While miRNAs in a variety of tissues and in the circulation
have been shown to be altered by exposure to the RISE interventions in humans or in vitro models, effects of
most of these miRNAs in the β cell are not yet described. Using data and samples from the RISE Pediatric
Medication Study (n=49; R03DK122100; PI Wander), we identified 9 plasma miRNAs that are prospectively
related to treatment response in youth aged 10–19 years including two novel miRNAs, miR-4468 and miR-6727,
which are predicted to regulate islet apoptosis via Bcl-2 like 1 and islet amyloid polypeptide. Our objective is to
characterize miRNAs that are related to preservation or improvement in β-cell function among adult RISE
participants, defined by clamp-derived measures of β-cell response paired with insulin sensitivity, after treatment
with medications or gastric banding. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-part study. In Aim 1, we will assay
circulating miRNAs using next-generation sequencing at baseline and after treatment in a nested case-control
sample of treatment responders vs. non-responders in RISE. In Aim 2, we will examine effects of miR-4468, miR-
6727, and miRNAs identified in Aim 1 on β-cell function, survival, and de-differentiation in gain-of-function in
vitro experiments using locked nucleic acid-based miRNA mimics in human islets. Our overarching hypothesis is
that circulating miRNAs contribute to treatment heterogeneity via effects on insulin secretion and β-cell survival.
To our knowledge, this project will be the first to directly test the role of treatment-related miRNAs in mediating or
reflecting treatment response. Better understanding of miRNAs as biomarkers of treatment heterogeneity will
facilitate T2D precision medicine by prospectively identifying subgroups likely to benefit from specific treatments
and promote development of targeted interventions to prevent or delay the progression of T2D."

During a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid dissemination of information
to clinicians about emerging innovations is critical to ensuring the best outcomes for patients.
However, little is known about how clinicians obtain information about innovations make decisions about
implementation and de-implementation during uncertain times. As SARS-CoV-2 made its initial, rapid spread
across the nation, clinicians feared that the impending surge of critically ill patients would overwhelm capacity,
causing patient deaths due to a lack of ventilators and other essential resources. Additionally, shortages of
personal protective equipment posed a challenge to following the usual standards to protect clinicians from
infection. In a massive response to prevent worst-case scenarios from materializing, emergency department
(ED) staff have rapidly innovated to deliver effective care, protect frontline workers, and ensure a
sustainable supply of personal protective equipment. In response to these unusual conditions, ED
clinicians turned to nontraditional sources of information—for example, Twitter, Facebook, podcasts, and pre-
print journal publications—to learn about innovations they could use to care for COVID-19 patients in EDs.
While these sources of information provided easy access to information about innovations, they also
spread misinformation. Little research has been done to optimize dissemination and implementation of
innovations during a public health emergency. Before the pandemic, an expansion of online platforms
facilitating exchange of information about innovations had already occurred, and many more exist now.
Information is also shared through professional societies and also through social media. But the understanding
of the diffusion of innovations among EDs during the pandemic is currently limited due to the volume of sharing
that happened during COVID-19; the urgency and fear associated with these innovations; and the need for
deimplementation of interventions that were found to be ineffective or even dangerous. It is not clear how these
processed happened and whether they might have differed based on the demographics of ED clinicians or the
communities and populations they serve. A comprehensive evaluation of the flow of innovations will lead
to insights into how disseminators and implementers can improve practices during pandemic and
rapidly evolving emergencies and also how processes can be optimized for more steady-state
conditions. Our study incorporates a strong interdisciplinary and mixed methods approach. Our strong team
will work with study partners representing emergency physicians and nurses and experts in other disciplines in
the ED. Study methods combine advanced natural language processing techniques with interviews (Aim 1),
focus groups with a survey of ED professionals (Aim 2), and systematic synthesis of results to identify
strategies for improving diffusion of ED care innovations (Aim 3). The study will also provide results in
actionable formats, such as a toolkit of dissemination and implementation strategies."

Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) account for 35-38% of head and neck SCC, the 6th most common
cancer worldwide, and have a disappointing 5-year survival rate of ~50%. Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) are
precursors to OSCC, but many go undiagnosed. Studies of OED allow characterization of the aberrant
molecular changes that lead to cancer. Yet due to inconsistencies in standard care and a lack of sufficient
longitudinal data, few studies have examined the molecular characteristics that drive the transformation of
OED to OSCC across time in the same patients to identify features unique to recurrence with progression.
There are very few longitudinal studies of OED progression, and those that exist have little epidemiologic
characterization and lack data integration from multi-omics. Additionally, existing reports concentrate on a few
common candidate genes and/or are limited to a small sample size. We will use our uniquely detailed
longitudinal cohort of OED to integrate clinical, histopathologic, epidemiologic and multiple molecular
characteristics of OED lesions to identify those hallmarks of OED lesions that lead to OSCC. This will benefit
patients by leading to improved risk prediction, more effective preventive measures, and insight into OSCC
biomarkers that indicate carcinogenesis. Use of a large, highly-characterized longitudinal cohort for this type of
multi-omics study, while using a second, independent population to validate generalizability, is highly
innovative. Viewed in light of the molecular profiles of OSCCs identified from our current set of tumors and
from TCGA HNSC data, this study will enable us to focus on the most relevant, recurrent changes, and
understand how OSCCs that proceed OED fit into the heterogeneity of overall OSCCs. Identification of
biomarkers predictive of progression will enable clinicians to provide more targeted preventive measures, and
vary the extensiveness of surgery and frequency of monitoring to increase quality of life.
 In Aim 1, we will use existing samples identify genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic profile
signatures distinguishing progressors from non-progressors at diagnosis for each OED stage. Our approach
allows us to identify a set of candidate biomarkers that distinguish high from low risk lesions, accounting for
important biologic variables. The goal of Aim 2 is to chart the timing of key genomic, transcriptomic, and
epigenetic changes associated with progression to OSCC, using extensive longitudinal cases, and comparing
observed changes to genes and pathways known to be aberrant in OSCC. In Aim 3, we will validate the
characterization of our unique longitudinal clinical cohort in OED with and without a subsequent diagnosis of
OSCC from the University of Michigan to identify clinicopathologic and epidemiologic predictors of recurrence
with progression."

Advances in genome editing have paved the way for the possibility of new therapeutic strategies for treating

a center that can provide testing not only in mice but in rats, which are often a preferred model species for
validation of therapeutics, is greatly needed. The MU Rodent Testing Center for Somatic Cell Genome Editing

the assembled collaborative team include 1) access to large numbers of rodent disease models and reporter
strains and the demonstrated ability to acquire/cryorecover/make any needed mouse/rat strain, 2) expertise in
the maintenance and distribution of rodents under the highest quality standards to ensure downstream research
rigor and reproducibility, 3) access to established and state-of-the art infrastructure and phenotyping expertise
in rodents, 4) experience operating facilities that are service-oriented and familiar with managing fee-for-service

interdisciplinary research teams. The specific goals of the MU Rodent Testing Center for Somatic Cell Genome
Editing are 1) breed and maintain groups of wild-type, reporter and disease model mice and rats for in vivo
testing, 2) establish assays and protocols for evaluating on and off-target genome editing, biodistribution,
bioactivity, and safety using a variety of delivery methods, including in utero delivery, and 3) provide the
resources and services needed by biomedical researchers to evaluate new reagents/tools related to somatic cell
genome editing/gene therapy in relevant preclinical rodent models. Our collaborative group can work with
investigators to provide comprehensive evaluation of somatic cell genome editing tools and delivery vehicles in
whole animals and embryos as well as in all tissues and cell types. The MU Rodent Testing Center for Somatic
Cell Genome Editing is ideally suited to provide the rodent-based expertise needed to facilitate the ability to
evaluate new genome editing tools and technologies for future application to human disease treatments."
10897331,"Intravascular pressure drives perfusion, which is critical for optimal neuronal function. High blood pressure
(hypertension), however, is a risk factor for cognitive decline. Emerging evidence identifies increased blood
pressure variability (IBPV), before the development of hypertension, as a strong predictor for vascular cognitive
impairment and dementia. The mechanism whereby IBPV mediates cognitive decline is unknown and is the
subject of this novel proposal. The myogenic response of cerebral arterioles protects the brain from blood
pressure fluctuations that could cause hyper- or hypoperfusion. Mechanosensory mechanisms are essential in
this process, but the impact of chronic blood pressure elevations at the level of the neurovascular unit has not
been previously described. For example, mechanosensitive Ca2+-permeable cation channels are expressed on
endothelial cells and astrocytes. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrate that increased intravascular pressure
significantly increased astrocyte Ca2+ in a a process that is enhanced in hypertension. Astrocyte Ca2+
dysregulation is often observed in neurodegenerative diseases suggesting it may underlie cellular processes
that contribute to the loss of homeostatic function and transition into reactive astrocytes. Because aberrant blood
pressure fluctuations are an early predictor of hypertension, we will explore the cellular mechanisms by which
intermittent increases in arterial pressure contribute to cognitive decline. Specifically, we will test the central
hypothesis that chronic IBPV amplifies mechano-driven Ca2+ increases at the NVU, which impairs astrocyte
homeostasis, decreases perfusion, and causes cognitive decline. Studies will be conducted in a novel murine
model of chronic increased blood pressure variability induced by pulsatile angiotensin II infusion coupled with
continuous blood pressure measurement in conscious mice. Aims 1-3 will test the following hypotheses: 1) that
IBPV impairs vascular function and causes cerebral hypoperfusion; 2) that increased IBPV enhances myogenic-
induced increases in astrocyte Ca2+and shifts astrocytes toward a pro-inflammatory/reactive phenotype; and 3)
that IBPV compromises sensory-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow, contributing to neuronal dysfunction.
Using in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we will link macroscopic cardiovascular variables to microscopic cellular
events at the neurovascular unit and assess how IBPV progressively impairs vascular, glial and neuronal
function. A longitudinal approach will determine the relationship between blood pressure fluctuations and
aberrant Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes, endothelial cells and neurons. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic
tools will be used to identify the cellular pathways underlying the loss of function at the neurovascular unit.
Findings from this innovative application will establish IBPV as a key driver and predictor of cognitive decline,
introduce a novel murine model to investigate the impact of IBPV on brain (and multi-organ) function, and identify
cellular and molecular targets of pressure-induced vascular and astrocyte dysfunction leading to compromised
cerebral perfusion and ultimately, neuronal dysfunction."

10766662,"The goal of this proposal is to develop dekaparin, a synthetic glycan, to replace animal-derived
low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). LMWHs are partially depolymerized natural products
of heparin, which are isolated from porcine intestine. A worldwide distribution of contaminated
heparin in 2007 was associated with 85 deaths in the US. This crisis revealed the vulnerability
of the LMWH supply chain. LMWHs are complex mixtures, having average molecular masses
of 3500-6000 Daltons, corresponding to 12-20 saccharide units. The efficient preparation of a
synthetic LMWH could improve the safety, availability and efficacy. However, the production of
homogeneous LMWHs has not been possible due to difficulties in the synthesis. Glycan
Therapeutics proposes to assess an innovative chemoenzymatic approach that would provide
an unprecedented efficiency in the preparation of heparin. Our product will be animal-free,
structurally homogenous, safe for renal-impaired patients, and have the ability of its
anticoagulant activity to be neutralized by protamine. In the presently proposed SBIR Phase IIB
grant application, we will conduct the synthesis of dekaparin under the GMP conditions and
complete the formulation, which will clear the IND requirements by FDA. Glycan Therapeutics
will also develop a 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy to shorten the regulatory pathway. The
completion of this project will modernize this century-old drug with improved safety and
anticoagulant properties."

The Harvard School of Dental Medicine Collaborative Clinical Practice-based REsearch Program for
DENTal Schools (H-CREDENT) will embark on an innovative, multidisciplinary practice-based research program
to engage dental students and residents with research and clinical-based faculty to address the challenge of
pain management in dentistry. H-CREDENT is a partnership amongst HSDM, University of New England,
Massachusetts College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, Meharry University, Charles River Community Health
Center, and Cambridge Health Alliance. The program provides didactic and hands-on clinical research
opportunities to deliver an experiential-learning/training for pre-/postdoctoral students and clinical/research
faculty at these sites. Leveraging the unique diversity in the provider/patient communities brought together by
this collaboration, H-CREDENT strives to prepare the next-generation oral healthcare providers through the
conduct of practice-based clinical research to enhance precision oral healthcare delivery.
 H-CREDENT will work towards this goal by accomplishing 2 aims: Aim 1: Establishment of clinical
research skills development program that will train next-generation clinical scholars in practice-based research
networks (PBRNs). Skills development will be advanced via a) coursework in clinical research study design and
PBR, complemented by b) unique pod-based mentorship program for experiential learning. Courses will be
developed by HSDM investigators in partnership with Harvard Catalyst, national PBRN, and a premier network
of private practice clinicians with extensive experience in clinical research. The courses will be taken by H-
CREDENT trainees from all collaborating sites, and each mentoring pod will comprise research-/clinical-focused
faculty and pre-/ postdoctoral trainees from all institutions to promote strong mentorship relationships, both
vertically (e.g., student/faculty) and laterally (e.g., peer-peer) across institutions. Aim 2: A PBRN investigation
to engage dental student and faculty providers to determine risk factors for developing pain following invasive
dental procedures and stratify patients based on demographic, psychosocial, and genetic factors. We will a)
determine risk factors predicting pain after dental procedures and b) how well the dental providers can predict
the patients’ pain experience and if biases influence this prediction, and c) identify patients as low-/ high-risk for
developing post-procedural pain through patient stratification by applying artificial intelligence/ machine learning
methods. This prospective longitudinal study will take place at all sites, where pre-/postdoctoral students will
recruit/enroll, perform dental procedures, and follow up with patients, under the guidance of their clinical mentor.
Differential experiences by H-CREDENT trainees across institutions will be shared via mentoring pods to
integrate and reinforce learnings from the classroom and direct participation in clinical research. Through these
activities, H-CREDENT will foster a culture of scientific inquiry to prepare dental providers with aptitude for
conducting effective practice-based clinical research."

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death for both men
and women for all major racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for lung
cancer. However, in the Multiethnic Cohort study (MEC), we showed that even when accounting for smoking
history (quantity, duration and quit rates), African Americans and Native Hawaiians had higher risk of disease
and Japanese Americans and Latinos had a lower risk when compared to whites. Lung cancer is a
heterogeneous disease with four major histologic cell-types and racial/ethnic disparities persists across all cell-
types. We have reported on the mechanisms contributing to these differences in smoking-related lung cancer
risk, we examined lifestyle and health behaviors, internal biologic dose of tobacco smoking and its carcinogens,
as well as the influence of smoking on DNA methylation of blood leukocytes across a multiethnic population. In
a recent study reporting on gene expression profiles to compare lung ADC from African Americans and whites,
they found that there were differences in tumor biology for lung ADC tumors from African Americans compared
to whites, suggesting that racial/ethnic disparities may be reflected in differences in the underlying lung tumor
biology. However, to date, a comprehensive molecular study that includes other minority populations has not yet
been conducted. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to molecularly profile the most common lung cancer cell-type,
ADC, from five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC to comprehensively examine for racial/ethnic differences in tumor
biology that may be contributing to the racial/ethnic disparities. For our first aim, we will conduct a comprehensive
genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome analysis for differences by race/ethnicity using lung ADC
tumor tissue from 750 multiethnic lung cancer cases (African Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians, Japanese
Americans, and whites). We will adjust for potential confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status,
and tumor stage. For our second aim, we will examine the association for DNA methylation and transcriptomic
profiles of lung ADC tumors with lung ADC survival and effect modification by race/ethnicity. For the third aim,
we will examine whether DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles mediate the association between
race/ethnicity and lung ADC survival. In addition, we will integrate DNA methylation, transcriptomic, risk factor,
and death data to identify novel lung cancer subgroups associated with disease survival. The strengths of this
study include 1) large-scale comprehensive molecular study design, 2) utilization of the high-quality resources
within the MEC, and 3) the multi-disciplinary investigative team. Findings from this study will provide information
on the biological mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities and evidentiary basis for the development
of new personalized treatment targets and strategies to mitigate racial/ethnic disparities in lung cancer."

TB treatment is an enigma of ineffectiveness. Current TB chemotherapy rapidly kills nearly all bacteria within
two weeks, yet tolerable treatment failure rates are only achieved after 6 months, and even then, ~5% of cases
relapse. Our recent work shows that bacterial factors associated with small MIC shifts are important predictors
of treatment outcome, but the driving forces behind those shifts are unknown. This project unites three labs,
with highly complementary expertise, around interrogating carefully curated M. tuberculosis clinical isolates
with leading edge approaches in genetics, metabolism, gene regulation and network-based modeling to reveal
fundamental new knowledge about how TB responds to front-line drugs. The direct result of this effort will be a
suite of candidate biomarkers with great potential to personalize treatment duration by predicting treatment
outcome and greatly simplify TB drug trials, as well as novel drug targets to improve outcomes and shorten
therapy. These translational aims will be pursued in future studies, using the insights, strains and tools
developed in the program."
10768927,"CORE B SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) remains a therapeutic challenge with nearly 50% of patients experiencing relapse
after aggressive multi-modal therapy including intensive induction chemotherapy, surgery, myeloablative
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, differentiating therapy and immunotherapy. Survival for those patients whose
tumors relapse or are refractory to upfront therapy (resistant NB) remains dismal; however, identification of
tractable molecular aberrations and immunotherapy combinations (chemoimmunotherapy) provide novel
approaches to address this urgent issue.
Core B will provide the needed clinical and statistical expertise, and an infrastructure derived from 23 years of
experience, to develop and conduct the clinical trials to exploit molecular and immunologic therapeutic
vulnerabilities identified by Projects 1-4. We will leverage the expertise of the well-established New Approaches
to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) consortium to ensure the efficient translation of laboratory research into
paradigm-changing therapy for high-risk NB. NANT, founded in 2000, has conducted 34 therapeutic and
biology/biomarkers trials, to date enrolled 1426 patients with resistant NB, and informed ongoing NCI-funded
national clinical trials that will enable New Drug Applications for two novel high-risk NB therapeutics. The 17
international highly motivated children’s cancer centers that comprise NANT have extensive NB-specific
translational expertise with the infrastructure to conduct complex clinical trials. NANT has innovative statistical
designs and correlative biology studies embedded into all clinical trials integrated with the original laboratory
research, a comprehensive tissue bank focused on resistant NB providing a unique resource of annotated patient
data, resistant tumor tissues, bone marrow, blood, and electronic images for scientific studies in the P01 Projects.
The overall objective of Core B will be to leverage NANT consortium’s clinical trial, biostatistical and operational
infrastructure to accelerate the translation of new therapies that target therapeutic vulnerabilities of resistant NB
uncovered by Projects 1-4. The long-term goal of this Core is to enable paradigm-shifting changes in high-risk
NB clinical care that will ultimately dramatically improve the survival probability with less toxicity. Core B will
provide the mechanisms to obtain and provide resistant tumor samples, annotated with the NANT clinical
database and electronic imaging repository, detailed molecular profiling, and data from biologic correlative
studies. These cumulative data will be used in this Program to inform selection of specific therapies and/or to
develop predictive biomarkers of response. Core B is essential to the translational mission of the Program and
has served as the major pipeline for Phase 3 testing in newly diagnosed high-risk NB patients."
10929492,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cancer remains one of the most common causes of death in the United States, second only to
cardiovascular disease. Great need exists for continued research to prevent cancer and improve outcomes.
Surgeon-scientists are uniquely positioned to translate research findings associated with surgical diseases to
the bedside and operating room. Despite their unique expertise and effectiveness in research, the role of the
surgeon-scientist has historically been threatened for the last few decades. Surgeon-scientists are submitting
fewer career development awards and have lower success rates in obtaining NIH funding. There has been
only small growth in the percentage of surgeons funded by NIH in the past 10 years, but surgical oncologists
represent the largest group of surgeon subspecialists receiving NIH grants. It is critical that we continue to
expand this pool of investigators and develop surgeon-scientists in the field of oncology.
 The overall program goal of the Surgical Oncology Research Training Program at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is to provide surgical residents who are strongly motivated toward a career in
surgical oncology with a comprehensive, mentored research and training experience that prepares them for
successful careers as surgeon-scientists. The program provides surgeon-scientists who intend to enter a
career in academic surgery, particularly in surgical oncology, with the opportunity for basic, translational, and
health services research training in a mentored, multidisciplinary, collaborative environment. The program
leverages the extensive resources of the UAB Department of Surgery, UAB O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer
Center (CCC), the UAB Heersink School of Medicine’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS),
the Office of Postdoctoral Education (OPE), and an abundance of health services and disparities research
programs and centers. The program includes a pool of outstanding extramurally funded trainers from a variety
of cancer-related disciplines. Seven trainees have completed the program; 1 has obtained a faculty position
with NCI funding, and 6 are continuing their clinical training in environments that will facilitate their continued
success in developing independent academic careers. An additional 4 are currently appointed. Several have
obtained additional degrees to advance their scientific knowledge, and several have been successful in
obtaining additional funding to support their fellowship training or further career development. While this is a
new program, it has already been successful in developing its first NIH-funded surgeon-scientist. It has
also attracted a diverse group of trainees, including 27% African American and 82% female. Trainees
have demonstrated excellent productivity as evidenced by publications and national presentations.
These early markers of success are clear indicators of the program’s future ability to produce
extramurally funded surgeon-scientists in the field of surgical oncology."

 Twenty percent of all primary care consults are related to musculoskeletal diseases; 30% of these are
associated with tendinopathies. Pathogenesis of tendinopathy includes increased inflammatory signaling and
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. This remodeling leads to softer tendinopathic tendons, increasing the
risk of tearing. Yet the relative roles of chronic inflammation and ECM stiffness in the initiation and progression
of tendon disease remain controversial and are difficult to decouple in patient populations. We and others have
shown that, in 2D cell culture using interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as a stimulant, patient-derived tendinopathic
fibroblasts exhibit a stronger inflammatory response that is further enhanced on soft substrates. This
inflammatory response is dependent on NF-κB signaling, which we have previously established as a critical
regulator of tendon disease and healing. Yet these studies are limited by the use of classical 2D culture
approaches and fail to recapitulate in vivo cell behavior or provide insight into ECM remodeling. The ability to
visualize cytokine receptor clustering in 3D environments has further demonstrated that cellular sensitivity to
cytokines is based on the properties of the ECM. Although these studies suggest physicochemical coupling
between ECM stiffness (physical) and inflammatory signaling (chemical) that sustains chronic loss of tendon
mechanical function, the mechanisms of how ECM drives cell behavior in 3D tissues like tendon remain
unknown. Therefore, there remains a critical need to define the physicochemical cell-ECM interactions that
regulate tendon function to discover the mechanisms underlying tendinopathies and treatments. Our long-term
goal is to develop therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of tendinopathy by identifying key cell-ECM
mechanisms driving chronic inflammatory tendon disease. Our overall objective in this application is to develop
a novel approach to studying the physicochemical coupling between ECM stiffness and inflammatory signaling
by developing a tendon specific microphysiological system (MPS) with tunable stiffness. In Aim 1 we will
establish a tendon specific MPS with tunable ECM stiffness that quantifies mechanical function in situ. We will
quantify tendon function by measuring micro-cantilever displacement in situ and tune ECM stiffness using light-
induced matrix polymerization. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate that inflammatory signaling in primary human
tendon fibroblasts is modulated by ECM stiffness via inflammatory receptor clustering. In Aim 3 we will
evaluate if and how pathogenic tendon fibroblast phenotype is regulated by ECM stiffness. At the completion of
this proposed work, our expected outcomes are to develop an MPS relevant to tendon function and deliver
new insight into tendon cell-ECM interactions that govern tendon pathogenesis. These results will have a
positive impact by providing the field with a repeatable and tunable platform to improve our understanding of
tendon pathology, ultimately leading to new opportunities for the development of novel therapies."

10757033,"ABSTRACT
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), including various brain anomalies
and microcephaly. Our recent studies suggested that yolk sac (YS)-derived microglia (primary immune cells in
the brain) and Peli1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) are involved in ZIKV infection and its associated CZS. However, it
is unknown whether and how Peli1 contributes to the YS-microglia-mediated spread of ZIKV into brain, whether
viral infection affects the normal function of microglia, and how such effects influence neural differentiation.
Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Peli1 plays a critical role in fetal brain ZIKV infection via
promoting YS-microglia-mediated ZIKV dissemination into fetal brain and via altering microglial function to affect
neural differentiation. This hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims: 1) to determine how Peli1 promotes
ZIKV infection of YS-microglia and virus dissemination from microglia to neural stem cells in fetal brains; and 2)
to determine how Peli1 mediates microglial activation and alters neural differentiation after ZIKV infection. This
integrative study employs biochemical and genetic manipulations in both in vivo animal models and in vitro
mouse and human cell platforms. The outcomes will be evaluated by molecular, cellular, and neuroanatomical
analyses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in ZIKV-related brain
infection may lead to identification of new targets for prevention and treatment of ZIKV and other virus-mediated
congenital neural infections."
10903993,"Project Summary
Motivation: In the United States, approximately 1 in 300 non-Hispanic Caucasians have hereditary
hemochromatosis with varying rates in other ethnicities and races. Transfusion hemosiderosis often develops in
cancer patients who have received repeated blood transfusions for cancer-related anemia treatment. Iron
overload, if left untreated, can cause fatal organ damage. Treatment of iron overload aims at reducing body iron
stores with phlebotomy or chelation therapy to maintain sufficiently low body iron levels while minimizing adverse
effects. Liver iron concentration is widely accepted for the best indicator of total body iron stores; therefore,
accurate liver iron quantification improves clinical management of iron overload and minimizes side effects of
chelator administration. MRI-based R2* relaxometry (R2*-MRI) is a noninvasive clinical standard for liver iron
quantification with no ionizing radiation due to its sensitivity to the presence of tissue iron. R2*-MRI acquires
images at multiple time points to estimate R2* (= 1/T2*) relaxation rates at each voxel. However, clinically
available R2*-MRI is prone to patient movement such as respiratory motion that breath-holding is commonly
practiced during scan. Breath-holding is challenging for children and some adults, and unsatisfactory breath-
holding leads to poor R2* values. The other challenge with the current R2*-MRI is caused by signal loss due to
rapid T2* decay in the presence of a high concentration of iron. Severe iron loading is commonly seen in patients
with transfusion-induced iron overload, and the current R2*-MRI does not reliably capture such a rapid signal
decay, resulting in inaccuracy in R2* measurements. This project addresses these challenges to provide novel
R2*-MRI methods for accurate and consistent liver iron quantification.
Approach: The project has two development aims that are validated on clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable rapid
free-breathing ultrashort TE MRI, which acquires images at multiple time points for R2* measurements. Such
acquisition is achieved by incorporating a 3D center-out k-space trajectory with multiple data readouts with self-
navigator without scan time overhead, facilitating parallel imaging compressed sensing. Aim 2 will enable
retrospectively motion-corrected image reconstruction that makes use of a low-rank tensor structure of the
acquired 3D spatiotemporal volumetric data. We will develop strategies for data parallelism and distributed
computing for computationally demanding tensor-based multidimensional reconstruction. Aim 3 will determine
the performance of the innovations in a clinical setting.
Significance: This work will lead to rapid, robust, free-breathing abdominal MRI for more accurate assessment
of liver iron overload in children and adults. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in quantitative
body imaging."
10744200,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Repeated major depressive episodes are particularly problematic for older adults who have a more brittle
recovery than younger adults. Our data show that, despite antidepressant treatment, almost 60% of remitted
older adults experience recurrence within four years. Beyond simply relying on past history and reported
current stress, it is unclear what neurobiological factors are prospectively associated with recurrence risk,
when these factors trigger recurrence, and how they contribute to the high rates of cognitive impairment
observed in late-life depression (LLD). Using a model of network homeostasis, we posit that depressive
episodes are characterized by disrupted homeostasis in key neural networks involved in affect regulation and
cognitive function. Our preliminary data indicate that treatment non-remitters have residual functional network
alterations and high network instability (higher fluctuations in temporal signal-to-noise ratio). We hypothesize
that remitters with residual functional network alterations and greater instability remain at high risk of
recurrence with subsequent stress exposure. This disequilibrium contributes to subsyndromal symptoms
followed by full recurrence. These processes may also contribute to the higher rate of cognitive impairment and
decline observed in LLD. Our groups have reported elevated rates of cognitive decline in remitted LLD and an
association of recurrence with accelerated brain aging. We hypothesize that greater neural reactivity to stress
may accelerate brain aging and cognitive decline and that deficits/variability in performance on tasks
dependent on ECN may serve as markers of network alterations and signal increased recurrence risk. The
goals of this study are to A) identify neurobiological factors that predict recurrence risk, and B) examine how
cognitive performance changes are both influenced by these same neurobiological factors and also predict
recurrence risk. Our approach is to conduct a three-site, two-year longitudinal study of remitted LLD and
never-depressed elders. Every 8 months we will conduct laboratory assessments, including clinical, cognitive
and neuroimaging assessments and an in-scanner stress paradigm, along with burst ecological momentary
assessments (EMA) of mood variability, stress exposure, cognitive performance, and passive actigraphy. As
an exploratory goal, we will examine whether continuous ecological monitoring of mood and activity can
provide early detection of recurrence. A subgroup will be continuously monitored by EMA and actigraphy for
state shifts (persistent worsening) or variance shifts (increased variability) in symptom severity. When shifts in
mood symptoms are identified, they will engage in ad-hoc clinical and neuroimaging testing. Results from this
study may be translated in clinical practice through the future development of easy-to-use platforms (e.g. apps)
that signal to clinicians increased risk of impending recurrence, thus allowing for swift therapeutic intervention."

 Our long-term goal is to develop a novel soft robotic endoscope with intelligent tactile sensing balloons and
complementary machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) algorithms to enhance early-stage detection,
accurate tumor localization, and treatment stratification of various gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. This robotic
framework provides clinicians with (i) a safe and intuitively-steerable soft robotic endoscope to perform precise
diagnosis, biopsy, and surgical procedures; (ii) in vivo high-fidelity visual, textural, and stiffness information of
the diagnosed anatomy; (iii) in vivo radiation-free quantified topographic mapping and morphological
characterization (i.e., shape and texture) of GI polyps using CV algorithms; (iv) intelligent real-time in vivo
classification of type and stiffness of detected polyps using ML algorithms; and more importantly (v) quantitative
evaluations of tumor response during chemo- and radiation-therapy period via in vivo topographic/stiffness
mapping. Considering the 2-year timeline of this collaborative project, in this proposal, we will mainly
focus on the design, development, and thorough evaluation of a novel and soft Vision-based Tactile
Sensing Balloon (VTSB) with complementary Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms to perform high-resolution in vivo topographic mapping and stiffness classification of
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) polyps.
 CRC is the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide. In 2020, CRC accounted for 1.9 million
new cases (i.e., #3 cancer type in ranking) and 935,000 new deaths (i.e., #2 cancer type in ranking). Since
survival outcomes differ significantly based on the tumor stage at the time of detection, early detection via
colonoscopy has a significant impact on treatment outcomes. Morphological characteristics (i.e., shape and
texture) and change in the modulus of elasticity of CRC polyps are well-known to be associated with tumor type
and stage. Colonoscopic procedures, therefore, are of paramount importance as they can help in early detection
and removal of pre-cancerous polyps. However, state-of-the-art traditional colonoscopic procedures still solely
rely on visual 2D/3D images and cannot yet provide the clinicians with in vivo detailed textural and stiffness
feedback. These limitations has caused high polyp miss rate (about 20%-30%) as well as heavily subjective and
evaluator-dependent tumor identification and classifications.
 It is our central hypothesis that utilizing the proposed VTSB with complementary ML and CV algorithms, can
collectively address the limitations of the state-of-the-art colonoscopic technologies by (1) readily integrating with
the existing colonoscopic systems and not changing the current clinical diagnosis workflow, (2) providing high-
resolution 4D imaging (3D texture mapping + stiffness classification), (3) decreasing polyp miss-rate, and (4)
enhancing in vivo polyps’ type and stage classification. The proposed contribution is significant, high impact, and
innovative and our goal is to demonstrate that it can significantly improve the current diagnosis procedures and
shift the current clinical paradigm."
10874563,"Abstract
Bacterial protein secretion is a fundamental physiological process that generates the cell envelope and maintains
its integrity throughout the bacterial life cycle. In bacterial pathogens, a variety of protein secretion systems have
been shown to deploy important virulence factors to the bacterial surface, into the milieu, or even directly into
eukaryotic cells or other bacteria. Borrelia spirochetes, the causative agents of tick-borne Lyme disease and
relapsing fever, have a unique double-membrane envelope with periplasmic flagella. The Borrelia surface lacks
lipopolysaccharide and is instead covered by abundant, immunodominant and serotype-defining surface
lipoproteins that serve as linchpins for transmission and pathogenesis. A recent study has shown that two thirds
of the about 130 lipoproteins expressed by the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi localize to the
surface. Therefore, B. burgdorferi is a perfect model organism for investigations into the secretion of bacterial
surface lipoproteins.
 Several seminal studies have demonstrated that (i) Borrelia surface lipoprotein secretion determinants
commonly localize to N-terminal disordered tether regions of the mature lipoproteins, (ii) translocation through
the outer membrane can initiate at a lipoprotein’s C terminus and requires an at least partially unfolded
conformation, and (iii) Borrelia surface lipoproteins are ultimately anchored in the surface leaflet of the outer
membrane bilayer. These data support the hypothesis that the Borrelia surface lipoprotein secretion pathway
includes a periplasmic mechanism that prevents premature folding of surface lipoprotein and an outer membrane
translocon complex that allows for the flipping of lipoproteins from the periplasm to the surface.
 This proposal will test the above hypothesis by identifying and mechanistically defining the components
of the B. burgdorferi surface lipoprotein secretion pathway. Aim 1 will build on recent CRISPRi gene silencing
data and employ site-directed mutagenesis and quantitative proteomics to begin determining the structure-
function relationships of a B. burgdorferi outer membrane protein shown to facilitate translocation of lipoproteins
from the periplasm to the surface. Fluorescent tags will be used to further define the sequestration of the B.
burgdorferi lipoproteome in space and time. Aim 2 will use the same approaches as well as X-ray crystallography
to characterize periplasmic proteins that are hypothesized to release surface lipoproteins from the inner
membrane and deliver them to the outer membrane.
 Together, these experiments will use novel approaches to further elucidate how emerging pathogens of
global importance generate and maintain their interface with the host. This will ultimately yield better tools for
diagnostics and improved strategies for prevention and treatment."

 We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect
nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain
networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance
use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize
treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk
a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.
 Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity
biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or
placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS
treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this
biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment
optimization.
 With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker
monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to
participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard
rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker.
Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized
and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression
biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally,
my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid
biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments."

In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death, and it is projected that 39.5% of all US
adults will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes. Carcinomas comprise up to 90% of all US cancer cases.
Chemotherapeutics and antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising treatments for these
cancers but are not effective in all cases and exact a large toll on the quality of life of patients due to off-target
toxicity. The goal of this proposal is to develop a peptide-based hydrogel therapeutic platform for the local
delivery of chemotherapeutics and ICIs to maximize treatment efficacy and mitigate systemic toxicity.
Boronic acid-containing small molecule drugs (BACSMs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutics for the
treatment of cancer. Bortezomib is an FDA-approved BACSM for the treatment of multiple myeloma and
causes immunogenic cancer cell death to help the body develop an anti-cancer immune response. There is
interest to expand the use of bortezomib to solid tumors but these efforts face challenges due to the inability to
maintain high local concentrations in the tumor without systemic toxicity. Multidomain peptide (MDP) hydrogels
are self-adjuvanting materials that have been investigated for cancer immunotherapy and drug delivery. The
limitations of bortezomib may be ameliorated by using MDPs hydrogels as a local drug delivery platform by
allowing for local intratumoral drug delivery to maximize treatment efficacy while minimizing off-target toxicity.
Boronic acids are known to form dynamic covalent bonds with diols, catechols, and salicylhydroxamic acids
(SHAs), which I plan to use to control the delivery of anti-cancer BACSMs from hydrogels. In the F99 phase of
this proposal, I aim to develop catechol- and SHA-functionalized MDP hydrogels for local bortezomib delivery
to improve the efficacy, safety, and accessibility of this chemotherapeutic treatment. I hypothesize that MDP
adjuvancy will synergize with bortezomib-induced immunogenic cell death to generate protective anti-cancer
immunity in a murine model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). These boronic acid-binding
MDPs can be used to control the release of any payload that has a boronic acid moiety. Thus, in the K00
phase of this proposal, I aim to modify ICI antibodies with noncanonical boronic acid motifs to fine-tune their
release from the designed MDPs. I will use this platform to intratumorally co-deliver bortezomib with immune
checkpoint inhibitors to facilitate an anti-cancer immune response in murine models of HNSCC, melanoma,
and breast cancer to demonstrate the broad utility of this platform. These materials could help treat patients
with malignant tumors and protect them from cancer recurrence after treatment while mitigating side effects
associated with chemotherapy and ICIs."

The weaponization of Ultrapotent synthetic opioids (UPS) has made finding a novel reversal agent a priority. The
current opioid response agent, Naloxone, is not as effective against UPS opioids and does not reverse one of
its known effects, wooden chest syndrome. Our long-term goal is to define the biological basis of opioid
overdose risk and promote the discovery of safe and effective agents that reverse fentanyl lethality. A key
objective is determining the molecular mechanisms underlying individual variability to fentanyl toxicity using
genetically diverse mice. In aim 1 we plan to identify genes and variants that modify the influence of Mcoln1 on
acute UPS opioid toxicity. Mcoln1 was identified in a GWAS study of overdose risk, and preliminary data support
a genetic knockout of Mcoln1 resulting in death more rapidly from morphine or fentanyl. We will create an
additional CRISPR knockout of Mcoln1 on a more sensitive genetic background, NOD/ShiLtJ and compare it
with the C57BL/6 knockout we have for response to the UPS opioid fentanyl. The LD50 will be determined for
these strains using our piezoelectric respiratory depression detection system. We will also study respiratory
mechanics and pulmonary and chest wall impedance in response to three doses of fentanyl. In another cohort
of mice, they will be tested by plethysmography to acquire respiratory metrics such as tidal volume and minute
ventilation. We will also collect arterial blood to measure blood gases of oxygen and carbon dioxide during the
plethysmography session to monitor the response to fentanyl at that level. Finally, another cohort of naïve and
fentanyl-treated mice will be dissected for brain stems. The pre-bötzinger complex will be identified and analyzed
by single-nucleus RNA-Seq, comparing the cellular populations and differential gene expression across
genotypes, sexes and treatments. In aim 2 we plan to identify the physiological, neural, and molecular
mechanisms of variable fentanyl-induced toxicity and lethality among eight inbred mouse strains. These eight
strains, which served as the foundation for the advanced mouse populations of the Collaborative Cross and
Diversity Outbred mice, contain approximately 45 million SNPs segregating between them. We have determined
that the LD50 for fentanyl varies > 150-fold across both sexes of the eight strains. As in aim 1, in aim 2 we will
phenotype cohorts of mice to detect the diverse phenomena associated with UPS opioids, including Opioid-
Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD), Opioid-Induced Persistent Apnea (OIPA), Wooden Chest Syndrome
(WCS), closure/collapse of the upper and cardiovascular/hemodynamic disturbances. This phenotyping will be
coupled to identifying the cellular populations, through single nucleus RNA-Seq, within the brainstem pre-
bötzinger region that varies across naïve and fentanyl-treated strains of both sexes of mice. The differentially
expressed genes that define these populations will help us identify targets for therapeutic development
associated with the different fentanyl lethality phenotypes."

 We are a current Environmental influences on Children's Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort awardee (Cohort
Identifier “Maternal Vitamin C Supplementation to Decrease Effects of Smoking during Pregnancy on Infant Lung
Function and Health” [VCSIP]) with expertise in upper and lower airway outcomes and analysis of associated
epigenetic mechanisms. We have been part of the ECHO cohort since its inception in 2016. This application is
to renew our participation in the ECHO Program for an additional seven years (9/2023-8/2030). The overall goal
of this renewal of the ECHO program is to extend the longitudinal follow-up of existing ECHO Cohort participants
and add new pregnant participants. The ECHO Cohort was successfully established by combining data and
biospecimens from multiple maternal-child cohorts such that there is now data and biospecimens from up to
60,000 children and their families. This robust and ongoing data set offers a tremendous opportunity to
collaboratively investigate multiple simultaneous exposures on one or more health outcomes.
 Multiple prenatal factors that can adversely affect lung development and place an infant on a lower lung
function trajectory and increase risk of lung disease. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is a well-
established risk factor for impaired fetal lung development, decreased airway function, and an increased risk for
wheeze and asthma in the offspring. We have shown that supplemental vitamin C (500 mg/day) to pregnant
cigarette smokers significantly improves their offspring's lung function through 5 years of age and decreases the
occurrence of wheeze. We have also demonstrated specific and stable epigenetic changes associated with
MSDP in pathways linked to lung development. The focus of this application are the effects of in utero exposure
to smoking on offspring lung function and respiratory health as modified by in utero exposure to air pollution,
vaping, and/or cannabis as well as the potential modulation by postnatal exposures. In specific aim 1, we will
leverage ECHO Cohort Protocol 3.0 core data elements to characterize the epigenetic signatures in placenta
and offspring associated with MSDP, and examine their additive predictive value relative to additional prenatal
and postnatal exposures. In specific aim 2, we will leverage ECHO cohorts with airway-specialized outcomes
(yearly
exposure
postnatal
spirometry and twice-yearly respiratory questionnaires) to characterize the relationships between fetal
to MSDP on airway function and wheeze during childhood as modified by multi-factorial prenatal and
exposures.We hypothesize that MSDP will significantly affect clinical respiratory outcomes including
wheeze and airway function trajectories up to 21 years of age. We also hypothesize that these effects will be
modified by the multi-factorial exposures that ECHO will be measuring. Given our cohort's excellent track record
during the initial phase of ECHO (2016-present) as outlined in specific aim 3 and our scientific background, we
are well poised to continue to lead scientific investigations in the area of upper and lower airway outcomes and
epigenetic mechanisms associated with these outcomes in the renewal phase of the ECHO."

This project proposes the development of new methods and data resources to integrate modern artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques into predictive toxicology, as well as the application of those methods and resources to generate new hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes. The recent explosion of publicly available chemical and biomedical data provides an immensely valuable resource for computational toxicologists, but existing techniques for learning
from these data perform poorly and fail to capture crucial patterns that span multiple levels of biological organization. For
example, the US FDA maintains a computational toxicology database cataloguing over 875 thousand chemicals of toxicologic concern, yet only a small handful of these have been characterized in terms of their downstream clinical effects.
However, informatics and machine learning (ML) provide specific tools that may solve this issue. This project focuses on
2 of those in particular: Graph machine learning (Graph ML) and semantic data analysis. Since both of these techniques
allow for the integration of information from multiple otherwise incongruent sources, they have the capacity to outperform
simpler traditional methods for pattern discovery, while increasing both inferential capacity and statistical power.
 Our central hypothesis is that inductive learning on semantic graph data provides an effective means for generating
and validating translational and mechanistic conclusions from existing public toxicology data. In Aim 1 (K99), a new
data infrastructure—driven by a large, ontology-controlled graph database aggregating public toxicology data—will
be constructed and evaluated on several important tasks in computational toxicology. Together, these resources will
be named `ComptoxAI'. Aim 2 (K99) will develop and apply a graph machine learning strategy to predict new adverse
outcome pathways (AOPs) in the graph database. Importantly, this aim will use an automated machine learning (Auto
ML) approach to discover optimized neural network architectures for this prediction task in a data-driven manner. This
Auto ML strategy will use estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to search for optimized network architectures
in a probabilistic manner. An expected side effect of the Auto ML approach is increased model interpretability over
existing applications of Graph ML. Aim 3 (R00) will use semantic data analysis via ontological inference to refine Aim 2's
model outputs into meaningful knowledge, proposing specific mechanistic explanations for the newly proposed AOPs.
Aim 4 (R00) will use the resources and outcomes of the previous Aims as a starting point to develop and disseminate
new open-source data standards, software resources, and research reporting protocols, with the goal of creating a
collaborative, cross-institutional research ecosystem for AI research in computational toxicology.
 Beyond the methodological and infrastructural contributions of this work, successful completion of the Specific Aims
will yield a library of mechanistically-based hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes, addressing
a major need in predictive toxicology. In supporting the goals of the open science movement, all research outcomes
from this project—including papers, software, data, and other resources—will be made available for free public reuse."
10745268,"ABSTRACT
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/HER2-negative breast cancer represents 70% of all breast cancer cases.
Surgery and adjuvant/neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) are mainstays of treatment in early stage disease.
However, some patients receiving ET for early stage ER-positive breast cancer only have a partial reduction in
their risk of recurrence and mortality, and those with advanced breast cancer (ABC) either progress shortly after
initiating therapy (intrinsic resistance), or ultimately experience progression over time (acquired resistance).
CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is) with ET are currently considered standard of care for patients with advanced ER
+/HER2 negative breast cancer. A key feature of CDK4/6 inhibition is the cell cycle inhibitory response it elicits
through induction of senescence, which can be escaped resulting in cells readily re-entering the cell cycle as
soon as drug is withdrawn. Senescent cells secrete interleukins, inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors,
which comprise the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that affects surrounding cells and
promotes tumor growth. The most prominent SASP cytokine is interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is associated with
metastasis, tumor aggressiveness and decreased survival. IL-6 activates STAT3, which is associated with a
more aggressive phenotype and resistance to many therapies [chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy]. We developed CDK4/6i (i.e. palbociclib) resistant breast tumor cell line models and
their molecular analysis showed that resistant cells adapt to palbociclib treatment by upregulation of IL-6 and
activation of STAT3 (phosphorylation of STAT3 on Y705, pY-STAT3). Treatment of the resistant cells with an
oral, small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 (TTI-101) decreased cell viability by >25-fold and resulted in decreased
levels of pY-STAT3 with concomitant decreases in (i) stem-like (CD44high/CD24low) population, (ii) primary and
secondary mammosphere formation, (iii) the EMT pathway. Furthermore, TTI-101 treatment of mice bearing
patient derived xenografts (PDX) that express a similar gene expression signature as palbociclib-resistant cell
lines resulted in a marked decrease in tumor volume, prolonged tumor-free survival and downregulation of serum
IL-6 levels. We hypothesize that inhibition of IL-6 and/or STAT3 can reverse acquired CDK4/6i resistance in vivo
transgenic and PDX models and in patients who have progressed on CDK4/6i based therapy. We propose a
coordinated mechanistic, preclinical and early phase clinical testing strategy to develop biomarker-qualified
therapy for the clinical need to overcome CDK4/6i resistance. To address these goals we will 1): Determine the
mechanism of IL-6 induction by long term CDK4/6 inhibition in vivo and the impact of IL-6 on tumorigenesis in
transgenic mouse models; 2) Conduct pre-clinical trials in palbociclib resistant PDX and transgenic mouse
models to determine if inhibition of STAT3 and IL-6 can improve the survival of mice with CDK4/6i resistant
tumors; and 3) Perform a Phase IB/II clinical trial of adding TTI-101 to standard of care palbociclib and aromatase
inhibitor upon progression."
10745273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 10-12% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations harbor in-frame
mutations or insertions within exon 20 of EGFR. Unlike NSCLC patients bearing “typical” EGFR mutations
(L858R or exon 19 deletions), these patients with exon 20 mutations are highly resistant to FDA-approved first-
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib or gefitinib, with an objective response rate of
approximately 4-8% and a median PFS of 2 months; by comparison, first-generation TKIs lead to an objective
response rate of ~60% and a PFS of ~10 months in patients with typical EGFR mutations. The population
impacted by EGFR exon 20 mutations is sizable: approximately 2,000-3,000 patients per year in the US and
approximately 27,000 patients per year worldwide. Until recently, no treatment strategies had been identified
that were tailored for this patient population. We recently reported the results of a detailed structure-function
analysis and screening effort that led to the identification of the TKI poziotinib as a potent and clinically active
inhibitor of EGFR exon 20 mutant tumors. Based on our preclinical data we have conducted a phase II trial of
poziotinib. Initial results indicate high anti-tumor activity with best objective response of PR (partial response) in
55% of 44 evaluable patients. However, some patients do not initially respond to treatment (primary resistance)
and, for the patients who do respond initially, acquired resistance is a clinical challenge. Our goals are to
elucidate the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to poziotinib and other potential EGFR exon 20-
targeted therapies. We find that in preclinical models, primary resistance may be associated with size and
location of the specific insertion, with a greater distance of the insertion from the α-c-helix associated with a lower
sensitivity to poziotinib. Moreover, we have generated evidence from preclinical models and NSCLC patients
indicating that acquired resistance may be mediated through multiple mechanisms, some EGFR-dependent (e.g.
additional EGFR alterations) and others EGFR-independent (e.g. activation of alternate signal bypass
pathways). We hypothesize that a) the sensitivity of different exon 20 insertions/mutations to specific TKIs will
be dictated by the insertion size and location and treatment may be tailored based on this information; and b)
that acquired resistance occurs through both EGFR-dependent and independent mechanisms that can be
targeted. We will test these hypotheses through an integrative, multidisciplinary effort involving preclinical
studies, molecular modeling, and ongoing clinical studies. In Aim 1, we will investigate primary resistance and
the structure-function relationship between specific insertions and drug response; in Aim 2, we will investigate
the mechanisms of EGFR-dependent acquired resistance, and in Aim 3 we will investigate EGFR-independent
mechanisms. These studies will help guide the selection of TKIs based on a patients’ mutation, and will provide
a road map for the future development of improved TKIs and more effective combinations to delay or prevent
the emergence of drug resistance in this group of patients for which no targeted treatments currently exist."
10886109,"Tumor metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer progression, survival, and therapeutic resistance. A
targetable class of cancer metabolic adaptation exploits mitophagy, a specialized autophagy pathway known to
be linked to the cancer phenotype. Mitophagy selectively eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria by targeting
them, via autophagosome shuttling, to the lysosome for degradation. Cancer cell mitophagy is triggered by
elevated oxidative stress and mitochondria DNA damage caused by hypoxia, radiotherapy, molecular therapy,
and immunotherapy. A high mitophagy demand can overwhelm the lysosome capacity resulting in the
accumulation of damaged mitochondria that is harmful to the cell, and can suppress biogenesis of healthy
mitochondria. We hypothesize that the newly discovered process of secretory mitophagy exports damaged
mitochondrial fission-released segments to reduce the overload pressure on the lysosomal system, and thereby
sustains cancer cell survival in the face of therapeutic mitochondrial stress. We have discovered a form of
secretory mitophagy occurring in vivo in a growing solid tumor. Our molecular analysis of the full repertoire of
extracellular vesicles (EV) shed into the resident tumor interstitial fluid (IF) in vivo yielded a rich set of information
about the functional state of mitochondria within the tumor cells, and the host cells. Within tumor interstitial fluid,
and within the culture media of cancer cells undergoing oxidative stress, we identified an EV-packaged full set
of mitochondria molecules comprising the peripheral fission pinched-off segment of the mitochondrial organelle.
It has recently been found that peripheral mitophagy fission, regulated by mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1),
is a key essential regulator of mitophagy, and is distinct from mid-zone mitochondria fission associated with
mitochondria biogenesis. We also found that mitophagy inducer PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cleavage status
(full length versus cleaved), is prominently reflected in the set of mitochondrial proteins exported within IF EVs,
and may constitute a new quantitative measurement tool to monitor the real-time state of tumor intracellular
mitophagy. Our findings raise important mechanistic questions, that we will explore in the Aims, concerning the
unknown intracellular steps of secretory mitophagy and how the content of the exported EVs reflects the internal
mitophagy state. Under Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that peripheral fission secretory mitophagy is induced
by high mitophagy demands that overwhelm lysosomal engulfment, and explore if secretory mitophagy is distinct
from secretory autophagy within the murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cell
lines. Under Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the ratio of full length to cleaved PINK1 is elevated
(mitochondria damage sensor) within the exported murine syngeneic breast tumor interstitial fluid EVs, following
treatment with mitophagy inducers Mito-CP and Rapamycin. The outcome is new understanding of the
importance of secretory mitophagy that can constitute an important therapeutic target, and a new clinically
relevant means of monitoring the in vivo state of mitophagic flux within the tumor microenvironment."
10846787,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioids were involved in 75,673 overdose deaths in 2020 in the U.S, in which fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is the
deadliest due to induction of ventilatory depression. Carfentanil (CFN) is another synthetic opioid acting on opioid
mu-receptors (MORs) with a potency 100 times that of fentanyl. Though no intending for therapeutic use,
aerosolized CFN has been applied as a lethal agent (bioweapon) to cause respiratory disorder (RD) and death
in humans. Naloxone increases survival rate of overdose opioids in early reports; however, deaths have been
increasing after synthetic opioid era due to unsuccessful resuscitation attempts in clinical settings. It also fails to
reverse aerosolized CFN-induced RD/death in animals. To date, the characteristics, mechanisms, and effective
countermeasure of acute CFN exposure-induced RD/death are still unclear.
Overdose fentanyl via intravenous (IV) perfusion produces RD including gradual ventilatory depression (dVE)
and then apneas/gasping before death. The RD is believed to result from inhibiting the carotid body O2-receptor
and central CO2-chemoreceptors, especially those in the retrotrapezoid and parafacial nucleus (RTN/PFN) and
the respiratory neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex (PBC, the respiratory rhythm-generator). Interestingly, we
recently reported that IV bolus injection of fentanyl induced an immediate apnea solely mediated by
bronchopulmonary C-fibers (PCFs) in anesthetized rats. Our pilot study further shows that the apnea is
associated with closure of the larynx, constriction of chest expiratory muscles, and silence of inspiratory muscles
(i.e., obstructive and central apnea with chest wall rigidity), which is lethal if overdosed. Moreover, aerosolized
fentanyl (100 mg/m3 for 10 min) initially triggers the similar apnea followed by dVE and gasping, leading to death
~10 min post exposure in anesthetized rats. In this proposal, we, therefore, will characterize the cardiorespiratory
(respiratory muscles’) responses to acute CFN exposure in awake rats and determine the causal roles of
peripheral and central MORs (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will mechanistically demonstrate that CFN exposure
stimulates PCFs to trigger the initial apneas and then inhibits the carotid body, RTN/PFN CO2-sensitive and PBC
respiratory neurons to produce dVE and gasping (apneas) by acting on local MORs (Aim 2). Doxapram is a
potent respiratory stimulant to the carotid body, while CX717 can enhance respiratory frequency and respiratory
drive via acting on the PBC and strengthen central CO2-chemoreception. Both agents are capable of reversing
opioid-induced RD in animals and humans. This, along with MOR internalization in vagal sensory neurons and
blockade of IV injection of fentanyl-induced apnea by dermorphin pretreatment (a peripherally acting MOR
agonist, IV) in our pilot study, allows us to define if a cocktail pretreatment of dermorphin, doxapram, and CX717
is a countermeasure for CFN-induced RD/death (Aim 3).
A multidisciplinary approach (electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and pharmacology) at systemic and
cellular levels will be employed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying acute CFN exposure-induced RD/death
and evaluate the efficacy of the cocktail pretreatment. The expected data will, for the first time, mechanistically
reveal the key roles of PCFs, the carotid body, RTN/PFN and PBC in generating the CFN-induced RD and
provide a novel and potential countermeasure to prevent/diminish the RD/death."

For task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the positive blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) response has been widely used and often assumed that it linearly reflects local neural activity.
However, a significant portion of brain regions responds with signal decreases upon activation, known as the
negative BOLD response (NBR). Although the negative BOLD response (NBR) and its origin have been
explored extensively, temporal characteristics and spatial structure of the NBR, and corresponding underlying
physiological dynamics are still poorly understood.
 We propose to investigate dynamics of the NBR evoked by a brief stimulus –the negative hemodynamic
response function (nHRF) and its underlying neurovascular and neurometabolic responses using our novel
experimental paradigms with high spatiotemporal resolution BOLD and arterial spin labelling (ASL) fMRI
modalities. High spatial and temporal resolution BOLD measurements will resolve temporal dynamics of the
nHRF as a functional of cortical depth and distance from adjacent positive BOLD responses along the cortical
surface. We also evaluated shift-invariant temporal linearity by measuring dynamics of the NBR for varying
stimulus durations. Fine spatiotemporal sampling ASL measurements in conjunction with a novel stimulus-
onset-time dithering scheme will provide accurate quantification of the cerebral blood flow associated with the
NBR within gray matter. We advance our novel computational model based on prompt arterial dynamics
observed in recent experimental studies, enabling estimation of realistic neurometabolic response associated
with the nHRF. The model will offer a better detailed interpretation of the underlying physiological components
associated with the nHRF.
 Our proposed research will provide a detailed understanding of neurovascular and neurometabolic
(de-)coupling associated with nHRF, expanding our knowledge of normal brain functions. Such details with
precision to understand the NBR and its physiology was not available in previous studies. Ultimately, success
of our proposed research will motivate use of the proposed fMRI approaches and modeling schemes for brain
pathologies that involve neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling."
10745665,"Abstract
Malignant gliomas continue to be the most aggressive and lethal of all brain tumors. In spite of improvements in
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, median survival remains ~18-24 months. Gliomas are infiltrative
tumors that invade the surrounding normal brain tissue making total surgical resection impossible. Tumor cells
that remain after surgery eventually lead to tumor recurrence, causing the demise of the patients. Collagen
plays an important role in the progression of various tumors such as breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. Its
role in gliomas, however, remains poorly understood. Cellular, molecular and functional preliminary data have
identified Collagen1A1 (Col1A1) as an important determinant of tumor progression and invasion. An important
role of Col1A1 in patient survival is supported by the analysis of TCGA, and GLASS, data from human primary
and recurrent gliomas that indicate that median survival is inversely correlated with levels of Col1A1. Human
and experimental mouse gliomas contain fascicles of elongated mesenchymal-like tumor cells that represent
areas of collective motion within the tumor invasive border, and the tumor core; an increase in the density of
these areas is associated with worse prognosis in preclinical mouse models and in human patients. scRNAseq
followed by RNAscope identified two types of cells that express significant levels of Col1A1. High Col1A1-
expressing cells are found within perivascular stroma cells, and glioma cells themselves express lower, but
significant levels of Col1A1. Using laser-microdissection of the mesenchymal-like structures followed by
RNAseq we confirmed that areas of collective motion are enriched in mesenchymal markers such as Col1A1
and ACTA2. These experiments predict an important role for Col1A1 in tumor progression. This was examined
by expressing a shRNA for Col1A1 during the induction of genetically engineered mouse models of glioma
(GEMMs) using our Sleeping Beauty system. Indeed, knockdown of Col1A1 from tumor cells from incipient
GEMMs increased median survival and eliminated areas of fascicles of elongated mesenchymal-like tumor
cells; however, tumors still progressed, animals became moribund, and perivascular expression of Col1A1
remained. This raises the possibility that expression of Col1A1 in perivascular stromal cells plays an important
role in glioma progression. What is not known is if Col1A1 depletion from either tumor or perivascular stromal
cells within established tumors will delay tumor progression and reduce collective motion. Thus, there is a
critical need for a mechanistic understanding of how Col1A1 contributes to glioma progression and invasion.
Our overall objectives are to establish the role of each cellular compartment that expresses Col1A1 on glioma
growth and invasion (AIM 1), the functional role of Col1A1 expression in either cellular compartment on glioma
dynamics (AIM 2), and the role of collagen and its receptors on the response of gliomas to radiation (AIM 3).
Our central hypothesis is that Col1A1 expressing cells play a significant role in glioma progression and
invasion and that blocking Col1A1 and/or its receptors could uncover a novel therapeutic target for GBM."

The goal of our first funded R01 grant was to unravel the cell type(s), if any, altered in the human prefrontal
cortex (PFC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We discovered a decreased number of Chandelier (Ch) cells
in the PFC of postmortem human tissue in ASD patients. In our first renewed R01 we proposed to define the role
of Ch cells in the PFC in ASD. We found an alteration of components of the GABA system in Ch cells in the PFC
in autism. Here, in our second R01 renewal application, we propose to follow up our studies by determining Ch
cell pathophysiology association to ASD symptomatology in PFC, other cortical areas, and in subcortical areas
known to be involved in ASD. Ch cells are the interneurons that regulates the final output of excitatory projection
neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Therefore, the loss of a single Ch cell may critically
impair proper function of projection neurons and the anatomical structure as a whole. This proposal will explore
the hypothesis that disturbances in Ch cell number in several areas of the cerebral cortex and subcortical areas
contribute to the altered function of the GABAergic system reported in the ASD brain. We also hypothesize that
a decreased number of Ch cells in dentate gyrus translates into a decreased rate of neurogenesis in ASD. We
will also test the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the pathophysiological alterations of Ch cells
and the severity of patient’s symptoms. We will test these hypotheses by quantifying the number of Ch cells in
specific areas of the neocortex (aim 1a,b), hippocampal formation (aim 2a,c), and amygdala (aim 3a,b) in ASD,
and correlating these numbers with patient behavior. We will also assess the number of progenitor cells and
immature neurons in the dentate gyrus in ASD (aim 2b). The number and function of Ch cells outside the PFC
has not yet been evaluated in ASD. Our proposal addresses this gap in knowledge. This project will greatly
expand our understanding of the GABAergic Ch system function in ASD, which will have a great impact on
translational research directed towards providing better treatment paradigms for individuals with ASD."
10745690,"This revised R01 application focuses on elucidating the cell type specific functions of the Fmr1 gene in the pathogenesis of social impairments that characterize autism spectrum disorder (ASD); a first step in a larger project aimed at identifying circuit based approaches which could act as therapeutics for treating ASD. Based on extensive preliminary findings, our overall hypothesis is that the loss of Fmr1 gene function in oxytocin (OT) neurons leads to disruption of mechanisms that normally subserve social reward learning, and that closure of the social reward learning critical period limits the efficacy of therapeutic interventions delivered in adulthood. Our hypothesis was formulated based on research in our laboratory demonstrating that acute deletion of Fmr1 in parvocellular OT neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) recapitulates social reward learning phenotypes observed in constitutive Fmr1 KO mice. In addition, we have discovered a novel critical period for social reward learning, and identified manipulations to reinstate social reward learning in adulthood. Despite our important preliminary findings, the importance of subtypes of OT neurons in ASD relevant phenotypes is unknown and only minimally been explored. Building on our preliminary insights, we propose to address a number of outstanding questions concerning the cellular, synaptic, circuit, and developmental consequences of Fmr1 deletion, outlined below in Aims 1-4: Aim 1: To determine the molecular and cellular consequences of Fmr1 deletion in oxytocin (OT) neuronal subtypes. Here we will
test the hypothesis that cellular characteristics of parvocellular OT neurons will be selectively impacted by deletion of the Fmr1 gene. Aim 2: To determine the consequences of Fmr1 deletion on OT dependent synaptic plasticity. Here we will test the hypothesis that deletion of Fmr1 will lead to an impairment of OT synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Aim 3: To determine the functional selectivity of OT neuronal subtypes. Here we will test the hypothesis that peer-peer social reward learning deficits will be social domain specific following ablation of OT neurons projecting to the NAc, but not the VTA. Aim 4: To determine the impact of the critical period for social reward learning on the therapeutic approach to Fragile X. Here we will test the hypothesis that social reward learning deficits in Fmr1 KO mice can be corrected if therapeutic interventions are delivered either before the closure of this critical period, or in adulthood if given in conjunction with manipulations that reopen the social reward learning critical period. In addition, the studies proposed in Aims 1-4 will deliver several novel tools for functional genomics. These tools will allow us to perform sophisticated molecular, synaptic and circuit level manipulations. It is our hope that the proposed experiments will provide new insight into how cell type specific mechanisms underlying social reward behavior contribute to the pathogenesis of social deficits in ASD."
10901933,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for ~23% of all hematologic malignancies with a 2.1% of cancer-related deaths
in the United States in 2022. Despite tremendous efforts to develop effective therapies, MM remains largely
incurable, and virtually all patients develop resistance to current therapies. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need
for innovative and improved MM therapeutics. It has been demonstrated that bone marrow endothelium is critical
to MM cell homing, progression, survival, and drug resistance. Specifically, cyclophilin A and E-selectin, a
homing factor and adhesion receptor, respectively, expressed by bone marrow endothelial cells, are critical to
MM survival. Thus, inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin provides a potential therapeutic strategy to abolish
MM dissemination and resistance. However, direct- and specific-inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin by
small molecules has been elusive. Thus, cyclophilin A and E-selectin are promising candidates for combination
RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which inhibits traditionally undruggable targets by directly reducing their
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The challenge of utilizing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) is the need for
safe and effective delivery methods, as siRNA degrades in the bloodstream and does not readily cross
membranes. During my predoctoral studies, I have engineered a library of polymer-lipid hybrid biomaterials, that
in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugates and siRNA, assembled into nanoparticles (NPs)
via microfluidic mixing. Through high-throughput in vivo screening, I identified a NP formulation with potent gene
silencing in bone marrow endothelial cells in vivo. This formulation was used to encapsulate cyclophilin A siRNA,
and showed inhibition of MM progression in vivo, and sensitized MM cells to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
a current therapeutic modality to treat MM. During the F99 phase, I will improve our NP design by incorporating
bone marrow endothelial-targeting ligands on the NP’s surface to enhance their specificity to bone marrow
endothelium, minimizing off-target effects. I will use our targeted NP to co-encapsulate cyclophilin A and E-
selectin siRNA sequences, and evaluate their inhibition in vitro through adhesion and transendothelial migration
assays, to determine the invasive abilities of MM cells. Further, I will test our co-delivery siRNA nanotechnology
through a survival study in a validated mouse xenograft model of MM and quantify its effects either alone or in
combination with bortezomib. This technology is expected to provide with a broadly enabling platform to target
other bone marrow-homing cancers. For the K00 phase, I will identify a renowned cancer biology laboratory to
study cell-cell interactions in the bone marrow immune microenvironment utilizing high-dimensional single-cell
approaches and tissue-engineered models, with the aim to determine mechanisms that drive cancer progression
and drug resistance. Completion of this project will successfully prepare me to launch an NIH-funded research
laboratory that focuses on drug delivery targeting the tumor microenvironment as means of cancer therapy."
10769616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2 (SMALL): INVESTIGATING CLINICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A NOVEL HYPERMETHYLATED SUBTYPE OF METASTATIC
CASTRATION RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (MCRPC)
The lethal phenotype of prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), inevitably
evolves from metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) following androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT). While recent studies have identified genomic and transcriptomic drivers of mCRPC, the epigenetic
landscape of this disease is less well understood. In order to examine the methylation landscape of mCRPC,
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for 100 mCRPC metastases from the West Coast
Prostate Cancer Dream Team (WCDT) cohort, which previously had been profiled with whole-genome and
transcriptome sequencing. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the methylome, a novel
hypermethylated subtype of mCRPC, the CpG methylator phenotype (CMP) was identified. Accounting for
22% of patients in the WCDT cohort, CMP-positive patients constitute one of the most prevalent molecularly
defined subsets of mCRPC. Despite accounting for this substantial proportion of patients, much remains
unknown about this phenotype, including its molecular underpinnings, potential prognostic or predictive
biomarkers, and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. To address these gaps in knowledge this application
proposes to explore the following three aims: (1) To investigate how the CMP phenotype promotes disease
progression, providing a comprehensive view of how the CMP methylation phenotype affects biological
pathways and oncogenic functions; (2) To identify clinically relevant therapeutic approaches for the CMP
mCRPC patient subset, assessing the use of currently available epigenetic agents to treat CMP+ disease, as
well as discover other potential therapeutic targets; (3) To develop and evaluate non-invasive clinical
methylation biomarkers of CMP status, providing a comprehensive assessment of methylation biomarkers
across a range of disease states. Successful completion of these aims will result in defining the clinical
relevance of the hypermethylated CMP mCRPC subtype, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets and
approaches for this phenotype. Ultimately this will set the stage for therapeutic trials in the cohort of CMP-
positive mCRPC patients, as well as a co-targeting strategy together with AR-directed therapies in CMP-
positive CSPC patients."

In the US, state and local laws allowing minors to consent to medical care can directly impact
population health. Prior research suggests increased vaccine uptake among adolescents in
states that allow minors to receive vaccines without parental consent. However, the impact of
real-world effects (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, access to vaccine providers) on this association is
unclear. It is also unknown if this association holds true for COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, the
percent of fully vaccinated 12-17-year-olds largely differs by state (from 11 to 61%), increasing
the risk of spread and negative health outcomes. Traditional efforts that apply mathematical
models to examine population-level outcomes do not account for different vaccine consent (VC)
laws, geospatial effects (e.g., spread within schools), local sociodemographics, or individual be-
haviors (e.g., vaccine hesitancy). To accurately study the impact VC laws as well as other real-
world effects have on COVID-19 transmission and mortality, researchers need to apply a com-
prehensive framework that integrates legal policy with health outcomes. Our proposed model
will apply a legal epidemiology framework that integrates legal and health data. It will leverage
US census data in an agent-based simulation (Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological
Dynamics; FRED), which was designed to include system-level, sociodemographic, geospatial,
and individual effects in its simulation models. Our multidisciplinary team—with expertise in ado-
lescent health, health law, and computational modeling—will merge state- and local-level VC
laws with nationally representative census data within FRED. We will collaborate with commu-
nity partners—including minors, parents, school employees, and pediatricians, among others—
to understand the impact of VC laws on COVID-19 vaccine uptake, explore potential interven-
tions with different legal restrictions, and inform a simulation model. First, we will develop a
comprehensive legal dataset of state- and local-level VC laws for minors. Second, we will col-
laborate with community partners to understand the impact of VC laws and design potential in-
terventions. Third, we will model the effects of various laws, real-world effects, and potential in-
terventions in FRED to assess the impact of these factors on COVID-19 transmission. In sum-
mary, this project will result in a comprehensive legal dataset of VC laws for minors and an evi-
dence-based predictive model of COVID-19 spread and mortality in real-world conditions. The
model’s flexibility can inform researchers on the impact of various VC laws and other real-world
effects that can impact population health."
10767530,"Mitochondrial disease has a minimum prevalence of at least 1 in 5000 adults, with few or no effective
treatments. Mitochondrial disease patients demonstrate enormous biological variation and diverse disorders.
These include neurologic, cardiac, endocrine, kidney, visual, hearing, blood, and skeletal muscle systems.
Imaging and basic science of mitochondria showcase how this highly dynamic organelle responds differentially
to extrinsic, intrinsic and unknown biological signals from roles in metabolism, organ homeostasis, apoptosis
and aging. One unique feature of mitochondria is their dual genome nature where both nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes contribute to its form and function. Sequence variations in either genome each
contribute to human mitochondrial genetic disease. The mitochondrial genome is highly conserved in all
vertebrates, for example the zebrafish mitochondrial genome is nearly identical in size (16kb+) and encodes
the same complement of genes that are organized in the same order as the human mitochondrial genome. A
key bottleneck in the field has been the historical lack of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene manipulation tools
that has greatly restricted the options for studying the differential roles of genetic variation in biology and
disease. However, the advent of mtDNA base editors has enabled a series of new cellular and animal models.
With advanced methods and effective delivery, near-complete editing efficiency capable of introducing over
80% programmed editing efficiency in the pioneering animal the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is now possible,
enabling the establishment of the first designer in vivo models of mtDNA disease.
 This research resource project will be accomplished in three aims: 1) Generating animal models of
mtDNA disease using the established mitoFUSXTBE cytosine base editor. Designer models with single
nucleotide variants will be generated in both protein-coding and tRNA mitochondrial genes. 2) To enhance the
kind of alleles that can be modeled and to develop new, tissue-specific mtDNA animal models, mtDNA
modeling work will be expanded using new mitoFUSXTBE adenine base editor. 3) Community engagement for
allele selection and to enhance access to these new models through education, outreach and sharing plans.
 The outcomes of this work will include a series of validated zebrafish lines harboring designer mtDNA
variants suitable for hypothesis testing as well as discovery science. The molecular toolbox will also be
optimized for utility in helping generate other animal models from work by mitochondrial scientists in the field.
Together, these gene editors and in vivo avatars will enable new approaches for diagnoses and therapies for
these terrible diseases."
10757379,"Project Summary
The adult lung continues to amaze in terms of its complexity and function from the discovery of new cell types to
the understanding of new functions of existing cells and molecular pathways operating during homeostasis and
injury. Never has lung biology received more attention as during the current COVID-19 pandemic where
fundamental studies in lung immunobiology are urgently needed to advance therapeutic development to address
unmet need in acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For the past 15 years, we
have studied lung biology at the intersection of innate immunity and hematology, which are core components of
the NHLBI’s mission. Facilitated by technical development in the intravital imaging of the mouse lung and by
advanced transplantation techniques, we have made fundamental discoveries in this area in the normal and
injured lung that will serve as the basis of the proposed studies in this application. To advance our understanding
of lung injury mechanisms, we will use established models of sterile and pathogen-induced lung injury and extant
ARDS biorepositories developed under previous funding to continue our studies of the contribution of platelets,
neutrophils, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to disease pathogenesis. These studies will include
mechanisms by which antibodies trigger lung injury after blood transfusions or after solid organ transplantation
including the development of novel models of injury and therapeutic targeting. Within this theme, we will continue
studies on distinct populations of megakaryocytes in the adult lung and their roles in platelet biogenesis and lung
immunity. We will explore the hematopoietic potential of the lung by testing the hypothesis that the human lung
contains significant numbers of hematopoietic progenitors that may uniquely contribute to hematopoiesis in
homeostasis and injury and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The environment at UCSF includes
established collaborations and accessibility to advanced Cores that will enable this program of lung biology to
accelerate discoveries under this funding mechanism and move the field forward."
10757381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A structural connectome can provide critical information for animal brain studies to study white matter bundles
and correlate brain circuits with experimental findings. As more animal models for neurological disorders are
widely used to understand the disease mechanism and test possible treatments, tractography atlases will help
those studies to correlate white matter pathways with brain function or dysfunction. Here, we aim to construct
tractography atlases at unprecedented details as structural connectome for mouse, rat, and rhesus macaque
and developed associated toolboxes for novel tractography analytics. To achieve this goal, we have formed a
multidisciplinary team between Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy and the ""DSI Studio"" team at the University
of Pittsburgh. At Duke CIVM, we will acquire the ultra-high resolution ""beyond-tensor"" diffusion MRI on the
mouse, rat, and rhesus macaque brains to resolve complicated axonal structures. The image acquisition will be
accelerated using compressed sensing and further reconstructed using a super-resolution approach. Besides
MRI, the rat and mouse brain tissue will be processed by tissue clearing and scanned by light-sheet
fluorescence microscopy to capture cell-level histology details of the entire brain. The diffusion MRI data will
then be processed at the University of Pittsburgh to construct tractography atlases and develop novel
automated tractography, shape analysis, and bundle analytics toolboxes. We will track whole-brain pathways
and cluster them into bundles. Our neuroanatomist team will validate tractography against publicly available
tracer data and aggregate the results in tractography atlases, which will be used to build their associated atlas-
based automated tractography and associated analysis. The completion of this study will provide a mesoscale
structural connectome with integrated histologic images at unprecedented quality as well as their associated
toolboxes. The data and tools combined will serve as invaluable resources for animal studies to investigate
brain disorders."
10757382,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT.
The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection poses new challenges to the ~3 million persons
with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) worldwide. Major knowledge gaps include the extent to which common MS
disease modifying therapies (DMTs) modulate the COVID-19 risk and severity, the efficacy of the COVID-19
vaccines and any impact on MS neurological outcomes given the exclusion of PwMS from COVID-19 vaccine
trials, and the broader consequence of the pandemic on social connection and health outcomes in PwMS.
These gaps create a critical need to rapidly generate rigorous information with which to guide clinical
management. To address these challenges, we created the MSReCOV (MS Resilience to COVID-19)
Collaborative in late March 2020 by assembling a network of MS Centers to leverage existing clinical research
infrastructure and collect patient-reported data. Given the reduced interaction between PwMS and healthcare
systems and the restriction on in-person research activities at the onset and during subsequent phases, we
rapidly deployed online survey studies to gather real-time data directly from PwMS during the pandemic to
complement the effort of physician-reported registries. To complement MSReCOV, we will interrogate the
Optum data warehouse of integrated claims and electronic health records data from a virtual cohort of ~40,000
commercially insured PwMS (per year). Building on the MSReCOV and Optum infrastructure, we propose the
following aims to address the knowledge gaps. Aim 1: Examine the association between MS DMTs and
COVID-19. We will test the hypothesis that certain DMTs such as IFNb are associated with reduced COVID-
19 risk, while others such as B-cell depleting agents are associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Aim 2:
Examine the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety in MS and association with MS outcomes. We will
first test the hypothesis that COVID-19 vaccines are effective and safe in PwMS and do not worsen clinically
relevant patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of neurological function, and secondarily test the hypothesis that B-
cell depleting treatments reduce vaccine efficacy whereas other DMTs do not. Aim 3: Examine the effect of
the pandemic on personal social network and MS outcomes in PwMS. Building on our prior works, we will
test the hypothesis that the pandemic (independent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection) negatively influences the
neurological function in PwMS by altering personal social connection. Given the extent of the COVID-19
pandemic, real-world evidence emerging from the proposed study will critically inform the clinical management
of PwMS during the rapidly changing landscape of neurological care. The project is highly relevant to the
mission of the NIH/NINDS to reduce the burden of neurological diseases such as MS in the setting of the
pandemic."
