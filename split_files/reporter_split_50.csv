 The requested instrumentation in this proposal is an ultra-high resolution mass spectrometer coupled to
an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system that will be used for lipidomics, metabolomics, isotope
tracing, and structural elucidation experiments. Specifically, we are requesting funds for a Thermo Scientific™
Orbitrap™ IQ-X™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer coupled to a Vanquish dual column liquid chromatography
system, to expand our technological capabilities and offerings to its user base. This instrument will be housed in
the Translational Biomarker Core (TBC) in the Center of Excellence in Toxicology (CEET) at the Perelman
School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The TBC currently serves over 80 investigators
from Penn and beyond. These collaborations range from fee-for-service customers to extensive grant-based
collaborations. Until 2016, the TBC only offered targeted quantification assays and proteomics methodologies.
 In 2016, the Core acquired a Dionex™ Ultimate™ HPG-3400RS ultra high-pressure liquid-
chromatography (UPLC) that was interfaced with an Orbitrap QE-HF that was running proteomics using a nano-
flow-LC in the Blair laboratory. With limited instrument time, the Core developed its lipidomic platform by
combining the HRMS raw data with Lipids Search (Thermo) software for lipids identification. This assay is one
of the most requested assays offered by the Core, and through collaborations, we have now more than 300 lipids
standards used for calibration curves. During the University restrictions due to Covid-19 in spring 2020, we ran
the 600 metabolomics standards commercially available, building a library for Compound Discoverer 3.2
(Thermo). The metabolomics workflow was used for several successful grant submissions during the last two
years. The Core would like to expand its capabilities to run these types of highly multiplexed and untargeted
omics routinely, to expand technological capabilities, and fit offerings to its user base needs. This proposal
highlights the need of omics assays from 29 users (28 with NIH funding). Additionally, the core has established
ongoing collaborations with institutes and centers at Penn including Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP),
the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, and the Institute of Immunology. Given the focus of
the users on the identification of novel small molecule biomarkers of inflammation and related chronic diseases
such as cancer and diabetes, this mass spectrometer is urgent and vital for our research projects. Expertise in
the Core includes staff that is responsible for instrument maintenance, sample preparation, method development,
and data analysis, including large data sets that require the use of bioinformatics software for differential analysis.
 Furthermore, having a dedicated HRMS instrument will complement the recent expansion of our Core
staff. It will allow method development time to expand core capabilities and the continuation of a more extensive
education and training arm of our mission, to provide our expertise in LC-HRMS analysis, experimental planning
and training to collaborators who are interested in better understanding mass spectrometry applications."

Retinal inherited diseases are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Despite major progress in the discovery
of causative genes underlying inherited retinal disease, understanding the natural history and phenotype of a
particular molecular diagnosis remains limited. Recently, we found that dominant human mutations in ARL3
cause higher levels of Arl3-GTP activity, resulting in a developmental phenotype that prevents photoreceptor
nuclei from translocating properly into the outer nuclear layer of the retina. Arl3 is a small GTPase that regulates
the enrichment of lipid proteins into the cilium. Building from this discovery, we wanted to determine whether
other mutations that cause elevated levels of Arl3-GTP activity had a similar phenotype. RP2 is the GTPase
activating protein (GAP) that facilitates GTP hydrolysis by returning Arl3 returning it to the inactive GDP state.
Human mutations in the RP2 gene cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and loss of RP2 GAP activity would be
expected to increase levels of Arl3-GTP in the cell. In our preliminary data, we rederived the RP2null mouse and
found that it has the same photoreceptor nuclear migration defect as we observed with dominant human
mutations in ARL3. The mislocalization of photoreceptor nuclei into the inner nuclear layer was overlooked in
previous publications and demands a thorough examination. The goals of our proposal are to investigate how
this developmental phenotype affects photoreceptor function and/or health, whether this phenotype can be
restored by sequestering the overly active Arl3-GTP and identify the ciliary signal regulating nuclear migration
that is perturbed by excess Arl3-GTP activity. In addition to building a comprehensive understanding of how
mislocalized photoreceptor nuclei affect function and lead to retinal degeneration, our aims utilize proximity
labeling approaches to uncover the ciliary signal and the mechanism by which photoreceptors guide nuclear
migration during development. Furthermore, we will employ gene delivery techniques in the RP2null rods to rapidly
screen candidates that we previously found restored the migration defect caused by dominant ARL3 mutations.
Completing our aims will provide insight into post-mitotic nuclear migration within the developing retina, how
these processes fail during disease, and how mislocalized photoreceptor nuclei impact retinal health and
function. This proposal will provide fundamental knowledge about the pathobiology underlying RP2 and ARL3
gene mutations and identify potential therapeutic targets for patients suffering from inherited blindness."

This S10 High-End Instrumentation grant application from Washington University (WU) in St. Louis requests
funds in partial support of the purchase of a Bruker 15.2-Tesla small-animal MRI scanner to replace a two-
decades-old Agilent/Varian 11.74-Tesla pumped MRI. This 11.74-Tesla MRI consumes a significant amount of
liquid helium (5500 liters annually with a cost of over $150,000), which is unsustainable given the worldwide
helium supply shortage. Moreover, with Agilent/Varian's exit from the MR market, the 11.74-Tesla scanner’s
outdated hardware and software no longer meet the current and future needs of pre-clinical MRI research.
The requested ultra-high field Bruker 15.2-Tesla Small-Animal MRI Scanner has state-of-the-art RF coils,
gradient systems, and an extensive MR pulse sequence library to perform most modern MRI experiments in a
preclinical setting. Its ultra-high field strength will provide a 2.6-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
compared to the 9.4T MRI, our only modern preclinical MRI system. In conjunction with its high-performance
gradients (1.5 times stronger, almost 2 times higher slew rate than our 9.4T system), this gain can be leveraged
to provide increased spatial resolution for ultra-fine anatomical definition, more accurate voxel-wise estimation
of signal amplitude, increased blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in functional MRI, and
sensitivity to susceptibility weighted imaging and iron nanoparticles. This SNR gain is especially crucial for X-
nucleus MR. Hydrogen and X-nucleus MR spectroscopy further benefits from increased spectral dispersion at a
higher field. Of equal importance, advances in magnet technology allow the new 15.2-Tesla magnet to consume
only ~12% as much liquid helium as the 11.74-Tesla system being replaced, thereby improving the sustainability
of our preclinical imaging program.
The requested Bruker 15.2-Tesla scanner will be managed by the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology’s (MIR)
Small-Animal MR Facility. The Facility is service-oriented, highly collaborative, and well-integrated into the
Washington University biomedical research community. The small animal MR facility is one of Washington
University's most successfully shared research resources. In the five years preceding the pandemic, the Facility
logged an average of approximately 5,900 scanner-usage hours annually from three small-animal MRI scanners.
This scanner will help advance our already robust NIH-funded imaging research programs across many
departments and centers in the School of Medicine and the McKelvey School of Engineering. University-wide
support for this 15.2-Tesla small animal program has been provided by the Radiology Chair, Deans of the Schools
of Medicine and Engineering, and Department Chairs and Center Directors of Major Users, with a total
institutional commitment of $4,669,072."

The global burden of dementias continues to rise; by 2050, it is estimated that approximately 152 million
people across the globe are going to be affected by dementias at a cost of 3 trillion US dollars. This is a
particular issue in China as it has the world's largest population of people with dementia. Despite the incredible
increase in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive dementias, very little progress has been made to prevent and
successfully treat these devastating diseases. The primary reasons for the lack of progress are: 1) continued
focus on single causes of disease rather than multifactorial etiologies; 2) lack of long-term follow-up data that
captures environments, lifestyle behaviors, and individual susceptibility factors before, during, and after
cognitive decline; and 3) insufficient attention to biological susceptibility along with dietary, lifestyle and
environmental strategies. China has a larger aging population and longer life expectancy than ever before.
Recent trends have led to a new phenomenon of older adults left behind when the younger generation
migrates to find work. These demographic changes as well as other urbanization-related changes provide
context and opportunity to address these issues. The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), an NIH-
funded study of more than 10,000 individuals aged 45-80 followed over 35 years, provides high quality
longitudinal data and captures the transition from traditional to Western lifestyles in parallel with urbanization
and emergence of cognitive decline during the past three decades. We will use these data to generate insights
that would not be obtainable in studies with short periods of follow-up in older populations that focus on single
causes of cognitive decline. We propose to capitalize on the 30-year span of coverage and geographic scope
of the CHNS, which provides substantial temporal and spatial variability, capturing extraordinarily rapid
urbanization-related changes, biological susceptibility factors, and cognitive decline data as well as changes in
individual, household and community environments. We propose data collection of an additional round in 2021,
preserving the continuity of the CHNS, while adding aging-focused components (e.g., tooth loss, hearing,
vision, and additional executive function tests, and in a subsample infectious and inflammatory markers, such
as cytokines and viral and bacterial pathogens implicated in Alzheimer's disease) to inform understanding of
the factors that lead to healthy aging versus physical and cognitive decline, and severe dementias. We will use
a series of complex statistical models to identify trajectories of key risk factors and their combinations that
predict or protect against early and severe cognitive decline. The impact of the proposed project is to generate
an 11th wave of multipurpose data capturing long-term exposure to major urbanization-related and
demographic changes, particularly within the recent 5 years, and test hypotheses that combinations of
biological, social, and environmental exposures will identify early and modifiable lifestyle factors that can be
used to delay cognitive decline and improve quality of older adults."
10857133,"Enteric infections remain the second leading cause of diarrheal morbidity and mortality globally in children, despite significant improvements in access to latrines and safe water sources in high disease burden countries. Our prior research has demonstrated that the “enteric pathome” - i.e. the communities of viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens transmitted by human and animal feces in the environment - ingested by children living in low-income urban neighborhoods of Kenya is taxonomically complex and varies by exposure pathway. Our preliminary data indicates that the risk of multi-pathogen infection is elevated among those 6- month old Kenyan infants fed cow’s milk and living in urban households with dirt floors, shared latrines, and cohabitating domestic animals. This suggests multiple aspects of societal development beyond latrines and water sources are required to reduce complexity in pathogen transmission in high burden countries. We hypothesize that joint modeling of enteric pathome agents across households and neighborhoods that represent contrasts in urban societal development will show that development leads to pathome evolution from complex to simple community structures, and thus lower detection frequencies for individual pathogen taxa. Understanding the evolution in pathome complexity induced by societal development and subsequently identifying effective intervention strategies is challenging since field experiments are expensive to implement, difficult to generalize to other settings, are only informed by existing, limited observational data, and sufficiently sophisticated statistical and mathematical pathome modeling tools are not currently available. Our proposal aims to (1) develop spatiotemporal and trajectory statistical models to understand the complex exposure risks for infants from the enteric pathome; (2) collect environmental, behavioral, spatial, economic, and microbial data to characterize the enteric pathome along pathways for disease diffusion and the intersection of humans and animals with these pathways; and (3) develop and validate agent-based models (ABMs) for predicting which social and environmental urban developmental interventions (e.g. animal penning, building latrines or drains, concrete floors) best prevent multipathogen transmission to infants in high disease burden countries using established Kenyan study sites as a model. Our interdisciplinary team includes a biostatistician, infectious disease epidemiologists, microbiologist, computational scientist, behavioral researcher, and urban development geographer."

10857134,"Project Summary / Abstract
This application builds on our laboratory's pioneering work delineating critical neurochemical mechanisms of
excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation in a translational model of brain injury from hypothermic circulatory arrest
(HCA) that is directly relevant to the techniques currently used in patients undergoing complex heart and aortic
surgery. We propose to test these mechanisms, specifically N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism with
ketamine and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate potassium (KATP) activation with diazoxide, using targeted
delivery with dendrimer conjugation in our translational HCA model with the addition of antegrade cerebral
perfusion. Prolongation of the safe HCA time during complex aortic surgery with such agents will dramatically
reduce neurological injury and improve outcomes in these patients.
 By identifying the underlying mechanisms of injury and testing them in a pre-clinical large animal model, the
work proposed in this application will advance the field because there are no currently available pharmacologic
agents that have been proven in randomized trials to provide significant improvement to the current use of
hypothermia. We propose the following aims: 1) To determine if the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine is a
neuroprotectant during hypothermic circulatory arrest in a canine model, 2) To determine the mechanisms of
mitochondrial injury during hypothermic circulatory arrest and the effectiveness of mitochondrial KATP channel
openers as neuroprotective agents in a canine model, and 3) To evaluate targeted neuroprotective strategies in
a hypothermic circulatory arrest model with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP)
 Our multidisciplinary team includes a practicing cardiac surgeon who experiences the current challenges
when performing complex aortic surgery, a practicing neurologist specializing in brain injury and mitochondrial
stress, a practicing neurosurgeon who specializes in brain injury, a neuroscientist with expertise in brain injury
and mechanisms of neurorepair and microglial activation, the co-director of the Center for Nanomedicine with
expertise in dendrimer-drug nanodevices for targeted therapy to attenuate neuroinflammation, and a
neuropathologist that specializes in neural cell death and mitochondrial pathobiology. Together we possess the
unique ability to translate our findings to clinical practice.
 The proposed experiments provide a comprehensive approach to understanding the mechanisms of
neurological injury due to hypothermic circulatory arrest. The knowledge gained could potentially provide benefit
for any patient with cardiovascular disease who requires cardiac surgery, which remains the #1 killer of men and
women in the United States."

 4 The proposed research will orally deliver existing commercially available acaricide formulations to

 7 Cydectin® (moxidectin), which has a 0-day withdrawal period for human consumption, to coat whole corn to
 8 dose deer and will use Kaput® (0.005% fipronil) to dose small rodents at three different locations with varying
 9 known diversities of alternative terrestrial mammalian hosts. Specific aims include: 1) Evaluation of the
10 efficacy and reproducibility of this strategy in the suppression of Borrelia burgdorferi-infected host-seeking I.
11 scapularis nymphs in multiple high-risk settings. 2) Optimization and standardization of the implementation of
12 systemic acaricide treatment of white-tailed deer and Peromyscus spp. to reduce the abundance of host-seeking
13 I. scapularis nymphs infected with human pathogens. 3) Development of standard operating procedures for
14 systemic acaricidal host treatment to be used by homeowners or vector control professionals within
15 communities at risk for exposure to Lyme disease spirochetes and other I. scapularis-borne pathogens.
16 The objective of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of systemic acaricidal host-targeted
17 treatment as an integrated tick management strategy that can be implemented on a town-wide scale, similar to
18 mosquito control efforts. Logistically, procuring access to numerous private properties for tick management will
19 prove challenging. However, white-tailed deer home ranges often contain numerous private properties and they
20 readily traverse human-derived property boundaries. Vector control professionals or homeowners would then
21 only need to establish feeding stations at a few locations to dose deer with moxidectin during the spring and fall
22 adult I. scapularis activity peaks to effectively interrupt the tick life cycle. Fipronil-laced bait could be
23 distributed on willing private properties or by vector control professionals or the homeowners themselves to
24 target juvenile I. scapularis on small rodents, further suppressing abundances and reducing pathogen infection
25 in both vector and reservoir. Additionally, through modeling efforts based on results from the proposed, this
26 strategy will be expanded to provide information to stakeholders in different ecological and climatic regions on
27 the optimum combination of interventions that can synergistically contribute to the short- to long-term, cost-
28 effective and sustainable control of tick-borne pathogens in an integrated vector management approach. Also, a
29 publicly accessible document containing standard operating procedures for use of this strategy will be published
30 and made available online that will be geared toward homeowners and vector control professionals. This

 Foodborne illness causes significant morbidity and mortality each year in the United States.
Although human foodborne illness is usually associated with the consumption of contaminated
food, pets can be direct and indirect sources of bacterial pathogens including Salmonella,
Campylobacter, and Listeria. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Veterinary Laboratory
Investigation Response Network (Vet-LIRN) Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Cooperative
Agreement Program is designed to promote human and animal health by providing scientific
information and building laboratory capacity for routine and emergency response for
investigation of outbreaks of disease, information on antimicrobial resistance in pathogens
isolated from veterinary patients, and to investigate problems with animal feeds and drugs.
Detection of outbreaks requires the ability to collect samples from geographically diverse areas.
Texas is home to 29 million people, second only to California in human population, and leads
the nation in horse and cattle populations. It is therefore important to understand the dynamics
of foodborne diseases among animals and people within the State of Texas. Texas A&M
University is home to the oldest, established College of Veterinary Medicine in Texas. The
Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory
currently serves as an FDA Vet-LIRN Laboratory. Members of the laboratory have helped to
develop Vet-LIRN methods for detection of Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni, participated in
proficiency testing, collected and analyzed samples as part of Vet-LIRN investigations, and
provided isolates for the Vet-LIRN ongoing effort to characterize the antimicrobial resistance in
pathogens from veterinary patients through whole genome sequencing. The objective of this
proposal is to provide infrastructure in Texas to support collection and testing of samples from
pets to support the FDA Vet-LIRN mission of protecting human and animal health by prompt
recognition of outbreaks and testing of samples associated with outbreaks as well as
surveillance assignments as needed by the Vet-LIRN Program Office."

The overall goals of the Chemical Biology Training Program (CBTP) at Stony Brook University (SBU) are (i) to
produce successful, independent, professional, rigorous, and ethical Ph.D. scientists trained at the interface of
chemistry and biology and (ii) to maintain a scientific research environment that is inclusive and supportive of
trainee development. Our mission is to train scientists prepared to enter the biomedical research-based
workforce and make major contributions to health and human welfare in the United States. The rationale for the
CBTP is that our faculty and program have the unique capability to advance biomedicine by providing training at
the chemistry-biology interface. Training objectives are to develop 6 core competencies: conceptual knowledge
of chemical biology, research skills, responsible conduct of research (RCR), communication skills,
professionalism, and leadership & management skills. Trainees are selected from 4 graduate programs:
Biochemistry & Structural Biology, Chemistry, Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, and Molecular & Cellular
Pharmacology. Trainees specialize in fields spanning chemical biology, as the 27 faculty in the CBTP have
research interests that include: infectious diseases, oncology, toxicology, immunology, developmental biology,
neurobiology, drug design, energy-harvesting, cell-signaling, organic synthesis, physical organic chemistry,
enzymology, pharmacology, and materials chemistry. Trainees learn principles and techniques of chemical
biology in a core 3-semester course sequence including rigorous, quantitative data collection, analysis, and
interpretation. The CBTP incorporates multiple professional development and networking opportunities and
requirements including: required monthly meetings for research presentations, discussions on rigor and
reproducibility, and RCR refresher training; career development workshops led by alumni; workshops to enhance
professionalism, leadership, and communication skills, many in collaboration with the Alan Alda Center for
Communicating Science (unique to SBU); required participation in annual symposia and poster sessions; and a
big/little graduate sibling mentorship program. Communication between trainees, faculty, and oversite
committees is facilitated, and students, faculty, and the program are assessed through required meetings and
rubrics. The assessments are used to ensure that students are guided to timely graduation with the required
skills and outcomes, such as first-author publications, a strong foundation in rigor and reproducibility, the ability
to think critically and independently, the ability to work in teams, and the ability to communicate effectively, both
with colleagues and students from diverse backgrounds, as well as with the public. Recruitment and retention of
URM/D students is achieved through activities that include the Center for Inclusive Education (unique to SBU).
In the past 5 years, URM/D CBTP trainees have increased from 22% to 35% of the cohort. Twelve funded
positions are requested per year, to be matched by 3 institutional training slots. Fellows are supported during
their 2nd and 3rd year but participate in the program until graduation."

Much evidence has accumulated over the past several decades that metabolism does more than just provide
the building blocks and energy to fuel biological functions. Instead, it is increasingly clear that metabolism has
a profound effect in determining the behaviors of cells, tissues and organisms. We hypothesize that many of
these effects are mediated by direct physical interactions whereby metabolites act on macromolecules, like
proteins, to alter their functions. Unfortunately, the available methodologies for discovering such interactions
are limited in scale, throughput and sensitivity. For this reason, we developed the MIDAS platform, which
uses simple biophysical principles to discover interactions with very high sensitivity and selectivity. MIDAS
has enabled the discovery of many novel metabolite-protein interactions, some of which we have shown to
exert functionally important effects in cell models. We now propose to implement MIDAS in a much more
systematic way, including collaborative efforts to define the metabolite interactions of the ubiquitin-
proteasome system and the autophagy machinery. Metabolite interactions with RNA are known to be
functionally important in bacteria, which use RNA elements known as riboswitches to couple direct metabolite
binding to changes in RNA function. We have used MIDAS to identify metabolite ligands for some previously
“orphan” riboswitches and will functionally characterize such interactions. More importantly, we
hypothesized that RNA-metabolite interactions also exist and drive cellular behaviors in human cells. We
used an integrated platform of transcriptome screening and RNA-adapted MIDAS to discover several
intriguing putative interactions between metabolites and human mRNAs. We have validated and
demonstrated the functionality of one of these interactions, with cAMP binding and stimulating the translation
of the COX7B mRNA. We will collaboratively determine the structure and function of this interaction and it
will serve as a model for the many such interactions that we propose are important in mediating metabolic
signaling in human cells. We anticipate that these two modes of metabolite regulation, via proteins and RNA,
are fundamental to the metabolic effects on cell behavior, and the understanding that we will gain over time
will be transformative."

biological target. Computational modeling at the atomic-level empowers understanding of the factors that drive
molecular recognition, and ""application"" to real world systems enables testable predictions. Grounded in strong
results, data, and demonstrated productivity, we hypothesize that major gaps in the field (e.g. design of ligands
with optimal target complementarity, sampling/searching challenges, protein specificity, incorporating
cheminformatics during design, lack of intelligent automated-methods for refinement, lack of methods for
covalent de novo design, difficult to use software) can be bridged through forward-thinking design of new
computational tools. As the lead developer of the widely-used program DOCK6, in major undertakings, we are
developing powerful paradigms for ""de novo design"" and ""molecular evolution"" that logically drive ligand
construction to drug-like space using clever scoring functions and cheminformatics descriptors simultaneously.
Our platforms remove the limitation of only considering ligands that are preconceived, and promote the design
of compounds that are highly optimized and ""specifically tailored"" to the protein(s) of interest. Our approach is
centered around fragment-based assembly and searching using customizable building block libraries for ""from-
scratch"" construction and ""refinement"". Our advances are made available to the research community through
regular public release (we led the last seven DOCK6 releases 6.4-6.10) along with validation databases and
user-friendly tutorials. A new webserver will enable novice, intermediate, and expert users alike more direct
access to our tools. Our expected outcomes are cutting-edge software and identification of highly specific and
optimized ligands. The proposal is framed around 4 fundamental questions: (Q1) Can the principles that drive
molecular recognition be captured at the atomic level and used to design improved software for more accurate
prediction of geometry and energy? (Q2) Can ligand growth be propelled to highly specific regions of chemical
space using clever from-scratch assembly (de novo design) and Darwinian principles (molecular evolution)?
(Q3) Can more ""intelligent"" sampling, scoring, and searching methods be developed for identification and design
of verified-active compounds in collaboration with experimentalists? (Q4) Can docking and de novo design
software and protocols be designed to be more ""user friendly"" while not sacrificing accuracy or power? We
collaborate with a network of experienced experimental labs to (i) validate theoretical predictions, (ii) answer
basic research questions, (iii) provide mechanistic understanding, and (iv) identify new agents against clinically
relevant targets involved in cancer (fatty acid binding protein, neutral ceramidase, EGFR, HER2), viral entry
(HIV, Zika, Ebola), multi-drug bacterial resistance (LpxC), and fungal infection (Sgl1, SglA, S1Pr3), among
others. Experimental outcomes, in turn, will inform our further method development efforts."
10841891,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria interact with the outside world through their cell envelope. The cell envelope defines cell boundaries
and provides structural integrity and cell shape to bacteria. Therefore, properly building their multi-structure
envelope is critical to ensure growth and survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell envelope is delimited by
two lipid bilayers, the inner membrane and the outer membrane. These membranes are separated by an
aqueous compartment known as the periplasm, which also contains a thin peptidoglycan cell wall. The structure
and composition of the Gram-negative outer membrane is unusual mainly because it is not a phospholipid
bilayer. Its inner leaflet contains glycerophospholipids, but its outer leaflet is composed of lipopolysaccharides
(LPS). By densely packing their cell surface with LPS molecules, Gram-negative bacteria create a permeability
barrier against small hydrophobic molecules that otherwise could diffuse across phospholipid bilayers.
Consequently, these bacteria are naturally resistant to many antibiotics and detergents. The long-term plan of
our research program is to investigate how Gram-negative bacteria build their cell envelope. This project focuses
on understanding outer membrane biogenesis by studying the mechanism of function of lipid transporters that
build this bilayer. Outer-membrane lipids are synthesized in the inner membrane, so they must travel through
the aqueous periplasmic compartment and be asymmetrically delivered to the outer membrane. The proposed
research plan will leverage our expertise in applying genetic and biochemical approaches to study the cell
envelope in order to investigate two highly conserved systems that are essential for outer-membrane biogenesis
and growth of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. We will investigate how the Lpt system extracts
newly synthesized LPS molecules from the inner membrane and transports them across the cell envelope
through a protein bridge so that they can be assembled at the cell surface. Our studies will focus on how LPS
extraction and transport are powered by the LptB2FGC components, which constitute an ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter at the inner membrane. ABC transporters are ATP-driven machines that all cells use to move
substrates across cellular compartments. We will also investigate transport of phospholipids from the inner to
the outer membrane by newly discovered bridge-like proteins belonging to the AsmA-like protein family. These
proteins have recently been recognized as the bacterial ancestors of lipid-transfer proteins that transport
phospholipids at contact sites between membranes of different organelles in eukaryotic cells. Our research will
therefore provide fundamental knowledge about bacterial physiology and growth that is also applicable to
homologous systems conserved across many organisms. In addition, since the barrier imposed by the outer
membrane is the main reason why very few novel antibiotics effective against Gram-negative pathogens have
been developed in decades, the knowledge obtained from our research will contribute to the development of
novel antimicrobials."
10839974,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious disease worldwide. Although TB is treatable,
treatments are prolonged, complex, and difficult for many people to tolerate. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb)
also readily acquires drug resistance and global efforts to control TB are threatened by the increasing problem
of drug resistance. M. tb is capable of assembling into biofilm communities capable of withstanding lethal doses
of antibiotics and this phenomenon likely contributes to difficulties in treating and controlling TB. We have
developed an in vitro system to study adaptation M. tb within biofilms. Leveraging analyses of these experimental
populations with those of a well characterized natural population of M. tb, we discovered that M. tb strains
separated by a small number of genetic differences exhibit a surprising array of phenotypic differences. Our
preliminary data point to regulatory mechanisms underlying these changes. Contextualizing these data with our
recent discoveries in M.tb evolutionary population genomics at regional and global scales, we hypothesize that
M. tb adaptation occurs at the scale of individual hosts while large scale phenomena act primarily as a constraint
on adaptation. Our major objective now is to delineate the mechanisms underlying observed phenotypic
differences in these natural and experimental populations."

There is an under-representation of Native American professionals in cancer research and healthcare
to address the cancer health disparities concentrated within the Native Nations. The Saint Regis
Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) shares a mission with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (Roswell
Park) to cultivate a cadre of Native American cancer professionals to address the disproportionate
cancer burden suffered by the SRMT community. The lack of Native American science and health
professionals is attributable to lower rates of college science degree completion, like other under-
represented minority (URM) counterparts. Impediments to persistence by URM students include
inadequate academic preparation and feelings of self-alienation in the collegiate academic science
setting. The objective of the SRMT Cancer Scholars Program is to bridge high school and college
student advancement and persistence into college science majors and graduate training in science
respectively, by enhancing the research, scientific, cancer literacy and “scientist” self-identification of
SRMT high school and college students. To achieve this objective, SRMT high school and college
students will participate in experiential education experiences in research addressing cancer and public
health disparities in their own community. Students, enrolled in regional SRMT high schools, will
participate in an after-school club to engage them in activity-based learning focused on cancer biology
and population science fundamentals. The after-school club will culminate in a three-week research
experience at Roswell Park, where they will apply principle knowledge to conducting research projects
under mentorship of Roswell Park faculty. College students will participate in 10-week research
experiences, to deeply study a behavioral health, biological or epidemiological cancer problem in the
SRMT community with a scientist at Roswell Park. To enrich their core research experiences, SRMT
college and high school students will form near-peer scholarly communities and attend culturally-
attuned lectures, professional development workshops and social activities coordinated by Roswell
Park's Center for Indigenous Cancer Research. Students participating in the SRMT Cancer Scholars
Program will impart knowledge about the importance of cancer research and benefits of participating
in research experiences in preparation for college and graduate school to their communities through
presentations made at community-engagement conferences at SRMT. The SRMT Cancer Scholars
Program will be evaluated on its effectiveness to inspire SRMT students' pursuit of advanced science
degrees; to prepare for academic success in college and graduate school; and to develop supportive
community and family environments to encourage persistence in health science careers that will serve
the SRMT community."
10840397,"For this P01 to fulfill its goal to significantly impact critical barriers to progress in the field of oxytocin as
a disease-modifying agent for pain after injury, it needs strong organization and cohesiveness. The
Administrative Core will coordinate the activities of the P01 among 9 investigators across 3 institutions through
interaction with the P01 leadership structure. The mission of the Administrative Core is to facilitate and assure
the application of high-quality standards throughout the P01, to track progress and provide a structure for
resource allocation, and to provide a mechanism for resolving problems and assuring integration. We will apply
innovative approaches, including documentation of a priori experimental design, assumptions, and data
analysis for all preclinical Projects, akin to trial registration in the clinical realm, application of REDCap
databases to all preclinical and clinical Projects to allow timely, automated reporting of progress, and
application of a newly created variant of StatReviewer to scan manuscripts prior to submission for key
elements of transparent reporting requirements. The Administrative Core will serve the following primary aims
and functions:
Aim 1: Facilitate day to day activities, internal quality control, and review of progress
The Administrative Core will coordinate resource sharing, including major equipment, animal husbandry, and
surgical facilities within the Pain Mechanisms Laboratory. It will establish a REDCap database for all preclinical
and clinical activities and generate monthly automated reports. Finally, it will establish the equivalent of trial
registration for preclinical studies.
Aim 2: Identify and address needs for changes in course or conflict resolution
The Administrative Core will provide resources and structure for decision making regarding the two main
reasons for course correction – technical / interpretation stumbling blocks and new knowledge from inside or
outside the P01, through review of automated reports and regular meetings, an interactive review of new
publications, and advisory and scientific symposia. The Administrative Core will coordinate meetings of the
P01 leadership structure to prevent and resolve conflicts.
Aim 3: Coordinate dissemination of concepts developed uniquely by the P01
The Administrative Core will facilitate integration and impact of the synergy provided by the P01 through
regular discussions of publication and presentation strategies and through internal review of these products
prior to release, including scanning for transparent reporting requirements. It will also coordinate presentation
of P01 research and progress to the External Advisory Committee and organize an annual symposium."
10840399,"The Animal Core will provide essential services and facilities to the preclinical projects in a
standardized and efficient manner, utilizing shared facilities, equipment, and personnel in a
coordinated fashion. The services to be provided to each preclinical project are divided into
three specific aims. Dr. Christopher Peters will oversee the Animal Core and will meet with
monthly or as needed with Drs. Boada, Martin, Romero-Sandoval to assure that the Core
efficiently performs these three key functions. Dr. Peters will provide oversight for regulatory
affairs within the Program regarding animal use including approval and compliance with
protocols for the IACUC and Biohazard Safety Committee. Specific Aim 1 is to provide
standardized in vivo surgical and behavioral procedures in animals utilized by preclinical
projects. Both projects involving animals require animal procurement and identification, surgical
preparation and behavioral assessment of sensory and affective pain related outcomes. Specific
Aim 2 will provide standardized methods for collection of plasma and brain tissue and sample
preparation for determination of oxytocin levels as part of PK/PD studies. We will standardize
immunohistochemical approaches across preclinical projects for verification of viral mediated
protein expression in discrete populations of neurons in brain or spinal cord tissue. These
services include sacrifice and transcardial perfusion with paraformaldehyde, tissue harvest,
cryoprotection and cryosectioning, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescent microscopy including
data collection and analysis Specific Aim 3 will provide for generation of and maintenance of a
novel transgenic oxytocin-cre rat colony. Dr. Romero-Sandoval will assist with colony
management, breeding and genotyping to ensure sufficient animals are available in a timely
manner for preclinical studies in Project 2. These essential functions will standardize and
coordinate services and procedures throughout the Program and provide an efficient and
costeffective structure for collaboration."
10840404,"Oxytocin produces antinociception in rodents in a variety of pain states, however the
mechanisms by which this occurs and the importance of peripheral versus central effects are
unclear. Prior studies have typically used systemic administration of oxytocin, with dosing-to-
effect strategies in the absence of pharmacokinetic data or consideration of brain penetrance.
These studies can only be extrapolated to the clinic after relevant dosing parameters have been
determined experimentally to achieve peripheral and central oxytocin exposure across rodents
and humans, and using such parameters to compare antinociceptive efficacy against different
outcome measures, with subsequent exploration of potential mechanisms. This Project
translates and is informed by Projects 1 and 3 to define the pharmacokinetics of oxytocin in
awake and anesthetized rats in brain and blood and determine the relevance of peripheral and
central action of oxytocin on complex behaviors following nerve injury. Three specific aims are
proposed. The first aim will define the pharmacokinetics of oxytocin in plasma and brain using
i.v. bolus, and these data will be used to design targeted concentration infusion paradigms in
the PK/PD core. The rate of brain entry and loss will also be assessed. The second aim will take
advantage of a novel transgenic rat developed by our group that expresses Cre recombinase
selectively in oxytocinergic neurons. We will determine the role of endogenous oxytocin circuits
in modulation of complex behaviors after peripheral nerve injury using Cre dependent neuronal
ablative strategies, expressing mutated caspase 3 in targeted neurons. We have developed
novel behavioral methods that assess impairment of attention, fear avoidance, and affective and
sensory modalities of pain after nerve injury and use these innovative behavioral methods for
this aim. The third aim combines the knowledge gained from Aims 1 and 2 to assess the
efficacy of oxytocin in mitigating the behavioral changes induced by peripheral nerve injury,
tests the potential for oxytocin to produce long-lasting, disease-modifying effects in behavior
and afferent physiology, and the role of endogenous circuits in these effects. This project
interacts with Project 1 to assess the contribution of altered primary sensory afferent signaling in
complex behaviors and the relevance of oxytocin and with Project 3 to target relevant peripheral
levels of oxytocin in humans for peripheral and central action."
10840406,"Project 3 Summary
 Surgery benefits most patients, but for some, it results in chronic pain and disability. Under current
funding, we have moved the state of research in this area forward by developing and applying methods to
more precisely map the speed of recovery in individual patients after surgery. In addition, we have shown that
recovery after surgery in animals and humans is quicker if surgery occurs around the time of delivery, and this
hastened recovery reflects oxytocin (OXT) actions. Although OXT’s effects on multiple neurologic disorders
have been probed in animals, translational testing in humans is hampered by a route of administration
(intranasal [i.n.]) with undetermined distribution in the brain or the periphery. Project 3 will build on these
observations and translate, with guidance by Projects 1 and 2 and support by the PK/PD Core, critical testing
of OXT’s actions on somatosensation and the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. Specifically:
Aim 1. Create PK models of OXT in plasma after IV and i.n. administration and test covariates
 This Aim will determine oxytocin pharmacokinetics (PK) after IV and i.n. administration in plasma and
test whether key biologic variables (sex, age, weight, race, ethnicity) affect this disposition. These data will be
used to determine appropriate dosing to target sites of peripheral or central drug action, including pain relief.
Aim 2: Define OXT actions at peripheral sites of somatosensation
 Using either pain report from a 5 minute heat stimulus or paradigms to be tested by our Swedish
collaborators (under their funding by the Wallenberg Foundation outside this P01), we will create and validate a
PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) model for OXT on somatosensation including pain in the periphery. This model will
guide OXT dosing under a subaward in Sweden to directly test the effects of OXT on sensory afferents using
microneurographic recording and by us to test the effects of OXT on light touch as well as pain fibers.
Aim 3: Validate hippus as a measure of OXT action and bridge IV studies to intranasal administration
 We will for the first time establish a PK/PD model for oxytocin in the brain, using pupil diameter
oscillations (hippus) as an outcome measure. We will then apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to create
PK/PD models for pain relief and central nervous system action after i.n. OXT administration. These models
will guide dosing for future clinical trials of i.n. OXT to treat pain and other neurologic disorders."
10840457,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
The study of retroviruses has resulted in important discoveries and led to insights into basic cell biology including
mechanisms of cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and ultimately cellular transformation and cancer.
Our collaborative work within this PPG focuses on HTLV-1, which is associated primarily with adult T-cell
leukemia (ATL) and neurological disease (HAM/TSP) in a small percentage of infected individuals. Disease
progression by HTLV-1 has been attributed to Tax, although we and others have hypothesized and provide data
that another viral gene, termed Hbz, plays a critical role in the malignant process. Our presented data, as well
as the work of others, indicate that hbz is multi-functional, playing important roles in both the RNA and protein
form throughout infection and establishment of latency. We have extended our proposed work through PPG
collaborations to better understand the manner in which hbz promotes proliferative and survival activity in cells.
Proteomic analyses identified a panel of cellular proteins that distinctly interact with hbz RNA and HBZ protein.
Functional characterization of these interactions are the next critical steps and the basis for this highly integrative
continuation project designed to further define the role of hbz in transformation and disease. Our overall
hypothesis is that uncovering the mechanism of actions of hbz RNA and HBZ protein will provide important
insight into HTLV-1 cellular transformation and disease and ultimately will provide means for therapeutic
targeting to eradicate HTLV-1 persistence in the host. This highly integrated proposal as referenced by Project
and Core collaborations below has two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will dissect the mechanism(s) of action of hbz RNA
and determine its contributions to the pathogenic process. We hypothesize that cellular protein interaction with
hbz mRNA 2o structure translates to cell signaling pathways important for viral persistence and cellular
proliferation. Our new proteomics data has identified, and we further validated, distinct cellular proteins that bind
hbz mRNA. This aim will utilize in vitro approaches (Projects 2 and 3, Cores Admin/Biostats and Viral Vector)
to identify the hbz RNA interactive region and determine the functional role of cellular binding proteins in cell
proliferation. We will use in vivo approaches (Animal Core) to understand the contribution of the RNA and
interactive proteins in the establishment of persistence and tumor formation. Aim 2 will dissect the mechanism(s)
of action of HBZ protein and determine its contributions to HTLV-1 pathobiology. Our new proteomics data has
identified, and we further validated, distinct cellular proteins that bind HBZ. In vitro approaches (Project 3, Cores
Admin/Biostats and Viral Vector) including protein interaction mapping, cellular proliferation assays, and
cellular transformation assays will be utilized to identify the HBZ interactive region and the functional role of key
cellular binding proteins in HTLV-1 pathobiology. In vivo approaches (Animal Core, Project 2) will be used to
determine the contribution of these HBZ interactive proteins in the establishment of persistence, infected cell
survival, and tumor formation."
10840460,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) develops in a subset of people infected with HTLV-1 and is an aggressive
T-cell malignancy. ATL’s unique relationship to bone (long latency in the marrow, bone invasion, osteolytic
lesions, and hypercalcemia) makes it an ideal model to dissect the critical factors that support tumor development
and progression in bone. Thus, our work on ATL will likely shed light on other late recurring and bone-tropic
tumors like multiple myeloma, breast, and prostate cancer. Using transgenic mice, we showed that the HTLV-1
tax viral oncogene can mediate both ATL development as well as osteolytic bone destruction through effects on
bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). However, Tax expression is downregulated in ~70% of human ATL, despite
ongoing bone involvement and bone loss, suggesting that another viral factor is important. Recently, we found
that HBZ, a second HTLV-1 oncogene, can also lead to lymphoproliferative disease and pathologic bone loss
when expressed transgenically or in a humanized mouse model of HTLV-1 infection. RANKL plays an important
role in this process, but is not a direct target of HBZ. We and others find that HBZ upregulates the expression of
Wnt5a and heparanase (HPSE), tumor-derived paracrine factors that modulate the tumor microenvironment in
bone and are upregulated in patient ATL cells. Wnt5a activates noncanonical Wnt signaling via Ror2 and has
both osteoblast-inhibiting and OC-stimulating activities, including increasing RANKL expression. HPSE
enzymatically cleaves heparan sulfate, thereby altering cell surfaces and extracellular matrix, increasing
bioavailability of growth factors and cytokines including RANKL and likely Wnt5a. We hypothesize that hbz
expression in transformed ATL cells reprograms the bone microenvironment via increasing Wnt5a and
Heparanase expression, and thereby affects tumor progression and bone loss.
Our plan for evaluating this hypothesis relies integrally on the in vivo models that were developed during the
previous funding period, including new patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that cause systemic bone loss
in mice following intraperitoneal (IP) implantation and newly characterized local bone effects of established ATL
cell lines following implantation into bone (with intratibial injection; IT). We will make extensive use of viral vectors
to manipulate Wnt5a and HPSE in these ATL and PDX lines, primarily with CRISPR/Cas9, taking advantage of
the expertise of Dr. Yoder (Vector Core 1). In collaboration with Dr. Niewiesk (Animal Core 2), we have also
implemented a humanized immune system (HIS) model in which immunodeficient mice are transplanted with
human cord blood cells, and then infected with HTLV-1, modeling emergence of lymphoproliferative disease
(LPD) accompanied by systemic bone loss. This collaboration will be a key part of our experimental design."
10840462,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the cause of an aggressive, refractory T cell malignancy, adult
T-cell leukemia / lymphoma (ATL). The integrated proviral genome has a single binding site (BS) for the
chromatin insulator protein CTCF (CTCF-BS). The HTLV-1 CTCF-BS is located within the 3’portion of the
genome, downstream of 5’ proviral DNA that is generally methylated and bound by histones with markers of
inactive chromatin, and upstream of 3’ proviral DNA with generally unmethylated DNA and bound by histone
with markers of active chromatin. More than 50,000 CTCF-BS are also present in the human genome, which
can mediate DNA looping with the HTLV-1 CTCF-BS. In addition to, or as a result of its looping activity, CTCF
regulates epigenetic chromatin modifications and transcription. CTCF-BS in several DNA viruses are known to
be important for latency, reactivation from latency, and/or viral transcription. However, very little is known about
the role of CTCF in retroviruses, and there is only limited information about the epigenetic regulation of HTLV-
1. Our premise is that CTCF regulates establishment of HTLV-1 latency, and the rate of virus replication and
transformation in humanized mice. In Aim 1, we will use a Jurkat cell line model of HTLV-1 latency to examine
if the effect of CTCF on establishment of latency is mediated by preference for certain integration site
characteristics, and whether this affects the pattern of DNA methylation and H3K4me3 and H3K36me3
modifications of histones bound to the 5’ and 3’ proviral DNA. Aim 2 will examine the effect of mutation of the
CTCF-BS on HTLV-1 replication and transformation in humanized mice. For this purpose, we will use two
different humanized mouse models, one of which is a model of HTLV-induced lymphoma and the other a
model of HTLV-induced leukemia. Once again, we will examine whether specificity of proviral integration sites
affects virus replication and transformation, and epigenetic modifications. Aim 3 will examine the effect of
CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the CTCF-BS in ATL cell lines on DNA looping and their ability to proliferate in
immunodeficient mice. We will also determine if reconstitution of DNA looping independent of CTCF, through
use of defective Cas9 fused to looping protein Lim domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) affects ATL cell
proliferation in immunodeficient mice. In summary, these studies will provide fundamental new information
about the mechanism whereby the CTCF insulator protein regulates HTLV-1 transcription, splicing, latency,
integration preference, immortalization, and tumorigenesis."
10841907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The post-transcriptional modification of RNA nucleosides is essential for protein production, and therefore
life, in all organisms. The chemical modifications to the RNAs that make up the protein synthesis machinery -
ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) - offer cells a mechanism to rapidly
and directly control of protein production at multiple steps. Over half a century of modification enzyme knockout
studies, coupled with recent efforts to map RNA modifications transcriptome wide, reveal that these chemical
additions impact every step in the life cycle of an RNA and help explain their conservation throughout biology.
As such, it is unsurprising that the mutation or dysregulation of RNA modifying enzymes is associated with a
myriad of negative human health outcomes, including intellectual disabilities, mitochondrial diseases and
cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms linking modification dysregulation to human diseases are ill-
defined. This is in largely due to the lack of functional roles determined for the vast majority of modified RNA
sites. No mechanistic consequences have been identified for > 99% of modified mRNA sites, and < 30% of
modified positions in tRNAs have an assigned biological function. Our work will establish relationships between
cellular components that shape the RNA modification landscape, discover the impacts of discrete tRNA and
mRNA modifications on translation, and uncover a role for one of the most abundant modifications,
pseudouridine (), in cellular responses to stress. Modified RNAs are also the foundation of mRNA therapeutics,
a new and rapidly expanding class of medical intervention. Altogether, these studies will (i) expand our
knowledge of a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation, (ii) inform the design of effective therapeutic
mRNAs, and (iii) illuminate the molecular etiology of numerous human diseases."
10841908,"Development and Applications of Bioorthogonal Chemistry
ABSTRACT
This MIRA renewal application combines three ongoing research projects in the PI’s lab to further develop
bioorthogonal covalent chemistry to tackle significant biophysical, biochemical, and in vivo imaging problems in
biomedical research. We have a long-standing interest in developing reactivity-based chemical tools to
address biomedical problems that are difficult to solve using conventional molecular biology techniques alone.
In the last five years, we continued our progress in tool development and applications of these tools to study
class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells and small domain antibodies such as monobodies.
Specifically, we optimized the tetrazole-based photoclick chemistry by designing new genetically encoded
hydrophilic azaspiroalkene reporters, the sterically shielded tetrazoles for fast bioorthogonal ligation reactions
with strained alkenes and alkyne on live cell surface, the tetrazole-based fluorescent reporters of hydrogen
peroxide in mammalian cells, a new class of reagents called hydrazonyl sultones (HS) that release NI through
tautomerization and display a balanced stability and cycloaddition reactivity, and biocompatible genetically
encoded crosslinkers based on 2-arboxy-4-aryltriazoles and -lactam for efficient inter- and intramolecular
crosslinking. In conjunction with genetic code expansion, we showed that these chemical tools can be used to
install an organic fluorophore into class B GPCRs for FRET studies as well as endowing cell penetration to
small domain antibodies through orthogonal crosslinking. In this application, we plan to leverage our most
powerful tools developed recently, namely, hydrazonyl sultones (HS) and -lactam-lysine (BeLaK), and
prepare modified membrane receptors, enzymes, and nanobodies with new capabilities using bioorthogonal
chemistry. Specifically, in Project 1, we will design hydrazonyl sultone (HS)-based turn-on fluorophores for
constructing FRET-based biosensors to probe class B GPCR activation and signal transduction dynamics in
live cells. The organic fluorophore will be installed at the intracellular loop 3 of class B GPCRs via
bioorthogonal HS−BCN ligation reaction to permit FRET-based single-cell kinetic analysis of receptor activation
and recruitment of G protein and -arrestin. In Project 2, we will design β-lactam-encoded enzyme traps for
covalent capture and subsequent identification of protein lysine methyltransferase substrates in living cells. In
Project 3, we will develop covalent nanobody-based immunoPET radiotracers with enhanced performance.
Both BeLaK-mediated, proximity-driven crosslinking chemistry and HS-mediated, environment-dependent
bioorthogonal ligation reactions will be exploited to enhance tumor uptake of the nanobody-based PET tracers
for greater sensitivity without unwanted nephrotoxicity. We expect these studies will offer new capabilities of
covalent chemistry to biomedical research."
10843777,"SUMMARY
Often, many different tests are performed to obtain a multiparameter assessment of the innate and
adaptive immune status. Such tests often include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein
(CRP), procalcitonin, various complement pathway proteins, total antibody (Ab) isotypes and/or
subclasses, and specific Ab titers. All these tests are performed on different analytical platforms
requiring a separate aliquot for each test. Thus, even with modest sample consumption per test, there
is a substantial cumulative volume required for multiple independent tests. While these sample
requirements may not be prohibitive for healthy adolescents and adults, they are particularly
challenging in especially vulnerable populations such as premature newborns, and frail and/or elderly
individuals. For these populations, a wide range of different tests is often very important, however,
samples are often limited.
In agreement with the purpose of the funding opportunity “Development of Sample Sparing Assays for
Monitoring Immune Responses”, we propose to move four different protein assays onto a common
processing and analysis platform, which can be performed on the same submicroliter aliquot of plasma
thereby significantly reducing the sample volume requirements. The four protein assays of interest
include i) an expanded panel of complement components, ii) CRP, iii) antibody isotypes and subclasses
including a novel and innovative immunoglobulin domain-resolved map of the IgOme-related protein
repertoire (aka IgOme), and iv) the classical plasma proteome, i.e. ~400 well described proteins many
of which of clear immunological function. The quantitative information from all these assays will provide
us with an exquisite map of the immune status, a hypothesis that we will be tested by correlating our
findings with the anti-hepatitis B titer measured before and after hepatitis B vaccination in >500
newborns. Samples will be provided by Boston Children's Hospital's NIAID-funded HIPC (Human
Immunology Project Consortium), which will significantly increase the impact of this cohort beyond its
original scope. Taking the request of this funding opportunity for sample sparing to a different level, we
will advance our plasma proteomics pipeline to quadruple the throughput to at least 96 samples/day
and to quarter the plasma volume requirements to <100 nanoliter.
Thus, in the future, 1 microliter of plasma will be sufficient for tens of temporally independent LC/MS-
based protein assays, resulting in quantitative information for hundreds of proteins such that even a
miniscule amount of plasma from the smallest and/or most frail patients will be sufficient to establish
an exquisitely detailed and unbiased molecular map of immune status of any person."
10841922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is an essential process in determining cell identity in multicellular
organisms. Through this process, one single genome can create numerous different cell types. Dysregulation
of transcription can result in aberrant gene expression and cause diseases. Transcription factors (TFs) play a
critical role in altering and controlling the transcription program in every cell. Identification of functional
transcriptional regulators is an important task for transcriptional regulation research, but the performance of
current computational tools still has room for improvement. The global distribution of cis-regulatory elements
(CREs) where TFs bind to DNA in the genome and its potential association with TF functions, and mechanisms
of TF recruitment to the regulatory genome are still not fully understood. With the availability of large amounts
of multi-modal genomics data in the public domain, innovative computational methods with rigorous statistical
models are needed to leverage such big data for studying these fundamental problems in functional genomics.
The research program of my lab focuses on developing statistical models and computational methods for
functional data analysis to study transcriptional regulation, genomics and epigenomics. In the next five years,
we will focus our research efforts on the following directions: (1) Developing improved statistical models and
computational methods for functional TR prediction; (2) Investigating genomic clustering tendencies of CREs
and their association with TF functions; and (3) Identifying novel mechanisms of TF recruitment to the genome
by integrative analysis of CTCF binding with lncRNAs, R-loops, and DNA secondary structures using
computational approaches. We are committed to developing all computational methods and tools as open-

There are unmet needs in critical clinical care scenarios (e.g., surgery and intensive care) namely the lack of
real-time intraprocedural imaging and pathologic data, intelligent systems for visualization, and integration this
multimodality data with other clinical data for real-time decision guidance. TRD3 will develop deep learning (DL),
machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and visualization (VIS) tools to address these challenges. To
accomplish this objective the research team will undertake four Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the research team will
build data-driven instruments by jointly optimizing the optical hardware and the back-end machine learning model
for a given task. Optimized iFLIM and iDOS instruments with increased capabilities and higher SNR will be
developed for clinical use. In Aim 2, the research team will develop effective and expressive visualization
interfaces and human comprehension of multimodality imaging data. These tools will provide critical information
for critical decision making and improve clinical workflow. In Aim 3, the research team will develop new AI tools
to integrate heterogenous multimodality data to predict patient outcome. The multi-model data integration
approach will overcome the limitations of each single modality being considered in isolation. Finally, in Aim 4,
the research team will incorporate these new techniques into clinical workflow to provide real-time feedback for
surgical guidance. By accomplishing these aims the research team will develop and validate a set of advanced
analytical methods with AI/ML/DL for intelligent instrument design, data/image analysis, visualization, and clinical
decision making. Strong interactions and shared resources between this TRD and TRDs1 and 2 will enable
performance advancements in the imaging and inference capabilities. The combination of these approaches will
pave the way for choosing highly personalized treatments based on predictions of individual patient outcome."
10844453,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Technology Training and Dissemination
The overall goal of the NCIBT Technology Training and Dissemination (TTD) Program is to promote awareness,
understanding, and skillful and productive use of NCBIT technologies by: NCIBT investigators (in synergistically
linked NCIBT TRDs and CPs) in developing more advanced biophotonic devices and techniques, other
investigators (SPs) in enhancing their own studies, and sets of diverse academic investigators, interventionalist
physicians, and technicians in employing them clinically. These groups will be specifically targeted to (1) educate
(dissemination of knowledge) via scientific publications and presentations, courses, seminars, workshops,
summer schools, website, and social media, (2) train (dissemination of skill) via direct interaction of NCIBT
personnel and potential users in hands-on exercises in usage; (3) equip (dissemination of technology and
analytical tools) via scalable design, open-source description of its technology, loans of equipment, and
promoting commercialization; and (4) diversify (dissemination of access) via affirmative efforts to include a
diverse array of learners and users in all TTD activities. TTD will thus educate a progressively enlarging, highly
diverse cohort of biophotonics investigators and interventionalist physicians regarding the NCIBT technology's
capability and availability, train investigators, physicians, and technicians in its use, and help make the
technology and tools available to them. TTD efforts can thus be categorized as seeking four Specific Aims: Aim
1: To Educate: The NCIBT will disseminate its accumulated technical knowledge by educating a broad array of
learners. Aim 2: To Train: The NCIBT will disseminate skill in using its technology and tools by training scientists
and clinicians in hands-on exercises involving direct interaction of NCIBT personnel and future users. Aim 3: To
Equip: The NCIBT will disseminate its devices and tools to scientists and clinicians through scalable design,
open-source descriptions of its technology, providing equipment, and promoting commercialization. Aim 4: To
Diversify: The NCIBT will disseminate access to its education, training, and collaborative use programs by
affirmative efforts to include a diverse array of learners and users in all TTD activities. TTD Program activity will
be continuously catalogued and its efficacy assessed relative to specific metrics such as articles published,
presentations made, users trained, website visitors, social media followers, diversity of participants, and, most
importantly, clinical users, devices deployed, and cases in which the tools were used. Creation of a large cohort
of knowledgeable and capable investigators and end users of NCIBT technology through this TTD should prompt
others to join the Center's efforts as CPs, SPs or end users, thus generating input and data regarding the
technology's utility and guiding its further improvement and deployment."

10844542,"Elucidating mechanisms of novel mRNA nanoparticle and adenovirus-viral vector vaccine-
induced T and B cell activation at the site of vaccination and lymph nodes is of critical
importance. Studying patients with autoimmune disease treated with B cell depletion, we will
perform a systems analysis to examine dynamics of immune response to SARS-CoV-2
vaccination in the context of B cell depletion. As part of our previous HIPC project, we studied T-
B cell interactions in the acute phase of COVID-19 disease and found that PD-1high CXCR5–
CD4+ peripheral helper T (Tph) cells were increased and exhibited B cell help signatures.
Activated HLA-DR+CD38+ Tph cells were highly correlated with titers of anti-S1/RBD antibodies
and improved clinical outcome. As Tph cells are known for supporting the generation of
pathogenic autoantibodies and COVID-19 patients display autoantibody signatures, Tph cells
may play dual roles in COVID-19 infection driving recovery and long-term adverse autoimmune
sequel. Thus, we hypothesize that in response to vaccination, B cells affect the induction of
antigen specific T cells and Tph cells required for antibody production. In Aim 1a , we will
elucidate immune response signatures to SARS mRNA vaccination with B cell depletion. In
depth functional profiling of immune cells will be accomplished with CyTOF, 10x scRNA
sequencing with BCR/TCR analysis and CITE-seq and proteomics. Analysis of autoantibody
production will be conducted with the REAP platform to determine whether SARS-CoV-2
vaccinations induce autoantibodies and whether they are attenuated with B cell depletion. In
Aim 1b, early events in the immune response to vaccination in B cell depleted patients and
controls will be analyzed near the inoculation site and in draining lymph nodes determining
whether Tph cells involved in ectopic antibody production are induced at the site of vaccination.
In Aim 1c, we will measure antigen specific responses to viral peptides using oligo-conjugated
MHC tetramers with CITE-seq technology. We will elucidate immune signatures to a booster
vaccination in B cell depleted patients in Aim 2a, and compare the response between MF59-
adjuvanted flu vaccine and standard-dose flu vaccine in Aim 2b. We will determine whether
responses to SARS-CoV-2 and flu vaccines correlate and if the MF59 adjuvant enhances
immune response with B cell depletion. In total, this systems approach will allow us to elucidate
the role of B cells in inducing immune responses with novel mRNA vaccines."
10844543,"Influenza remains a worldwide public health threat in the 21st Century. While the incidence of influenza
decreased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza is certain to re-emerge and contribute to an
increased burden of respiratory viral disease together with SARS-CoV-2. The impact of infliuenza is magnified
by a vaccine that affords incomplete protection, and by the episodic appearance of new pandemic strains.
Influenza has a disproportionate impact in older adults, with 90% of the deaths in the United States attributed
to influenza occurring in individuals over the age of 65; nursing home residents with a high prevalence of frailty
are particularly vulnerable. Two vaccines are currently approved for use in adults over age 65—a high-dose
(HD) unadjuvanted vaccine and a MF59-adjuvanted standard-dose (SD) vaccine. Here, we will carry out the
first randomized study to compare immunologic, transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of response to these
two vaccines in older adult residents of nursing homes or patients in a homebound primary care program,
compared to young adults receiving the same vaccines. We are continuing our longstanding work with the Yale
Section of Geriatrics, collaborating with a group of geriatricians that serve as medical directors for these
faciilties and programs who are responsible for annual influenza vaccination. We will leverage our expertise in
carrying out studies in human immunology, particularly those that have elucidated innate immune and gene
expression signatures of vaccine response and how aging affects these signatures; for example, we carried
out the largest study of gene expression signatures of response to SD vaccine in young and older adults
enrolled over five consecutive vaccine seasons. Samples obtained prior to and following vaccination will
undergo detailed analyses by CyTOF (Core C) for innate and adaptive immune cell composition, activation
status, and intracellular cytokine production. We will also carry out unbiased studies of innate immune PRR
function in PBMC populations and platelets. The breadth of antibody responses to the influenza hemagglutinin
protein will be assessed using microneutralization studies with heterologous viral strains and cryo-electron
microscopy-based epitope mapping. These findings will be integrated with an established CITE-seq with cell
hashing platform (Core C) for single-cell transcriptomic analyses that will also be combined with B cell receptor
sequencing to compare responses in young vs. nursing home older adults, and with proteomic analyses on
serum samples done in collaboration with the Boston Children’s Hospital HIPC center. Finally, in a subset of
participants, we will obtain skin biopsies of the vaccination site to visualize early cellular infiltrates and regional
lymph node biopsies following vaccination to gain insights into immune responses in tissues and secondary
lymphoid organs using an innovative spatial transcriptomics program, DBiT-Seq. Understanding the genetic,
immunologic and protein architecture of influenza vaccination is likely to identify pathways that could be targets
of therapies, drugs or other biological treatments to optimize immune responses in older adults."
10844546,"ABSTRACT
Vaccines capitalize on our knowledge of the immune system to safeguard against infectious diseases and
historically have revolutionized human health. However, the powerful success of vaccination strategies is not
complete and certain vulnerable populations, even when receiving the recommended regimen, have ineffective
or inefficient responses. A fundamental challenge in clinical medicine and public health is to understand the
mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of responses in these populations in order to design rational
approaches to improve vaccine strategies. Addressing this challenge will require integration of information about
the complex interactions among cells and molecules of the immune system across time and space. The projects
in this proposal will carry out systems-level immune profiling of vaccination responses across three cohorts of
vulnerable patient populations: autoimmune patients with B cell depletion (Project 1), aged and frail individuals
(Project 2), and patients with sickle cell disease (Project 3). A multi-omics immune profiling core will generate
multi-omics data from longitudinal samples of circulating immune cells along with tissue biopsies to capture the
early response in situ in the skin and peak responses in draining lymph nodes. This Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC), led by Dr. Steven Kleinstein, will support the database, bioinformatics analysis and
complex data analysis needs of Projects 1, 2 and 3. In addition, the core will collaborate with project investigators
on experimental design and reporting, and provide a training environment for project personnel on software tools
and principles of methods and interpretation of results. Specifically, the DMAC will:
(1) Provide a secure data management system for clinical and research data.
(2) Submit data to the NIAID ImmPort repository and other public portals designated by NIAID, to ensure
 that all data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).
(3) Provide comprehensive biostatistical analysis support and consultation.
(4) Analyze and integrate cohort-wide data using multivariate statistical approaches to discover immune
 signatures associated with vulnerable populations and differential vaccine responses.
(5) Support investigators in Projects 1-3 by carrying out analyses to address their scientific questions.
(6) Collaborate with Core C (Multi-omic Immune Profiling) on pre-processing of all immune profiling data,
 submission of raw and computable data into the management system, and systems-level analyses.
(7) Integrate data across projects to detect common and unique signatures of vaccine responses.
(8) Actively participate in the HIPC Data Management and Integration subcommittee.
(9) Continue our efforts within HIPC towards the development and adoption of common data standards."
10847421,"Limb regeneration after injury is a sophisticated and energetically expensive process. In this process, progenitor
proliferation, osteoblast differentiation and mineral deposition all require sufficient supplies of biological building
blocks and ATP(1-5). However, the contribution of cell metabolism and its genetic control of skeletal regeneration
is largely unknown, representing a major knowledge gap. Using the established mouse digit tip amputation
model, we found that mice exhibit impaired regeneration during aging, and that this impairment is linked to
increased expression of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) genes, compared to young mice.
These exciting preliminary results have led us to investigate the metabolic and genetic mechanisms that underlie
skeletal regeneration.
Our preliminary findings support that skeletal regeneration is metabolism-dependent and can be manipulated by
exogenous metabolites and gene expression, respectively. These data suggest that administration of
oxaloacetate (OAA), a pro-glycolytic and pro-respiratory metabolite, increases regenerated bone volume and
thickness in a mouse model. Alternatively, modulation of collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (Cthrc1) also
alters skeletal regeneration. Cthrc1 is specifically expressed in the blastema, the dedifferentiated tissue structure
central to regeneration, and Cthrc1-/- mice demonstrated impaired regeneration and dysregulated cell
metabolism. Moreover, our preliminary data show that treatment with OAA increases Cthrc1 expression,
reinforcing a direct link between metabolism and genetic control. We hypothesize that a finely tuned interaction
between cell metabolism and genetic control synergistically regulates cell function, and that this interaction can
be manipulated both exogenously (OAA) and at a gene level (Cthrc1) to modulate regenerative outcomes."

10848044,"ABSTRACT: PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY
The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center is a re-envisioned consortium located in the heart of Center City Philadelphia
and is comprised of multidisciplinary investigators from Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Drexel
University (DU) dedicated to understanding and meeting the cancer needs of the residents within our catchment
area. These premiere institutions have the opportunity to work alongside one of the most diverse cities in America
and are dedicated to building a more equitable metropolis, where determinants of success are not defined by
race, ethnicity, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, income, or neighborhood. When diversity, equity,
and inclusion practices are woven into the framework of government agencies and academic institutions, a
strong model of fairness is created, allowing these groups to work together to develop career opportunities for
diverse groups that make up the neighborhoods of Philadelphia. As these groups cohesively work in partnership,
institutional and structural barriers can be dismantled as we strive to create an equitable workforce in
Philadelphia, together, where everyone thrives.
The SKCC’s Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) reflects our long-standing commitment to ensure that SKCC
members and leaders reflect the diversity of the nation. Strong roots were laid back in 2012, by Dr. Edith Mitchell
(EVP Cancer Disparities) through the creation of the Center to Eliminate Cancer Disparities. Mitchell’s vision
early on was forward thinking and multi-dimensional, with one area concentrating on the development of
comprehensive programs focused on training and teaching a diverse workforce that is culturally appropriate. Dr.
Mitchell’s training and education through a diverse lens have been recognized over the last decade and were
highlighted by her appointment in 2019 as the President of the National Medical Association.
These early efforts laid the groundwork for the SKCC to appoint Ana María Lopez, MD, MPH, MACP, FRCP
(London), Professor of Medical Oncology, as the inaugural Associate Director for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(AD DEI) for the SKCC on July 1, 2022. Dr. Lopez is a health services researcher and implementation scientist,
whose expertise in health equity, cultural humility, and digital health is internationally recognized. Upon her
appointment, the SKCC Office of DEI (ODEI) was established and their first priority was to assemble a team of
SKCC faculty and staff to define strategic DEI priorities and paths to inclusion. The now formalized SKCC DEI
Committee, B-JEDI (Belonging - Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion), guides the work of SKCC’s ODEI and
serves as an advisory board reporting to the Cancer Center Director. The B-JEDI Committee developed the first
SKCC DEI Strategic Plan in 2022 and in February 2023 issued a draft SKCC DEI Mission Statement which has
been approved by SKCC leadership and the Center Director."

regulating cell growth and survival; 2) Identify tumor-stroma interactions sustaining primary tumor growth and
distant recurrences; and 3) Develop novel imaging and therapeutic interventions to improve detection and clinical
outcomes, and catalyze the translation of these findings into the clinic. TaCO synergizes transdisciplinary efforts
to develop trials targeting cell signaling processes and metabolic vulnerabilities as well as novel imaging
approaches, particularly in catchment area priorities (breast and prostate cancers) and for cancers which Sidney
Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) is a national referral center (uveal melanoma, head and neck cancer). TaCO
members engage with and learn from the local community through outreach and retreats involving patient
advocates and community leaders, as well as regular interaction with the SKCC Community Advisory Board.
Furthermore, members continuously support the education and training mission through direct mentorship at all
career levels, NCI fellowships, T32 awards, and a novel diversity-enhancing training program.
The TaCO Program is led by Mauricio Reginato, PhD, and Ubaldo Martinez-Outschoorn, MD, who provide
complementary expertise in signaling and metabolic alterations in tumor progression, and mechanisms of
metabolic crosstalk between different cancer and non-cancer cells within a tumor, respectively. To capture the
research strengths across the consortium, the Program assembles 41 members from 13 departments across
Thomas Jefferson University and Drexel University. TaCO members have successfully published and obtained
grant support. Total cancer-relevant funding is $12.7 M with $4.1 M from NCI and a further $6.1 M from other
NIH institutes and DOD. TaCO has published 691 cancer-relevant research articles of which 25.3% are intra-
programmatic, 23% are inter-programmatic, and 39.8% are collaborative with other NCI-designated Cancer
Centers. Important discoveries have been published in high-impact journals including Cell, Cancer Discov, Mol
Cell, Nature Commun, Cancer Res and Clin Cancer Res.
The TaCO Program’s future directions are aligned to the SKCC strategic plan, IMPACT PHL. Future goals are
to: 1) Expand thematic areas of 'Metabolism, Mitochondria and Imaging' and 'Signaling and Metastasis', 2) Foster
translational clinical trials; and 3) Enhance faculty mentoring and education initiatives."

10848049,"ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is foundational to the success of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer
Center (SKCC), as it links the research and investigators at the SKCC to the residents and communities in its
catchment area. The 7-county SKCC catchment area is mostly urban and extremely diverse, consisting of 5
million residents who speak upwards of 45 different languages and experience some of the most adverse social
determinants of heath of any communities in our nation. The Office of COE was established in 2020 to develop,
facilitate, and evaluate COE activities across the SKCC. Currently led by Dr. Amy Leader, the first Associate
Director for COE at the SKCC, the Office consists of 3 master’s prepared program managers and 6 additional
staff. One of the core functions of the Office is to maintain a robust Community Advisory Board (CAB) as a
mechanism of communication between the SKCC and the catchment area. Membership of the CAB is reflective
of the communities and populations in the catchment area; the CAB is led by a Community Chair and Co-Chair
and reports directly to the Director of the SKCC. Other responsibilities of the Office of COE are to determine the
priority cancers of the catchment area and to execute the aims of the Office. The specific aims of the Office are
to: (1) identify needs, assess priorities, and continually monitor the catchment area across the cancer continuum;
(2) foster bi-directional partnerships with communities to ensure that research and clinical trials are responsive
to catchment area priorities; and (3) implement evidence-based interventions, policy recommendations, and
public education campaigns across the catchment area to reduce cancer disparities. For the first aim, the Office
uses national, state, and local data plus its own Catchment Area Report to monitor the trends and needs of the
catchment area and provide data to investigators to support catchment-relevant research. For the second aim,
the Office supports the Research Programs in developing, implementing, and evaluating research and clinical
trials that are relevant to the catchment area, as well as creating novel initiatives to prepare investigators,
community members and trainees to participate in COE activities. For the third aim, the Office supports evidence-
based initiatives, such as community-based cancer screening and linkage to resources, to further policy and
practice in the catchment area. Taken together, these outreach and engagement strategies will allow the SKCC
to achieve its broader mission of reducing cancer disparities in the catchment area."

among vertebrates in being able to regenerate numerous tissues and body parts. These include the spinal
cord, limbs, jaw, retina, brain, heart, and tail, all of which can be regenerated at any point during embryonic,
larval, and adult life. Also, axolotls are used by researchers that work in additional areas, including
neurobiology, ecotoxicology, development, physiology, cell biology, genetics, genomics, and evolution. This is
an exciting time for the axolotl community as it’s incredibly large genome (32 Gb) was recently sequenced and
assembled. New and assessable resources are allowing cutting edge technologies like gene-editing and single
cell RNA sequencing to be performed for the first time, approaches that are rapidly accelerating discoveries
using axolotl models. Since 2020, 31 different axolotl-associated projects have been awarded by NIH with
support coming from multiple institutes (NICHD, NHLBI, NIDDK, NIGMS, NINDS, OD, NEI, and NCI). NIH
support is catalyzing advances in biomedical research through its support of the axolotl and the AGSC,
increasing the likelihood that investigators will use axolotl models in the future.
During the current funding period, the AGSC is maintaining and generating high quality, axolotl stocks that are
needed by a growing number of NIH-funded investigators. Husbandry and management practices have been
modified to increase availability of post-embryonic stocks. Also, new transgenic and knock-out stocks have
been imported into the AGSC and cryopreservation methods are under development to preserve and more
efficiently manage stocks. The proposed Curation and Informatics Component in this revision application will
increase data management efficiencies. Specifically, multiple types of data, including animal and
environmental data, will be managed within a software package that enables mobile data entry and retrieval. A
second objective of the Curation and Informatics Component is to better serve and interface with AGSC
stakeholders. A research software designer will be recruited to manage the AGSC website and overall data
management plan, and a curator / outreach coordinator will be recruited to develop new website content and to
interface with axolotl stakeholders. Overall, the project will increase the AGSCs impact in biomedical research

10848179,"SUMMARY
Biomarkers of metabolic syndrome(MetSyn) and vascular disease expressed soon after World Trade Center
(WTC) particulate matter (PM) exposure predict development of WTC-Lung Injury (WTC-LI). However, the
identification of biosignatures and molecular determinants of WTC-PM related disease are yet to be
comprehensively characterized and remain as untapped resources. Whereas genetic and environmental factors
are the foundation of many disease processes, metabolomic profiling provides a close link to disease phenotype
and is profoundly influenced by the microbiome.
A combined multiOMIC approach has the potential to be an effective tool for early diagnosis of WTC-LI, predictor
of disease prognosis, surveillance marker of treatment response, and detection of further disease development.
Furthermore, reducing MetSyn risk factors through a technology-supported multidisciplinary nutritional
intervention can also improve BMI, lung function and quality of life measures.
We hypothesize that multiOMIC biosignatures of WTC-LI will facilitate the understanding of the dynamic biologic
pathways that are altered by environmental influences that lead to a heterogenous response to PM exposure
and treatment. We will investigate the:
1. MULTIOMICS, including phenomics, metabolites, microbiome and genomic profiles associated with WTC-LI
in our pilot symptomatic FIREHOUSE RCT cohort. We will then integrate the MultiOME using systems biology
to optimize disease specific models and identify pertinent pathways of WTC-LI.
2. LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS of the FIREHOUSE treatment model using longitudinal phenotypic and
multidisciplinary assessment of physical, cardiopulmonary, and mental health. Feedback will be obtained using
focus groups and questionnaires.
3. FEASIBILITY AND NEED ASSESSMENT. This will be the first multiOMIC study in WTC-exposed subjects,
enabling the identification of distinctive patterns in individuals with WTC-LI, and motivating specific therapeutic
approaches. This will allow us to lay the ground work for the eventual implementation of the FIREHOUSE model.
We will undertake a feasibility and need assessment using shared decision-making. VALIDATION of our
nutritional findings in additional cohorts will prove its generalizability and assist other WTC exposed populations.
The overall goal at the end of four years will be to understand the long-term effects of our tailored nutritional
intervention. Data generated by this grant will improve the understanding of WTC-LI and enhance our ability to
diagnose and treat WTC-related airway injury. Qualified bio-signatures can be externally validated in other
cohorts that face significant elevations of BMI and heavy PM exposure who may also benefit from the technology-
supported diet modification. Lessons learned from this investigation can be validated in other cohorts who face
significant public health concerns due to heavy PM exposure, and who may benefit from targeted therapies."
10848188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed project addresses the problem of low diversity in biomedical and behavioral
research by continuing and improving the University of Florida (UF) MARC program. The
program will recruit 30 undergraduate trainees from underrepresented (UR) backgrounds and
place them with NIH-funded faculty mentors for up to three years of continuous research
mentorship within an integrated training environment. The overall program is designed to
increase each trainee's technical, operational, and professional development skills for
biomedical and behavioral research, promote each trainee's academic performance, and
enhance each trainee's mental health and wellness, with the goal of increasing motivation and
preparation for transitioning to a competitive PhD program. The program recruited its first
trainee cohort in 2017 and appointed 17 trainees through 2020 (four more have been selected
for 2021). All 12 trainees who have since graduated were accepted to competitive PhD
programs (10) or directly entered the biomedical workforce (2). The program includes 15
undergraduate degree programs at UF in which ca. 3,300 students (30%) are from
underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and ca. 1,000 (9%) are students with disabilities. The
proposed MARC program has six measurable performance targets: 1) recruit 30 trainees (10 as
rising sophomores and 20 as rising juniors), 2) at least 93% trainee retention, 3) 100%
participation in an extramural research experience, 4) at least 93% 4-year graduation rate (5-yr
for engineering majors), 5) at least 75% authorship on a research publication, and 6) at least
90% matriculation to a PhD or MD/PhD program within two years. The training plan includes
continuous participation in research mentored by a faculty research mentor and an integrated
curriculum of courses and activities. The proposed program includes three novel, innovative
projects: development of two Data Science and Research Computing courses that provide
training in biomedical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, biweekly
trainee participation Mental Health & Wellness Process Groups led by senior psychiatry
residents, and development of workshops to train graduate students and postdoctoral students
in mentoring undergraduates in research environments. Resources from these novel projects
will be open and exportable. Program outcomes will be continuously monitored, and
adjustments made whenever indicated."
10848191,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a major cause of perinatal mortality and long-term morbidity, affects 1-
5/1000 live births. Hypoxic ischemic insults (HII) lead to HIE through a cascade of neuronal injury that continues
for hours to days. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) proved that brain injury from HII can be avoided, revolutionizing
treatment of HIE. Despite TH success, additional improvements are urgently needed as up to 63% of infants still
die or have long term cognitive deficits. Also, guidelines for treatment are highly subjective, with no consensus
on when to treat mild HIE. Our first premise is that adverse outcomes are due to ongoing neuronal injury after
HII. As neurons are the primary consumer of oxygen, measures of cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) would
provide a potential means to monitor neuronal health and the evolution of injury. Our second premise is that
hemodynamic instability contributes to adverse outcomes through secondary neuronal injury. Secondary injury
may be preventable with bedside measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to ensure the brain’s metabolic needs
are met. In fact, direct CBF measures enable assessment of cerebral autoregulation (CA) and neurovascular
coupling (NVC), which reflect hemodynamic stability. Bedside measures of CMRO2 and CBF could enable
treatment optimization to prevent secondary injury and inform decisions on who to treat. In R01HD076258, our
major achievement was performing >500 Frequency-Domain NIRS and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (FDNIRS-
DCS) measurements in >100 neonates with HIE, demonstrating that routine direct bedside measurement of CBF
and CMRO2 are possible. Our major finding is that CMRO2 in the days after TH was the only early predictor of
outcome, with higher CMRO2 strongly associated (r=0.62, P=0.002) with better 18-month cognitive scores of
Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3rd edition (BSID-3). Our renewal goal is to perform early, continuous
bedside monitoring of CMRO2 and CBF, demonstrating their potential as vital signs with three aims: Aim 1:
Extend current infrastructure to enable continuous, real-time bedside monitoring of neonatal CBF and CMRO2
at 100Hz, integrated with data from other clinical monitors. Aim 2: In neonates with HIE, determine evolution of
CMRO2, CA and NVC during TH and their association with post-TH CMRO2; validate that post-TH CMRO2
predicts 2-year outcome. Aim 3: In controls and neonates at risk for HIE but not meeting criteria for TH,
determine CMRO2, CA and NVC during the first 24 hours; determine if day 1 CMRO2 predicts 2-year outcome. In
the first grant, we demonstrated that bedside measures of CBF and CMRO2 are feasible and discovered that
CMRO2 after TH predicts of outcome. In this renewal, we propose to turn CMRO2 and CBF into early, continuous,
real-time, bedside vital signs. Our goal is to determine if there is evidence of neuronal injury (decreased CMRO2)
mediated by cerebral hemodynamic instability (impaired CA and NVC). If successful, CMRO2 and CBF
monitoring may improve neonatal outcomes by enabling medical optimization of hemodynamic stability during
TH as well as to screen for neonates at risk for HIE who may benefit from TH."
10848327,"Project Summary / Abstract
Chromosomal rearrangements have multiple impacts on human health in cancer, inherited genetic disease,
and normal tissue function. While less frequent than single-nucleotide changes, structural variants are
disproportionately impactful because they alter genome continuity and change many base pairs at once.
Rearrangements mainly arise through DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) because they disrupt chromosomal
integrity. Over many years this project has engaged basic studies of the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair
and chromosomal mutagenesis conducted mainly in yeast, specifically nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and
how it and other repair pathways such as homologous recombination (HR) contribute to genome maintenance.
We will continue to exploit yeast to explore a set of critical contextual influences that determine the flux through
DSB repair toward variable outcomes, focusing on contexts for which a single-cell eukaryote is an ideal
experimental system. This project will specifically investigate some of the earliest events in DSB repair that
occur soon after recognition of the break and coincident with the commitment to a repair mechanism. At the
smallest scale, we will exploit novel single-base resolution resection and protein occupancy assays to explore
the impact of local sequence on DSB repair, in particular on specific protein functions in the initial stages of
DSB resection in vivo. At the genomic scale, we will follow up our recent findings to understand how nuclear
and functional properties of different DSB locations influence mutagenic outcome frequencies through DSB
movement. At the cellular scale, we will expand our focus to investigate the mechanisms by which metabolic
signaling in response to carbon source interacts with the DNA damage response and cell cycle, which our prior
work identifies as an important and underexplored aspect of DSB repair regulation. Results will provide novel
insights into how these cellular processes normally preserve the genome and how rearrangements result when
they are perturbed by environmental or genetic factors."
10846239,"This proposal requests funding for the Biotechnology Predoctoral Training Program at Northwestern University,
which supports core activities for training a select group of students, nucleates the biotechnology community,
and provides many training opportunities. This interdisciplinary and interdepartmental Program draws students
from 6 participating graduate programs: the Departments of Chemical & Biological Engineering (ChBE),
Biomedical Engineering (BME), Material Sciences & Engineering (MSE), and Chemistry (Chem), the
Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) graduate program, and the Driskill Graduate Program in Life
Sciences (DGP). Research opportunities, chosen from rotations in bioengineering and life sciences
laboratories, are complemented by a core interdisciplinary curriculum. Instruction in responsible conduct of
research is provided, and discussion and training in reproducibility and rigor (R&R) is woven throughout the
Program. Three- to six-month industrial internships expose Trainees to modern biotechnology. A BTP-only
retreat and other gatherings promote scientific interactions across the Biotechnology community at
Northwestern. At monthly biotechnology Research in Progress meetings, Trainees and faculty discuss their
research results and challenges, develop communication skills, interact with other Trainees, and discuss
personal experience with R&R challenges and strategies. Trainees select topics and suggest speakers for a
Biotechnology Seminar Series that brings industrial and academic scientists to campus for discussions with
Trainees. Trainees organize a Biotechnology Practicum and co-host a Biotechnology Nexus event. The
Practicum provides both pedagogical and experiential, hands-on training in current and emerging
biotechnologies. Biotechnology Nexus introduces Trainees and the broader biotechnology community to
numerous representatives from industry, who answer questions and discuss their career paths and strategies
for navigating opportunities and challenges in industry. Professional development also includes crafting and
discussing an Individual Development Plan. Trainees are recruited by the Program through graduate program
orientations, email, brochures, presentations, and web pages. Extensive efforts are made to recruit and
support students from underrepresented groups and/or with disabilities. Trainees are selected from all 6
graduate programs using a rubric and process aligned with holistic evaluation of applicants, explicitly
prioritizing cohort diversity. Mentoring excellence is supported by formal training and multi-level evaluation
aligned to program evaluation. Northwestern provides significant resources to enhance the Program and
increase the number of students benefitted. The Graduate School provides additional training slots and tuition
supplements; and the McCormick School of Engineering, the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, the
ChBE and Molecular Biosciences Departments, and the Feinberg School of Medicine contribute stipend
supplements, administrative support, and operating funds."

Protozoan parasites of the group kinetoplastids are responsible for major human maladies such as fatal sleeping
sickness (Trypanosoma brucei, also termed the African trypanosome), Chagas disease (T. cruzi), and
leishmaniasis (Leishmania species). Due to the lack of inexpensive and safe drugs, rising resistance against
current drugs, and limited drug discovery efforts, novel approaches are urgently needed to combat these
neglected tropical diseases. Because kinetoplastids constitute one of the earliest-branching organisms in the
eukaryotic tree of life, they exhibit numerous molecular and cellular features that are distinct from metazoa and
fungi, and that can be exploited for pharmacological intervention. By combining structural, biochemical, and in
vivo approaches, we seek to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and gene regulation in the
model kinetoplastid T. brucei. We are particularly interested in the structure and mechanism of the closely related
DOT1A and DOT1B enzymes that are key regulators of essential functions in T. brucei and that catalyze the
methylation of histone H3 lysine 76 (H3K76) in the globular nucleosome core region. While DOT1A regulates
cell-cycle progression, DOT1B in antigenic variation, an essential mechanism for the parasite to evade the host’s
immune system. Due to significant mechanistic differences of trypanosome DOT1A/B to human and yeast DOT1
enzymes, the molecular mechanisms of how they methylate chromatin and how they are regulated remain poorly
understood. In Aim 1, we will therefore investigate the mechanism of DOT1A-nucleosome substrate recognition
and its impact on cell cycle control. In Aim 2, we will decipher the regulatory mechanism of DOT1A governed by
RNaseH2, an enzyme that is known to cleave RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids and that has been implicated in both
DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Our goal is to define the impact of RNaseH2 on DOT1A activity,
provide a structural basis for its regulatory function, and elucidate the mechanism of how DOT1A activity is
coordinated with the cell cycle. The interaction of RNaseH2 with DOT1A/B is specific to trypanosomes,
suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism of DOT1 enzymes. Collectively, our studies will illuminate the long-
standing question of how DOT1A is recruited to chromatin and how it is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner.
Our studies will yield the first atomic structures of the fundamental unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, of the vast
group of protozoa, which are medically, ecologically, evolutionarily, and scientifically important eukaryotes. Due
to the novel regulatory function of RNaseH2, our results will broaden our mechanistic understanding of DOT1A
and RNaseH2 enzymes. Because T. brucei DOT1-regulated processes are essential for the parasite, this
research may ultimately have a large impact on global health by exploiting the unique attributes of protozoan
DOT1 structure and regulation to inform novel therapies for sleeping sickness and other diseases caused by
kinetoplastids that affect half a billion of people."

 Shared information in cortical functional architecture is embedded in topographies that are
idiosyncratic, posing a major impediment for functional brain imaging research. Hyperalignment
resolves this problem by projecting information from individual brains into a common model
information space.
 The proposed research project will create HyperBase – research infrastructure that will
enable the brain imaging research community to leverage hyperalignment to greatly enrich their
data, enable analyses of shared information and individual differences embedded in
idiosyncratic fine-scale cortical topographies, and create a data sharing platform for data in the
hyperaligned common model information space. The infrastructure will be an optimized,
standardized template common model space based on a normative database, turnkey software
tools for hyperaligning new brains and estimating individual functional topographies, and a
framework for sharing hyperaligned data. These data and tools will provide community
infrastructural support for research on a broad range of topics in clinical neuroscience, brain
aging, and basic cognitive neuroscience. The proposed database will consist of fMRI data in 60
participants collected during movie viewing, story listening, at rest, and during a large set of
functional localizers, augmented with demographic information and cognitive and personality
test scores.
Specific aims
 1. Produce an optimized, standardized template for hyperalignment based on a normative
 database with open-source software that will allow mapping numerous functional
 topographies, based on standard localizer data in the normative sample, into new
 participant brains using only fMRI data collected while the new participants watch a movie,
 listen to a story, or are at rest.
 2. Adapt hyperalignment algorithms to work with a standard template and estimate functional
 topographies via the template and normative localizer data. Develop new hyperalignment
 algorithms that increase power, precision, and flexibility.
 3. Create a system for sharing functional brain imaging data that are projected into the
 common information space model, allowing accumulation of data in a framework that
 affords at a fine-grained level of detail. Hyperalign existing public datasets."

10856940,"ABSTRACT: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 7th most prevalent cancer globally,
resulting in 930,000 new cases and 467,000 deaths annually. Alongside tobacco and alcohol use, human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection contributes to HNSCC development. Regardless of their clinical stage or location,
these tumors exhibit significant heterogeneity in gene expression and treatment response. While immunotherapy
has revolutionized treatment approaches for many cancers, its impact on HNSCC remains limited. This suggests
aspects of HNSCC tumor immunology – including the role HPV plays in immune dysregulation – are not well
understood. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop, validate, and implement advanced computational
tumor phenotyping techniques to characterize HNSCC at multiple levels of biological organization. Our approach
involves high-throughput analysis of quantitative features from both radiology images (i.e., radiomics) and digital
pathology images (i.e., pathomics) to generate a multiscale depiction of the HNSCC phenotype. We hypothesize
that tumor-specific radiopathomic expression patterns of HNSCC are connected to fundamental biological and
immunomolecular processes driving therapeutic resistance. In Aim 1, the prognostic value of radiomics will be
evaluated in both HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy as part of a previously conducted
prospective clinical trial (NCT01908504). Changes in radiomic expression after initial 20 Gy will be quantified via
data assimilation of PET/CT imaging and stochastic models of tumor dynamics. In Aim 2, the tumor immune
microenvironment of these patients will be characterized via pathomic analysis. Single-cell interactions will be
measured between different immune compositions and compared to single-cell transcriptomics data to gain
mechanistic insight into the genes driving pathomic expression. Radiomics (Aim 1) and pathomics (Aim 2) will
each be experimentally confirmed and mechanistically validated in novel carcinogen-induced and genetically
engineered mouse models that co-evolve with an intact immune system, where we will dissect mechanisms of
treatment resistance and interrogate immune dysregulation in mice that spontaneously develop HPV+ vs. HPV−
HNSCC. In Aim 3, our scientific findings will be independently tested in an ongoing prospective interventional
study (NCT04667585) to evaluate radiopathomic expression as a potential biomarker to guide adaptive therapy
for HPV+ HNSCC. Candidate biomarkers identified in NCT01908504 will be independently tested in
NCT04667585 to provide an unbiased evaluation of their prognostic value. The rationale for these studies is to
enhance understanding of HNSCC biology to guide improved treatment approaches for this urgent, unmet
clinical need. By leveraging innovative radiopathomic strategies, novel clinical trial data, and complementary
mechanistic interrogation, our proposed research will be an important advancement in computational oncology
and precision treatment of HNSCC. We anticipate that our results will improve our understanding of HNSCC
treatment resistance and will bridge a knowledge gap between abstract image representation and basic biology."

The NIH Diversity supplement will financially support the training and development of a first-
generation, Peruvian U.S. permanent resident Ph.D. candidate, who will be conducting research
in the topics disclosed in the parent grant. This student will be investigating the mechanistic
pathways of Cu-catalyzed C-N cross-couplings under a diverse set of dianionic ligand and
reaction conditions. Recent mechanistic findings showed that oxalamides, a type of dianionic
ligand, form a Cu(II) complex that catalyzes Ullman couplings of aryl halides with phenoxides by
a new mechanism involving redox “non-innocence” of the ligand. However, the generality of this
finding has yet to be established. The span of the ligands being surveyed differ by the degree of
conjugation in their backbone which is hypothesized to correlate with their likelihood of following
the mechanism involving ligand redox. Since Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling to form C-N bonds
occurs with copper complexes of several ligands that could also bind as dianions, testing these
systems will create a better understanding of the mechanisms of Cu catalyzed cross-coupling and
pave the way for more effective ligand design. In addition to these mechanistic and
methodological research plans, the candidate will follow an individualized development and
training plan we have created to best suit his career aims during his predoctoral training. These
activities will include participation and instruction in problem-solving sessions in synthesis and
catalysis, taking part in workshops to prepare the candidate for writing grants, working closely
with a postdoctoral mentor and the research advisor to prepare manuscripts and presentations,
as well enhancing his ability to present research results orally and to establish scientific networks
by attending and presenting at national conferences."

This R35 application describes a robust research framework to facilitate discovery and translation of new
therapeutic targets in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a common cause of acute respiratory
failure that carries a high mortality rate and has no beneficial targeted therapies. ARDS remains a significant
health problem affecting 190,000 Americans per year, costing billions of dollars, and leaving the majority of
patients dead or significantly impaired. New insights into the pathogenesis are needed to deepen our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to ARDS as well as to develop novel therapeutics.
Thus, there is an unmet need to define clinically relevant therapeutic targets that can be studied
mechanistically and rapidly carried through robust pre-clinical studies. For the last 14 years I have been
building my research team to be on the forefront of translational discovery. My group has made major
contributions to understanding ARDS pathophysiology. The major focus of my laboratory is defining the key
cellular and molecular regulators of alveolar capillary barrier function and dysfunction that underlies ARDS
pathology. My R35 research program is designed to identify novel mediators in ARDS using lung tissue
imaging mass spectrometry and deep phenotyping of gene expression profiles at the single cell level coupled
with advanced statistical methods to identify leading targets. New targets will be studied in in vitro transgenic
model systems to define cellular and molecular mechanisms in order to facilitate the development of novel
therapeutics to be tested in pre-clinical models. My research framework is centered on three goals: Discovery,
Mechanism and Translation. Goal 1 – Discovery. To accomplish this goal, we will break new ground using
imaging mass spectrometry and single cell RNA sequencing to create an expression profile and protein “map”
of the injured and uninjured human lung. Using advanced statistical approaches, we will identify promising
targets to take forward into further studies. Goal 2 – Mechanism. Leveraging our existing lung injury models,
institutional resources and new approaches, we will define the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that lead
to alveolar capillary barrier permeability in ARDS by generating novel transgenic cell and mouse lines for
mechanistic studies. Goal 3 – Translation. Building on our existing ex vivo human lung and in vivo mouse
models, we will generate rigorous pre-clinical data based on new targets identified in our Discovery and
Mechanism studies. With this R35, my lab will advance the mission of the NHLBI by: generating a catalogue of
single cell transcription profiles and tissue protein expression levels in acutely injured and uninjured human
lung, identifying novel therapeutic targets in ARDS, defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating
alveolar capillary barrier dysfunction and conducting pre-clinical studies in mouse and human models. The R35
will provide the support and flexibility necessary for me to break new ground in ARDS."

A central goal of infectious disease research is to identify the genes that determine an individual’s
susceptibility to parasites. Biomedical research has made substantial progress towards this goal by
establishing molecular and genetic approaches for detecting alleles associated with parasite resistance
and host health. Pursuing these alleles across many organisms, including humans, has revealed an
underlying problem: an allele may strongly predict parasite resistance in one environment but not
others, or against one parasite strain but not others. This context-dependence might explain why
genomic surveys have rarely been able to identify alleles that consistently explain disease
susceptibility in humans. In addition, there is immense genetic diversity for parasite resistance in
host populations, and this diversity is not represented in the few inbred lab lines used to identify
alleles in model organisms. Therefore, to gain a general understanding of the alleles that matter for
parasite resistance, we must account for the genetic diversity and environmental complexity present
in the natural settings in which hosts encounter their parasites. In the next five years, research in my
lab will address this need by characterizing the genetic basis of parasite resistance across genetic and
environmental contexts using diverse host and parasite genotypes sampled from nature. My lab
group is well-positioned for this work: we have expertise in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and
its most prevalent natural parasite, the microsporidia Nematocida parisii. This powerful model
system enables us to quickly and cheaply perform highly replicated experiments and genomic
analyses to examine genetic variants across contexts. Recent efforts to collect wild C. elegans isolates
and parasite strains have provided us with the broad sampling of natural variation necessary for our
goal. Here, I propose to 1) characterize the alleles that contribute to parasite resistance in natural
populations using high-throughput phenotyping, genome-wide association surveys, and high-
resolution quantitative trait mapping based on public collections of fully-sequenced wild C. elegans
genotypes (>300) and recombinant inbred lines based on multiple wild parents. I then propose to
use experimental evolution, phenotype mapping, and transgenic host lines to: 2) evaluate the impact
of parasite genotype on the expression of genetic variation for parasite resistance, and 3) examine the
sensitivity of resistance alleles to relevant environmental variation, specifically in microbial diet and
population density. This proposed work forms the foundation of my research program targeted at
establishing general frameworks for identifying the diversity of alleles that can determine parasite
resistance and evaluating their contribution to host health in real world settings. This work will
support efforts to use genetic data to predict the health of individuals and populations."

Excessive alcohol drinking Initiated during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental
patterns, increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in
adulthood. In response to RFA-AA-21-009, the Data Analysis Resource (DAR) proposes to support the next 5
years' data collection and analysis across a diverse community sample of male and female participants that
were recruited in 3 age bands between 12 and 21 years old, were mostly no-to-low drinkers, and tracked over
the last 8 years across 5 sites (N=831; 93% retention rate). Monitoring has involved annually-acquired
multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state fMRI, task fMRI) and cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and
biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer and our mobile app. These measures will now be
complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep and physical activity tracking. This cohort
sequential design uniquely positions NCANDA-A to quantify transient or enduring alcohol-related disturbances
in specific adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol’s effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g.,
age of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will
quantify the impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and
their relations with alcohol use patterns. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns
and history, impact of alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
The goal of the DAR is to support hypothesis testing based on five aims. Aim D1 will ensure that procedures
for collection and quality control of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical assessment data are
standardized. In Aim D2, the DAR will advance the existing informatics infrastructure for integrating data
collected across all sites. Aim D3 will enhance macrostructural, microstructural, and functional neuroimage
processing and analysis. In Aim D4, the DAR will create machine (deep) learning frameworks identifying
predictive markers of early adulthood drinking. Aim D5 will maintain data sharing and distribution systems for
consortium PIs and the scientific public at large.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning."
10855248,"Food allergy affects about 10% of the US population, and its incidence continues to grow. More than
40% of individuals with peanut allergies have experienced life-threatening anaphylaxis, which occurs when
allergen binds IgE antibodies to activate allergic effector cells. Immunotherapy for food allergies induces IgG
antibodies that disrupt these IgE-allergen interactions. Therefore, the molecular interactions of high affinity
antibodies with allergen are clinically relevant to food allergy and tolerance. Somatic recombination and
hypermutation have evolved to generate remarkably diverse antibody repertoires. However, we and others
found highly similar antibodies commonly selected out by different individuals during a specific, adaptive
immune response. We propose that understanding this apparent constraint on antibody selection to
immunodominant epitopes of food allergens is essential to understanding the origins of food allergy, the
mechanism of immunotherapy-induced therapeutic antibodies, and new potential avenues of intervention.
 Our long-term goal to develop antibody-based therapeutics relies upon understanding antibody
recognition of allergens. We recently identified neutralizing antibodies in patients with durable efficacy after oral
immunotherapy. These antibodies uniquely disrupt IgE-allergen interactions through their epitope-specific
recognition of allergen. During the structural characterization of conformational epitopes of the
immunodominant peanut allergen Ara h 2, we identified that our previously reported highly similar (convergent)
antibodies, bind to the same epitope. Additional Arah2-specific IgG and IgE antibodies with homology to our
convergent antibodies have also been identified in other cohorts. In our preliminary data, we found that
germline reversions of these antibodies can bind to the Ara h 2.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that frequently occurring convergent antibodies, recognizing
structurally similar epitopes, evolve from several common germline rearrangements and emerge first in early
life. Our approach involves using cloning peanut and tree nut specific antibodies from single antigen-specific B
cells from sensitized and allergic children and adults. We are uniquely positioned to address this topic, through
our application of the allergen-specific B cell multimers, epitope-specific antibody characterization, and
collaborations to develop mutated allergens. We will address our hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1)
Define allergen-specific antibody convergence structurally using monoclonal recombinant antibodies and (2)
Identify prevalence and evolution of convergent allergen-specific antibodies.
 We anticipate that the proposed studies will structurally define convergent antibodies and elucidate the
inherent ability of germline antibodies to recognize allergens to provide new insights into how allergen
recognition develops in early life."

Almost 300,000 patients undergo cardiac surgery in the U.S. annually, and up to 30% develop cardiac surgery
associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI). The complication is potentially preventable and results in 3-4
additional intensive care unit (ICU) days, $10-40K added health expenditures per case, and up to 10-fold
increased odds of mortality. In severe cases requiring dialysis, consequences are even greater. While efforts to
identify targets for CSA-AKI risk-reducing interventions have focused on underlying patient risk and surgical
details, the intraoperative and early ICU periods remain understudied sources of outcome variation.
Intraoperative and early ICU periods present unique opportunities for reducing CSA-AKI due to (i) unique renal
insults due to altered hemodynamics of cardiopulmonary bypass; (ii) major physiologic shifts and clinical
interventions detailed in granular intraoperative and ICU data, and (iii) amenability to process change.
A paradigm shift in how CSA-AKI is understood during these periods remains possible through the addition of
detailed minute-to-minute intraoperative and early ICU data to factors in traditional prediction models, but
requires advanced analytical approaches to identify patterns within the 25,000 physiologic, fluid, medication, and
intervention data points available for each patient. The potential value of such patterns is emerging in recent
studies, yet remains unvalidated in large, contemporary cardiac surgery populations. Moreover, for CSA-AKI
prediction models to be maximally informative, risk-reducing modifiable processes of care are likely not “one size
fits all”, as are commonly applied in healthcare despite important heterogeneity of treatment effects across
diverse pathologies and procedures. Finally, efforts to translate evidence to practice often fail, due to poor
communication of evidence-based, patient-specific benchmarking data to individual clinicians.
We propose a multicenter study leveraging the integration of two mature, unique research and quality
improvement collaboratives built upon national, standardized registries: the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes
Group (MPOG) and the Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Database. MPOG uses nurse-
validated, detailed minute-to-minute intraoperative and early ICU data from the EHR for research and quality
improvement. Headquartered at University of Michigan and guided by Associate Research Director PI Mathis,
MPOG has integrated 16 million patient records across >40 health systems in 22 states and provides monthly
automated performance improvement benchmarking reports to 5,000 frontline anesthesiology clinicians. In
addition, MPOG has integrated each member hospital’s STS clinical registry to create a unique national “MPOG-
STS” dataset of 80,000 cardiac surgeries. We will (i) identify high-impact, modifiable intraoperative and early
ICU processes of care associated with reduced CSA-AKI; (ii) estimate the impact of individualized treatment
strategies versus standardized or usual care for reducing CSA-AKI and progression to CKD, and (iii) disseminate
and assess the effect of precision feedback on CSA-AKI and relevant processes of care."

diagnosed in under-screened individuals or after a failure to follow-up abnormal screening results. Cervical
cancer screening and management (CCSM) is complex as both screening modalities and management
guidelines have recently evolved. The 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force screening guidelines
recommend 3 strategies to screen for cervical cancer: Pap test with option of reflex human papilloma virus
(HPV) testing, Pap/ HPV co-testing, and HPV alone. The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical
Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines for managing abnormal results reflect the principle of “equal management for
equal risks,” promoting highly personalized management, with synthesis of current and prior results, to
maximize benefits of cancer prevention while minimizing harms of over-testing and over-treatment. Yet, the
complexity of these current evidence-based clinical guidelines makes it challenging for clinicians to implement
in practice. Lack of integration of the ASCCP algorithms with electronic health records (EHRs) is an important
barrier to management. As a result, incomplete and incorrect follow-up represents an ongoing and growing
challenge, involving complex interactions among patients, primary care practitioners and specialists.
Implementing personalized risk-based cervical cancer screening requires addressing barriers at individual,
both patient and practitioner, levels as well as at care team and health system levels. We propose to develop,
test and disseminate a health information technology-enabled, multilevel, stepped care intervention
grounded in primary care, PREDICT (Personalized Risk-based Follow-up of Cervical Cancer Screening
in Practice) for the cervical cancer screening continuum. PREDICT is designed to be highly scalable,
using an open source CCSM tool, integrated using national data standards endorsed by the 21st Century
Cures Act Final Rule. Key PREDICT components include: system redesign to promote identification, tracking,
and EHR-integration of clinical guidelines to promote both visit-based and population management; use of
individual patient and practitioner reminders and tools to promote engagement; and enhance team
coordination through an efficient “stepped care” approach. The effectiveness and implementation of PREDICT
will be evaluated by conducting a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (standard care vs. visit-based
management vs. population outreach) of individuals in 4 primary care networks. The design will allow us to
examine the marginal and cumulative effectiveness of the intervention components on the primary
effectiveness outcome of receipt of appropriate CCSM within 120-days of becoming due for care. Guided by
Implementation Evaluation (RE-AIM QuEST) and Determination (CFIR) frameworks, we will assess the reach,
acceptability, adoption, implementation and maintenance/ sustainability of the intervention."

biophysically realistic model of traumatic brain injury will require having longitudinal, high-resolution
access to the gyrencephalic, large animal brain. Fluorescence microscopy enhances such capabilities,
enabling multimodal data collection through the use of genetically targeted and ion-selective
fluorophores. In the tool development Phase I of this project, we developed an instrument and
supporting technologies that afford us the unique ability to perform such measurements. These
technologies include a custom two-photon microscope with a gantry design that can accommodate
imaging in vivo, with subcellular resolution, brains of animals weighing >80kg. Microscopic in vivo
imaging in animals of this size (to our knowledge, the largest by a factor of 2-4x) required substantial
development and optimization of motion artifact mitigation tools, including heartbeat-triggered, high
speed image stack acquisition; flexible, penetrable, transparent sub-dural windows; and post-hoc image
registration algorithms. Finally, the microscope can perform digital fluorescence lifetime imaging,
enabling quantification of extracellular chloride using novel single-wavelength dyes. The Microscopy
Core will implement the imaging tools developed in Phase I, as well as optimize for calcium imaging and
long-term repeated access. As these tools require substantial cost and technical expertise, the
Microscopy Core represents a cost-effective consolidation and consistent implementation for the
proposed program."
10837543,"PROGRAM PROJECT 1 [PP1]: Genomic Epidemiological Mapping (GEM) of non-falciparum malaria
(NFM; Pv, Po, and P. malariae [Pm]) to quantify the parasite reservoir, measure transmissibility to
mosquitoes and evaluate the insecticide resistance status of mosquitoes with NFM parasite infections.
ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
To date, much of the global research and policy focus interest has been centered upon understanding
transmission dynamics of P. falciparum malaria (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv), together accounting for the majority of
documented human malaria infections and disease severity. However, the true contribution of non-falciparum
malaria (NFM) –P. ovale (Po wallikeri [Pow] and Po curtisi [Poc]) and P. malariae (Pm) – to the global disease
burden remains underappreciated. This is largely because accurate diagnosis for both Po and Pm rely on the
use of sensitive nested PCR, given the evidence of usually low parasitemias amongst infected individuals. As
such, these infections are missed by “gold standard” light microscopy routinely used in field settings to diagnose
malaria, rendering NFM a silent, and thus neglected disease by the global health community. Moreover, it
remains unclear as to which primary vectors are responsible for the transmission of mixed and/or mono-NFM
infections. Increasing pressure from insecticides is leading to changes in host seeking (biting) behavior of primary
mosquito vectors, and potentially so-called “secondary vectors”, that may also be increasing exposure to NFM.
Failure to detect and quantify this infectious “hidden” reservoir will likely result in a failure to eliminate residual
malaria transmission locally. The overarching hypothesis to be explored in PP1 is that Pf mixed infections with
NFM are more prevalent than expected, especially in subclinical but parasitemic populations, and are often
missed by non-molecular based diagnostics. Moreover, transmission of these infections to mosquitoes may be
affected by primary or secondary vector species and related IR status in Cameroon and Nigeria. The project will
seek to rapidly develop and deploy new genomic field-based tools for NFM – molecular inversion probes (MIPs)
for human biological samples and HMADS assays for determining mosquito species and insecticide resistance
status – by leveraging an existing bank of saliva, whole blood, DBS, and liquid blood spots, this Émergents
ICEMR program project seeks to: Aim PP1.1. Develop, refine, and implement targeted genomic tools and
determine the distribution of clinical and subclinical Pf, Pv, Po, and Pm infections in Cameroon and
Nigeria; Aim PP1.2. Determine transmissibility of NFM mixed infections to Anopheles funestus; and Aim
PP1.3. Measure and map the prevalence of insecticide resistance, and associated resistance
mechanisms of outdoor biting Anopheles vectors. Key outcomes of PP1 will be to provide insight into the
prevalence of NFM infections, Pf population genomics and drug resistance in mixed infections with NFM, and
the relationship of insecticide resistance to mosquito host seeking behavior. Translational outcomes include
development of targeted genomic tools for understanding parasite evolution, validation of a deployable all-in-one
MOSAIC genomic tool for mosquito species determination and insecticide resistance marker confirmation, and
distribution of a high-resolution, Anopheles vector insecticide-resistance maps to strengthen the quality of
malaria elimination efforts in Nigeria and Cameroon."

background of endemic primary and secondary anopheline vectors.
ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The introduction of Anopheles stephensi Liston (AS) to Djibouti and Ethiopia – evidence of further expansion of
AS inland into Sudan, across the strait to Yemen and more recently into Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana― has
justifiably raised “alarm bells”. Between 2013-2017, following the introduction of AS to Djibouti, national surveys
have indicated that the number of malaria cases have increased significantly across the country, supported by
recent entomological surveys that indicate AS infections with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv). AS
has demonstrated preference for similar breeding habitats as the urban dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Therefore,
the risk of a return of malaria into highly dense, urbanized cities and towns in Nigeria, Cameroon, and throughout
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is concerning. Evidence from Ethiopia suggested that AS in the Somali region are
also resistant to pyrethroid-based insecticides. The overarching hypothesis to be explored in PP2 is that multiple
introductions of AS was likely due to overland commercial traffic/transhumance and via seaports of entry (e.g.,
in the case of Accra, Ghana) and that these introductions and subsequent successful establishment are
influenced by habitat suitability (invasibility). The project will leverage innovative technology to extensively map
and characterize AS vector genomics and bionomics in Central and West Africa that will allows us to answer four
priority questions viz. AS invasion of SSA: (i) Where did invasive AS populations originate from and are there
continuous introductions?; (ii) How long have AS populations been established in different locations?; (iii) What
are the necessary/optimal conditions supporting AS establishment?; and (iv) What is the potential contribution of
AS to malaria transmission in study locales? Therefore, this Émergents ICEMR program project seeks to: Aim
PP2.1. Conduct a cross-national comprehensive mosquito genomic surveillance program to hunt for and
characterize invasive An. Stephensi; Aim PP2.2. Geospatial analyses of AS strain biology and micro-
ecologies to quantify habitat suitability or invasibility to enable predictions for AS spread; and Aim PP.2.3
Mosquito speciation, insecticide resistance, and infection status using a field-deployable Matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Key outcomes of PP2 are to (i)
develop a predictive model for An. stephensi invasion into non-endemic sites by understanding the microecology
including the role of sympatric non-anopheline mosquito vectors, (ii) determine the prevalence of Pf, NFM, and
Pf-NFM mixed sporozoite infections in anopheline vectors (AS included) in surveyed sites; (iii) validate an
artificial intelligence-driven smart trap; and (iv) establish an “all-in-one” LMIC-deployable MALDI analytical
platform for determining vector species, insecticide resistance and malaria parasite infection status."

The brain is nature’s most sophisticated signal-processing system. Unlike human-made integrated circuits, the
brain circuits organize in a complex three-dimensional and intertwined manner, which makes it challenging to
spatially resolve neuronal activities. Among all available neural recording technologies, penetrating neural
probes hold great promise and are vital to neuroscience research. In common practice, neural probes are linearly
inserted into the brain to map the local activity, which, however, can only probe a single spot in the targeted brain
region. An entire circuit or structure can be mapped by deploying multiple probes, but the spatial resolution is
modest. To date, how to spatially resolve single-unit activities from nonlinearly organized brain structures and
circuits is still a challenge. Here, we propose to fill the technological gap via a nonlinear probe implantation
modality. In contrast to the conventional linear implantation, we will conformally deploy high-density
microelectrode arrays along designated curved brain circuits or structures with minimal surgical lesions.
Ultraflexible neural probes with high electrode density will be designed accordingly to obtain the optimal
nonlinear implantation outcome. The proposed technology will be fulfilled via three Aims: In Aim 1, we will
develop the implantation apparatus and optimize the probe design using an in-vitro test platform; In Aim 2, we
will evaluate and optimize the nonlinear implantation in vivo and characterize the surgical lesion and
biocompatibility of the probes; in Aim 3, we will systematically examine the nonlinear probe in single-unit
neuronal recording and demonstrate its usefulness in studying the place codes of the mouse hippocampus. In
our preliminary study, we validated the feasibility of the proposed method by deploying nonlinear probes along
the longitudinal axis of the mouse hippocampus, a well-known nonlinear structure in the brain. Precise targeting,
low surgical lesion, and chronic single-unit tracking were shown. The technology, if successful, will significantly
increase the spatial resolution of brain mapping along nonlinear circuits or brain structures, make the hard-to-
access brain regions within reach, offer alternative routes toward designated brain regions, and offer a
generalizable approach for other brain interventions. In all, we believe the nonlinear delivery of neural probes
enabled by this project will be a valuable modality complementary to the conventional linear implantation for
both basic and translational neurosciences."
10837025,"Epithelial tumor progression involves abnormal cell interactions with the extracellular environment as
well abnormalities intrinsic to tumor cells themselves. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arises in
skin from ultraviolet mutagenesis and disproportionately affects U.S. Veterans due to sun exposure incurred
in military service. Nationally, SCC is the second most common cancer, with ~1 million new cases yearly.
SCC can lead to disfigurement and, in rare cases, lethal metastases. This Merit Review recently identified
collagens as the most highly mutated gene family in SCC, with the COL11A1 gene the second most
frequently mutated gene overall in SCC (63%). It also found additional collagen genes mutated at high
frequency (>20%) in SCC, including COL17A1 and COL4A4, as well as COL7A1, whose inherited mutation
causes forms of epidermolysis bullosa with aggressive skin SCCs. SCC collagen mutations concentrate at
prolines and glycines in the Gly-X-Y (with X and Y commonly proline) triple helical sequence, alterations
known to produce dominant-negative collagens, raising the possibility that tumor-secreted mutant collagens
may enable cancer in a trans-dominant fashion. Consistent with a pro-oncogenic function for mutant
collagens, knocking in an SCC-associated COL11A1 mutation enhanced neoplastic invasion in vivo
compared to isogenic COL11A1 wild-type control and ablating endogenously mutant COL11A1 in SCC
tumors impaired tumorigenesis in vivo, indicating that mutant collagens functionally promote tumorigenesis.
 Aim I will test a model in which secreted mutant collagen proteins act in a non-cell autonomous fashion
to accelerate tumorigenesis. First, it will determine if mutant COL11A1 can promote neoplastic progression
of tumor cells in trans using mosaic tissue models. Second, it will quantify the impacts on epidermal tumor
progression of mutations in multiple additional collagens that are frequently mutated in SCC, including
COL17A1, COL4A4, and COL7A1. Aim I will study the action of COL11A1 in epidermal tumor progression
and determine if other recurrently mutated collagens can also promote SCC.
 This project also recently used single-cell RNA-sequencing of 47,771 cells from a series of human SCC
tumors, along with patient and site-matched normal control skin, to identify tumor cell subpopulations in
SCC. This defined a new tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population with no counterpart in normal tissue
that expressed COL11A1 and other genes linked to cellular communication and invasion. Such tumor
subpopulations enable neoplasia by communicating with each other through cell surface and secreted
proteins, however, the sets of proteins – as opposed to RNAs – that are actually expressed in living tumors
by specific tumor subpopulations have been a technical challenge to define. To address this, we developed
a new proximity proteomics method, Secreted Protein Identification (SecrID) that can identify cell surface
and secreted proteins within discrete cell populations of interest in heterogenous living tumor tissues in vivo
to characterize cell subpopulation proteins in tumor progression.
 Aim II is based on a model in which the TSK SCC subpopulation uses specific cellular communication
proteins to drive malignancy. First, it will use SecrID to define the secreted and cell surface proteins specific
to the TSK cell subpopulation, based on the premise that these may mediate pro-neoplastic cellular
communication. Second, it will ablate TSK subpopulation-specific genes, including those identified by
SecrID, to define their impact on tumorigenesis and to search for new accessible therapeutic targets. Aim II
will characterize the tumor-specific SCC TSK subpopulation and identify the molecules it uses to influence
tumor progression.
 At the end of the proposed funding cycle, we plan to have characterized the actions of mutant collagens
and newly defined tumor cell subpopulations in epidermal tumor progression."

Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an annual incidence of 3-4
per million in North America (300-500 cases < age 25 in the US yearly). The large majority of cases are
caused by autoimmune destruction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); accordingly the disease can be
treated and often cured by either immune suppression therapy (IST) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
The ATG/ cyclosporine (CsA) combination developed in the 1990s is the preferred IST approach for newly
diagnosed SAA patients and has response rates of 60-80%, with 5-year survival exceeding 90%. BMT from an
HLA matched sibling donor (MSD) is the standard for initial therapy for younger, newly diagnosed patients
with long-term survival rates of over 95% however, only 20% of patients have a suitable sibling donor,
consequently, the large majority of patients receive IST for initial therapy. Outcomes of matched unrelated
donor (MUD) BMT for SAA have improved significantly over the past decade, with studies reporting similar
outcomes for BMT using MUD compared to MSD. Although these data are provocative, MUD BMT carries
significant risks, and a state of equipoise exists between the two approaches. To address this challenge, the
North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium (NAPAAC), in collaboration with the Pediatric
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consortium (PTCTC) conducted an NHLBI funded pilot trial, which has
shown the feasibility and safety of randomizing patients between IST and MUD BMT. In this cluster
application, the Resource for Clinical Investigation in BMT (RCI BMT), the prospective clinical trial arm of the
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), will serve as the Data
Coordinating Center (DCC) to manage the definitive Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in
collaboration with the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) partnership of NAPAAC and PTCTC. Our specific
aims are to: 1) compare the proportion of SAA patients with immune suppression free survival with adequate
counts at two years for patients randomized to IST versus BMT, including to understand the impact of either
therapy on fertility, quality of life and biological factors, 2) support and manage the efficient implementation,
governance and completion of this RCT, and 3) leverage existing systems and expertise to ensure
adherence to high quality data collection. The proposed DCC provides an efficient and experienced
infrastructure that leverages existing relationships and a framework which has successfully delivered clinical
trials over 15 years, including a seasoned statistical team. These assets will ensure that this trial is designed,
analyzed and conducted with the utmost integrity and efficiency and that it will meet its goal of advancing
knowledge regarding the best therapy for children and young adults with SAA."
10837029,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Romantic bonds are a fundamental part of the human experience, positively contributing to our health
and well-being by decreasing risk for physical and mental illness. A key feature of pair bonds - and social
relationships more generally - is that they are highly reciprocal, evolving as a function of ongoing feedback
from the other individual. Yet the interdependent nature of neural activity within pair bonding remains
understudied, due in part to the dearth of laboratory-amenable mammals that form selective attachments with
their mating partners. One promising metric for explaining aspects of interaction and its progression in dynamic
social contexts is interbrain synchronization, or correlation, in which the neural dynamics of two individuals
become more similar to each other as they interact. Interbrain correlation scales with relational variables; it is
stronger in romantic partners than strangers during social interaction. I have found that interbrain correlation is
also evident in prairie voles and that pair bonded voles show stronger correlations when interacting with their
partner than with a stranger. In this proposal, I will leverage modern optical tools to detect and functionally
manipulate interbrain correlation in prairie voles. In my first aim, I will perform within-animal comparisons to
determine how interbrain correlation varies across discrete behaviors and as a function of pair bonding. I will
use fiber-photometry to conduct simultaneous real-time calcium recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex of
interacting animals, and use supervised and unsupervised machine learning to conduct thorough behavioral
annotations of the interaction. Using a variety of analytical approaches, including generalized linear models, I
will delineate the relationship between pair bonding, affiliative behavior and interbrain correlation. In my second
aim, I will use synchronized real-time optogenetic stimulation in the mPFC to test whether induced interbrain
correlation can facilitate pair bond formation. Together these results will characterize the occurrence of
interbrain correlation during distinct behaviors and as a function of bond state and test the function of interbrain
correlation in pair bond formation. Such work is instrumental for determining whether therapeutic approaches
targeting interbrain correlation will be beneficial for treating disorders that impair social attachment like autism
spectrum disorders."
10836024,"A renaissance in the field of modular polyketide synthases has begun. New tools and paradigms are enabling
deeper insights into the architectures and activities of these enzymatic assembly lines and are facilitating our
long-term goal of applying the synthetic power of modular polyketide synthases to the development and
production of new medicines. Using the updated definition of the “module”, our lab has engineered diverse tri-
/tetra-/pentaketide synthases that are functional both in vivo and in vitro. While these short assembly lines are
uncommon in nature, they are ideal for our structural and functional studies. In Specific Aim 1 we propose to
plunge-freeze these assembly lines as they are synthesizing their polyketide products and investigate them by
cryo-electron microscopy. Since this approach has enabled us to capture high-resolution, dynamic information
of the priming ketosynthase and acyltransferase of a model triketide synthase, we will apply it to synthases that
contain other regions of interest. One objective is to learn how the ketoreductase, dehydratase, and
enoylreductase processing enzymes are oriented relative to one another and the neighboring
ketosynthase+acyltransferase didomains to understand how acyl carrier protein domains move between these
enzymes during the extension and processing of polyketide intermediates. Thus, we will investigate at least
thirteen engineered tri-/tetraketide synthases and two natural synthases functionally validated in our lab that
contain different sets of these processing enzymes. In Specific Aim 2 we propose to elucidate interactions
between processed polyketide intermediates and the ketosynthases that gatekeep for them. We have strong
hypotheses for how sets of substrate tunnel residues interact with intermediates closest to the reactive thioester
to ensure they are properly modified by upstream processing enzymes. Thus, we will appropriately mutate the
gatekeeping residues of ketosynthases in less active model synthases as well as model synthases with
inactivated upstream processing enzymes and determine whether their productivities improve as predicted.
Since our data indicate that polyketide intermediates rigidify the ketosynthase dimer and dimeric
ketosynthase+acyltransferase didomains can be readily identified in cryo-electron microscopy studies, we will
also perform electron microscopy on stalled synthases to solve structures of polyketide-bound
ketosynthase+acyltransferase dimers. In Specific Aim 3 we propose to determine key domain-domain interfaces.
We have evidence that interfaces between processing enzymes and downstream KSs drive the ordered self-
assembly of synthase polypeptides more than the small interface observed between the C- and N-terminal
docking domains and seek structures of representative complexes. We also aim to determine how acyl carrier
protein domains dock with ketosynthases during the transacylation reaction. If we are successful in these
projects, it will greatly inform the rational engineering of modular polyketide synthases that synthesize new
molecules and, ultimately, new medicines."

 Pneumococcal disease has a disproportional impact upon the young and elderly. Notably, advanced age
and influenza A virus infection act synergistically to enhance susceptibility to pneumococcal lung infections.
Indeed, older adults (>65 years old) account for 70-85% of deaths due to the combination of influenza and
pneumonia. As this vulnerable population is projected to reach two billion worldwide by 2050, novel
preventative approaches that boost resistance to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal
disease more generally, are needed. Background: The Pfeifer group has engineered a novel vaccine
formulation, termed Liposomal Encapsulation of Polysaccharides (LEPS), designed to account for both the
breadth of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial serotypes and the unique progression profiles that complicate
treatment options for pneumococcal disease. Significance/Innovation: The LEPS formulation combines both
polysaccharide and protein antigens, which is an innovative approach that provides both capsule specific
immunity and cross protection against other serotypes and stages of disease progression. Because this
vaccine candidate has matched and exceeded the capabilities of Prevnar-13 in normal-aged mice, the
enclosed application features a complementary collaboration with Dr. Elsa Bou Ghanem to test the
Hypothesis that vaccination of elderly mice with the LEPS particle will induce a robust immune response
relative to current pneumococcal vaccine formulations. This hypothesis will be thoroughly addressed through
three specific Aims: 1) Expand Serotype Coverage with the LEPS Platform in Pneumonia Models using Aged
Mice with Detailed Immunological Assessment to Reveal Mechanism; 2) Assess Secondary Bacterial
Pneumonia within Aged Mice using the LEPS Platform; and 3) Test Intranasal Delivery of LEPS Formulations
for Pneumococcal Disease in Mice across Age. Host survival, clinical disease score, organ-specific bacterial
burden, and other indicators of infection severity (organ pathology) will be measured over time across vaccine
and non-vaccine pneumococcal strains to assess serotype-specific protection as well as cross protection.
Successful outcomes will include treatment effectiveness beyond current vaccine options (i.e., PPSV and
PCV), in which case, we will have important preclinical data needed to support translational progression."
10836029,"Abstract
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function
mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Renal disease, which includes cysts, angiomyolipomas, and renal cell carcinoma,
is a major source of morbidity and mortality for both children and adults with TSC. mTORC1 inhibitors have
partial, cytostatic effects on TSC-associated tumors, so continuous and potentially lifelong therapy is required,
often beginning in early childhood. The death of two children from serious infection in a recent trial of mTORC1
inhibition for TSC highlights the unmet need for novel therapies that eliminate TSC-associated tumor cells.
The TSC1/TSC2 protein complex inhibits mTORC1. Multiple components of the TSC signaling network can
localize to the lysosomal membrane, including mTOR, Rheb, TSC1, and TSC2. Lysosomes are highly dynamic
organelles with both degradative and signaling functions. We have found that nuclear levels of the transcription
factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, are elevated in TSC1-deficient and TSC2-deficient
cells, in a mouse model of TSC renal disease, and in human TSC tumors. This is unexpected, because mTORC1
phosphorylates TFEB and TFE3, leading to their cytoplasmic sequestration. We have also found that TFEB is
required for the proliferation of TSC2-deficient cells, in vitro and in vivo. These and other preliminary data lead
to our central hypothesis that hyperactivation of TFEB and TFE3 leads to a lysosome-dependent increase in cell
proliferation in TSC. This hypothesis will be tested in three Aims:
Aim 1. To identify the mechanisms of nuclear localization of TFEB and TFE3 in TSC2-deficient cells.
Aim 2. To identify compounds that induce TFEB and TFE3 to move to the cytoplasm in TSC2-deficient cells.
Aim 3. To determine the in vivo impact of TFEB and TFE3 on cell proliferation and renal cystogenesis in TSC.
We expect this project to have scientific and preclinical impact by elucidating the roles of TFEB and lysosomal
biogenesis in TSC-associated renal disease, with the potential for clinical translation to prevent and/or eliminate
TSC-associated renal tumors."
10835850,"Background: Population-based screening programs for suicidal ideation (SI) are becoming standard practice.
This year, VHA is implementing a new multi-stage SI screening and evaluation process, VA Risk-ID. However,
prior research has shown that Veterans often feel uncomfortable disclosing SI during screening, and that
Veterans frequently do not disclose SI at healthcare visits proximal to suicide. Further, there is almost nothing
known about how SI screening experiences may impact subsequent treatment engagement. Factors known to
be associated with treatment engagement include effective patient-clinician communication, therapeutic
alliance, and collaborative treatment planning. Negative perceptions of SI screening have the potential to
adversely affect Veteran comfort disclosing and discussing SI, as well as subsequent engagement in care.
Significance/Impact: Suicide prevention is VHA’s highest priority, and optimizing engagement of at-risk
Veterans in treatment is of critical importance. This project addresses key gaps: 1) It will generate knowledge
about both positive and potentially negative impacts of a population-based SI screening process; 2) It will
generate comprehensive information about SI screening from the perspective of patients; and 3) It will examine
the relationship between screening experiences and subsequent engagement in care.
Innovation: This project will use a mixed methods approach to characterize the “natural history” of the
treatment of Veterans screened for SI in primary care and mental health settings primarily from the perspective
of Veterans, from the point of initial depression or PTSD screening until 6 months after screening.
Specific Aims: (1) In a national, stratified random sample of Veterans screened in primary care and mental
health, using quantitative surveys, characterize Veteran experiences with VA Risk-ID screening and clinical
evaluation that takes place in response to screening; (2) Conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews with
Veterans and staff who participate in SI screening, with the goal of identifying ways to improve screening and
engagement after screening; (3) Among the group of Veterans screened in primary care, examine the extent to
which screening process variables are associated with mental health treatment utilization over 6 months.
Methodology: This 3-year mixed-methods project will utilize quantitative and qualitative data from a national,
stratified random sample of Veterans. In Aim 1, we will mail recruitment letters immediately after VA Risk-ID
screening to 2,000 Veterans screened in primary care and 2,000 Veterans screened in specialty mental health
who have not received mental health treatment in the prior 12 months. Respondents will be invited to complete
surveys including measures assessing satisfaction with screening, patient-care team interactions and
perceived barriers to care and disclosure. In Aim 2, informed by Aim 1 survey results, up to approximately 40
Veterans identified from the survey cohorts will participate in semi-structured interviews. We will also interview
up to 40 clinical staff members from primary care and mental health settings of three or more VHA facilities.
Qualitative analyses will prioritize identification of ways for clinical teams to detect and respond to SI more
satisfactorily and effectively. In Aim 3, within the group of Veterans screened in primary care, we will examine
the extent to which screening results and survey variables are associated with subsequent engagement in
mental health treatment over 6 months. Outcomes will include specialty mental health visits attended (when
referred) and antidepressant fills (when recommended by providers). VHA’s Corporate Data Warehouse will
provide care utilization data. Multivariable models will adjust for patient and care team and site characteristics.
Next Steps/Implementation: This project will inform further development and implementation of VHA’s SI
screening processes, and lay groundwork for 1) development and testing of new interventions for primary care
and mental health care teams to improve SI screening and care engagement; and 2) additional research
examining the impacts of early care experiences of Veterans at risk for suicide on health outcomes."

10835865,"Project Summary
An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with HCV and are at heightened risk for severe liver
disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although effective directly-acting antiviral
treatment is available, only an HCV vaccine will help prevent infection, associated pathologies, and effectively
reduce global disease burden. Cumulative evidence has shown that both B and T cell immunity contribute to the
control of acute HCV infection. A major challenge is the high variability across the genome especially in the
envelope E1E2 glycoproteins, the natural target of protective antibodies. An E1E2-based immunogen will need
to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to multiple epitopes to overcome the high antigenic diversity of
HCV isolates and be of sufficient titers to achieve protective immunity. Our approach is supported by our recent
data that a secreted form of E1E2 (sE1E2) maintains its native-like properties and can elicit broader neutralizing
antibody responses than the membrane-bound form of E1E2 and secreted E2. Also, we have shown that
presentation of sE1E2 as multivalent virus-mimicking polymer assemblies (VMPAs) that include HCV core
protein can elicit cellular immune responses to sE1E2 and core antigens with potential immunopotentiating
activity for B and T cell responses. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that rational structure-guided design of
E1E2 and co-formulation with conserved HCV T cell antigens as a VMPA vaccine will lead to optimal presentation
of conserved bnAb epitopes and elicit long-lasting B and T cell mediated immunity. Towards this end, we propose
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1, Rational E1E2 antigen design. We will advance our structure-guided E1E2
design to increase the immunogenicity of bnAb epitopes, and stabilize the native-like sE1E2 complex using
synthetic scaffolds. Aim 2, Structural characterization of HCV envelope complexes. We will structurally
characterize the E1E2 heterodimer complexed with key bnAbs, and new structures will be used for further E1E2
optimization. Aim 3, Formulation and characterization of virus-mimicking polymer assemblies. We plan to further
develop supramolecular assemblies of E1E2 for multimeric presentation of E1E2 and T cell antigens. Aim 4,
Immunological evaluation of B and T cell responses in animal models. Immunological assessment of our vaccine
candidates will be performed in mice, guinea pigs, and macaques. These studies will include an examination of
the specificity of neutralizing antibody responses as well as systemic and tissue resident memory T cells. Aim 5,
Vaccine efficacy in challenge model systems. Protection studies will utilize the only two available challenge
models. The first, an immunocompetent humanized mouse model to test the protective efficacy of our lead
vaccine candidates. The second, a human-mouse liver chimeric model that can be infected with antigenically
diverse clinical HCV isolates to demonstrate serum antibodies from vaccinated macaques passively transferred
to the chimeric mice will be protective. The overall program will lead to a rationally designed vaccine candidate
to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies and long-term memory T cell responses to prevent HCV infection."
10835866,"Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation encompasses aphenotype that includes enhanced migration,
proliferation, and matrix deposition. Migration is critical for coordinately situating HSC for matrix deposition
and development of cirrhosis. Our Long-Term Objectives are to understand the molecular underpinnings of
HSC biology that lead to cirrhosis with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets. Recently,we identified a
critical role of synectin in the process of HSC migration and fibrosis. Synectin is a cytosolic protein that
mediates signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, and ultimately gene expression. Synectin is chosen for this
proposal as a significant protein warranting detailed investigation because, as we demonstrate, it is
upregulated in human cirrhosis and is required for murine fibrogenesis. Mechanistically, we implicate synectin
inHSC migration through both short term receptor signaling as well as longer term epigenetic regulation of
gene expression networks. Our preliminary data show that depletion of HSC synectin reduces migration
signaling downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha
(PDGFRα); attenuates transcription of a set of HSC activation genes including one that encodes the
multifunctional signaling protein, IGFBP3 (insulin growth factor binding protein-3); and abrogates murine
fibrosis in vivo. These important observations have led us to propose the central hypothesis that synectin
increases HSC migration and fibrosis by promoting PDGFRα signaling and by regulating a network of genes
that include IGFBP3. This hypothesis leads to the following Specific Aims: 1) Synectin promotes HSC
migration by regulating PDGFRα targeting and signal activation. Aim 1a will determine how synectin recruits
and binds specific vesicle trafficking proteins that maintain PDGFRα protein levels, target the protein to
endosomes and activate migration signaling. Aim 1b will uncover how disruption of synectin function leads to
autophagic degradation of PDGFRα and attenuated HSC migration. 2) Synectin epigenetically controls
IGFBP3 gene expression to promote HSC migration. Aim 2a will identify how synectin regulates a specific
histone methyl transferase, EZH2 and how this governs IGFBP3 gene expressionthrough histone
methylation. Aim 2b will determine how IGFBP3 production stimulates HSC migration. 3) Synectin regulates
fibrosis in vivo. Aim 3a will use a novel fibrosis regression model in mice with HSC selective modifications to
synectin and PDGFRα to further ascertain the proposed role of these proteins in vivo. Aim 3b will use a
synectin neutralizing peptide that selectively targets HSC in coordination with magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) imaging, and mice with genetic deletion of IGFBP3 to elucidate how synectin promotes
fibrosis in vivo. In total, this proposal will utilize conceptually and technically innovative approaches and
concepts to test a novel hypothesis pertaining to synectin as a “master regulator” of HSC signals that lead to
migration and fibrosis.

10835940,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer
mortality in Western women. As is the case for most other solid tumors, metastasis and drug resistance are the
main causes of death. In ~80% of BC cases, the PI3K-AKT pathway is aberrantly activated, due to the
alterations in genes encoding the pathway components, such as Ras, Her2, PTEN, PIK3C and AKT. This
pathway regulates multiple cellular processes to promote BC development, growth, metastasis, and drug
resistance. Consequently, over 100 clinical trials are currently underway worldwide to evaluate the therapeutic
efficacy of PI3K and AKT inhibitors in BC; however, initial data revealed that inhibition of this pathway is either
not effective or often results in development of resistance and relapse of the disease. Thus, identification of
additional targets and therapeutic combinations are urgently needed. We previously mapped TRAF2
phosphorylation sites and reported that TRAF2 Ser-11 phosphorylation enhances NF-κB activation to promote
cancer cell survival under conditions of cellular stresses. Recently, we discovered that inhibition of AKT in BC
cells leads to increased phosphorylation of TRAF2 by TBK1, and that inhibition of both AKT and TBK1
synergistically induces apoptosis in BC cell lines in vitro and significantly suppresses xenograft BC tumor growth
in vivo. TBK1 and its close homologue IKKε are serine/threonine kinases overexpressed in 65-70% of BC and
play critical roles in BC cell survival mainly by direct phosphorylation of TRAF2 at Ser-11. In cancer cells,
TRAF2 constitutively recruits potent E3 ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 (cIAPs) to RIP1 to catalyze its noncanonical
ubiquitination, which is not only essential for NF-κB activation but also for the suppression of RIP1-dependent
apoptosis and necroptosis. Through a series of functional assays, we identified a peptide (Tp-14) that blocks
TRAF2 interaction with RIP1 and synergizes with AKT inhibition to induce apoptosis in BC cells that
overexpress RIP1. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that TRAF2 and RIP1 are overexpressed in invasive BC,
and significantly correlate with poor prognosis. Thus, we hypothesize that combined inhibition of AKT and
TRAF2 phosphorylation or interaction with RIP1 synergistically induce apoptosis in BC cells that overexpress
TRAF2 and RIP1. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims. Aim-1. Determine the
mechanisms of signaling crosstalks between the PI3K-AKT and TBK1-TRAF2 pathways and identify biomarkers
that predict BC cell response to combined AKT and TBK1 inhibition. Aim-2. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
combined AKT and TBK1 inhibition in BC xenograft models. Aim-3. Determine how blockade of TRAF2
interaction with RIP1 affects BC cell survival in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Our proposals will shed
new lights on the mechanisms underlying BC cell resistance to AKT inhibition and identify biomarkers for
combined inhibition of AKT and TRAF2 phosphorylation or interaction with RIP1 for BC therapy."

10852358,"Project Summary/Abstract: Macrophages are one of the major cellular elements in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) markedly outnumber dendritic cells (DCs)
and represent a prominent population of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the TME. Assessment of their
number and distribution in human solid tumors provides elusive and paradoxical information regarding their
roles in human tumor immunity. Based on studies in murine systems, macrophages are historically classified
into M1 and M2 subsets. However, the phenotype, characteristics, and functions of macrophages are
determined by the environmental milieu, in which macrophages reside. Like the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, we aim
at identification of previously unknown immune resistance target(s), which may be potentially targetable with
specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). Hence, we have attempted to explore the relationship between
transmembrane proteins in APCs (and tumor cells as well) and ICB efficacy in patients with cancer and in
tumor bearing animal models. We discovered that (a) membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member
7 (MS4A7) was predominantly expressed in TAMs; (b) MS4A7 contributed to poor anti-tumor immunity and
correlated with immune resistance to ICB in both in humans and mice; and (c) MS4A7 interacted with and
prevented TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) cleavage, resulting in a reduced
expression of key functional genes (such as MHC and CD86) in macrophages, an impaired macrophage-
mediated phagocytosis, and a reduced T cell activation. Based on these surprising and novel findings, our
central hypothesis is that MS4A7 endows TAM phenotype and shapes ICB efficacy; and blocking MS4A7 and
its pathway could reprogram TAMs. Therefore, MS4A7 is a myeloid cell associated, previously unknown
immune resistance membrane protein, and a potential novel ICB target. In this application, we propose two
specific aims with 7 subaims to test this central hypothesis mechanistically, functionally, and translationally by
engaging bioinformatics, genomic, proteomic, immunological tools, and novel MS4A7-neutralizing antibodies.
Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that MS4A7 contributes to TAM-mediated immune suppression.
Aim 2 is to test our hypothesis that the MS4A7-TREM2 axis controls TAMs and tumor immunity.
The proposal will define the role of MS4A7 in tumor immunity and the underlying molecular mechanisms in
both human and mouse cancers, set the stage to explore other likely cancer immune-relevant membrane-
spanning family members, and provide a proof of principle that targeting specific membrane-spanning protein
may augment tumor immunity and sensitize ICB efficacy."
10852499,"Structural investigation of biological complexes at near atomic resolution is essential to illuminating the molecular
mechanism of biological systems under physiological and pathological conditions; these efforts ultimately lead
to developing therapeutics and improving human health. Understanding lipid-protein interactions, protein-ligand
interactions, multi-subunit protein assembly, and physiologically relevant conformational ensembles require
experimental measurement and structural determination, because these are questions too complex to solve in
silico even with today’s most advanced structural prediction and simulation software. Single particle analysis
(SPA) cryo-EM is used extensively for structural determination at Vanderbilt investigators to illuminate novel
mechanism underlying DNA replication (Chazin and Eichman), nuclear export of mRNAs (Ren), calcium
signaling (Karakas), host-pathogen interaction (Cover, Crowe, Lacy, and Wan), therapeutic antibody
development (Crowe), membrane trafficking (Jackson), neuronal signaling (Nakagawa and Zhou), biomimetic
polymers (Duvall), energy homeostasis (Lepesheva), and membrane protein biology of GPCR, ion channels,
and transporters (Hamm, Karakas, and Nakagawa). Furthermore, technological advance in cryo-electron
tomography enabled visualization of macromolecules in subcellular compartments in situ, providing access to
intact ultrastructure of synapses (Zhou) and viral assembly mechanism in host cells (Wan). Essential to these
discoveries are the extensive trial-and-error efforts to optimize and identify specimens most suitable for high
resolution analysis using the state-of-the-art Titan Krios. This process is often referred to as specimen screening,
which requires visualization of negative stain specimen by a 100-200kV transmission electron microscope (TEM)
equipped with a detector suitable for image acquisition and subsequent data processing to address specimen
quality. We have been extensively using two old TEMs equipped with outdated technologies, 100kV Morgagni
and 200kV Tecnai-F20 (TF20), for screening. However, all components of Morgagni and the detector of TF20
are out of replacement parts. Adding a modern detector to TF20 will not add usage hours, yet be prohibitively
costly. Considering the low cost-benefit of upgrading TF20 and our inability to repair the Morgagni, we propose
to retire the two old TEMs and acquire the modern 120kV TEM, Talos L120C, as a replacement. Talos L120C
will provide additional ability to image vitrified samples at cryogenic temperatures in the instance where our cryo-
TEM Glacios, used for screening vitrified specimen, is temporarily down for repair. Collectively, the Talos L120C,
which will be housed in the cryo-EM core facility and used by the investigators from four Schools and Colleges
at Vanderbilt, will fulfill the needs currently met by the retiring TEMs and further establish a robust cryo-EM
workflow pipeline to advance the NIH funded projects aimed to improve human health."
10830327,"Project Summary – Overall Component
This project supports continued funding for the National Xenopus Resource (NXR) located at the Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The NXR is one of the top priorities for the Xenopus community. The
NXR was established in 2010 to serve as a national resource for researchers working with the Xenopus
amphibian model system, which includes two species Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. The NXR serves
as a national repository for community-generated animal stocks as well as serving as an advanced training
venue that greatly facilitates productivity for a multitude of researchers. It is a community-oriented resource
center that serves all Xenopus researchers, including individuals from large research-focused universities to
small liberal arts colleges. As biological research becomes ever more complex, often requiring specialized animal
lines and involving diverse technologies, individual laboratory units become insufficient to meet all of the
demands required for addressing significant biological problems and a centralized repository or stock center
becomes essential. There are four aims to this grant. First, the NXR will maintain current stocks of frogs as well
as obtain new lines making them available to the community; this includes special inbred, wild type and mutant
lines of both species. In the second aim we outline the NXR research services that meet community demand,
including creation of transgenic and mutant animals. In the third aim we outline the resources that we have
developed to enable novel Xenopus research, including advanced training workshops (bioinformatics, advanced
imaging, genome editing) taught by experts in each field that serve to teach and propagate specialized
techniques. The last aim is the applied research aim. In Aim 4 we outline our goals to define the integration sites
for our transgenic animals."
10857141,"Project Summary: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an effective form of
immunotherapy that is potentially curative for malignant (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma) and non-malignant
conditions (e.g. anemia, immunodeficiencies). However, graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD) remains a major
deleterious side-effect for many patients. While studying GvHD in murine allo-HCT models, we surprisingly
discovered an important role for Galectin-3 (Gal-3) in mitigating GvHD. Gal-3 is expressed by hematopoietic
and non-hematopoietic cells and is known to influence innate and adaptive immunity. Interestingly, its
contribution to GvHD is unknown. In murine allo-HCT experiments, recipient mice were reconstituted with T
cell depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) and T cells from wild type (WT) or Gal-3 deficient mice. I discovered that
Gal-3 deficiency in donor T-cells significantly exacerbated the severity and mortality of GvHD and that Gal-3 is
important for protecting recipient tissues from GvHD. Based on my preliminary data, the goal of this study is to
explore a new paradigm regarding the role of Gal-3 in GvHD after allo-HCT. I hypothesize that Gal-3 is the key
regulator of GvHD that modulates both donor and recipient hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell functions
and decreases GvHD severity and mortality. Therefore, I will study murine models and human HCT patients to
pursue three aims. Aim 1 will explore the cellular mechanism(s) by which Gal-3 signaling impacts GvHD. I will
use Gal-3 deficient mice as donors to determine how Gal-3 signaling affects the functions of major T cell
subsets known to dictate the onset and severity of GVHD, including CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T
cells. Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of manipulating Gal-3 signaling to modulate GvHD and the
graft versus tumor (GvT) effect. To increase the translatability of this work, I established a xenotransplantation
system using humanized NSG-HLA-A2 mice as HCT recipients to examine GvHD severity induced by human
immune cells. Aim 3 will analyze the clinical association of Gal-3 with GvHD severity after allo-HCT. I will
measure Gal-3 plasma levels in 200 de-identified allogeneic HCT patients and analyze the relationship
between Gal-3 levels and clinical outcomes including GvHD incidence and severity, engraftment, and infection.
In summary, this project will not only improve our understanding of the biology of allo-HCT, but my results may
identify a new biomarker which will help identify patients at risk for developing severe GvHD after HCT.
Moreover, this research may lead to a novel therapeutic rationale for modulating Gal-3 signaling to control
GvHD. This project will be carried out under the supervision of the candidate's primary mentor Dr. Elizabeth
Repasky, co-mentor Dr. Philip McCarthy, and advisory committee including Drs. Bruce Blazer, Pawel Kalinski,
Theresa Hahn and Jonathan Bramson. By completing the training outlined in this application (K99), I will obtain
the knowledge and skills required to take the initial steps toward scientific autonomy in the subsequent phase
(R00), and successfully complete the transition from a postdoctoral trainee to an independent researcher."
10857233,"Clearance of cytoplasmic RNA, protein and mRNA-protein (mRNP) granules maintains homeostasis and
prevents the accumulation of toxic species. Stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies (PBs) are mRNP granules
enriched in mRNAs, RNA binding proteins and signaling proteins, that often aid cell survival during stress. This
may reflect regulation of the transcriptome and signaling pathways. Aberrant SG clearance is implicated in many
cancers, viral infections, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where SGs may promote cytoplasmic mis-
localization and aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43); this is toxic to neurons. SGs are likely
cleared by various disassembly and degradative means, with roles for chaperones, the proteasome, and a
selective autophagic pathway termed granulophagy. In contrast, PB clearance has barely been studied.
Recently, cytoplasmic TDP-43 was shown to be degraded via a novel endolysosomal trafficking pathway (distinct
from autophagy), which, when induced, suppresses TDP-43 toxicity. Understanding of the mechanisms and
consequences for SG, PB and TDP-43 clearance remains at an early stage. It is also known that large amounts
of RNA decay occur in vacuoles and lysosomes, though the RNA molecules targeted, trafficking mechanisms
used and impacts of such decay on gene expression are unknown. Key gaps in understanding include
determining how different clearance pathways function, co-operate and affect the degradation or disassembly of
mRNP granules, cytoplasmic RNA and TDP-43. The impact of such clearance pathways on cell function and
disease also requires elucidation. The aims of this grant are: 1.) define the usage, importance and co-operativity
of reported SG and PB clearance mechanisms under disease-relevant stress, and identify the mechanism of
granulophagy; 2.) determine the extent, specificity and trafficking mechanism(s) underlying vacuolar/lysosomal
RNA decay; 3.) mechanistically assess TDP-43 endolysosomal degradation and evaluate consequences to
neuronal and TDP-43-related RNA phenotypes. Using genetic, biochemical and cell biology assays, a
granulophagy model based on a prior unbiased yeast screen will be tested. These efforts will be aided by a novel
SG purification method, which will identify SG-localized granulophagy effectors. RNA-sequencing and vacuole
isolation will be combined to quantify the vacuolar RNA degradome, while genetics and single-molecule imaging
will identify RNA vacuolar decay trafficking mechanism(s). Finally, supported by an unbiased yeast screen
identifying regulators of TDP-43 abundance, a model of TDP-43 degradation involving endosomal membrane
invagination will be tested. Yeast, human, and neuronal cell models will be used. This proposal is innovative in
that it will generate basic understanding of how novel vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking mechanisms affect RNA and
protein homeostasis. The value of this work is that the knowledge obtained will offer paradigms for clearance of
similar cellular substrates and globally reveal targets of an unappreciated RNA decay pathway. Finally,
understanding clearance of SGs and cytoplasmic TDP-43 may identify therapeutic targets in ALS and cancer."
10857236,"Project Summary
Despite the ability of combination antiretroviral therapy to dramatically suppress viremia, the brain continues to
be a reservoir of HIV low-level replication. Adding further complexity to this is the co-morbidity of drug abuse with
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and neuroHIV. Among several abused drugs, the use of opiates is
highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, both as an abused drug as well as for pain management. It has been
shown that both HIV/HIV proteins and abused drugs such as morphine contribute to neuroinflammation, which,
in turn, involves activation of the inflammasomes. Mounting evidence has also shown that noncoding RNAs
function as epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulators controlling vital cellular functions, including activation,
thus altering the dynamics of various biological processes. While both HIV proteins and opioids have been shown
to change the gene expression profiles of CNS cells, there is a gap of knowledge on the detailed molecular
mechanism(s) underlying the co-operative effects of HIV Transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein and
morphine on astrocyte activation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HIV Tat and morphine, via
distinct regulatory mechanism(s) augment astrocyte activation leading, in turn, to exacerbated
neuroinflammation. Our preliminary data on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in the frontal cortices of SIV-
infected rhesus macaques show increased DNA hypomethylation of the NLRP6 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin
domain-containing protein 6) promoter with a concomitant upregulation in NLRP6 expression. Additionally,
exposure of human and mouse primary astrocytes to HIV Tat and morphine also resulted in decreased
expression of microRNA-152 that was accompanied by increased expression of NLRP6. Interestingly, we also
found that exposure of these primary astrocytes to either HIV Tat or morphine resulted in increased cellular
activation with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1β and IL18) via pyroptosis. Based on the
central hypothesis and the reliable preliminary data, this proposal led to the following specific aims: Specific Aim
1: Determine the molecular mechanism(s) involved in microRNA-152 mediated NLRP6 inflammasome activation
in HIV Tat and morphine-exposed astrocytes in vitro; Specific Aim 2: Determine the epigenetic mechanism(s)
involved in promoter DNA hypomethylation of the NLRP6 in HIV Tat and morphine-exposed astrocytes in vitro;
Specific Aim 3: Validate the combinatorial effects of HIV Tat and morphine on NLRP6 inflammasome mediated
astrocyte activation, in vivo. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for astrocyte activation induced by HIV
and morphine will set the stage for the future development of novel therapeutics aimed at dampening HIV and
opiate-mediated neuroinflammatory responses."

The overall aim of the Northwestern University Allergy-Immunology Research (NUAIR) Program is to train
postdoctoral scientists in translational research, here defined as research of disease mechanisms that includes
investigations in human subjects or human samples. The NUAIR Program builds on our Allergy-Immunology
Fellowship, which has a long history of excellence in clinical and academic training. Unified efforts of established
investigators in our Division with those from other Divisions and Departments have created a rich environment
for translational research in the NUAIR program in which clinical and basic researchers, both faculty and trainees,
collaborate and interact in weekly research and didactic activities. These collaborations have led to
multidisciplinary translational research programs in several allergic diseases supported by well-equipped
laboratories and a large number of research cores and facilities. Under the NUAIR Program, a steady state of 4
MD, MD/PhD and/or PhD postgraduate trainees per year will receive 2 years of research training. Each will work
together with a clinical research mentor and a basic research mentor to study mechanisms of allergic and
immunological diseases, including studies of human subjects or their derived samples. In addition to well-
structured research training and didactic activities, strong mentoring and close monitoring of trainees’
performances based on milestones will ensure proper progress during training. During the duration of funding,
we have mentored 17 trainees; all but one of the 14 who have finished have academic or research positions.
Our retention plan includes support for select trainees who remain in our Division as junior faculty members after
T32-supported training, while they seek external funding support. Senior faculty members in the Allergy-
Immunology Division have a strong record of mentoring NUAIR trainees towards obtaining K awards (6 so far)
and new R grants (1 junior faculty). We also offer programs to inspire medical students and residents to pursue
careers in Allergy-Immunology. Taken together, our rapidly expanding and comprehensive Allergy-Immunology
research environment provides state-of-the-art training to highly qualified MD, MD/PhD and PhD postdoctoral
trainees. These trainees will conduct collaborative translational research in Allergy-Immunology, initiating
research careers that will help solve a severe national need for academic leaders in this field."
10846035,"Abstract
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic viral disease process. Early in
infection, gut permeability is increased due to translocation of bacterial products. This leads to
systemic immune activation, which is reduced but not eliminated with effective antiretroviral
therapy. The presence of concomitant chronic viral hepatitis infection with hepatitis C (HCV)
may exacerbate systemic immune activation, via activation of hepatic macrophages with
proinflammatory downstream effects. It has been suggested that immune senescence or
premature aging of immune function accompanies these events and is itself a precursor to
clinical outcomes such as accelerated cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive impairment.
Immune senescence may be assessed using a variety of measures including DNA methylation,
telomere shortening, and changes in T-cell subsets. Cross-sectional analyses have reported
varying results depending upon the cohort studied and the method utilized. In this application,
we seek to compare and contrast different methods of assessing immune senescence in the
setting of HCV/HIV coinfection. Using longitudinal samples from a well established, diverse, and
well clinically characterized cohort, the BIRTH Study (ACTG 5294), we propose to evaluate
biomarkers of immune senescence and relate them to degree of hepatic fibrosis. We will
examine the relationship of HCV cure to determine how senescence biomarkers change, and
we will attempt to link immune senescence to alterations in Treg subpopulations."

The Neuroscience Curriculum (NBIO) provides comprehensive and rigorous training in neuroscience research
to graduate students working at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). No other graduate
program on campus fulfills this mission. We seek to renew the predoctoral training grant (T32NS007431) that
supports the stipends of NBIO students in their first and/or second year as well as training activities for
students as they advance in the NBIO program. The overall objective of the NBIO program is to train the next
generation of neuroscientists to conduct fundamental basic research on the nervous system. Trainees in the
program gain mechanistic knowledge of brain function across the lifespan and develop research skills that can
be used to develop new treatments for neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. The training plan
includes required coursework in tools and technologies used in modern neuroscience research, molecular and
cellular neuroscience, neurodevelopment, sensory and motor systems, the neurobiology of disease, training in
experimental design, statistical methodology, and quantitative skills and literacy. In the prior funding period, we
developed a Neuroanalytics course that provides rigorous training on programming, statistical analyses, and
machine learning as applied to quantitative real-world neuroscience data. Additional training activities include a
weekly seminar series that facilitates networking with experts in the neuroscience field and serves as a weekly
community building activity for NBIO students and faculty. The plan also includes an annual neuroscience
symposium, the annual awarding of the internationally recognized Perl-UNC Neuroscience Prize, an annual
retreat organized by NBIO students, and various academic and non-academic career development
opportunities. The 75 participating NBIO faculty are highly collaborative and are world-leaders in key areas of
modern neuroscience, ranging from basic research to translational/clinical studies. We recruited >40% more
NBIO training faculty relative to the prior funding period, and these faculty have been extremely successful in
training NBIO students. We are thus requesting a modest 10% increase in the number of T32 supported
students (11 per year) as part of this renewal. This T32 leverages strong institutional support of NBIO for
program administration, training activities, and resources, some of which are used to enhance recruitment and
mentoring of underrepresented (UR) trainees (30% of current NBIO students are from UR groups, up from
20% in the prior funding period). The planned appointment duration is 1-2 years, and the intended trainee
outcomes include completion of a thesis that advances new neuroscience knowledge, one or more first-author
peer-reviewed publications, and career advancement opportunities post-graduation. Our training environment
has proven to be conducive to meeting these and other outcome measures. Over the past reporting period
there were 3.5 average publications per trainee, 88% of all trainees completed their doctoral training with one
or more first author publication, and 97% of all NBIO trainees remain in neuro/science-related careers."
10840976,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Appropriate functioning of the nervous system is tremendously important to our quality of life. The nerves
within our body branch from the spinal column and can extend up to one meter away. Peripheral nerve injuries
are a common occurrence and can readily heal in most cases. However, end-organs beyond ~18 inches away
from the nerve body, are highly susceptible to poor reinnervation outcomes and long-term detriments. A main
reason for this being the slow growth rate of the axons (1-2mm/day or 1 inch/month). Some tissues, such as
skeletal muscle, can remain ready for reinnervation for 18-24 months. However, current intervention strategies
are limited, and most injuries are left to resolve naturally. This application aims to develop a strategy capable of
promoting quicker neurite outgrowth and preserving the muscle in a healthy state until reinnervation can occur.
This application focuses on tissue-nanotransfection mediated delivery of non-viral gene cargo to induce
molecular changes and to reprogram cells. The ability to deliver cargos locally to the site of injury opens
avenues beyond nerve injury for gene and cell-based therapeutics with a precision medicine approach.
Completion of the F99 phase sets a strong intellectual, technical and professional foundation for the
postdoctoral (K00) phase of this award. During the K00 phase, training in understanding how cell and gene-
based therapies impact neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions will develop knowledge,
expertise, and skills essential to becoming an independent investigator."

molecular biology through the funding of 9 predoctoral students, 3 of which will come from internal UNMC
support. The program will rely on a carefully vetted list of experienced and motivated mentors, as well as new
mentors who will work in tandem with more experienced mentors. The program will select highly qualified and
diverse predoctoral students and provide them with outstanding training in scientific rigor, critical thinking, and
the bench skills necessary to succeed in academic or biomedical industry research. Training will not be limited
to research skills, but will provide exposure to a wide range of careers, and to develop the requisite skills in
professionalism, leadership, organization, time management, teaching, oral presentations, scientific writing, etc.
The proposed training program includes formal didactic courses, including a key discussion-based course in
critical thinking in biochemistry and molecular biology directed by the PI of this proposal, as well as journal clubs,
seminars, oral and poster presentations and other opportunities for scientific discourse. The program is designed
for students to complete their training within a 5-year window and to produce an outstanding cadre of graduates
that will contribute significantly to the Nebraskan and US scientific workforce."

progress in the field of diabetes and related metabolic disorders at Joslin and in the surrounding Harvard
Medical School (HMS) community. Funding for the DRC enables state-of-the-art Biomedical Research Core
facilities, a Pilot & Feasibility Program that supports new and innovative research, and an Enrichment Program
that serves as a stimulating platform for scientific exchange. These activities are organized and managed by
the Administrative Core. Within this Core, the team of Director and Associate Directors brings a strong and
informed vision of diabetes research. Together they develop, oversee, and integrate Center activities, with
input from an engaged Internal Advsory Committee and external diabetes research experts who serve on the
DRC External Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core serves a key role in coordinating Center activities
with the administrative and scientific leadership at Joslin, Boston-area institutions, other DRCs, and the
NIDDK. The broad and deep expertise of the Joslin DRC leadership team, combined with rigorous and regular
self-assessments of the Center, enable the DRC to evolve Center activities nimbly to embrace new scientific
advances and the development of new technologies."
10847344,"ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY CORE: Abstract
The purpose of the Joslin Diabetes Research Center (DRC) Animal Physiology Core is to provide technically
advanced physiological evaluation of rodents for the study of diabetes, obesity, and their associated
complications. These studies provide a critical platform for extension of molecular discoveries to in vivo settings
that provide critical insights for relevance to human metabolic diseases. The study of animal models is an integral
part of Joslin Research. In addition to study of rats and established mouse models, Joslin DRC investigators
have generated new strains of genetically engineered mice, the majority of which have been studied using the
Animal Physiology Core.
Services provided by the Animal Physiology enable investigators to quantify in vivo energy expenditure, activity
and fuel utilization; body composition and bone density; arterial blood pressure and blood glucose levels; and
hypoxia and hyperoxia. Equipment and expertise are available for in vivo and longitudinal animal imaging;
controlled exposure to cold and thermoneutral temperatures using diurnal incubators; exercise using a rodent
treadmill and activity wheel cages; assessment of muscle strength; and advanced retinal imaging and function.
In addition, the Animal Physiology Core provides a Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility to study the role of the microbiome
in metabolic diseases. Based on technological advances and needs of the DRC research base, the current
application proposes substantial advances in the capabilities for quantification of energy expenditure and fuel
utilization enabled by recent acquisition of a state-of the-art Sable Promethion System.
The Animal Physiology Core provided services to 19 Joslin DRC Investigators and 11 outside Investigators in
the past cycle. In addition, the Core educated investigators and fellows on the theoretical understanding of core
procedures and data collection, consulted on study design, and provided hands-on training for some procedures
and equipment. The Core has been essential in the publication of numerous papers, including many published
in high impact journals such as Cell Metabolism, Nature Medicine, Nature Metabolism, Journal of Clinical
Investigation, and Science Translational Medicine. Both institutional and DRC support for the Animal Physiology
Core are substantial and enable Joslin’s Research Base to make physiologically relevant discoveries with
potential for translation to improved treatments, prevention, and ultimately, cures for diabetes and related
metabolic disorders."
10847345,"CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH CORE: Abstract
The Joslin Clinical Translational Research Core (CTRC) provides infrastructure for the conduct of high-quality
clinical and translational research in diabetes and metabolism. This is done by facilitating access to appropriate
patient populations as well as providing specialized facilities and expertise focused on clinical research related
to the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of diabetes, its complications, and related metabolic disorders.
Since it was established in the last funding cycle, the CTRC has provided consultative services for study design
and regulatory guidance. Physical infrastructure and well-trained nusing and technical staff assist investigators
in safely carrying out gold standard euglycemic, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic clamps at physiologic or
pharmacologic insulin concentrations; intravenous and oral glucose and mixed meal tolerance tests; and other
metabolic testing to assess insulin secretion, insulin action, and other physiologic processes for patient-centered
research specific to diabetes and metabolism. In addition expertise and equipment are available for exercise
training and testing capacities, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for assessment of bone density and body
composition, electroretinogram and optical coherence tomography angiography for visualization of retinal
function and vasculature, continuous glucose monitor data analayses, cooling vests for brown fat activation,
metabolic assessments, bioimpedance analysis, and anthropometry. CTRC facilities and procedures allow for
the sampling of various biologic fluids, performance of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and
physiologic measurements, and protocols for skin, muscle and adipose tissue sampling. Additionally, the Core
has established a diabetes-specific Biorepository that facilitates discovery of and access to biospecimens and
linked data. In this application, we propose to provide resources for “T1” translational research programs with
specific focus on prediction, prevention, and interdiction of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and related complications;
to facilitate design, implementation, and evaluation of investigator-initiated clinical trials and epidemiologic
studies for “T2-T3” research programs focused on improving/optimizing treatments of diabetes and related
complications; and to expand the CTRC Biorepository. These represent efforts that will build research capacity
for translating new discoveries into improvement in the treatment, prevention and ultimately, the cure of diabetes."
10847348,"FLOW CYTOMETRY CORE: Abstract
The primary objective of the Joslin Diabetes Research Center (DRC) Flow Cytometry Core is to provide state-
of-the-art equipment and expertise for quantitative phenotyping of cells and for isolating pure populations of cells
from complex tissues. These approaches enable diabetes and metabolism investigators to study the
development and cellular physiology of pancreatic islet, muscle, and adipose cells, as well as the inflammatory
cells that contribute to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and to elucidate mechanisms in the
pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and atherosclerosis. Services of this Core enable
characterization of cellular phenotypes and rapid isolation of well-defined, pure, populations of live cells. Cell
sorting technology is continuously evolving and improving, enabling new approaches to address key questions
in diabetes research. In addition to continually updating equipment to offer cutting edge cell sorting technology
to its users, the Core provides outstanding expertise through consultations and educational activities. During the
past cycle, the Core was heavily used by diabetes investigators in the Joslin research base and the broader
Boston diabetes research community, and use of Core services led to high impact publications that advanced
the field. To meet the evolving needs of the research base, the Core acquired a new state-of-the-art flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson LSRFortessa) and an Ellispot reader, both of which are now heavily used. In
addition, Core personnel provided training and education to users and carried out developmental research to
improve methods. In the next cycle in collaboration with the Molecular Phenotyping and Genotyping Core, the
Flow Cytometry Core will offer CITE-seq, an approach in which staining and flow cytometric analysis and
separation of cells is performed up-front of single cell RNA sequencing and combined with DNA-barcoded
antibodies that provide highly quantitative data on cell surface protein expression. CITE-seq will vastly expand
the ability to phenotype markers simultaneous with unbiased gene expression analysis in cells of relevance to
diabetes and metabolic disease. In sum, the Flow Cytometry Core provides critical equipment and expertise to
advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes and its complications, and ultimately develop
novel treatments and a cure for the disease and its complications."
10847349,"GENOME EDITING CORE: Abstract
Investigating mechanisms that underlie diabetes and its complications requires relevant experimental models.
The Genome Editing Core (GEC) was established to assist investigators in generating cell and mouse models
that can accelerate the development of new approaches to prevention, treatment, and ultimately a cure for
diabetes. The GEC provides investigators the tools and expertise to leverage the latest CRISPR methodologies
for the generation of both mouse and cellular models. The first component of this core, implemented
approximately 5 years ago, is a mouse genome editing service. GEC staff assist investigators in the design and
generation of custom mouse models with gene insertions, deletions and modifications of many kinds. The GEC
is uniquely positioned to engineer the genome of the most relevant mouse models for diabetes, including the
nonobese diabetic mouse model for type 1 diabetes and strains used in type 2 diabetes research (e.g. C57BL6
and C57BLKS). These models enable investigators to evaluate the consequences of genome edits at the
systemic level in physiological conditions. The second component of this core enables powerful cell-based,
genome-scale forward genetic screens through a CRISPR screening service and represents a major core
evolution to meet the needs of the Joslin research base. GEC leadership brings outstanding expertise in this
approach, and over the past year the core has acquired several genome-scale mouse and human CRISPR
libraries and completed successful screens. In the present application, CRISPR screening services will be
offered to perform genome-wide screens in the many various cell types to uncover mechanisms and identify
novel targets in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. In sum, the GEC provides a state-of-the art
platform for DRC investigators to manipulate the genome of mouse and human cells at a small scale for specific
hypothesis-driven projects and at a large scale for exploratory, hypothesis-generating research endeavors. The
GEC further allows investigators to test genome edits in mouse models to explore gene function at the systemic
level in physiological conditions."
10847350,"MOLECULAR PHENOTYPING AND GENOTYPING CORE: Abstract
The objective of the Molecular Phenotyping and Genotyping Core is to support Joslin and external investigators
in the study of molecular mechanisms of disease by providing equipment, expertise, and services in molecular
phenotyping and genotyping, with a focus on technology-intensive and high-density data analyses, which would
be too specialized or costly for individual laboratories to perform independently. One suite of services focuses
on multi-analyte characterization of samples from human studies and includes services for DNA extraction, SNP
genotyping, and genetic characterization of diabetes- and complications-related genes for clinical studies (next-
generation sequencing-based assay). A second suite of services provides equipment and expertise for analysis
of gene expression in cells and tissues including tissue homogenization, DNA shearing, Nanodrop
spectrophotometer, Bioanalyzer analysis of DNA/RNA, custom library preparation and facilitated access to
external sequencing facilities, and realtime and digital droplet PCR. The third suite of services assists
investigators in metabolic phenotyping by providing a Seahorse bioanalyzer for metabolic rate determinations
and a MALDI biotyper for identification and taxonomic classification of bacteria by high-throughput proteomic
analysis. In each of these areas, the Core provides training and consultations to facilitate understanding and use
of new methodologies by the Joslin community. Core staff work closely with Joslin’s institutional Bioinformatics
and Biostatistics Core staff to facilitate rigorous analytical pipelines for -omics data analysis and secure data
storage. The core is highly utilized, providing services to the majority of Joslin Research Base investigators, and
productivity is evidenced by numerous high impact publications that cite core use. In the present application, in
response to technological advances and the needs of our Research Base, we propose to enhance the Core’s
capacity to support study of the molecular mechanisms of disease by providing the following new and ehanced
services: 1) Single cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing; 2) expansion of the “genetic characterization for
clinical studies” service, with addition of newly-identified genes for monogenic DM, and new SNPs for T1D, T2D,
and complications; 3) automation of RNA extractions by acquisition of a Qiacube instrument; and 4) Integration
of the Core’s curated DNA collection with the Clinical Translational Research Core’s Biorepository. These new
initiatives, coupled with current services and training programs, will facilitate the access of Joslin investigators to
state-of-the art phenotyping and genotyping that are instrumental for both basic, translational, and clinical
research studies."
10847352,"PILOT AND FEASIBILITY GRANT PROGRAM: Abstract
The Joslin Diabetes Research Center (DRC) Pilot & Feasibility Grant Program has several goals. First is to
enrich the scientific base of the DRC at Joslin and other local institutions. A second major goal is to foster
interactions between researchers at Joslin and other local institutions, and in particular to enhance interactions
between basic and clinical researchers focused on diabetes and its complications. Finally, the Program aims to
advance innovative research into the pathogenesis, treatments and potential cures for all types of diabetes and
their complications. To achieve these goals the Program sponsors an annual competition for awards to support
projects by:
 1. New investigators in the diabetes field. The Pilot & Feasibility Program facilitates recruitment of talented
 new investigators who typically have not yet received substantial NIH funding.
 2. Experienced investigators in the diabetes field who wish to strike out in a novel direction. The Pilot &
 Feasibility Program embraces promising new experimental strategies and methods.
 3. Investigators from other fields embarking on a diabetes-related project for the first time. The Pilot &
 Feasibility Program helps inspire established investigators to bring their expertise to the diabetes field.
The Pilot & Feasibility Program has developed a carefully designed program to attract the most competitive
applications from Joslin DRC Research Base Investigators and from investigators at neighboring institutions in
eastern and central Massachusetts. The annual competition is widely advertised and comprehensive guidelines
are distributed. Proposals are judged by internal and external reviewers chosen on the basis of expertise.
Typically, the two proposals that receive the highest scores are recommended for funding of $50,000/year for 2
years, with the second year of support contingent upon progress in the first. Although these awards are modest,
the program provides initial support to enable these investigators to develop preliminary data sufficient that will
serve as the basis for subsequent successful applications for independent extramural research support.
Over the past decade the Pilot & Feasibility Program has made 21 new awards, 18 of which were to new
investigators, which are the highest priority of this Program. Each recipient is encouraged to Joslin DRC Cores
and participates in the Enrichment program by attending the Joslin Research Retreat and presenting a Joslin
seminar in the second year. Over the past 10 years, support from the program has led to 23 publications, and
recipients leveraged Pilot & Feasibility support to obtain 13 federal grants and 12 grants from non-profit
organizations. All of the award recipients supported in the past cycle remain in diabetes research. These metrics
provide strong evidence of the success of the DRC Pilot & Feasibility Program."
10847401,"Project Summary – Research Development Core
The overarching goal of the Research Development Core (RDC) of the UAB Nathan Shock Center (NSC) is to
support impactful research in the basic biology of aging related to the NSC theme of “Comparative Energetics
and Aging.” We will achieve this goal by addressing the following specific aims.
1. Maintain a nationally competitive pilot award program focused on the comparative biology of and energetics
and aging to:
a. Support expertly reviewed pilot studies.
b. Provide an avenue to support earlier-phase studies via an expedited “exploratory studies” funding
mechanism.
c. Facilitate interactions between potential applicants and leaders of UAB NSC Research Cores.
2. Solicit applications locally and nationally through interaction with UAB partners and the NSC Coordinating
Center, choose projects for funding, and monitor progress of projects:
a. Oversee a rigorous review process for selection of funded projects.
b. Monitor outcomes (publications and grants) of funded studies.
3. Support the education and development of junior investigators by:
a. Developing and maintaining an interdisciplinary pool of scientific mentors committed to guiding junior
 investigators to independence in the field of the biology of aging.
b. Organizing a journal club on Center-related topics; promoting nascent project meetings for brainstorming
 feedback, and networking; and offering a series of “boot camp” sessions (i.e., F to K, K to R, etc.).
c. Facilitate junior investigator development as well as collaboration with other NSCs via development of a
 mock study section meeting open to junior investigators across the NSC network.
d. Support conduct of the nationally advertised annual UAB integrated aging symposium.
The RDC will capitalize upon the UAB NSC Research Cores as well as established collaborations with entities
on the UAB campus and throughout the nation – including with other NSCs. The Core activities will support the
continued development of outstanding science in the biology of energetics and aging with particular emphasis
on developing the next generation of independent scientists."
10847406,"Project Summary – Comparative Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core
The maintenance of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism is essential for healthy aging.
Although bioenergetic metrics have been surveyed in a broad range of aging models, further integration of
these parameters with mitochondrial quality-control mechanisms and mitochondrial genetics is necessary for a
better understanding of healthy aging. We will extend the new concept of bioenergetic health we have
formulated in the previous funding period for age-related research. In the Comparative Mitochondrial Health
Assessment Core (Mitometabolism Core) both state-of-the-art and established techniques in
bioenergetics/metabolism, mitochondrial genetics, mitochondrial dynamics/mitophagy, and redox biology will
be offered. State-of-the-art experimental design and protocols for assessing cellular bioenergetics in various
live and frozen cells/tissues/organisms of aging models can be achieved. Mitochondrial dynamics and
mitophagy have been shown to be essential for healthy lifespan, and deficiencies of these lead to
accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. The Core will provide scientific and technical assistance to
measure these parameters of mitochondrial quality control. The mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX) mice
will be offered to the aging community to allow the contribution of specific mitochondrial DNA sequences to the
process of aging to be assessed independent of the nuclear contribution. Services to be provided to NIA
regular and supported members and pilot and feasibility grant awardees are: 1.) Molecular energetics analysis,
including cellular, tissue, and small organism measurements and including approaches we have pioneered in
spheroid-like cell structures and complex multi-cellular structures such as pancreatic islets, vessel segments
and adipose tissue, and complementing approaches with targeted metabolomics. Novel techniques of
assessing frozen tissues will vastly expand our ability to work with investigators outside UAB. 2.) State-of-the-
art technologies to enable comparative mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, keys to mitochondrial health,
and the integration of mitochondrial quality control with bioenergetic parameters. This will be further
strengthened by interactions with the Analytics Core. 3.) Mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX) models,
haplotyping, and mtDAMP measurements to test the unique contribution of mtDNA sequences to bioenergetics
and the response to age-related disease. 4.) Virtual and wet lab workshop educational programs, as well as
consultations."
10847409,"Project Summary – Comparative Data Analytics Core
The Comparative Data Analytics Core (Analytics Core) will provide not only high-level customized statistical
support for basic science investigators studying aging and energetics in diverse model organisms at UAB, but
also a venue for development of de novo methods specially for such research and a platform for the
dissemination of such methods to the aging research community at large. The core leadership comprises
statistical scientists with decades of combined history of studying the interface of aging, energetics and body
composition. They bring not only their statistical expertise, but their experience with and zeal for the science of
comparative studies at the interface of aging and energetics.
The need for specialized statistical expertise and support in aging research is clear. Statistical analyses of aging
research data provide many challenges. Aging research involves longitudinal analyses and modeling the
dependency of multiple observations taken over time, and accommodating the missing data that commonly
occurs with longitudinal studies. Left, right, and interval censoring add further complexities with time-to-event
(e.g., survival) outcomes. Statistical approaches in comparative biology face challenges such as phylogenetic
dependence among model residuals that complicate inference.
Non-statistician researchers benefit from the support and involvement of statistical scientists who are deeply
involved in the subject matter, who can tailor methods to the situation at hand, who work with the biologists from
the beginning as an engaged part of the research team, who can discuss the methods with the biologists and
explain the statistical procedures and who can develop new statistical methods for specific needs.
To that end, the Analytics Core offers the following specific aims:
 Specific Aims 1/2: To provide statistical support for 1) UAB investigators and 2) non-UAB investigators
 studying the comparative energetics of aging, including traditional, specialized, and bespoke methods.
 Specific Aim 3: To conduct high-level statistical investigations of secondary data to answer questions
 about the comparative energetics of aging.
 Specific Aim 4: To develop and evaluate statistical methods needed in the field of the comparative
 energetics of aging.
 Specific Aim 5: To provide reproducibility, verification, and transparency support for aging researchers.
An investment in this core will achieve dividends by catalyzing more informative and rigorous research on aging
within the UAB NSC and for the community of aging researchers at large.

maximal exploitation of these materials. These goals facilitate research by providing universal and rapid
access to the most generally useful stocks by preserving specialty genotypes with exceptional characteristics,

acquiring, maintaining and distributing Drosophila strains while simultaneously eliminating obsolete stocks. The
work will preserve federal investments in genetic resource development by maintaining stocks securely using
regimented practices. It aims to maximize the rigor and reproducibility of genetic studies by encouraging stock
reuse. The second specific aim is to continue developing robust and transparent information resources to meet
the operational needs of the facility and the research needs of Drosophila scientists while maintaining and
promoting excellent user support. The third specific aim is to undertake research to increase the utility of one of
the largest subsets of BDSC stocks, the split-GAL stocks, which were developed to characterize neurons in the

allowing investigators to manipulate cell characteristics experimentally in otherwise normal individuals. The
research proposed here aims to characterize the expression of split-GAL4 transgenes outside the brain to
benefit the analysis of diverse cell types and to help distinguish the physiological effects of gene expression in
the brain versus other tissues in split-GAL4 studies. Key to all three aims is the administration and
advancement of the existing, highly successful cost recovery program that finances most operational expenses
from user fees. Consequently, the proposal focuses on support and development of the core management

10841831,"Pain is a very common clinical problem, causing suffering in millions. Treatment of pain that lasts longer
than a brief procedure can be difficult and can entail the use of opioids, with their side effects and potential for
addiction and diversion. In this research we seek to develop injectable drug delivery systems (DDS) using
sustained release technology to provide continuous prolonged local anesthesia (PLA) lasting many hours to
days for perioperative pain, or even weeks for chronic pain. In addition, will develop DDS where the patient
could determine when they receive local anesthesia, how intense the anesthesia is, and how long it lasts.
Those on-demand DDS (termed triggered local anesthetics, TLA) are controlled by external energy sources
such as near-infrared light and ultrasound. Both the continuous and triggered DDS have the potential to
revolutionize pain management and advance the science of drug delivery. These PLA and TLA systems could
mitigate or obviate opioid use.
 All the DDS should ideally: be delivered by a single injection; be easy to administer; not require general
anesthesia or surgery to initiate; last days to weeks; cause minimal local inflammation and no local neuro- or
myotoxicity, or systemic toxicity; be fully biodegradable and reversible. Triggerable systems should be easy to
use with a safe and convenient device.
 Our strategy has been to develop novel sustained release vehicles to extend the release of local
anesthetics, thus prolonging duration of effect and reducing systemic toxicity. To minimize local (tissue) toxicity
we have used site 1 sodium channel blockers (S1SCBs) such as saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin, and taken
advantage of interactions with compounds that are known to enhance their duration of nerve blockade, such as
conventional local anesthetics and steroids.
 In PLA, we have greatly extended the duration of effect of our previous designs and reduced their toxicity,
such that 3-4 days of nerve block can be achieved without using drug synergy, and at least a week with. In
TLA, we have used photo-labile linkages to produce formulations that only release drugs upon photo-triggering
(i.e. do not cause nerve block unless the site of injection is irradiated), and where nerve block can be safely
and repeatedly re-induced by irradiating the injection site with near-infrared light or ultrasound. This work has
produced 17 papers in the past 4 years (actually 3 years if accounting for the lab shutdown due to COVID-19),
many in prominent journals (5 in Nature communications, 1 in Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2 in Nano
Letters).
 In PLA, we propose a spectrum of approaches to produce yet longer blocks while improving safety. In TLA,
we propose means to extend the number of triggerable events, and extend the time frame over which they can
be triggered – allowing use in prolonged perioperative and chronic pain.
 Addressing these challenges will entail overcoming challenges in biomaterials / drug delivery /
nanoscience, including enhancing the loading of highly water-soluble charged drugs into DDS, minimizing their
initial rapid (“burst”) release, extending their duration of release, and /or minimizing their baseline (un-triggered)
release. The impact of these new approaches on tissue reaction will be studied.
 The PLA and TLA systems to be developed here address unmet clinical needs and could revolutionize pain
management."
10842023,"Project Summary
As the sole producer of proteins in the cell, the ribosome is central to all cellular life. With this critical role,
ribosome dysfunction can give rise to a host of human disease, which makes it a target for therapeutics. In
addition, since ribosomes are organism-specific, several classes of antibiotics function by halting protein
synthesis in bacteria, without interfering with the dynamics of human ribosomes. However, efforts to combat
bacterial infections face multiple challenges, including antibiotic resistance and side effects. Accordingly, a
thorough understanding of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosome dynamics can be used to design more effective
antibiotics, as well as provide insights into the molecular origins of various diseases. In the current project, we
will apply state-of-the art molecular simulation methods to study how ribosomes are able to accurately and
efficiently produce proteins in the cell (i.e., translation). We will apply multiple types of simulation techniques to
obtain atomistic insights into the dynamics of the conformational rearrangements that enable translation. These
calculations will elucidate the precise interactions that control ribosome kinetics in bacterial and human
ribosomes (cytosolic and mitochondrial). These studies will advance our understanding of ribosome dynamics,
which will allow for more effective therapeutic strategies to be developed, in order to combat bacterial infections
and disease. We will work towards this objective by pursuing multiple avenues of investigation. In collaboration
with experimental groups, we will design and execute simulations that will specifically guide the development of
next-generation single-molecule methods. Our models will also be used to understand the precise relationship
between small-scale conformational motions (identified by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments) and large-
scale/long-time dynamics in the ribosome. We will also use computational strategies to identify candidate small
molecules that may serve as novel broad-spectrum antibiotics. Promising antibiotic candidates will then be
characterized through biochemical, single-molecule and structural biology (cryoelectron microscopy) analysis,
performed in well-established experimental laboratories. Finally, our collaborations with structural biology
laboratories will allow us to provide the first insights into the dynamics of newly-identified functional states. In
addition to immediate therapeutic applications, this broad range of efforts will help establish a comprehensive
understanding of ribosome dynamics that connects experimental observables and theoretical principles, such
that guiding principles may be identified."

10842034,"Project Summary:
Our research program investigates the functional mechanisms that operate in voltage gated K+ (Kv) channels.
Kv channels are essential for the generation and conduction of electrical signals by neurons, muscles and
endocrine cells. Underlying the physiological roles of Kv channels is their ability to regulate the flux of K+ across
cellular membranes. The flux of K+ through a Kv channel is controlled by the processes of voltage activation,
which turns on the flux, and inactivation, which turns off the flux of K+ through the channel. There have been
extensive investigations on Kv channels but major questions remain on the activation and inactivation
mechanisms. In our research program, we use a multidisciplinary approach that combines structural and
functional studies with protein modifications using unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutagenesis. UAA mutagenesis
is a very powerful method for protein modification compared to traditional mutagenesis because it allows a large
variety of side chain modifications and permits the modification of the protein backbone. In the grant period, we
will investigate C-type inactivation in the Shaker, Kv1.2 and the cardiac Kv channel HERG. C-type inactivation
refers to a conformational change at the selectivity filter, the ion binding region of the channel, that turns off the
flux of ions through the channel. We will also investigate the role of the protein main chain interactions in voltage
gating. Our studies on voltage gating will be carried out in the hyperpolarization activated and cyclic nucleotide
gated ion (HCN) channel. The research proposed is significant because it will provide key mechanistic insights
into the working of Kv channels. The research will also provide strategies for investigating the role of the protein
backbone and ion binding sites, strategies that will be generally applicable to other ion channels."

Precise, coordinated regulation of gene expression is essential for the viability of all organisms
and prevents the formation of many disease states. A critical challenge for the cell is to coordinate
the regulation of thousands of genes that are distant from each other in the linear genome.
Coordinate regulation of distant genes is key for diverse, essential biological processes from
activation of the zygotic genome, to cellular differentiation, and dosage compensation. Our goal
is to reveal how the correct genes are precisely coregulated spatially and temporally. Prior to the
zygotic genome becoming activated, only a few key transcription factors (TFs), called pioneer
TFs9, occupy their DNA targets. Pioneer TFs can bind closed chromatin, recruit chromatin
remodelers, and target additional TFs and complexes to coregulate genes. We and others
recently identified a new conserved mechanism by which GA-binding pioneer TFs coregulate
genes through a new class of cis regulatory elements called tethering elements which mediate
chromatin looping and are distinct from enhancers and promoters. However, it is critical to
determine the mechanisms by which tethering elements function spatially and temporally to
coregulate the correct targets. We leverage the conserved, dynamic process of male X-
chromosome dosage compensation (DC) to define the mechanisms by which tethering elements
co-regulate genes because hundreds of tethering elements co-upregulate thousands of non-
contiguous active X-linked genes. Thus far, we have identified the following mechanisms that are
necessary, but not sufficient to, drive the specificity of tethering elements during Drosophila DC,
a powerful genetic and biochemical system: 1) long-range 3D chromatin loops mediated by a
conserved pioneer TF that dimerizes and binds to clusters of GA-rich motifs; 2) competition
between functionally similar GA-binding pioneer TFs; 3) pioneer TF interaction with long non-
coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that competition between
similar GA-binding pioneer TFs that dimerize at clustered GA repeats and directly interact with
lncRNAs drive the specific contacts that precisely co-regulate target genes spatially and
temporally. We will answer the following key questions: Question #1: How does competition
between pioneer TFs drive three-dimensional looping? Question #2: How does interaction
between TFs and lncRNAs coregulate genes? Question #3: How is the spatial and temporal
specificity of gene co-regulation determined? By defining how pioneer TFs and lncRNAs function
together to accurately spatially and temporally coregulate distant genes, we will determine
fundamental new mechanisms for gene regulation."

The goal of this proposal is to determine how the crosstalk between RNA and chromatin shapes epigenetic
states in pluripotent and differentiated cells.
My laboratory studies epigenetic memory, both at a mechanistic level, using biochemistry and functional
genomics in mouse embryonic stem cells, and at an organismal level, using ants and flies as model systems.
In the nine years since the lab opened, our mechanistic work has been recognized for our contributions to
understanding the role of protein–RNA interactions in chromatin regulation and in particular the Polycomb
pathway. We have developed technologies to map RNA-binding sites on specific protein complexes or the
entire proteome using photocrosslinking and mass spectrometry, and used this information to dissect the
functional contribution of RNA to epigenetic pathways. We also established an acute depletion system in
embryonic stem cells that allow us to interrogate epigenetic dynamics during cell fate transitions.
In the next five years, we will build on these studies and develop new systems and technologies to obtain a
deeper understanding of the RNA foundations of chromatin regulation and epigenetic phenomena in
mammalian cells. Using a directed differentiation system from embryonic stem cells to neurons combined with
acute protein and RNA depletion technologies, we will determine the order of biochemical events that
culminate in Polycomb-mediated silencing and the role of RNA at two critical steps: Polycomb target
selection and gene repression via Polycomb body formation. Expanding on our protein–RNA studies with
mass spectrometry, we will study more broadly the role of different classes of RNA and their chemical
modifications in chromatin factor recruitment and design separation-of-function mutants using a newly
developed high-throughput mutational screening method. Finally, we will follow up on some intriguing
preliminary findings from a genome-wide knockout screen to explore a new direction, the molecular
mechanism by which mobile RNAs are selected for incorporation into extracellular vesicles and transfer to
recipient cells, where they might exert epigenetic functions.
This work will add to our mechanistic understanding of RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin processes,
which in turn will provide new opportunities to decode and engineer epigenetic states, with broad impact on
research, biotechnology, and medicine."
10842123,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Drug discovery for rare diseases is often limited by the lack of relevant preclinical models that adequately
capture the complexity and diversity of patients affected. Furthermore, clinical trials are burdened with challenges
in patient recruitment and stratification to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate. The ability to use
in vitro cellular data for efficacy assessment will create drug development opportunities for rare diseases that
were previously considered too challenging due to the small number of patients. To enable the use of data from
relevant cellular models to replace, reduce or refine clinical trials for rare diseases, this proposal will leverage
human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a well-established tool for patient-specific and disease-specific
modeling in vitro, to advance the concept of “clinical trial in a dish” to accelerate, de-risk, and streamline drug
discovery for rare diseases. Additionally, we combine iPSC technology with artificial intelligence and machine
learning (AI/ML) to discover novel therapeutic compounds that are predicted to have significantly improved safety
and efficacy. Here, we leverage our expertise in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) as a rare disease with unmet
needs to apply our iPSC-AI/ML drug discovery platform.
 DM1 is a monogenic rare disease affecting nearly 1 in 2,100 in the general population and is the most
common adult form of muscular dystrophy. It is a progressive multi-systemic disease with cardiovascular
complications being the second leading cause of death behind respiratory failure. To date, there is no treatment
for the heart in DM1 and no pharmacological treatments available for the prevalent arrhythmias. The main
standard of care for DM1 patients at risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death is an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD). Specific Aim 1 will utilize AI/ML to identify safe and novel compounds with high binding affinity
to RNA structures formed by expanded CUG repeats in the RNA from the DMPK gene, which is the underlying
cause of the disease. Specific Aim 2 will then evaluate these drugs in iPSC-derived cardiac organoids and in
DM1 mouse model. The outcome of this project will inform the development of general standards, quality control
criteria, and best practices for in vitro models to be used for rare disease safety and efficacy assessment for
clinical trial readiness."
10843789,"Inflammatory diseases limit healthspan, defined as the length of one's life spent in good health. We propose an
ancillary study on deidentified samples from a recent NIA-funded trial Antecedent Metabolic Health and
Metformin (ANTHEM) that will define traits of healthy people who would benefit from metformin intervention
before onset of age-related health risks like chronic inflammation. ANTHEM queries an unexpected outcome of
dual interventions of metformin and exercise: metformin improved metabolic health over exercise alone in
overweight/obese insulin resistant subjects, but metformin blunted exercise-mediated improvements in
metabolic health of otherwise similar insulin sensitive subjects. ANTHEM tests the impact of baseline metabolic
health on the effects of metformin monotherapy on insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle mitochondria by
recruiting overall healthy subjects to address the general paradigm that lifespan enhancers must start prior to
onset of age-related co-morbidities for maximal benefit. The proposed work will add an inflammation arm to
ANTHEM. The primary endpoint of our ancillary study will be cytokine profiles, a bioinformatic combination of
cytokines that revealed a previously unappreciated Th17 profile that naturally develops systemically with age.
This profile is similar to the systemic profile in type 2 diabetes, and thus suggests a mechanistic link between
inflammation and this major challenge to healthspan. Metformin-mediated repair of mitochondrial
bioenergetics, in combination with improved non-mitochondrial autophagy, lowered the Th17 profile in samples
from older subjects. In contrast, metformin lowered IL-10 production by cells from younger subjects, arguably
increasing inflammation. Our unique approach to defining “inflammation” thus clarified mechanisms of
metformin action, while echoing concepts from the exercise study summarized above: metformin may benefit
subjects with sub-clinical health challenges while having a negative effect on healthier people. We will apply
similar approaches to query metformin's effect on inflammation by analyzing deidentified ANTHEM samples to
test the hypothesis that metformin intervention in healthy subjects with naturally low insulin sensitivity reduces
cytokines known to fuel chronic inflammation, by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics and increasing non-
mitochondrial autophagy in immune cells. The secondary hypothesis is that metformin will have either a
negative or no impact on immune cells from highly insulin sensitive subjects. Mechanistic insights into
metformin action on immune cells will be analyzed relative to changes in body composition, aging biomarkers,
glycemic control, and skeletal muscle outcomes collected for ANTHEM. Parallel ex vivo manipulation of
mitochondrial function and autophagy in immune cells will establish cause/effect relationships amongst
metformin, cell physiology, and cytokine profiles. Success with the proposed project coupled with ANTHEM
outcomes will define traits of people who would benefit from preventative metformin, and perhaps more
importantly, to identify those who may be harmed by proactive metformin use."

Clinical Subjects and Recruitment Core will provide a centralized resource for subject recruitment, screening
and enrollment. Project 1 will focus on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults with autoimmune disease in the

vaccination have already been collected, a trial of repeat SARS CoV-2 vaccination and of influenza vaccination
will be done. Project 2 recruitment will focus on recruitment of older (age ≥ 65) nursing home and senior
assisted living residents for a randomized trial of high-dose versus MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, and
will also recruit young adults (age 21-39) as controls. Project 3 will recruit young adults (age 16-30) with sickle
cell disease for studies of immune dysregulation and response to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine,
together with controls without sickle cell disease. The Core will also facilitate skin biopsies of the vaccination
site and regional lymph node biopsies following vaccination in a subset of participants to assess tissue
transcriptomic responses. This Core will also be responsible for ensure safety and information security for all
participants and for compliance with all regulatory measures. The Core will be responsible for maintaining and
deploying our established barcoding sample system for generation of subject numbers, tracking of samples,
and mapping to external IDs, collaborating with Core B (Data Management and Analysis), where data
management platforms are based. The Core is led by investigators with extensive experience carrying out
human immunology studies who have the necessary regulatory and clinical experience. Consequently, this
Clinical Subjects and Recruitment Core will advance the goals of this Human Immunology Project Consortium

The long-term goal of the SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma is to reduce the morbidity and mortality from soft tissue
sarcoma by developing therapies targeted to specific molecular, genetic, epigenetic, and signaling pathway
alterations or specific sarcoma type and subtype. To pursue this, we will focus our efforts on 4 broad translational
research objectives: 1. Define shared and type-specific molecular mechanisms of sarcomagenesis to identify
new rational therapeutic targets; 2. Define mechanisms of resistance to targeted and immune therapies; 3.
Clinically validate new therapeutic targets and treatments in soft tissue sarcoma patients and facilitate the
development, recruitment, and application of clinical trials that serve both the adult and pediatric populations; 4.
Discover specific molecular alterations and new biomarkers that predict outcome and response to targeted and
immune therapy. To achieve these goals, we have marshaled an integrated, multidisciplinary group of basic and
clinical investigators, all armed with a unique resource, a clinicopathologic and outcomes database prospectively
collected over a 41-year period. This database now contains data for over 14,990 patients treated for soft tissue
sarcoma at MSK. The database is linked to an extensive sarcoma tissue and blood bank, which in turn is linked
to an extensive multi-platform molecular genetic and epigenetic dataset and a collection of primary sarcoma cell
lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human sarcoma. The SPORE is structured around 3
research projects, 4 cores, and career enhancement and developmental research programs. Each research
project focuses on two or more of the 4 broad translational research goals listed above. RP1 (GIST
Pathogenesis) aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and role of MAX/MGA/MYC genetic perturbations
in driving GIST pathogenesis and to develop novel biomarkers and predictive models to improve patient risk
assessment and selection for adjuvant therapy. RP2 (Targeting Hippo Dependence) seeks to characterize the
role of the Hippo pathway and the eIF4FA complex in genetically complex sarcomas, test the efficacy and toxicity
of a new eIF4A inhibitor, TDI-7663, and develop biomarkers of innate and acquired resistance to eIF4A inhibition.
RP3 (Synovial Sarcoma Vulnerabilities) seeks to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities and immuno-oncologic
strategies in synovial sarcoma and potential synergies between them by discovering H3K36 methylation-related
dependencies on specific epigenetic regulators, preclinical development of T cells genetically engineered to
express a T cell receptor against the SS18::SSX public neoantigen, and a conceptually innovative clinical trial of
a multivalent mRNA vaccine encoding the SS18::SSX(1/2) junction sequence and the major cancer-testis
antigens in synovial sarcoma."
10848364,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Birth rates to older fathers increased approximately 60% since 1980, while births to younger fathers declined. Of
the nearly 4 million registered births in 2015, 11% (~440,000) were born to older fathers. Sperm from older men
have more mutations compared with young men, increasing the risk that their children will be afflicted with a
genetic disease. This increase in mutations, the paternal age effect, is increasingly significant and is directly
relevant to male reproductive aging and to child health. DNA repair declines in spermatogenic cells as mice age,
promoting an increase in mutations. Reduced levels of a base excision repair protein is causal to reduced repair
activity and increased mutagenesis in spermatogenic cells at older age. Our preliminary data indicate the
mechanisms driving increased germline mutagenesis with aging occur in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes and
involve APEX1, TRP53 and MDM2, tumor suppressors that normally function to protect against mutagenesis.
We hypothesize that chronic activation of TRP53 activates MDM2 ubiquitination of APEX1, resulting in reduced
APEX1. In Aim 1 we will test if phosphorylation of TRP53 at Ser18/23 triggers degradation of APEX1 in
pachytene spermatocytes, but not post-meiotic round spermatids, from older mice. In Aim 2. we will test if MDM2
ubiquitinates APEX1, leading to greater amounts of highly ubiquitinated APEX1 in pachytene spermatocytes,
not round spermatids, of older mice, proteasomal degradation of APEX1, and a resulting greater spontaneous
mutation frequency. In Aim 3, based upon preliminary data showing a unique distribution of APEX1, we will test
if APEX1 uniquely interacts with chromatin in meiotic cells. Methods: Defined populations of enriched specific
spermatogenic cell types will be prepared from male mice carrying targeted genetic changes in Mdm2 and Trp53
to test whether 1) these tumor suppressors dysregulate APEX1 abundance in old mice, and 2) become
chronically activated during aging resulting in decreased APEX1 abundance, decreased base excision repair,
and increased mutagenesis. The importance of proteasome degradation and MDM2 activity will be tested using
proteasome and MDM2 inhibitors. Proximity labeling will be used in vivo to identify APEX1 interacting proteins
in meiotic cells. Age-associated mutation frequency and spectra will be determined for mouse genes using
duplex sequencing. The proposed studies test a novel model in which a tumor suppressor axis (i.e. TRP53,
MDM2 and APEX1) that normally functions to safeguard genome integrity, instead compromises gamete genetic
quality by reducing APEX1 abundance and resulting in elevated mutagenesis in the unique biological context of
aging meiotic germ cells. If confirmed, this is a paradigm shift from the widely held view that the major driving
force of increased mutations in male gametes is a passive accumulation. The proposed studies will address a
fundamental biological mechanism driving increased mutagenesis that leads to the paternal age effect and may
ultimately reveal potential treatment targets to protect against genetic diseases mediated through mutagenesis
in spermatogenic cells."
10848178,"Project Summary/Abstract
By 2030, the majority of World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery workers (responders) will be aged 65
and over and at risk for aging-related conditions and consequences. Although the WTC General Responder
Cohort (WTC-GRC) is aging (median age is 59 in 2021), the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) does not
routinely collect data on aging-related syndromes. In particular, frailty is a common geriatric syndrome
characterized by increased vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability and
hospitalizations. Recently, our multidisciplinary research team has developed a WTC-specific frailty
assessment tool (i.e., WTC Clinical Frailty Index/FI) based on clinically observable signs and symptoms of
aging regularly examined within WTCHP surveillance. Our preliminary data indicate that approximately 30% of
the WTC-GRC meets criteria for frailty as determined by WTC Clinical-FI, an association that increases with
age, WTC exposure, and by occupation type (e.g., higher risk among construction worker). These findings
underscore the urgent need for routine systematic assessments of structured aging-related indicators such as
frailty in the WTC-GRC. Moreover, we began pilot work to prospectively assess physical measures (e.g.,
Frailty Phenotype) and consequences of frailty (e.g., functional impairment, falls) in WTC general responders
who are followed at the Mount Sinai Clinical Center of Excellence (CCE) with an aim to improve the accuracy
of the WTC Clinical-FI. These efforts have provided the necessary first step to more accurately measure frailty
in WTC general responders. Thus, the overarching goals of this project are to further develop WTC Clinical-FI
to study frailty progression and associated risk factors and clinical outcomes, and begin piloting frailty
interventions in WTC general responders. Specially, we will determine frailty trajectories and risk factors
associated with these distinct trajectories using the repository of WTC-GRC health monitoring data already
collected at the Mount Sinai CCE (Aim 1); validate WTC Clinical-FI against Frailty Phenotype and determine its
predictive validity for aging-related clinical outcomes such as functional decline and falls in a longitudinal cohort
of general responders (Aim 2); and implement a pilot multicomponent intervention targeting modifiable risk
factors of frailty such as inappropriate medication use in a subset of general responders (Aim 3). Identifying
modifiable risk factors for frailty has the potential to impact the aging WTC responders of the entire WTCHP.
Results of this study will be instrumental in improving the capacity of WTCHP to monitor and care for aging
responders through partnership with Mount Sinai's nationally recognized Geriatrics and Palliative Care
programs including the development of future widespread multifactorial preventive programs tailored to WTC
responders to promote healthy aging."
10848366,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) is a common type of arthritis defined by the presence of
calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in articular cartilage. While CPDD typically affects elderly patients in a
sporadic fashion, it also occurs prematurely in familial patterns. Studies of familial forms of this disease present
exciting opportunities to identify novel therapeutic targets for this currently untreatable arthritis. We recently
confirmed that a mutation in the stop codon of TNFRSF11B causes early onset CPDD. TNFRSF11B codes for
osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG is a decoy receptor for Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Ligand
(RANKL). RANKL promotes osteoclast formation. Our preliminary data clearly demonstrate that recombinant
mutant OPG (OPGmt) displays inefficient inhibition of RANKL resulting in excess osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Our
genetically engineered mice carrying OPGmt have osteopenia and premature arthritis mirroring the effects of
OPGmt in humans. We have also found that osteoclast conditioned media potently stimulates chondrocyte
pyrophosphate (PPi) production, a necessary process for CPP crystal formation. The purpose of this work is to
investigate the conceptually innovative hypothesis that OPGmt produces CPDD by increasing
osteoclastogenesis in subchondral bone. We propose that excess osteoclasts in subchondral bone stimulate
cartilage PPi production and that high cartilage-derived PPi levels target pre-osteoblasts to exaggerate
subchondral osteoclastogenesis seen in the presence of OPGmt. The scientific premise of this work stems from
careful observations of the phenotype of patients with OPGmt and strong preliminary data. In Aim 1 we will use
Opgmt/+ and Opgmt/mt knock-in mice to comprehensively determine the role of Opgmt in arthritis pathogenesis in
mice and determine if disease can be prevented by blocking RANKL. In Aim 2, we will employ in vitro and in
vivo models to investigate the role of high PPi levels in promoting OPGmt-induced arthritis and elucidate the
underlying mechanisms. This work is the first to identify the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in CPDD and to
implicate subchondral bone as a primary target tissue in this disease. This proposal includes a novel mouse
model that will serve as the basis for further mechanistic and pre-clinical studies in CPDD. The shared clinical
features of patients with the OPG mutation and those with age-related CPDD and the existence of available
drugs which target these pathways support rapid translation of this work."
10848367,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) repair is a promising surgical treatment for young adults with aortic regurgitation
(AR). However, BAV repair surgery remains underutilized and variably applied across institutions, owing in
part to the lack of a standardized approach to BAV repair planning. Currently, BAV repair planning relies
primarily on intraoperative manual measurements of the valve made by direct observation while the heart is
in an arrested state, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify defects in valve dynamics under physiological
conditions. To address this challenge, the long-term goal is to develop a multimodal 4D image analytics and
valve modeling platform that systematically characterizes pre-operative BAV morphology and dynamics and
enables patient-specific surgical planning. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (i) fill a knowledge
gap in the precise anatomical relationships between the aortic cusps, annulus, and root that make a BAV
functionally competent, and (ii) develop computational image analytics to precisely identify the patient-
specific, anatomical and dynamic distortions that cause AR so that these defects can be prioritized for risk
stratification and planning of BAV repair surgery. This work will be carried out by pursuing three specific aims:
(1) Design and assess an automated segmentation and modeling algorithm for 4D reconstruction of the BAV
apparatus from multiple clinical imaging modalities; (2) characterize the morphological and dynamic features
of BAV competence and create a machine learning method for comprehensive anomaly detection in
regurgitant BAVs; (3) evaluate a BAV repair planning system using images acquired from valve repair
procedures at three institutions. The proposed project leverages the complementary benefits of two
modalities: real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography and 4D computed tomography angiography,
which capture both the morphological detail of the aortic cusps with high spatial resolution and the motion of
the 3D BAV apparatus with high temporal resolution. The innovation of this project is that the proposed tools
could change how BAV repair planning is carried out. Instead of relying on intraoperative inspection of the
valve while it is unpressurized, the surgeon can interactively visualize image-derived BAV models and quantify
dynamic mechanisms of AR when the valve is in a pre-operative 4D physiological state. The significance of
this research is that it could promote consistency in valve repair planning across institutions, decrease
surgeons’ reliance on intuition and trial-and-error, and thereby increase the utilization of BAV repair in young
adults. This would have quality of life advantages relative to conventional valve replacement, which requires
lifelong anticoagulation therapy (mechanical valves) or multiple re-replacements due to limited durability
(bioprosthetic valves). Ultimately, the systematic analysis of multimodal image data for computer-aided valve
defect detection will broadly benefit advancement of surgical treatments for acquired and congenital heart
disease."
10848284,"Summary
Stuttering or childhood onset fluency disorder, affects 5-8% of preschool-aged children. Although many
children’s stuttering resolves within 12-24 months of onset, those who continue to stutter beyond age 7 are at
significant risk for chronic stuttering. For children who persist, speaking often becomes a lifelong struggle. The
negative consequences for academic/vocational achievement and psychosocial development suffered by
many of these children are substantial and long lasting.
 Prior studies in preschool children who stutter (CWS) have identified demographic, behavioral, and
physiological factors associated with stuttering persistence by comparing performance across groups of
preschool children. Yet, we do not know how a child’s unique developmental pathway leads them to recover or
persist in stuttering. This limits our ability to predict a child’s risk of developing persistent (chronic) stuttering
reliably and to develop efficacious prevention and treatment strategies.
 This project shifts experimental focus, for the first time, to the individual child, providing a dynamic
account of how neurological, behavioral, and experiential factors unfold over time and contribute to different
stuttering outcomes. We achieve this through our comprehensive, longitudinal design and structural equation
modeling framework, in which we map the developmental trajectories of critical factors implicated in stuttering.
In our approach, we use a novel neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), that
allows us to record brain activity concurrent with continuous speech production, a distinct advantage of this
technique. We will assess whether neural markers derived from fNIRS recordings identified in our research
with older CWS can distinguish preschool children at risk for persistence, thereby helping to establish a neural
basis for stuttering persistence and recovery. We will also assess whether atypical coupling between
sympathetic nervous system activity and speech output, detected in cross-sectional studies, represents a risk
factor for chronic stuttering. Finally, stuttering leaves a lasting imprint on children who persist. Ample evidence
shows that older children and adults are more likely to harbor negative emotions about their speech and/or
develop communication anxiety. We lack a continuous picture, however, of how these issues develop in young
children whose awareness of stuttering is emerging. We will examine how behavioral, emotional, and
experiential factors unfold over time and explore their roles in stuttering persistence or recovery and in the
development of negative communication attitudes.
 This project will bring new, comprehensive insights into why stuttering persists in individual children,
and, in parallel, help better prioritize therapy resources, identify etiological targets for prevention and
intervention, and accelerate the development of new treatments."

experience of focused dedicated didactics, seminars, and an intense research experience with one of 32 well-
established, highly interactive, and well-funded cross-disciplinary mentors from nine different primary
departments. The goal is to generate productive MD and MD/PhD physician-scientists as well as PhD
scientists and clinician-scientists, who are launched on a lifelong investigative career pursuing basic,
translational, and clinical research in this relatively underrepresented field. We propose to expand the training
program to include 2 MD/PhD and PhD predoctoral students, who will also benefit from the unique training
opportunities provided by this T32. Three major degree granting ""tracks"" are also available for MD post-docs:
an Investigative Medicine PhD available to MD-only trainees who wish to obtain a more expansive research
background mimicking that of an MD/PhD; a Master’s of Health Sciences for those with an emphasis on T3-T4
research; and a Masters of Biomedical Engineering for trainees with a past biomedicine emphasis who wish to
add a diagnostic and cellular therapeutic engineering dimension to their career. Drawn predominantly from an
MD, MD/PhD, and PhD candidate pool with a background focused on Laboratory Medicine & Pathology, with
additions from adult and pediatric Hematology and Immunology/ID programs (a pool that has always included
at least 10 fold more excellent, TG eligible, candidates than are accepted), outcomes have been quite positive.
Of the 36 graduates of the T32 program over the past 15 years, there was an average of 4.5 papers and 2 first-
author papers per trainee published as a direct result of the T32 training. Seven are still in training (e.g. clinical
fellowship, ongoing research with independent K funding). Of the remaining 29, 96% (28) are in scientific
careers; 41% (12) are in tenure-track research-intensive positions at research universities; 21% (6) in careers
on the ladder research track at major universities, and 34% (10) are in senior scientist positions in industry.. As
the only benign hematology T32 at Yale, one of the few Immunohematology/Transfusion Medicine T32s in the
country that emphasizes PhD clinician-scientists (an important alternate career pathway for PhDs) along with
MD and MD/PhD physician-scientists, and also one of the few postdoctoral hematology T32s that includes
bioengineering and PhD degree tracks for MD-onlies, this program fills an important research training need
both at Yale and nationally."

The discovery and development of new methods for the efficient synthesis of N-containing and F-containing
chemical building blocks is an important goal in organic synthesis as a large number of pharmaceuticals and
other bioactive molecules contain these atoms within a diverse set of chemical functional groups. More rapid
and/or selective assembly of known motifs, and moreover the preparation of new chemical landscapes, requires
innovative approaches to drug-like scaffolds, including the discovery of new reagents and new catalysts/catalytic
strategies.
The current goals of this project fall under three main focus areas. 1) We will develop 2-azatrienes, a novel class
of enamine umpolung reagents, for myriad catalytic enantioselective approaches towards chiral amines.
Representative reactions that will be developed include 6,3-, 6,5- and 5,6-hydrofunctionalizations including
reductive couplings with carbonyls and imines, hydroalkynylations, and hydroarylations. Azadienes generated
from 6,5- and 5,6-hydrofunctionalizations of the azatriene reagents may be utilized in myriad downstream
reactions, including other catalytic processes, thereby providing a diastereodivergent avenue towards highly
complex chiral amines through sequential catalysis. 2) We will expand upon our prior work in enantioselective
transformations of 2-azadienes, the first class of enamine umpolung reagents developed in our laboratory.
Examples include reductive couplings with aromatic heterocycles, such as quinoline N-oxides, catalytic
enantioselective fluorofunctionalizations with 4,4-difluoro-2-azadienes, cascade desymmetrization reactions,
and reductive [3+2]-cycloadditions. 3) We will develop catalytic remote C–C and C–B coupling reactions that
result in the loss of a halide from a trifluoromethyl group or H-atom abstraction from a difluoromethyl group to
deliver difluorocarbons in a number of settings. In one case, we will carry out borylation or enantioselective
alkylation of a 3-trifluoromethylpyridine scaffold to yield medicinally important and highly functionalized 3-
(difluoromethyl)pyridines. In another area, we will execute a radical hydrogen atom abstraction of 4-
difluoromethyl-2-azadienes to furnish a difluoro-2-azapentadienyl radical, which then may be engaged in
catalytic cross-couplings to furnish chiral allylic amines bearing a difluoroalkene unit.
Together, these undertakings will enable new chemical space for drug discovery to be obtained readily and with
great diversity from simple reagents. We will access more established N-containing motifs more quickly and with
greater levels of regio/stereocontrol compared to known approaches because of the invention of new reagents
and the novel reactivity that they embody."

who identifies drivers and consequences of gender disparities in health among older adults with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD), blending life course social and health constructs with clinical details
from medical claims. To accomplish this goal, I will complete the following four training objectives that build upon
my prior training in the epidemiology of aging: (1) Understand the complex processes that impact pain and ADRD
among older adults; (2) Learn context of sex/gender and techniques to analyze results by sex and gender, with
a focus on sex and gender differences in pain and ADRD; (3) Develop statistical skills for analyzing Medicare

independent extramurally-funded investigator, by developing mentoring and leadership skills and enhancing
manuscript and, grant applications, and leadership skills. Training in these areas will include coursework,
shadowing interdisciplinary teams in clinical settings, and experiences accessing, managing, and analyzing
Medicare files. My training activities have been integrated with a research project in which I will use data from
the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults in the US, linked

claims data in older adults, by ADRD status; (B) Examine gender disparities in the treatment of chronic pain
among older adults with pain, by ADRD status; and (C) Assess gender disparities in the association of chronic
pain and pain treatment with incident ADRD. The expected findings of this research will provide evidence for
pain and pain treatment as a modifiable risk factor for ADRD and inform potential pain treatment interventions
aimed at reducing the treatment gap between men and women and ultimately reducing the gender disparity in
ADRD burden. Completion of the K01 mentored training and research plans will provide me with the knowledge,
skills, and expertise required to understand disparities among older adults with ADRD, in order to develop a
program of research that blends life course social and health constructs with clinical data, with the goal of
reducing gender disparities among older adults with pain and ADRD."

Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature myeloid cells with potent inhibitory properties for
macrophages and T cells. The link between MDSCs and tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), is supported by work in mice where MDSC recruitment to the lungs correlates with disease
severity, and in humans, where peripheral blood MDSC abundance positively correlates with TB progression.
Work in mice also demonstrates that MDSCs are recruited to sites of BCG vaccination where they phagocytose
bacteria and suppress local T cell activation, suggesting that MDSCs may reduce the effectiveness of anti-TB
vaccination and contribute to TB’s status as a global public health concern. The relationship between MDSCs
and TB has generated interest in targeting them with host-directed therapies to improve TB treatment. Recent
work using tasquinimod (TSQ), an FDA-approved small molecule MDSC inhibitor, in guinea pigs and mice finds
that targeting MDSCs lowers reduces granuloma formation, lowers bacteria loads, and improves the treatment
efficacy of anti-TB drugs. These results are encouraging but critical questions need to be answered before
MDSCs can be safely targeted in human TB. Knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how
MDSCs interact with macrophages in diseased tissue, if MDSCs restrain or promote pathologic inflammation in
TB, how MDSC activity relates to bacterial burden in granulomas, and if MDSCs permit or restrict Mtb replication.
These gaps are particularly acute in human TB where progress is inhibited by the inability to access granulomas
to study MDSCs in situ and fundamental differences between mouse and human TB pathophysiology. Our
proposal addresses these gaps with innovative studies using MDSCs from human cord blood and a nonhuman
primates (NHPs) model that accurately reflects human TB pathophysiology. We hypothesize that MDSCs
suppress macrophage-mediated anti-Mtb activity and are permissive hosts for Mtb and inhibiting their functions
will improve immunity, restrict bacterial persistence, and improve outcomes in TB. In Aim 1, we propose
mechanistic studies investigating relationships between MDSCs, macrophages, and Mtb that influence immunity.
We will determine if cell-free DNA release is a novel MDSC effector that suppresses macrophage function. We
also determine if MDSCs support Mtb as a permissive host cell and define molecular features at the phagosomal
level that contribute to competency for hosting Mtb. In Aim 2, we infect NHPs with mCherry-expressing Mtb and
use TSQ-mediated MDSC inhibition as an intervention to assess how MDSCs regulate lung inflammation,
immunity, and if they host Mtb. Here, we use PET/CT and fluorescence imaging, quantitative microbiology, and
flow cytometry to identify MDSC-regulated correlates of immunity in granulomas. We also define MDSC
transcriptional profiles in scRNAseq and use CosMx spatial molecular imaging to identify how MDSCs regulate
granuloma-level immunity in physiologic and spatial context. These studies address significant questions on
MDSCs-regulated immunity in TB and provide valuable data for future trials targeting MDSCs in TB."
10857266,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the colon. UC has a significant global burden, and is characterized by an aberrant immune response directed towards the gut microbiota. Current treatment options exclusively target host inflammatory pathways and are often ineffective in managing disease. Nearly 1 million individuals in North America are currently living with UC and its prevalence in humans continues to grow worldwide. The considerable number of growing cases, coupled with the lack of an effective therapy, stresses the need for investigation into new therapeutic interventions against UC. Our group recently characterized host-microbiome interactions governing UC through six fecal or serum based –omic datasets from 40 UC patients displaying a wide range of clinical, endoscopic, and histologic disease activity. After broad-scale analyses, the six datasets provided powerful evidence towards a central hypothesis: Bacteroides vulgatus proteases can drive UC disease severity. Metaproteomics pinpointed B. vulgatus proteases as a distinguishing feature of severity. Shotgun metagenomics guided taxonomic inferences and revealed that the B. vulgatus association was driven primarily by protein regulation as opposed to microbial abundances. An abundance of serine protease inhibitors found in the patient serum suggested the importance of proteases. The metapeptidome showed increased peptide fragments correlated with UC disease severity. An independent 210-person cohort validated the strong connection between B. vulgatus proteases and UC disease severity. Testing our hypothesis, we demonstrate B. vulgatus can disrupt intestinal epithelial permeability in vitro, and protease inhibition was sufficient to restore epithelial barrier. Monocolonization of B. vulgatus into germfree IL-10 deficient mice demonstrated colonization induces colitis in these animals and protease inhibition is sufficient to prevent colitis development. Furthermore, transplantation of feces from UC patients with over-abundant B. vulgatus proteases into germ-free mice induced colitis dependent on protease activity (Mills et al., Nature Microbiology 2021). Based on our published work, we have formulated two testable hypotheses to further build on these new findings: 1) proteolysis is a central mechanism utilized by B. vulgatus to induce colitis in vitro and in vivo relevant to UC and 2) B. vulgatus proteases degrade key components of the intestinal barrier. The specific aims of this application are to define the genomic context, roles, and develop specific inhibitors against B. vulgatus proteases in UC (Aim 1), characterize the targets and dynamics of B. vulgatus mediated proteolysis in UC (Aim 2). To complete this proposal, we will use a multifaceted approach of state-of-the-art biochemical, cell culture, bacterial genetics, and in vivo models. Ultimately, this work has the potential to break new ground in UC basic and translational research."

Tau normally regulates microtubules in neurons and glia, however during diseases pathogenesis, several post-
translational modifications cause hyperphosphorylation of this protein which consequently is toxic to the cell.
Primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a common pathology associated with human aging is estimated to effect
1-7 % of the of the population and patients with the disorder can be cognitively normal or exhibit a range of
symptomology including mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Neuropathologically, those with PART have var-
ying degrees neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe, and an absence of amyloid plaques throughout
the brain. Our goal is to deploy three independent approaches to understand how PART has convergent and
divergent features from other primary and secondary tauopathies. The objective is to use novel high-throughput
genetic and transcriptomic technologies combined with innovative computational methods including computer
vision and AI to better characterize drivers of tau phosphorylation in PART. Our hypothesis is that machine
learning classifiers (supervised and unsupervised) combined with single cell analysis will be able to accurately
identify and quantify transcriptomic, genomic, clinical, and morphological features in PART to further understand
the underlying amyloid independent mechanisms of tauopathy. Our rationale is that understanding the genetic
transcriptomic and clinical architecture of PART will assistant in understand disease staging, diagnosis, and
progression. We plan to test our hypothesis by pursing the following significant aims: (1) Quantify neurofibrillary
tangle burden using supervised machine learning models and integrate this data in genetic and clinicopatholog-
ical association studies (2) Model the sequential progression of neurofibrillary tangle degeneration in PART with
unsupervised deep generative approaches. (3) Identify transcriptional alterations associated with neurofibrillary
tangles in PART using single cell RNA sequencing. The proposed research is innovative as it applies novel
transcriptomic and machine learning techniques to identify in an understudied group of elderly subjects with
tauopathy lacking amyloidosis. This proposed research is significant as it addresses a critical unmet need to
develop algorithms which can assist neuropathologists in their post-mortem diagnosis and provide better quan-
titative phenotypic data which can aid in facilitating better neuroprotective strategies. The proposal builds upon
the candidate's established interest in age-related tauopathy and his prior training in biomedical engineering and
translational basic science research. The candidate’s primary mentor, Dr. John Crary, is an experienced neuro-
pathologist and tau neuroscientist and will be supplemented by mentoring team consisting of Dr. Bin Zhang with
specific expertise in computational genetics and transcriptomics and Dr. Thomas Fuchs, a prominent scientist in
the field of computational pathology with a specific expertise in machine learning classifiers, AI, and computer
vision. They will assure that the proposed research and training prepare the applicant to be an independent
investigator in experimental computational neuropathology."
10857268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Calcium influx into the mitochondria can potently stimulate ATP synthesis, but excessive levels cause
mitochondrial failure and cell death. Such calcium overload is a prominent pathological pathway in disease
in multiple organ systems. In the heart, this phenomenon is noted during heart attacks, when prolonged
ischemia causes calcium to accumulate in the cytoplasm and subsequently overload mitochondria. In heart
failure, mitochondrial are also more susceptible to calcium overload. Calcium enters the mitochondria
through a multi-subunit calcium-activated channel known as the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. In animal
models, genetic inhibition of the uniporter has appeared protective in acute disease. In chronic diseases,
though inhibition of calcium overload is protective, there may also be basal requirements for milder
mitochondrial calcium uptake. Currently, however, there are no specific therapies to prevent calcium
overload or its downstream affects. Pharmacological modulation of the uniporter in vivo is limited by agents
that are poorly selective, cell impermeable, or produce off-target effects. A critical gap in the ability to better
modulate the uniporter is our limited understanding of how the pore-forming subunit, MCU, is regulated.
Recent elegant structural studies have revealed the architecture of the uniporter complex, and mechanisms
for calcium selectivity and gating, setting the stage for structure-function investigations of further channel
regulation. In this proposal, the principal investigators apply their complementary skills in structural biology
and mitochondrial functional assays to define pharmacological and protein-based mechanisms for such
channel regulation. First, using a combination of computational, electrophysiological, and structural
approaches, we will investigate uniporter inhibitors that are cell-permeable and specific, and useful for either
acute or chronic injury. Second, using new molecular tools, mutagenesis, and structural biology, we will
identify how the uniporter subunit MCUB leads to inhibition of calcium uptake through the uniporter. Taken
together, our studies will reveal novel forms of uniporter regulation that may be developed into therapies for
cardiovascular and other disorders."
10855441,"Abstract: The histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralogue p300 protein are key
transcriptional co-activators and attractive therapeutic targets for human prostate cancer and other types of
human cancers. Development of highly potent and orally active small-molecule degraders of CBP and p300
proteins represents a promising new therapeutic strategy. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our designed
degraders are highly effective in inducing rapid and complete degradation of both CBP and p300 proteins in
tumor cells at sub-xnanomolar concentrations and >100-times more potent in in inhibition of cell growth than
CBP/p300 inhibitors. Our optimized CBP/p300 degraders achieve excellent pharmacokinetics and oral
bioavailability in mice. Oral administration of our optimized CBP/p300 degrader strongly inhibits tumor growth
in animal models of human cancer at well-tolerated dose-schedules. Collectively, our preliminary data provide
compelling data to support the further evaluation, optimization and development of orally active CBP/p300
degraders as a new anticancer therapy."
10857036,"ABSTRACT: Malignant primary brain tumors represent the most frequent cause of cancer death in children and
young adults and account for more deaths than cancer of the kidney or melanoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is
uniformly lethal, and current therapy is non-specific and produces a median overall survival of <21 months.
Moreover, patients with GBM are plagued by reduced systemic T cell counts, reduction in secondary lymph
organ cellularity, increased mature T cells sequestered in the bone marrow (BM), and dysfunctional antigen
presentation in tumor draining lymph nodes. This combination of BM sequestration of T cells and heterogeneous
antigen expression leads to tumor escape and progression. Dendritic cells (DCs) bearing tumor antigen can be
delivered as a vaccine and migrate to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) to trigger the formation of potent tumor-
specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of eradicating tumor while leaving normal tissue unharmed.
However, despite individual cases of remarkable patient responses to antitumor DC vaccination, overall objective
responses in early phase clinical trials have remained under 15%. We have found that post dendritic cell (DC)
vaccination, both long-term survival and migration of DCs is dependent on the chemokine CCL3. Interestingly,
CCL3 can enhance migration of both exogeneous DC vaccine to lymph nodes and endogenous DCs at the tumor
site. Separately, but concurrently, T cell sequestration to the BM is also reversed with CCL3 administration. Here,
we aim to build on this data preclinically and determine the optimal CCL3 dose for DC migration, determine the
mechanism of CCL3 on T cell sequestration, and determine the efficacy of CCL3 in combination with DC
vaccines on anti-heterogeneous glioma responses. We hypothesize that systemic administration of CCL3 will
increase migration of both exogenous and endogenous DCs and maintain increased levels of activated T cells
systemically and within the TME by eliminating sequestration. This proposal will promote the development of
CCL3 as a novel anti-cancer drug that enhances the potency and diversity of immune responses generated by
DCs will reduce antigen escape and improve the control of diffusely heterogeneous tumors"
10933569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: There is a maternal health crisis in the United States that
disproportionately affects Black birthing people. Black birthing people are two times more likely to experience
severe maternal morbidity (SMM) - “unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant
short- or long-term consequences to a birthing person’s health” – than non-Hispanic White birthing people.
Preventing preeclampsia, increased or maintained engagement in healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity),
and support addressing health-related social needs can enhance receipt of timely, appropriate care and
reduce risk for SMM. The Maternal OutcoMes (MOMs) Program implemented at Northwell Health is an
effective integrated care approach that identifies and supports high-risk birthing people immediately post-
delivery. In preliminary analysis based on data from 2500 participants, the MOMs Program significantly
reduced risk for SMM-related hospital admissions 30-days post-delivery by 77% among Black participants.
These preliminary findings are promising; however, the long-term effectiveness needs to be established as
well as the feasibility and effectiveness of extending the MOMs Program to the prenatal period.
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an integrated care model approach at two different
levels of intensity designed to facilitate timely, appropriate care for high-risk Black birthing people and reduce
risk for SMM. Black birthing people with an Obstetrics-Comorbidity Index Score  3 and/or a history of pre-
eclampsia will be identified via the electronic health record and 674 will be recruited and randomized during
the first trimester to one of two study arms: MOMs High-Touch (MOMs-HT) vs. MOMs Low-Touch (MOMs-
LT). MOMs-HT will consist of close clinical and behavioral health monitoring via chatbot technology and
navigation to timely care and services by the MOMs team throughout the prenatal and postpartum periods;
12 bi-weekly self-management support calls with the MOMs team during the prenatal period; and 4 weekly
postpartum clinical check-in calls with navigation by the MOMs team immediately post-delivery. MOMs-LT
will also include clinical and behavioral health monitoring via the chatbot along with navigation to services by
the MOMs team and 4 weekly postpartum clinical check-in calls with navigation. The two study arms will be
compared on incidence of SMM at labor and delivery (Aim 1), incidence rate of SMM-related hospitalizations
at 1-month and 1-year postpartum (Aim 1a), rate of preeclampsia diagnosis (Aim 2), change in perceived
social support domains (Aim 3), and physical activity trajectories (exploratory Aim 4). Findings from this
study will help to determine how to feasibly implement an effective and sustainable integrated care approach
to address SMM disparities."
10932986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest food security program for lower-income
households in the U.S., providing financial benefits for grocery purchases to nearly 42 million people (1 in 8).
SNAP benefit amounts increased substantially starting in March 2020, most of which was driven by temporary
emergency allotments (i.e., supplemental benefits), to bolster food security in response to the COVID-19
pandemic and to ensure participants could afford a healthy diet. These emergency benefits expired across all
states in March 2023, a policy that is estimated to have reduced benefits by an average of $175 per household,
a ~33% decline. The sudden end of SNAP emergency allotments represents the largest-ever universal reduction
in SNAP benefits and could have a major impact on households’ food purchases and their subsequent health.
However, this has not been investigated to date. This study will make a significant contribution by evaluating the
impact of the expiration of SNAP emergency allotments on participants’ food purchase quality overall, among
historically underserved groups with worse food access and pre-pandemic inequities in nutrition-related chronic
disease, and in the context of concurrent economic, social, community, and retail factors. We will use a mixed-
methods approach that combines a natural experiment of household purchases with qualitative interviews of
SNAP participants and those working in the larger food system. In Aim 1, we will analyze longitudinal, loyalty-
linked sales data on >440,000 customers of a large Northeast supermarket chain who made purchases from
November 2021-February 2023 (16 months before the end of SNAP emergency allotments). We will use
controlled interrupted time series (CITS), a quasi-experimental method, to estimate the effect of the end of SNAP
emergency allotments on several indices of food purchase quality from April 2023-March 2024 (12 months after
the end of allotments) among SNAP-participating households (intervention) vs. non-participating households
(control). In Aim 2, we will enroll a cohort of 2,500 lower-income shoppers who shop at the chain and whose
purchases can be identified by loyalty number. We will assess household-level data via online surveys and use
CITS to examine associations between the end of SNAP emergency allotments and supermarket food purchase
quality by rurality, race/ethnicity, and economic stability. In Aim 3, we will explore individual-level factors (e.g.,
use of other assistance programs, cooking norms, food preferences) by conducting semi-structured qualitative
interviews among 45-75 participants from the cohort in Aim 2 who participate in SNAP and represent rural, Black,
and Hispanic demographic segments of the study population. We will explore system-level factors (e.g., food
availability, supply chains, pandemic era SNAP policy rollout) via interviews with representatives from SNAP
implementing agencies, supermarket retailers, and food pantries from within each of the communities of interest.
This research will generate timely, rigorous evidence on the nutritional impact of this substantial change to SNAP
benefits, which will be useful to policymakers to help guide future program changes."
10835942,"Project Summary
 The incorporation of chiral, stereogenic centers in small molecule drug candidates is statistically linked to
success in clinical trials. In order to design more structurally complex bioactive compounds, chemists must rely
on efficient synthetic tools. The objective of this proposal is to develop novel modes of reactivity that deliver
molecules containing carbon and silicon chiral, stereogenic centers inaccessible through existing methods.
Specifically, this proposal outlines a novel application of asymmetric ion-pairing catalysis to hypervalent silicate
/ chloride ion pairs, engaging hypervalent chlorosilanes with dual hydrogen-bond donor catalysts via an anion-
binding mechanism. Mechanistic studies of hypervalent chlorosilanes have established that ionization of the
silicon-chloride bond is relevant to many transformations involving organosilanes in the presence of nucleophilic
or Lewis basic additives. Despite this evidence, these reactive ion pairs have not been used as handles in the
design of asymmetric transformations. Using dual hydrogen-bond donors to catalyze anion binding from
hypervalent silicon will be explored in two orthogonal approaches based on shared mechanistic principles. The
first approach establishes Lewis acid / hydrogen-bond donor co-catalysis utilizing cationic hypervalent silicates
as highly electrophilic Lewis acid catalysts through the design of a tailored bifunctional hydrogen-bond donor
catalyst. This cooperative catalytic approach will be applied to an asymmetric Passerini two-component reaction
(P-2CR), generating alpha-hydroxy amides, prominent motifs in bioactive molecules. Asymmetric induction
through cooperative non-covalent interactions between the silicate-electrophile / chloride-catalyst ion pair is
expected to result in high enantioselectivities across a wide substrate scope. If successful, this approach to
Lewis acid / HBD co-catalysis provides a new and potentially general approach to enantioselective additions to
carbonyl compounds. The second application will apply anion-binding catalysis to the enantioselective synthesis
of silicon-stereogenic alkoxyorganosilanes. Few catalytic methods exist to access enantioenriched
alkoxyorganosilanes, which have significant, yet underexplored, roles in drug discovery. Kinetic studies and
computational evaluation of putative reactive intermediates will help build a comprehensive mechanistic
understanding of these reactions, guiding further application of this novel anion-binding approach to additional
transformations. It is expected that these methods will aid chemists in the design and synthesis of small molecule
drugs and tool compounds that positively impact human health."

Many students enter college with an interest in studying science, but ultimately pursue other
majors. Others graduate with a science major, but fail to enter or remain in the biomedical
workforce. The many pathways out of science contribute to shortages in the biomedical
workforce, particularly among women, underrepresented minorities (URMs), and first-generation
(FG) college students. What is often missing in the study of persistence in biomedical fields is a
consideration of the psychological mechanisms involved in persistence and an understanding of
how to design experiences or institutional supports around such mechanisms. My research
program addresses this gap by examining persistence in the biomedical fields using a
psychological lens, with a focus on motivational trajectories and contextual supports.
Over the next 5 years, I will focus on two key open questions: (1) What developmental patterns
of motivational beliefs are adaptive for persistence in biomedical career pathways and do
adaptive patterns vary across individuals with different characteristics (e.g., URM, FG,
Gender)?, and (2) How can we improve contextual supports during college, focusing on
motivational beliefs as a mediating mechanism, in order to retain more individuals on biomedical
career pathways, especially those from underrepresented groups? This MIRA application aims
to leverage and extend my extensive multi-site, multi-method longitudinal research by
continuing quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data collection as research participants reach
the next phases in their career pathways (immediately after college and >5 years after college)
from two unique university samples: (1) large, land-grant public university (Michigan State
University, N = 1735; 57% Female; 11% URM; 12% FG) and (2) elite, private university (Duke,
N = 2546; 54% Female; 19% URM; 9% FG). Additionally, to extend the generalizability of these
findings to a third unique university context and to flexibly pursue research questions based on
findings from the original cohorts, data collection will be extended to Old Dominion University, a
public, minority-serving institution (41% URM, 28% FG). Finally, an alternative approach for
addressing persistence in biomedical fields will be pursued, namely examining how training
future faculty to support student motivation and engagement in the context of enriched curricular
opportunities relates to their later approaches to supporting student motivation and
engagement. IMPACT: This on-going research program will provide key insights into the types
of contextual supports and psychological mechanisms that are needed to encourage
persistence in biomedical science careers, especially among women, URMs, and FGs."
10835953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the US. Despite
guidelines promoting aggressive anti-atherosclerotic therapies, there is »5%/year residual ASCVD risk in
patients who achieve profound LDL-C lowering (median 30 mg/dL) with combined statin and PCSK9 inhibitor
therapy. New treatment strategies are needed to target the mechanisms beyond LDL to reduce this residual
risk. Histologic studies have demonstrated that plaque neovasculature constitutes the main entrance for
inflammatory cells into plaques and provides a major source for the formation and progression of intraplaque
hemorrhage (IPH). IPH, mainly resulting from plaque neovascularization, is a common feature of advanced
atherosclerotic lesions and a critical element leading to accelerated plaque progression, plaque instability and
ischemic vascular events in humans. We found that plaque neovessel permeability (measured as Ktrans, using
dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging) is strongly correlated with macrophage content and
that greater adventitial Ktrans is associated with IPH. Recent studies have identified that CD163+ macrophages
are associated with IPH and can further promote neovascularization leading to IPH progression. On the other
hand, B1 cell-derived IgM can inhibit inflammation and reduce atherosclerosis, and circulating human B1 cells
are inversely associated with coronary plaque volume and instability features. Our preliminary data showed
that plasma IgM levels are reduced in patients with carotid IPH and B1 cells are inversely associated with IPH
progression. We, therefore, propose to study the role of B1 cell-derived IgM and B1 cells in IPH pathology.
 To test a novel hypothesis that B1 cell-derived IgM levels are reduced in patients with IPH and that
the reduction in protective IgMs results in unobstructed IPH-promoted inflammation and neovessel
permeability, thereby exacerbating plaque progression, we propose to conduct comprehensive studies
including: (1) histological examination of CEA specimens to determine whether plaques with increased Ktrans
and/or IPH have a lower density of IgM and a higher density of CD163+ macrophages; (2) a longitudinal clinical
follow-up study in 250 patients to determine whether lower IgM levels and B1 cells predict progression of Ktrans
and IPH and whether IgM production and effect on macrophages are different in B1 cells in patients with and
without IPH; (3) in vitro mechanistic studies of endothelial sprouting and leakiness using 3D microvessels to
determine the effects of IgM and B1 cells on RBC-induced changes in macrophages and vascular permeability.
 This proposal utilizes state-of-the-art imaging technique for quantification of vascular permeability and IPH
and 3D microvessels for study how hemoglobin-stimulated macrophages and B1 cells and/or IgM influence
endothelial function related vascular permeability. Our study will gain new knowledge to uncover inflammatory
mechanisms in IPH pathogenesis and to discover potential therapeutic targets with a goal of reduced vascular
permeability to prevent IPH and its progression, which will ultimately reduce residual ASCVD risk."

The NIOSH Training Program Grants (TPG) support occupational health programs to meet the
growing need for skilled occupational health providers and for health care for the workforce. The
Meharry Medical College Occupational Medicine residency program has been a proud recipient
of three NIOSH TPGs since 2008. In that time, the program has accomplished all of its goals
and has enabled high quality specialized training for a diverse group of over 40 physicians
practicing in a multitude of occupational medicine focus areas. Our graduates serve as local,
regional, and national leaders in major corporations, government, academia, industry, and
private practice. Meharry is the principal producer of minority occupational medicine physicians,
ensuring that as the diversity of the workforce grows, so will the population of providers who
deliver the services needed for their care.
Funding from the current proposal will enable us to continue to offer a structurally superior
curriculum that will consolidate gains made from our `Total Worker Health' strategy via first-rate
learning experiences in clinical, research and service settings. The curriculum enhancement
and innovation will be inclusive of opportunities to affect positive changes in safety and health of
all workers, within and outside the workplace, including a focus on mental health and preventing
burnout among employees. Residents will participate in a newly developed rotation with the
Health and Wellness/Employee Assistance Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
that will help us build residents' knowledge and skills in employee mental health and wellbeing.
As well as enhance their participation in Prevention Leadership Advocacy Rotation. Residents
will be able to collaborate with other trainees or other occupational safety and health
professionals related to disparities in vulnerable worker populations. Residents will be
encouraged to focus on work-related health concerns as outlined in Healthy People 2030.
Continued support from NIOSH will enable us to train at least 2 residents per year, one from
each level of training, over the funding cycle, and will allow us to offer a wide array of
opportunities that will enhance residents' training and professional development. While the
residency has been able to train up to 6 residents per year over the last 8 years, all trainees
selected will be included in the training opportunities as outlined. Support from this funding will
be adjusted to provide support equally across trainees based on available award and trainee
level. We will continue to select high quality candidates of diverse backgrounds, who have a
passion for service of underserved populations, and will become productive members of the
profession.
Additionally, this NIOSH funding opportunity along with other grant support will allow for the
Occupational Medicine residency to confidently request an increase in trainee complement to up
to eight residents per year. This increase will serve to improve the growing concern of a dearth
of occupational medicine trained physicians that are entering into the workforce and ready to
meet the intensifying demand of employers and employees globally."
10854798,"Chronic pain is one of the most extensive health care issues facing our society with “severe impacts on all
aspects of the lives of its sufferers.” Pain predominant chronic multisymptom illness (Pain-CMI, e.g.,
fibromyalgia) is a particularly debilitating and treatment resistant chronic pain condition and a presumptive
service connected condition for Veterans who deployed to the Gulf region from 1990-2021. The VA/DoD
Guidelines recommend non-pharmaceutical treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) for Pain-CMI and
find evidence they improve disability (typically) by targeting the mechanisms underlying Pain-CMI (e.g., low
perceived pain control, catastrophizing and limiting activity). While no single treatment is (or is likely to be)
acceptable, available and efficacious for all Veterans, having a wide array of treatment options facilitates
Veterans’ uptake of non-pharmaceutical approaches. Health coaching is an appealing potential approach to
improve the disability of Pain-CMI because it has high acceptability and it will be widely available as the VA is
rolling out health coaching for other conditions (high availability). The goal of this proposal is to understand if
health coaching is also efficacious for complex pain condition, Pain-CMI. Health coaching has high
acceptability because it addresses what experts, clinicians and patients agree is a driver of low satisfaction and
adherence - disagreement between the patient and providers about the cause of and best approaches for
Pain-CMI. In health coaching, the health coach elicits the Veteran’s beliefs and uses these to develop a shared
understanding of Pain-CMI. The health coach then identifies discrepancies between where in life the Veteran is
and where the Veteran wants to be. Motivational interviewing, goal setting and problem-solving are used to
help the Veteran reduce these discrepancies. The goal of the current proposal is to conduct a randomized
clinical trial to determine the efficacy of remote-delivered health coaching to reduce the disability and pain
impairment for Veterans with Pain-CMI as compared to supportive psychotherapy (n=250), and to explore
mechanisms of change. The VA has already rolled out whole health coaching approaches for other conditions.
Thus, if found to be efficacious, our health coaching intervention can be taught to VA whole health coaches
and providers nationally. This would increase access to care for Veterans with Pain-CMI. The VA WRIISC,28
which is mandated by Congress to provide leadership and expertise in CMI, is closely following our efforts to
guide their decisions and potential national implementation of health coaching for Pain-CMI. There is a
desperate need for empirical data to guide these decisions."

Decades of treatment studies demonstrate that youth with significant behavioral health needs make more
progress when their treatment planning is informed by ongoing quantitative data collection (e.g., by changing
treatment strategies, increasing therapy hours, and adding services), however, aides often do not collect high
quality data consistent with evidence-based practice. Measurement feedback systems (MFS), originally
developed to support data collection and inform treatment decisions in outpatient therapy as part of
measurement based care, may be an ideal starting point from which to improve aides' data collection; however,
MFS have not been applied and tested in this setting. Our application, Footsteps, comprises a low-cost MFS and
implementation strategy to support electronic data collection and target implementation mechanisms – aides'
intentions, attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy – associated with data collection to optimize clinical care. Footsteps
was developed in partnership with community behavioral health agencies, guided by behavioral economics
principles, user-centered design, and a conceptual model that integrates the science of behavior change with
organizational theory. Footsteps integrates digital data collection in a customizable, server-based, native app
with tools for supervisors to review data and provide feedback, and behavioral-economics informed features,
such as gamification, leaderboards, employee of the week emails, targeted reminders, celebratory/encouraging
messages, and in-app data collection tutorials, to increase motivation to collect data. As part of our Penn
ALACRITY Center (P50 MH127511), we conducted a pilot RCT in which we compared Footsteps with a data-
collection-only app in a pilot trial. We found that Footsteps was acceptable to aides and feasible to use, and that
it engaged our target mechanisms of attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, and motivation. We now are ready to test
the app in a fully powered trial. Our formative work also raised three key questions: a) which behavioral strategies
are most effective for increasing data collection; b) does Footsteps alter supervision processes; and c) does
Footsteps ultimately improve youth outcomes? We propose a randomized, hybrid type 2 effectiveness-
implementation pragmatic mixed-methods trial in which we enroll 150 aides and 30 supervisors. Specifically, we
propose to: (Aim 1) examine whether Footsteps improves data collection quality and youth outcomes in an RCT
on Footsteps vs. a “data collection only” application; (Aim 2) explore mediators of data collection quality,
specifically changes in aides' intentions, norms, attitudes, and self-efficacy regarding data collection via biweekly
surveys and interviews; (Aim 3) examine the impact of Footsteps on supervisory processes, team
communication, and changes to child treatment plans via interviews and biweekly surveys with 30 supervisors
and a subsample of 30 aides. The proposed study would be one of the first studies to examine the effect of
theory-informed behavior change mechanisms on data collection in behavioral health care and will advance the
science of digital health as a support to practitioners in implementing behavioral health programs."

mRNA translation, or protein synthesis, is a fundamental cellular process that can be dysregulated in several
human diseases. Macrophages are heterogeneous populations that are present in most tissues and adopt
tissue specific functions. The role of mRNA translational control in macrophages and in regards to their tissue
specific functions is not well understood. The broad goal of the proposed studies is to understand how
dysregulation of mRNA translation controls tissue-resident macrophage function during stress. The specific
goals of this study are to identify how GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2)-dependent translational
control in macrophages affects macrophage function in RBC production and clearance and to uncover the
genes mediating this effect. The GCN2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that belongs to a signaling network
that coordinates cellular response to nutrient stress through translational regulator eIF2 (Eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2). GCN2 senses amino acid levels and phosphorylates eIF2 in response to amino acid
deficiency. p-eIF2 inhibits global mRNA translation but paradoxically stimulates the translation of a subset of
key stress-response genes such as ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4). Upregulation of stress-response
genes in response to GCN2/eIF2 signaling activates a transcription program that helps the cells to overcome
unfavorable conditions or undergo apoptosis. GCN2 function has been previously linked to important
physiological and pathological conditions such as memory formation, cancer and inflammatory diseases.
However, the role of GCN2 in regulating tissue-resident macrophages and their functions in RBC production
and clearance has not been characterized. Our current model suggests that GCN2 controls RBC production
and clearance during stress through regulation of mRNA translation in macrophages. Therefore, we propose
the following aims to achieve our goals: First we will determine the importance of GCN2 in RBC clearance by
macrophages (Aim 1) and define molecular mechanisms through which GCN2 impact this process. Next, we
will elucidate how GCN2 controls RBC maturation and production by macrophages (Aim 2). Finally, we will
examine how mechanical force sense by macrophage through GCN2 (Aim 3). To achieve these goals we will
use transgenic mice lacking GCN2 or carrying phospho-resistant eIF2 in macrophages and state-of-art
technology to study mRNA translation at genome-wide level. Our mouse models and in vivo and in vitro
experiments will rigorously assess the central role of macrophages in development of GCN2-dependent
defects during stress. Our genome-wide approach and in vitro functional analysis of selected targets will
discover novel translationally regulated genes downstream of GCN2 that play important roles in macrophage
regulation of RBC production during stress."

 We plan to explore the functional topography of electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a
central brain region that controls cortical attention to the sensory surround by gating thalamocortical
interactions. During slow-wave of sleep and absence epilepsy, the brain is unresponsive to sensory input; the
TRN is thought to focus this neural “searchlight” of attention, and to generate the rhythms that appear as
spindles during sleep and sharp-wave discharges in epilepsy. Neuronal communication in the TRN is
dominated by the electrical synapses that are formed by connexin36 gap junctions amongst its GABAergic
neurons. Our best understanding of electrical synapses is limited by current techniques to pairs of neurons and
a single electrical synapse. Here, we will leverage modern optogenetic and focal photostimulation techniques
to map electrically coupled networks in molecularly defined populations of GABAergic neurons of the live TRN.
Our central hypothesis is that the electrically coupled networks within the TRN link neurons across molecular
identity, sensory modality and higher-order and primary relay channels, and thereby regulate thalamocortical
transmission. We will test the hypothesis that activity-dependent electrical synaptic depression, which is
induced by bursting patterns that are prominent during slow-wave sleep, is global for all synaptic coupling to a
strongly bursting neuron, due to its dependence on pan-neuronal T currents. Finally, we will model and
experimentally validate how plastic electrically coupled networks finely control the inhibition that TRN neurons
deliver to thalamocortical relay cells, and thereby gate thalamocortical communication. Because these
synapses are both widespread and underappreciated for their power throughout the mammalian brain, it is
crucial to understand the molecular and functional topography and the dynamics of their networks. The
significance of this proposal lies in its potential to, for the first time, identify and characterize electrically
coupled networks in vitro, both in the TRN and eventually, throughout the brain. This research will make great
strides in our understanding of the physiological function and plasticity of electrical synapses, and provide
insight into how the TRN controls thalamocortical information processing."

substantial prevalence, morbidity and mortality. In Uganda, prevalence estimates for Sm and HBV are 25% and
10%, respectively. Sm infection biases immunological responses towards Th2 and regulatory patterns which
could potentially result in significant immune interactions at various stages of HBV infection. However, limited
data address the clinical or immunological impact of Sm and HBV coinfection. Proposed is a clinical and
mechanistic investigation to characterize the nature and magnitude of impact from Sm infection on the course of
chronic HBV. Led by Ugandan investigators proficient in leading high-level research on viral hepatitis and
Schistosomiases epidemiology and immunology, this study builds on long-standing collaborative work between
Ugandan, US, and UK investigators and leverages substantive in-country research infrastructure and expertise.
In Aim 1, we characterize the course of Sm infection in chronic HBV patients utilizing both novel and standard
assays for diagnosing Sm, while concurrently establishing a cohort of individuals for longer-term investigation.
In Aim 2, we systematically evaluate HBV serology, virology and clinical measures of disease (e.g., Fibroscan,
ultrasound) at study entry compared to six months post praziquantel treatment, and then over up to three years
of follow-up. In Aim 3, we explore focused immunological studies comparing liver biopsy to peripheral blood
samples to evaluate potential mechanisms by which Sm and HBV interaction may occur. These studies support
technology transfer of a novel, highly sensitive Sm assay as well as directly support the career development of
several early-stage Ugandan investigators. Findings from the proposed studies will provide novel insight for
improving the clinical management and mechanistic understanding of Sm and HBV coinfection, with implications
for many regions of Africa with co-occurring endemics of these two infections."
10831057,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Circadian clocks play fundamental roles in regulating essential cellular and physiological processes. The
mammalian clock is comprised of cell-autonomous oscillators orchestrated by the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to perform tissue and systemic functions. More than a dozen core components
of the oscillator have been identified; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding regulatory
mechanisms/components and tissue-specific functions in the clock system. My previous research has provided
important insights into mammalian circadian rhythms. For example, I generated Per2::Luc reporter mice which
proved to be a powerful reagent ubiquitously employed in the clock field. We recently reported a second-
generation reporter mouse line, Per2::LucSV, and demonstrated a novel miRNA regulation of PER2
accumulation and a positive role of PER2 in its own transcription. Most relevant to the current MIRA
application, I have been interested in combining mouse forward genetic screening and mechanistic studies to
probe fundamental clock functions. Previously we reported the identification by mouse screening and
mechanistic dissection of two antagonistic E3 ligase, FBXL3 and FBXL21 in circadian period regulation. More
recently, we uncovered a GSK-3beta-FBXL21 regulatory cascade controlling rhythmic degradation of the
sarcomere protein TCAP and skeletal muscle function. Building on these prior studies, the current proposal
aims to determine tissue-specific circadian mechanisms of FBXL21 and to identify novel clock components
from a streamlined mouse screening. We will examine new targets and functions of FBXL21 in striated
muscles including skeletal and cardiac muscles, focusing on proteostasis and myogenic differentiation.
Leveraging expertise in mouse forward genetic screening, I recently performed a genetic screening for
dominant phenotypes using an efficient breeding/phenotyping scheme. Whole-exome sequencing and variant
analysis pinpointed a novel circadian mutant line with a lengthened circadian wheel-running period and age-
dependent neurodegeneration. We will identify this new genetic component of the clock and characterize the
underlying regulatory mechanisms. Overall, these studies promise to discover important mechanisms and
functions of circadian rhythms in mammals. I have established an integrative research capability combining
mouse genetics and phenotyping, biochemical/molecular/cellular studies, imaging methodologies, and omics
platforms, complemented by expertise from a broad network of collaborators. These together form an excellent
foundation for the proposed research. The ultimate goal is to understand how biological timing governs bodily
function and what we can do to safeguard our health by optimizing our natural clock."

This R35 proposal is designed to consolidate two R01 programs, ES005703 and ES020668 into one
program with an emphasis on understanding how environment influences human health through the PAS
sensor family of proteins. Our approach is to use a highly experienced team, a broad spectrum of
biochemical and genetic reagents, a transdisciplinary approach, and the expertise of an array of
collaborators and clinician scientists to define the roles that PAS sensors play in environmentally influenced
disease states such as cancer, infertility, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Our
overarching idea is that PAS sensors, and their related environmental signals, are impinging on almost
every aspect of human health through their capacity as sensors of circadian time, oxygen status, chemical
exposure and microbiome changes. We propose that by understanding these pathways, we can not only
identify important gene by environment, and environment by environment interactions, but that we can use
this information to develop intervention strategies in numerous environmental scenarios likely to be causing
human morbidity. Our vision is to understand these pathways through the prism of the Ah receptor (AHR)
and through the overarching idea that these pathways are in fact interacting through shared partners,
cofactors or ligands. We propose that the insights gained from the R35 will ultimately be useful in
intervention strategies to manipulate these pathways via therapeutics or to guide/modify human behavior or
the human environment in a manner that is most beneficial to sensitive populations. Over the next eight
years, this consolidated R35 should give us the freedom and power to make considerable advances in our
understanding of PAS sensors and how they influence human health."

Free radicals are more than toxic by-products of metabolism. Many cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) using specialized enzymes, NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and nitric oxide
synthases (NOSs) respectively, for specific functions. For instance, innate immune cells produce RONS in large
amounts during inflammation, and endothelial cells and neurons can produce them for signaling. RONS
production is an important part of many physiological processes as well as numerous diseases, including
inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, etc. We propose to investigate how NOX-
and NOS-dependent RONS production is coupled to substantial remodeling of cellular metabolism. Specifically,
we will address two key questions: (1) How is cellular metabolism remodeled to enable RONS production? Both
NOXs and NOSs require NADPH as the electron donor to drive the reactions. Thus, activation of NOX or NOS
greatly increases cellular NADPH demand and can significantly lower NADPH/NADP+ redox ratio. We recently
discovered that in activated neutrophils, NOX activation is quantitatively coupled to the metabolic shift from
glycolysis to cyclic pentose phosphate pathway (a unique mode for glucose metabolism with ultra-high NADPH
yield) to meet this demand. We propose to investigate the molecular mechanism allowing neutrophils to complete
such substantial metabolic switch in a very short time, which is essential for them to immediately mount the first
line of innate immune defense. We will next reveal the metabolic strategies other cells use to power up RONS
production using approaches including isotopic-tracing based metabolic flux analysis and genetic manipulation.
(2) How does the increase in RNS regulates cellular metabolism? It is well known that RONS can impact cell
functions through protein cysteine oxidation or nitrosylation. Intriguingly, we recently found that the inducible
RNS production in activated macrophages drives dynamic metabolic remodeling via a novel mechanism: RNS
specifically and efficiently inactivate two crucial mitochondrial enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase and
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, via covalent modifications of the catalytic lipoic arm in their E2 subunits. We seek
to understand of the biochemical mechanisms for such RNS-driven regulation in-depth, specifically, (i) elucidate
the role of coenzyme A, the thiol-containing substrate for these enzymes, in delivering NO- mediated
modifications specifically onto the catalytic lipoic moiety; (ii) examine the mechanistic link between such lipoic
modifications with the cysteine nitrosylation on their E3 subunit; (iii) examine the reversibility of such RNS-
mediated modifications of lipoic arm and the mechanism driving the recovery. We will further investigate how
this mechanism regulates other lipoic arm dependent- enzymes, and elucidate the downstream effects of such
regulation in cellular physiology in various RNS-producing cells (e.g. regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by
NO can modulate histone acetylation and downstream cell functions by changing acetyl-coA availability)."

The initial health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been unequal across social groups, and disparities
in the economic impact of COVID-19 have amplified existing economic inequalities and health gaps. When faced
with health and economic challenges, Americans often rely on family members, including those who are not
coresident, to provide time help, financial assistance, and shared housing. Yet, for many disadvantaged
Americans, the increased need for help from family comes at a time when the ability of family to provide help is
diminished. Public transfers designed to alleviate economic hardships of the pandemic may interact with family
transfers, but the combined effects are unknown. Despite the interdependence of health and economic
challenges across generations and the effect of family support on health outcomes in the face of challenges,
most research on pandemic effects focuses on individuals and households. This project fills this gap in the
research creating a multidimensional contextual database linked to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the effects of the pandemic across generations of
American families. The HRS and PSID have collected data on the health and well-being of individuals and their
family members for decades, include supplements on COVID-19 health and economic challenges and on public
and private transfers to combat these challenges, and will continue indefinitely to support an understanding of
the health impacts during and in the years following the pandemic. This project enhances these data by building
a contextual database on the pandemic linkable to the generations of families in the HRS and PSID across
dimensions of exposure to risk; state, local, and school policies; local economic conditions; health care
availability; preexisting health factors; and structural inequalities. The proposed project addresses four Aims: (1)
build and maintain a multidimensional contextual database linked to generations of HRS and PSID families; (2)
describe how pandemic-related health and economic challenges differed across groups and were shared within
families; (3) assess how care, financial support, and coresidence from family members responded to pandemic-
related health and economic challenges and how each interacted with public transfer programs; and (4) study
the physical and mental health effects in the immediate aftermath and the years following the pandemic and
whether family support and public transfers mitigated negative health effects. Disparities across race-ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, gender, age and retirement status, and family structure are assessed in each aim. Causal
effects of the impact of the pandemic will be estimated using a combination of subjective assessments elicited
from respondents and analytic strategies. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the health and
economic challenges the pandemic posed to American families and how it impacted their physical and mental
health. Consortium collaborations will facilitate harmonization of contextual factors and health outcomes and
support dissemination of the contextual data resource to the broader research community."

This proposal aims to develop an eXtended Modular ANthropomorphic (XMAN) digital phantom to simulate
realistic patient images with both population-based and individualized motions to establish effective motion
management in liver cancer radiotherapy (RT). With over 70% of liver cancer patients surgically unresectable,
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become an essential non-invasive alternative treatment.
However, despite its promise, liver SBRT has a local failure rate of over 20% at 2-3 years, grade 3+ toxicity
over 20%, and resulted in deaths for over 10% of cirrhotic patients. Previous studies demonstrated strong
associations between the treatment outcome and the RT delivery accuracy. Accuracy of liver SBRT is severely
impaired by patient motion, such as breathing and daily motions. Current practice uses a large planning target
volume (PTV) margin of 5-10mm to account for patient motion, which leads to increased dose to normal
tissues increasing the toxicity and limiting dose escalation to increase tumor control. Lack of effective motion
management is a key barrier to improving outcomes in liver SBRT. Several challenges exist for establishing
effective motion management: (1) Lack of ground-truth (GT) for evaluation. Liver SBRT is mostly guided by
cone-beam CT (CBCT), which has limited tumor visibility. Thus, no GT tumor volume can be defined in CBCT
to evaluate the treatment errors. (2) Lack of effective optimization tools: In patient data, various factors
affecting motion management compound one another and cannot be separated to be optimized individually. (3)
Lack of individualized strategy. The current population-based approach is far from optimal for individual
patients. Digital simulation provides GT images and motion patterns, effective tools for optimization with well-
controlled parameters, and the possibility for patient-specific simulation. However, current phantoms lack
realistic simulation of imaging and motions as well as patient-specific simulation. We will address these
limitations by pursuing the following aims: Aim 1: Establish generic XMAN to simulate patient imaging and
motions in the entire RT workflow. Aim 2: Establish Patient-specific Adaptive XMAN (PAXMAN) to customize
motion management. Aim 3: Translate and apply XMAN and PAXMAN in RT to validate their clinical impact.
The hypothesis is that PTV margin can be reduced to 3-5 mm while ensuring tumor coverage and minimizing
normal tissue dose using XMAN. Deliverables: This project will deliver a suite of XMAN phantoms, the first of
their kind, to simulate realistic patient images and motions in the entire RT workflow, providing essential tools
to evaluate and optimize motion management. PAXMAN unlocks the potential to move from population-based
heuristic approaches into high-precision patient-specific motion management. Our multi-institution and industry
partners have a strong track record of collaboration, ensuring the success of this grant. Overall, XMAN can
lead to a paradigm shift in liver SBRT motion management to significantly advance its precision and outcome."

the Lunaphore COMET, to this well-established core facility. HIMSR is substantially supported by the University
of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC, P30 CA046934) and the Colorado Head and Neck Cancer SPORE
(P50CA261605). Current multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) tissue imaging instruments include the Akoya
Vectra 3.0, the Akoya Vectra Polaris, and the Ionpath Multiplex Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) system (low-
throughput, 40-marker mass spectrometry imaging in regions of interest). HIMSR is the only core lab in the state
of Colorado that offers multiplex tissue imaging and specializes in the development of customized high-
parameter panels. HIMSR supports a consistently growing number of investigators, approximately 100 per year,
65% of which utilize mIHC instruments. The rationale for adding additional high-parameter imaging capability is
that many investigators need affordable hyperplexing options, however the capacity of HIMSR's existing high-
parameter MIBI platform is maximized with no available AUT for innovation or new assay development. The
Lunaphore COMET instrument utilizes commercially available label-free primary antibodies in a serial staining,
imaging, and elution approach that is flexible to each investigator's needs. It maximizes throughput with walk-
away automation and preserves tissues and epitopes with unparalleled integrity and stability using innovative
microfluidics, making it possible for investigators to perform whole genome RNA-based analyses of the same
tissues in downstream transcriptomics assays. The Lunaphore COMET offers whole-tissue imaging with a
virtually unlimited hyperplex capability and generates OME-TIFF image files that can be analyzed with either
open-source or commercially available image analysis packages. Interest in high parameter tissue imaging and
the need for additional instrumentation is driven by a strong group of NIH-funded principal investigators with 23
active NIH-funded grants in the areas of oncology, dermatology, hepatology, nephrology, and hematology. The
estimated need for the 12 Major Users is approximately 81% accessible user time. The HIMSR team is highly
qualified to develop new assays and operate the Lunaphore COMET instrument, composed of a master's level
histologist, a Ph.D. level image analyst, a certified histotech, and three research assistants. The PI (Dr. Kimberly
Jordan) has over 7 years of experience in developing, optimizing, and analyzing multiplex IHC tissue imaging
data, has collaborated on many NIH-funded R01 projects utilizing these technologies and expertise, and
authored 50 peer-reviewed publications in immunology. HIMSR's expertise in developing custom mIHC assays
is nationally recognized with a strong track record of providing robust and quantifiable images of tissue
microenvironments. There is a well-established financial and administrative infrastructure in place to support the
Lunaphore COMET in HIMSR with strong leadership and institutional support."

Glucose homeostasis plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes, and impaired or altered glucose
metabolism is associated with a wide range of pathological states. A key step in glucose metabolism is catalyzed
by the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. Proliferating cells almost universally express the pyruvate kinase M2
(PKM2) isoform, which can assume either an active or inactive state. PKM2 is at the nexus of cellular metabolism,
and determines whether cells metabolize glucose into ATP or use it to make more of the necessary building
blocks for cell division. Multiple studies have demonstrated how dynamic changes in PKM2 expression contribute
to altered glucose metabolism in different contexts. The ability to non-invasively visualize and track dynamic
changes in PKM2 expression will enable improved understanding of altered glucose metabolism and the
downstream mediators of glycolysis in multiple disease states. The lack of PKM2 expression within the brain and
myocardium make this imaging strategy highly promising for neurological and cardiovascular applications.
We have recently reported the development and human translation of [18F]DASA-23, the first clinically-relevant
and specific radiopharmaceutical to detect, localize, and quantify PKM2 using positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging. We have determined the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and brain distribution of [18F]DASA-
23 in healthy volunteers, and have explored its ability to visualize PKM2 expression in one potential application
of patients with primary brain tumors. Although our results highlight the potential of imaging PKM2, [18F]DASA-
23 has several limitations that impedes widespread use, and the ability to study PKM2-mediated glycolytic
reprogramming in broader applications. This includes high radiation dose to the gallbladder wall, a high degree
of non-specific binding within white matter in the brain, and poor solubility in radiotracer formulation vehicle.
This proposal will develop novel PKM2 radiotracers to overcome the limitations of [18F]DASA-23. Development
of a safe and reliable PKM2 radiotracer will enable repeat assessment of the dynamic alterations in glucose
metabolism in multiple different applications and patient populations. We will establish the synthesis and fluorine-
18 radiolabeling of two candidate small molecules with improved physicochemical properties relative to DASA-
23, pharmacological activity and specificity for PKM2, and the potential for radiolabeling. We will automate the
radiosyntheses and characterize uptake and specificity in cell culture (Aim 1), determine biodistribution and
radiation dosimetry (Aim 2), and assess the ability to visualize PKM2 expression in one potential application of
primary brain tumors (Aim 3). Success of this proposal will develop novel radiotracers for visualizing a hallmark
of metabolism. This will have important ramifications for studying altered glucose metabolism in multiple
applications and could improve our collective understanding of metabolic adaptations in disease. Importantly,
this technology will be adopted by a wide range of users in different pre-clinical and clinical studies."

Learning and decision-making are driven by expectations of future outcomes. Three key parameters
determining the valuation of future outcomes are 1) “how much” to expect, 2) “when” to expect it, and 3)
“what” to expect (ie, Outcome Prediction). However, how outcome prediction is generated by the brain in
response to predictive cues is poorly understood. Exemplifying the when of outcome-prediction is so-called
“reward timing” activity in the primary visual cortex (VC), which emerges in VC when visual stimuli are
behaviorally conditioned with delayed water reward. Previously, we have demonstrated that this timing
activity is generated within VC itself and requires basal forebrain cholinergic innervation to be formed. We
have also demonstrated that this activity informs on the timing of visually-cued actions. Indeed, the dorsal
striatum (DS) is VC's direct downstream motor-related target, and it is also observed in pilot data to expresses
this activity. Together, these observations make the visual corticostriatal circuit (VC»DS) a powerful
system to address how outcome prediction can be learned and reported neurally. Combined with our
computational model of how outcome prediction signaling could be learned by reinforcement signaling within
VC»DS, these observations well motivate our research into how VC»DS circuitry produces outcome prediction
signals, how cholinergic signaling teaches this circuit to learn outcome predictive signaling, and whether
predictive signaling in VC»DS informs decision-making behavior.
 Whether appetitive (Aim1a) and aversive (Aim1b) conditioning leads to the visual corticostriatal
circuit learning to produce outcome prediction signals is unknown, though pilot data indicates it is. Testing
predictions from our formal model, selectively perturbing inhibitory circuit elements will assess whether VC is
a site sourcing predictive signaling to DS (Aim1c). Pilot Ca2+ imaging of cholinergic fibers within VC indicates
that reward, as well as punishment is reported to VC (Aim2a) in keeping with its purported role as a teaching
signal, but raising the possibility that outcome valence is learned downstream in DS (Aim2b). Therefore, the
degree of cholinergic activation within VC may serve to teach VC to express and source to DS signals predicting
the time and magnitude of expected outcomes (Aim2c), while DS may serve as a site associating those
predictive signals with their appropriate reward-seeking/punishment avoiding behaviors. The ability to
optogenetically mimic outcome signaling affords a means to test whether learned outcome prediction signaling
in VC»DS informs decision-making: By instilling fictive reward expectancies atop behaviorally conditioned
reward expectancies of otherwise equal value, outcome prediction signaling in VC»DS can be shown to impact
future decision making (Aim3a&b). Observations made here will advance an understanding of the
mechanisms—impaired in many cognitive diseases—of how the behavioral meaning of sensory information is

For the many Americans living with neurogenic speech disorders, the simple task of talking—producing a
sequence of speech sounds—presents significant barriers in daily life. Therefore, learning to produce new sound
sequences (such as those in a difficult word) is a central component of speech rehabilitation. However, the
mechanisms underlying speech motor sequence learning are poorly understood despite the critical importance
of this process to speech therapy. Accurate speech production involves both a phonological encoding stage to
plan and sequence upcoming sound units (i.e., phonemes) and a motor programming stage to transform the
planned phonemes into precise motor movements. It remains unclear how these two stages interact to support
the learning of new speech sequences. The primary objective of this proposal is to differentiate the roles of
phonological planning and speech motor programming processes during speech motor sequence learning in
patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). PPA is a category of neurodegenerative disease in which the
location and degree of brain atrophy is closely tied to specific speech-language impairments in each individual,
and thus allows for relatively precise localization of speech-language function. Patients with PPA may have
isolated phonological impairment (e.g., logopenic-variant PPA) or motor programming impairment (e.g.,
progressive apraxia of speech), or may have relatively intact speech. In this project, participants will complete a
two-day learning paradigm where they will practice novel syllables containing non-native consonant clusters that
do not occur in English. Improvements in the accuracy and speed of practiced consonant clusters will be
compared to their performance on syllables containing untrained non-native consonant clusters. The central
hypothesis, based on the GODIVA model of speech sequencing, is that phonological learning should result in
reduced utterance duration while motor program learning should result in improved accuracy. This project will
test this hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) determine the behavioral predictors of speech motor sequence
learning abilities, and 2) establish the neural correlates of these abilities. Aim 1 will test the relationship between
learning measures and common clinical measures of phonological and motor programming ability. Aim 2 will
analyze the relationship between learning measures and the degree of cortical thinning in phonological and
motor programming brain regions. This study will further our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in speech
motor sequence learning, in line with the NIDCD mission to advance our understanding of normal and disordered
speech and improve the lives of individuals with communication disorders. This proposal will also provide crucial
training in areas including structural neuroimaging methods and neurodegenerative speech disorder research
that are essential for the trainee’s successful transition to an independent research career."
10845553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Every year, over a million children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU) are born in sub-Saharan Africa
and this population will continue to increase with improving availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In utero
HIV exposure has broad ranging health impacts and emerging data suggest that CHEU have higher risk of
neurocognitive delay compared to unexposed children. But the contribution of biological factors, the psychosocial
environment and maternal-child interactions to this delay remains poorly characterized. This proposal will take
advantage of the unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of in utero HIV exposure on neurocognitive
development in children in the context of an ongoing clinical study we are conducting in Malawi. We are screening
pregnant women, enrolling infants and conducting immunological analysis of neonatal adaptive immunity in three
categories: (1) CHEU born to women diagnosed with HIV at the first antenatal visit, thus exposed to uncontrolled
viremia for at least half of gestation; (2) CHEU born to women initiated on ART prior to conception with
undetectable viral loads; and (3) infants born to HIV uninfected mothers. We collect cord blood mononuclear
cells at birth to conduct a detailed immunological analysis. In this proposal, we will increase our sample size,
incorporate assessment of monocyte activation from cord blood specimens and extend follow up of these infants
to five years of age. Our goal is to conduct rigorously validated longitudinal assessments of neurocognitive
development and psychosocial factors including maternal mental health, socioeconomic status, HIV stigma,
home environment and mother-child interactions. Our interdisciplinary study team of infectious disease
specialists, developmental pediatricians, social scientists and immunologists will lead one of the first studies of
CHEU in resource-limited settings to simultaneously address the impact of biological and psychosocial factors
on neurocognitive development. We hypothesize that in utero exposure to HIV will impair neurocognitive
development in the first five years of life and children born to HIV-infected mothers with untreated HIV infection
at the start of pregnancy will demonstrate more delay than children of mothers with undetectable HIV viral load
throughout pregnancy. We further hypothesize that both immunological status at birth and psychosocial factors
will contribute to impaired neurocognitive development in CHEU. This study will provide detailed evidence to
develop interventions to improve the well-being of CHEU in resource-limited settings."
10846605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While radiation therapy effectively eliminates malignant cells, damage to healthy tissue surrounding tumors
remains a persistent clinical issue. Indeed, cancer patients who receive radiation treatment have an increased
risk for fracture when compared to those who undergo the same treatment regimen but who are not subjected
to radiotherapy. Unfortunately, the use of antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphates does not significantly
reduce insufficiency fractures for this patient population. For these reasons, our long-term goal is to identify
unique cellular and molecular mechanisms that can be therapeutically exploited for the radioprotection of bone.
Notably, the bone microenvironment (BME) is characterized by low oxygen tension or hypoxia. In response to
this external stimulus, many cell types in the BME activate hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling to facilitate
cell survival. While activation of the HIF signaling pathway is required to maintain healthy bone, the contribution
of hypoxia/HIF signaling during radiation induced bone damage has not been well defined. Intriguingly, we show
irradiated bones show a decrease in multipotent mesenchymal progenitors (MMPs) when compared to non-
irradiated controls. Moreover, preliminary data shows that MMPs are found in hypoxic regions and respond to
hypoxia by stabilizing HIF-2. Strikingly, while conditional ablation of HIF-2 in a population of MMPs did not alter
bone homeostasis, it did serve to protect against bone loss after radiation exposure. For these reasons, our
overarching hypothesis is that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HIF-2 will serve as a radioprotective
mechanism to ameliorate bone damage after radiation exposure, in part, by maintaining the number of MMPs
that can functionally contribute to bone after stress induced damage. To test our hypothesis, we will utilize a
combination of genetically engineered mouse models, in vitro cell culture experiments, and novel
pharmacological approaches to inhibit the HIF-2 signaling pathway in the BME. Currently, there are no FDA
approved agents to mitigate radiation induced bone loss, hence these studies will not only expand our
fundamental knowledge of bone biology but will also fill an unmet clinical need to identify therapeutic targets
which will ameliorate bone damage after radiotherapy."
10846685,"Projection Summary Over the last decades, we have made tremendous advancements in understanding the role of somatosensory neurons in sensing exteroceptive signals including touch, temperature, and pain. However, somatosensory neurons also innervate internal organs, but we understand much less about the anatomy and physiology of these neurons. There is literature on the roles of interoceptive neurons in sensing lung stretch and blood pressure. These studies mainly focus on the Vagal Nodose ganglia that innervate many internal organs. However, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, in addition to innervating skin and muscle, also innervate disparate internal organs but have garnered much less focus. To begin to elucidate the structure and function of these sensory neurons, we focus on adipose-innervating DRG neurons. These neurons are an attractive starting point because very little is known about their form and function, but these neurons could potentially have a profound relationship with the autonomic nervous systems (for example, the sympathetic nervous system) and roles in whole-body physiology. Here, we show that fat depots are robustly innervated by DRG neurons. We have also collected important preliminary data molecularly defining the subset of DRGs that innervate fat depots, and have begun to address their interactions with the sympathetic activities. We propose to use state-of-the-art and innovative molecular and genetic techniques to map adipose-innervating DRG neurons, profile their identities, and test their function."
10846643,"ABSTRACT: Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS) is an under-recognized but nevertheless common
balance disorder, which in most cases occurs after exposure to prolonged passive motion. MdDS, a chronic
illness that can last for many years, is manifested by persistent false sensations of rocking/swaying or
gravitational pull. MdDS is debilitating as these symptoms and signs are typically accompanied by other
presumably secondary physical, cognitive, and affective problems. In addition to motion-triggered (MT) cases,
the same or indistinguishable symptoms can occur without a specific trigger, identified as spontaneous-onset
(SO) MdDS. Treatment options for MdDS are limited, and it was only recently that a breakthrough was made in
our clinical laboratory with physiological readaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The premise of this
treatment is that MdDS is caused by maladaptation of a functional component of the VOR called velocity storage,
which shapes spatial orientation and the perception of self-motion. The treatment has been administered by
maneuvering the head of the patient seated inside a cylindrical chamber during a full-field optokinetic stimulation
(OKS). Our current success rates immediately after treatment of MT and SO MdDS are 75% and 50%,
respectively. A follow-up study indicated that the success rates later fluctuate as well as that a significant number
of patients remain sensitive to bright lights, movements of visual objects, and transportation, pointing to the
treatment method's limitations. A primary hurdle is access to the treatment. Full-field OKS requires a specialized
set-up in a dedicated room, making the treatment possible only in several laboratories around the world. We
recently successfully pilot tested the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) goggles for MdDS treatment with the
readaptation approach. In this proposed project, VR goggles will be tested on a larger group of patients, and the
effects will be compared to those of full-field OKS. If proven to be effective, MdDS can be treated locally to
patients in many vestibular therapy offices, not only for initial treatment but also for remedial or follow-up
treatment when symptoms return. This proposal also addresses the weaknesses of the VOR readaptation
approach by testing complementary approaches. We hypothesize that reducing (habituating) the velocity storage
capacity decreases sensitivity to physical movement and improves MdDS symptoms as well as limits symptom
recurrence. We further hypothesize that desensitization to visual stimuli can reduce visually induced dizziness
frequently observed in patients with MdDS. We will verify whether these complementary treatments will provide
a better outcome compared to the readaptation treatment by itself. Lastly, we hypothesize that OKS without head
motion can reduce the false sensation of gravitational pull commonly reported by MdDS patients. Two hundred
MdDS patients will be recruited for the study. Patients will be treated for 1-2 hours a day for 5 days. Patients will
be followed up with for up to 12 months. The proposed study will facilitate improved outcomes for MdDS by
broadening its treatment options."
10846723,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human population is increasingly at risk of developing chronic diseases, such as obesity, atopic dermatitis
and inflammatory bowel disease, which together affects millions of people, thus representing a huge economic
burden. One of the major contributing factors to these diseases is epithelial barrier dysregulation. The Ah
receptor (AHR) is emerging as a major factor in the maintenance of immune surveillance and integrity of
barrier tissues (e.g. skin, intestinal tract). However, our knowledge of AHR function is often confusing and at
times appears contradictory. This proposal will pursue the innovative theory that the AHR is a central regulator
of host barrier homeostasis, and the localized response to commensal and pathogenic microbes upon tissue
damage leads to AHR activation and enhanced epithelial repair and barrier function. We have established an
innovative multi-disciplinary team of collaborators with the intention of providing a comprehensive
understanding of the physiological and toxicological routes of ligand stimulation, modes of activity and targets
of AHR activation within epithelial barriers (e.g. intestinal mucosa and skin). I have been studying the AHR
since 1984 and have made a number of unique and seminal contributions to our understanding of the
physiologic and toxicologic functions of the AHR, thus I believe I am well qualified to lead this effort.
Discoveries from the Perdew laboratory include complete characterization of the subunit composition of the
AHR complex, and the determination that the liganded AHR works with inflammatory transcription factors to
mediate cytokine/chemokine/growth factor signaling. We propose here to also examine the AHR as a potential
therapeutic target for a number of chronic diseases. However, excessive or sustained activation of the AHR
can lead to a variety of toxicities, so we plan to reconcile these opposing concepts. Humans are exposed to
complex mixtures of AHR ligands from the diet, through microbiota metabolism, endogenous metabolism, and
environmental contamination. Thus, there is a need to better understand the activities of this enigmatic
receptor, the influence of different classes of ligands, and the appropriate level of AHR activation required to
maintain health. Project 1 will identify and characterize proteins that interact with the AHR/selective AHR
modulator (SAhRM) complexes. Project 2 proposes to identify and assess the significance of dietary/bacterial
AHR ligands that are major sources of AHR activity. The identification of naturally occurring AHR ligands in the
diet or synthesized by microbes in the gut will provide insights concerning the homeostatic role of the AHR and
the risk of low-level exogenous ligand (e.g. TCDD) exposure. Project 3 will examine the ability of natural,
exogenous, and synthetic AHR ligands to modulate barrier function and immune signaling in intestinal models.
Project 4 will examine the ability of natural, exogenous, and synthetic AHR ligands to enhance barrier function
in skin models. This highly innovative proposal will explore and validate a model for AHR function that unifies
many diverse observations and will lead to important insights into the role of the AHR in disease processes."

Autoimmune diseases (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Type I Diabetes mellitus (T1DM), multiple sclerosis (MS),
Crohn's disease, etc.) affect at least 3% of the US population, although this number appears to be significantly
increasing since 2020. Interestingly, many autoimmune diseases occur disproportionately in women. These
diseases are chronic, debilitating, and often, life threatening. Recent advances in biologic therapeutics have
been successful in reducing symptoms of these chronic diseases in many patients. However, due to the costs
associated with these treatments, many Americans still go untreated. In fact, several recent reports have
described health disparities in women of Hispanic, African American, and Native American descent, due to
availability of healthcare and cost-effective therapies. There is a clear unmet need for lower cost therapeutics
for autoimmune diseases. To develop new therapies for autoimmune diseases, we need to further our
understanding of the physiological and cellular mechanisms controlling activation and differentiation of Th17
cells. Th17 cells are a subtype of CD4+ lymphocytes that produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 17a
(IL-17a). Dysregulated activity of Th17 cells is associated with several autoimmune diseases including multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and others. Many of the current biologic therapies target the
interleukins produced by Th17 cells to reduce aberrant inflammatory processes. HIF-1α is a transcription factor
that plays an important role in the metabolic regulation of Th17 cells. Interestingly, the nuclear receptor REV-
ERB, regulates both the Th17 cell activation and differentiation by competing with RORγt, and recent work by
our lab indicates that REV-ERB may directly repress the expression of HIF-1α, providing a “two-hit” mechanism
to suppressing T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. This proposal aims to investigate the role that REV-ERB
plays in HIF-1α expression and determine the cellular changes that occur in T-cells during activation with and
without the presence of REV-ERB ligands. The data obtained from this work will provide novel insights to the
role that REV-ERB plays in T-cell physiology, and provide preliminary data for future drug discovery efforts."

From its emergence several decades ago, tissue engineering has been driven by the need to replace, repair or
regenerate our organs lost to congenital abnormalities, injury or disease. The field of regeneration medicine,
often called regenerative engineering, has been transformative for biomedical research. Bioreactors, used in
conjunction with reparative cell and biomaterial scaffolds, have played a vital role in advancing tissue engineering
by providing physiological environments to the forming tissues. In addition, a bioreactor should also enable
monitoring, quantification and control of highly dynamic biological processes involved during tissue and organ
culture. These features of bioreactors are critical for further advances in tissue engineering research and the
impact of the field on medicine. In response to these needs, we have focused on the development of imaging-
enabled bioreactors for regeneration of the two frequently affected organs: lung and heart. The current TERC
has developed imaging-enabled bioreactor systems for regeneration of injured donor lungs ex vivo and
recapitulation of the acute phase of post-myocardial infarct environment. In TERC renewal, we will continue
these translational studies of cardiopulmonary organ regeneration. In Aim 1, we will build upon the lung
bioreactor platform and demonstrate its translational utility in clinically-relevant settings. In addition, we will
develop an ex vivo whole lung model of cystic fibrosis for studies of therapeutic strategies. Cardiac regeneration
studies will continue in the new TR&D2 Aim 2, and will include the immune cell component and the chronic phase
of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In Aim 2, we will establish a “patient on a chip” model of cancer metastasis, to
establish capability for translational studies of systemic conditions. In Aim 3, we will create a reconfigurable
multi-sensing module serving both the micro-bioreactors and whole organ bioreactors, to achieve real-time, non-
invasive and quantitative assessments of the tissues and organs. In light of this broader approach to translation
of tissue engineering, encompassing the modeling of both injury and disease, at both the micro- and whole-
organ scales, we modified the title of TR&D3 from “Regenerative engineering” to “Translational technologies."

For TERC renewal, the Technology Training and Dissemination Core has been designed to provide three
related components: training, dissemination, and outreach. Training will provide investigators with the
knowledge and skills necessary for effectively using TERC developed technologies, and to create a new
cadre of biomedical researchers prepared to move the field forward. To this end, we will offer formal
graduate-level courses (e.g., hands-on laboratory classes, stem cell bioengineering classes) for developing
general tissue engineering skills. In parallel, we will offer specialized seminars, lectures, symposia and
workshops tailored to the needs and interests of the trainees (e.g., specialized training in translational
research, clinical research, entrepreneurship and commercialization). In addition, we will offer research
programs for undergraduate, graduate and medical students, and residencies for guest investigators. A
portfolio of training modalities will be posted on TERC website, with regular updates, and made available
free of charge. The second component, Dissemination, will also include a range of modalities that will be
managed through the TERC website. Our weekly lecture series Tissue Talks will be offered to worldwide
audiences. Workshops and symposia organized by faculty and trainees will be offered to all registered
participants to provide forums for discussing developments in the field. Science Simplified, a web-based
initiative started and managed by TERC trainees, will feature recent advances in tissue engineering, in the
form of clear and simple articles suitable for young audiences and non-specialists. The Career
Conversations Podcast, also run by our trainees, will provide invaluable insights into the multiple career
paths. The third component, Outreach, will provide an engaging learning program to underrepresented and
underserved communities, including summer programs for middle school students, Girls Science Day and
summer research for undergraduate students from black colleges. All training, dissemination and outreach
activities will specifically acknowledge NIBIB grant support."

The Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) supports a large, worldwide community of scientists using
the insect Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for biomedical experimentation. The goals of the
BDSC are to provide a collection of documented living stocks of broad value to current research, to preserve
documented strains with clear future value, and to provide information and support services that promote
maximal exploitation of these materials. These goals facilitate research by providing universal and rapid
access to the most generally useful stocks by preserving specialty genotypes with exceptional characteristics,
and by providing information that helps researchers identify stocks appropriate to their needs. The genetic
technologies available to Drosophila researchers are among the most sophisticated in any multicellular
organism; consequently, Drosophila is used extensively in studies of biological processes relevant to human
health and investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying disease. As the most comprehensive source of
stocks for genetic experimentation with Drosophila, the BDSC is central to the success of thousands of
research projects and hundreds of NIH grants yearly. The first specific aim of this proposal is to continue
acquiring, maintaining and distributing Drosophila strains while simultaneously eliminating obsolete stocks. The
work will preserve federal investments in genetic resource development by maintaining stocks securely using
regimented practices. It aims to maximize the rigor and reproducibility of genetic studies by encouraging stock
reuse. The second specific aim is to continue developing robust and transparent information resources to meet
the operational needs of the facility and the research needs of Drosophila scientists while maintaining and
promoting excellent user support. The third specific aim is to undertake research to increase the utility of one of
the largest subsets of BDSC stocks, the split-GAL stocks, which were developed to characterize neurons in the
brain. Split-GAL4 transgenes are used to force expression of other transgenes in cell-specific patterns,
allowing investigators to manipulate cell characteristics experimentally in otherwise normal individuals. The
research proposed here aims to characterize the expression of split-GAL4 transgenes outside the brain to
benefit the analysis of diverse cell types and to help distinguish the physiological effects of gene expression in
the brain versus other tissues in split-GAL4 studies. Key to all three aims is the administration and
advancement of the existing, highly successful cost recovery program that finances most operational expenses
from user fees. Consequently, the proposal focuses on support and development of the core management
team as the most effective way to leverage the investment of federal funds."

Tissue engineering is rapidly developing, but remains limited by (i) scaffold and bioreactor designs that are based
on predetermined parameters, and (ii) the lack of real-time, nondestructive measurements of cell and tissue
function. To overcome these two limitations, we will develop adaptive-responsive biomaterials that can sense
environmental signals and actuate the cells, and imaging-enabled bioreactors with real-time spatiotemporal
control of engineered tissues with feedback from the measured cell responses. Our goal is to offer these
advances to the tissue engineering community and translate them into clinics. The proposed renewal of the
Tissue Engineering Resource Center (TERC) brings together a highly productive interdisciplinary team of
actively collaborating investigators from Columbia University (lead institution), Tufts University, Columbia
University Irving Medical Center and Stevens Institute of Technology. An Administrative Board will coordinate
the Center’s activities, with the oversight and guidance of an exceptionally strong External Advisory Committee,
formed from the world leaders in tissue engineering and clinical translation. TERC will partner with a number of
existing resources (please see 18 letters of support), and will benefit from the exceptional resources provided by
our institutions and the very generous financial support of the Columbia University School of Engineering
($2,125,000 over the five-year cycle). The technical components of the Center are three Technology Research
and Development Projects (TR&D1: Adaptive-responsive biomaterials; TR&D2: Imaging enabled bioreactors;
TR&D3: Translational technologies), 17 Collaborative Projects, and 16 Service Projects. We also propose a
robust and highly diverse Technology, Training, and Dissemination program for biomedical investigators to
facilitate the use of new technologies and raise awareness about TERC, and comprehensive Outreach to
students, the general public, underrepresented and underserved communities. With a highly innovative scientific
premise, extensive foundational research, strong leadership and institutional support, experience in translational
research, and long history of collaboration among the lead investigators, we are confident that the Center will
accomplish its mission of serving as a transformative driving force in the field of tissue engineering."
10841950,"ABSTRACT
 Many bacteria are motile by synthesizing corkscrew-like flagella which when rotated propel bacteria
through the environment. Each bacterium synthesizes a species-specific number of flagella and inserts the
flagella in a species-specific pattern on the cell surface. Flagella are complex nanomachines assembled from
dozens of different proteins and how each bacterial species controls flagellar number and patterning is poorly-
understood. Moreover, the number of flagella per cell increases when cells come into contact a solid surface to
initiate a form of surface motility called swarming. The Kearns lab uses classical forward genetics, super-
resolution microscopy, and biochemistry to study flagellar biosynthesis and swarming motility of the Gram
positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The goals of the project are to understand flagellar biosynthesis in the
context of growing cell architecture. First, we will determine how flagellar number is controlled by the poorly-
understood master regulator of flagellar biosynthesis SwrA and a response regulator DegU. Second, we will
explore how the surface contact response is transduced to inhibit the adaptor-mediated regulatory proteolysis
of SwrA and increase flagellar number. Third, flagella are synthesized in a grid-like pattern and we will study
how flagellar patterning is interpreted and updated in time during cell growth, and coordinated with
peptidoglycan insertion. Fourth, we will study how flagellar assembly is integrated with two other envelope-
associated machines, the cell elongasome and the divisome controlling cell growth and division, respectively.
Ultimately, we want to achieve a holistic understanding of how a cell dynamically governs the initiation of flagellar
biosynthesis at specific locations to insert the machine through the cell wall. Our basic research is fundamental
to how cells self-organize and is applicable to the spatiotemporal control of the assembly of transenvelope
nanomachines involved in pathogenesis including flagella, pili and protein secretion apparati."
10841960,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A class of cis-regulatory elements, called enhancers, plays a central role in orchestrating spatiotemporally
precise gene expression programs during development. Perturbations in enhancer sequence or regulation can
lead to disease, including congenital malformations and cancer. Furthermore, enhancer sequence divergence is
emerging as an important mediator of human phenotypic variation. Key features of enhancers include their role
as major sites for transcription factor (TF) and coactivator binding in the genome, as well as their ability to activate
transcription over long genomic distances from their target promoters. Indeed, at some genomic loci enhancers
can regulate promotes at distances of over a megabase away. Such long-range function raises a question of
how is regulatory specificity within chromosomal domains containing many cis-regulatory elements
accomplished to allow for precise and robust gene regulation during development and in tissue homeostasis?
Proposed research program focuses on addressing fundamental knowledge gaps in enhancer biology and long-
range gene regulation. We will utilize novel genomic and computational approaches to systematically probe how
enhancer-promoter genomic distance, 3D contacts and inherent features of cis-regulatory elements influence
transcriptional outputs, and how a broader genomic and epigenomic environment modulates promoter
responsiveness to enhancers. We will complement these studies with live-cell and multiplexed DNA FISH
imaging of model loci where enhancers regulate their target genes over ultra-long genomic distances. We will
track movement of cis-regulatory elements and visualize nascent transcripts to capture the kinetic behavior of
enhancers and promoters and its relationship with the discontinuous nature of transcription. We will introduce
genetic perturbations to address how a new class of structural elements identified in our previous studies
mediates robust transcriptional regulation. Finally, through precise modulation of TF and coactivator dosage at
physiological levels, we will explore features that confer sensitivity or robustness of enhancers and gene
expression to changes in trans-activator concentrations. Altogether, the proposed research will yield new
concepts and quantitative models of long-range gene control, with broad future implications for understanding
and treatment of human disease."
10841964,"ABSTRACT
The fate and function of individual cells and tissues is often dictated at the transcriptional level by the activity of
cell- and tissue-specific transcription factors, as well as by RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) that determine
aspects of mRNA processing such as alternative splicing, stability, and localization.
The physiological importance of RBPs in regulating RNA processing is illustrated by many human diseases, for
example Spinal Muscular Atrophy and ALS/FTD, which can result from RBP mutation or dysregulation. A major
open question for many of these diseases is: why does disruption of a widely-expressed RBP result in highly
cell-specific phenotypes? For example, in SMA, why does mutation of the ubiquitously-expressed SMN1 result
specifically in motor neuron degeneration? A second major question is: which target(s) of a given RBP are
responsible for a specific phenotype? And a third related question: are the physiologically-relevant targets of a
given RBP different in different cell or tissue types? Collectively these open questions illustrate that much
remains unresolved about the relationship between RBP regulation and function in specific cells and tissues.
Thus, we will ask how broadly-expressed RBPs result in highly specific functional outcomes, focusing on cell-
specific regulatory mechanisms of two model RBPs, MEC-8/RBPMS and SMN-1.
In addition to well-established roles for RBPs in regulating processes such as RNA stability and alternative
splicing, the known universe of RNA regulation modalities continues to expand. Our lab is particularly
interested in novel types of alternative splicing, aiming to dissect new and emerging types of alternative
splicing at the cell-specific level, focusing on (1) formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) due to back-splicing as
opposed to canonical forward splicing, and (2) alternative splicing of exons that are not multiples of 3
nucleotides, and thus may lead to unusual outcomes including amino acid recoding, alternative C-termini
lengths, and regulated RNA degradation. Together these experiments will address a significant gap in our
understanding of the regulation and function of RNA processing at the cell- and tissue-specific level."
10841966,"Summary
Most biological events in the cell are mediated at some level by protein post-translational modifications. For
example, aberrant protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinase and phosphatase enzymes is linked to a
wide variety of cancers. Similarly, the unregulated acetylation state of histone proteins, controlled by histone
deacetylase (HDAC) proteins, can lead to epigenetic changes in transcription and ultimately disease. Key
to characterizing both healthy and disease states is a detailed molecular understanding of the role played
by protein post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, on protein function and
interactions. Importantly, enzymes regulating protein post-translational modifications, including kinase,
phosphatase, and HDAC proteins, are targets of therapeutics. Yet, tools linking specific protein
modifications to downstream biological activities are often limited or unavailable, which has stalled progress
in disease characterization and drug development.
The NIGMS-funded projects in the Pflum lab address the critical need to develop innovative chemical
approaches to discover unanticipated roles of protein post-translational modifications and their modifying
enzymes in cell biology. In our work with protein phosphorylation, we pioneered use of g-phosphoryl
modified ATP analogs in kinase-catalyzed labeling reactions. Building on this prior work, we propose in the
next 5 years to 1) develop a new suite of methods with unique abilities to probe kinase- and phosphatase-
substrate pairs and multi-protein complexes in cells, and 2) apply our innovative tools to a variety of
biological problems in collaboration with biologists. In our work with protein acetylation, we have
demonstrated the power of using inactive mutants as traps to discover non-histone substrates of HDAC1
and HDAC6, which has revealed unexpected roles in cell biology. In the next 5 years, we will apply this
powerful trapping strategy to additional HDAC protein isoforms, which will establish the role of HDAC
proteins in activities beyond epigenetics and transcriptional regulation. In a new direction for the program,
trapping will be expanded to demethylase enzymes, which regulate protein methylation. Given the critical
role of kinase, phosphatase, demethylases, HDAC enzymes in disease and drug treatment, yet the
inadequate tools available to study these enzymes in complex cellular systems, the enabling chemical
strategies proposed in this application will strengthen biomedical research in cell biology and drug design."

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection remains a significant public health problem in the United States
(US). It is estimated that almost 15% of the 1.17 million people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are unaware
of their HIV status. And despite the existence of highly effective HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy, ART),
only 65% of people living with diagnosed HIV have achieved viral suppression. Similarly, among HIV-negative
people eligible for PrEP, only 18% have used PrEP. These gaps between evidence and practice are deepened
in the US South, where the opioid crisis has further increased the risk for acquiring HIV in this region. In order
to achieve US Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) goals, implementation research, particularly in the US South, is
needed to close the gap between evidence-based interventions and practice in the HIV neutral continuum of
care. Thus, our overarching goal is to support and evaluate the implementation of a sustainable HIV health
service model for rapid HIV testing and linkage to HIV treatment (ART) or prevention (PrEP) in Tennessee
(TN), a state located in the US South. Our Core Project will focus on implementation and evaluation of rapid
HIV testing and linkage to ART from the Shelby County Health Department, the highest volume HIV testing
facility in Memphis, TN (a southern US city which ranks 4th among all US Metropolitan Statistical Areas for HIV
incidence) to several nearby Ryan White-funded HIV care clinics. Our Collaborative Project will focus on
implementation and evaluation of rapid HIV testing and linkage to local PrEP providers from: 1) Street Works, a
Community Based Organization (CBO) providing a Syringe Service Program (SSP) to the Nashville community
and 2) A Betor Way, a CBO providing a SSP to the Memphis community. We are uniquely positioned to
perform the work we propose for three important reasons. First, we plan to leverage an established
collaboration with implementation and community partners in Memphis and Nashville including colleagues from
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, University of Memphis, Shelby County Health Department, Street
Works, and A Betor Way. Second, we will leverage resources available at the TN Center for AIDS Research,
Vanderbilt Center for Health Services Research, and the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance/Community
Engaged Research Core. Thirdly, the investigators involved in this proposal possess the expertise in HIV

10839757,"Project Summary/Abstract
Low exercise capacity is an important risk factor for all-cause morbidity and mortality. Skeletal muscle is a
critical component of exercise capacity through its ability to generate ATP via mitochondrial substrate oxidation
(i.e. mitochondrial function). Skeletal muscle properties also influence whole-body insulin sensitivity which
affects risk for metabolic diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, obesity). Nascent myogenic progenitor cells are a
critical component of skeletal muscle plasticity in response to exercise as they proliferate, self‐renew and pass
on epigenetic modifications to daughter populations. Meager evidence suggests that these progenitor cells are
“imprinted” by lifestyle interventions which confers subsequent metabolic adaptations. The proposed studies
will fill a gap in our knowledge and directly assess the ability of exercise training to imprint myogenic progenitor
cells in a manner leading to improved exercise capacity and reduced risk for metabolic disease. The primary
goal of the present proposal is to leverage the MoTrPAC parent project and determine the distinct abilities of
short-term (three months) and life-long (athletes) aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) to imprint
key myocellular metabolic properties (insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function) through epigenetic regulation
(DNA methylation, RNA expression) of novel exercise response genes in skeletal muscle progenitor cells. Our
secondary goal is to establish a human primary skeletal muscle cell (HSkMC) culture repository from MoTrPAC
which can be utilized for future mechanistic interrogations. We hypothesize that exercise training will imprint
metabolic properties in skeletal muscle progenitor cells through epigenetic regulation of novel exercise
response genes that will differ between AT and RT. We will establish HSkMC cultures from muscle biopsies of
325 individuals (AT, RT, control groups) before and following three months of intervention and 75 athletes (AT
and RT) and assess insulin action (insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, insulin signal transduction),
mitochondrial function (O2 consumption using carbohydrate and fatty acid substrates), DNA methylation and
RNA expressions (RNAseq) with associated pathway enrichment analyses. The stated purpose of Aim 1 is to
determine the distinct abilities of short-term and life-long AT and RT to imprint key myocellular metabolic
properties (insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function) through epigenetic regulation of exercise response genes.
Integration of DNA methylation and RNAseq data will identify novel exercise response genes for subsequent
genetic manipulation in vitro to determine its effects on the stated metabolic endpoints. The stated purpose of
Aim 2 is to create an HSkMC repository for future investigations. Findings from the proposed studies will
provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the ability of exercise training to confer a “metabolic memory”
through epigenetic modification of specific exercise response genes and inform subsequent exercise
prescriptions relative to optimizing health benefits gained from exercise."

 The overall aims of this integrated P01 proposal are to advance fundamental understanding and
provide clinical translation of oxytocin’s actions in the periphery and in the central nervous system as they
relate to sensory processing and recovery from tissue injury, including surgery.
 The three goals of this program project are 1) to determine oxytocin pharmacokinetics (relationship
between dose and concentration) and pharmacodynamics (relationship between concentration and drug effect)
in rats and humans, 2) characterize the mechanisms of oxytocin actions on acute pain and sensitization at
peripheral and central sites, and 3) determine the central and peripheral actions of oxytocin on recovery after
tissue injury (e.g., surgery). Each of these goals is predicated on precise measurement of oxytocin dose and
concentration, construction of mathematical models relating blood oxytocin concentration to oxytocin dose and
route of delivery, and construction of mathematical models relating oxytocin concentration to drug effect. The
first goal comprises measuring oxytocin dose, concentration, and effect, and developing mathematical models
of these fundamental relationships. This is the critical analysis that brings new scientific rigor to the second and
third aims, because we will use the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models to give oxytocin in a
manner that facilitates rigorous exploration of the dose – concentration – drug response relationship for both
acute pain and sensitization (goal 2) and speed of recovery (goal 3) for both peripheral and central sites
(differentiated by leveraging differences in peripheral and central pharmacokinetics to target each site
experimentally)."
10842113,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most mammalian genes harbor multiple cleavage and polyadenylation sites, or PASs, across the gene body,
resulting in mRNA isoforms with different coding sequences (CDS) and/or 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs).
Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is an important layer of gene regulation, affecting gene
expression levels, protein diversity, and mRNA metabolism. The APA isoform expression varies across cell
types and is dynamically regulated in a growing number of cell conditions, such as cell proliferation and
differentiation, change of metabolic states, and cellular stress.
Our lab employs interdisciplinary approaches to study APA, involving molecular biology, functional genomics,
and computational biology. Our long-term goal is to understand the functional genomics of APA across species
as well as molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of gene regulation by APA in different cell
contexts and pathological conditions. In the next five years, we plan to address a few key gaps in the field:
First, we plan to examine regulatory rules governing intronic polyadenylation that leads to early termination of
transcription. Second, we will examine the role of 3’UTR isoform regulation in cell metabolic reprogramming,
such as growth and autophagy. Third, we will investigate the mechanisms and consequences of the unique
APA isoform profile in secretory cells."

We propose single-cell technologies to quantify multiparameter immune markers that provide in-
depth single-cell data for analysis of immune responses to vaccination in our study cohorts. The
shared platforms in this service core provide efficient and reproducible profiling in support of our
research projects with greatly expanded sensitivity and cell-type specificity. To define cell
phenotypes, we will employ mass cytometry or CyTOF (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight) for
multiparameter single-cell analysis, which uses heavy metal ions as antibody labels and provides
tremendous detail for cellular analysis of immune subsets. To further profile and correlate the
transcriptomes of targeted single cells with immunophenotype, we will employ single-cell cellular
indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq) for circulating blood cells and
spatial-resolution proteo-transcriptomics via deterministic barcoding (DBiT-seq) in biopsies from
tissues (skin, lymph node). These transcriptomics include in depth sequencing of BCR and TCR
to investigate clonal expansion in the tissue compared to the circulation. To identify molecular
signatures of vaccine responses across our cohorts, we will use a mass spectrometry (MS)-based
MStern blotting-based serum proteomics platform for unbiased discovery of several hundred
proteins with immunological function as an excellent reflection of the immunological state.
Standardization, both at the assay and analytical levels, will allow comparisons and integration of
data across projects. The goals of Core C are to provide a unique and essential resource to
enable the comprehensive characterization of circulating immune cells from blood as well as cells
available from tissue biopsies, with comparative data by CyTOF and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq),
and matched profiles of proteomic milieu."

Sickle cell disease (sickle cell) is the most common genetic hematologic disorder in the United States and an
increasing global health problem. Sickle cell patients have a range of acute and chronic multisystem clinical
complications and considerably shortened life expectancy. Paradoxically, despite their hyperinflammatory state,
sickle cell patients have reduced responses to vaccination, suggesting dysregulation or impairments in immune
pathways reminiscent of our studies of the chronic inflammatory milieu in aging. A broad investigation of the
systemic immune response in patients with sickle cell disease is necessary for the understanding of whether
chronic hyperinflammatory immune status may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and reduced
responses to vaccines in this vulnerable population. We will employ recent advances in single-cell technologies
to quantify and analyze sickle cell disease patient immune status and responses to vaccinations. Our study will
provide in-depth multiparameter immune profiles and analysis to identify molecular signatures defining the
hyperinflammatory state and reduced vaccine efficacy in sickle cell disease patient populations."

MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY RESOURCES CORE (MCBRC)
Molecular and Cell Biology provide an essential linkage among important basic fields of biomedical sciences,
such as genetics, developmental biology, structural biology, immunology, neurobiology, and cancer biology.
Centralized core facilities offering specialized equipment and services in molecular and cell biology,
immunology, immunopathology, and microscopy are often called on to provide critical support for biomedical
research. The Molecular and Cell Biology Resources Core (MCBRC) will provide, development, and training
functions based on the variety of needs for advanced molecular/cell biology support by Louisiana Biomedical
Research Network (LBRN) junior investigators. The main goals of the MCBRC are to: 1) Provide access to the
sophisticated equipment and expertise of the biomedical research intensive (BRI) institutions throughout
Louisiana, with the LSU flagship campus in Baton Rouge being the primary site (LSU School of Veterinary
Medicine, LSU College of Science, Pennington Biomedical Research Center) 2) Train and support all LRBN
investigators by helping them develop or adapt technological assays and methodologies needed for their
projects. Access to expensive equipment and experienced technical support is facilitated through a four-prong
strategy: i) PUI faculty and staff are invited to spend typically 2-3 days in the main MCBRC facilities to receive
hands-on training, as well as advice about their research projects; ii) training through organized workshops and
teleconference sessions, as well as “Works in Progress” sessions; iii) providing specific services and reagents
via the internet communication and order managing tool iLab; iv) provide on-site support and consultations
for PUI campuses through scheduled visits of MCBRC leadership and technical staff; v) provide “Core
Bucks” funds for all PUI investigators regardless whether they are funded by the LBRN. MCBRC leverages
the resources and expertise of three existing core facilities operated by the Division of Biotechnology and
Molecular Medicine (BioMMED) at the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM): Gene expression and
sequencing laboratory (GeneLab); Protein Production, Purification, and Characterization Laboratory (PPPCL),
and the molecular immunopathology laboratory (MIPL). These three laboratories are co-supported by the
NIH:NIGMS COBRE Center for Experimental Infectious diseases and the new COBRE Center for Lung Biology

10888412,"Abstract:
Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, produce rewarding effects that have been extensively investigated. However,
these drugs also produce aversive effects that are far less understood, even though they strongly influence
drug‐seeking, and exhibit large individual variability that contributes to differences in individual addiction
propensity. We found that aversive responses to cocaine depend critically on serotonin and glutamate
signaling in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a major afferent to midbrain dopamine neurons. This
proposal examines cellular mechanisms by which these receptors drive neural activation and aversive
conditioning, and why these responses occur much more strongly in some individuals than others, with an
overall aim of identifying novel potential therapeutic targets for regulating drug‐seeking and treating
addiction."
10848217,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Significant growth in the number of cancer patients, particularly those ≥65 years, is predicted within the U.S
over the next 20 years. The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship
phase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery.
Serious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended
cancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for
colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as
vaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these
issues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors.
Primary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational
studies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international
randomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences
in time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity
of high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings,
seriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will
conduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low-
risk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building
on our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model
(experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk
survivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer
survivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared
to the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The
primary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care),
assessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated
measures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care,
and other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and
receipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship
care. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system,
Kaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our
results will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship
care, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality."

The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the core criterion of memory impairment, but
biomarker-detectable pathophysiological changes start decades before clinical symptoms. This preclinical
phase, in which someone has the neuropathology of AD but does not yet show clinical symptoms, is crucial for
potential intervention and timely diagnosis for patient and caregiver. The preclinical phase is currently only
detectable with expensive or invasive biomarkers. Because current cognitive measures are not sensitive to the
preclinical phase of AD and have low specificity and large variation with regard to individuals' educational and
cultural exposure, there is a critical need to develop sensitive, low-cost, and high-access cognitive markers for
early detection in diverse older adults. The primary goal of this project is to investigate if novel psycholinguistic
metrics of existing cognitive test data can accurately identify people in the earliest stages of AD. The semantic
fluency task—naming as many animals in one minute—tests semantic memory, one of the first cognitive domains
to become impaired in AD. Traditionally, semantic fluency is scored by the total number of items. However, there
is a wealth of information at the item-level of this task, because words are organized in a semantic network that
becomes vulnerable during AD, specifically for words that are poorly connected and not often used. These traits
of words in the semantic network can be captured with novel psycholinguistic metrics, such as lexical frequency,
e.g., `dog' is a high-frequent word in our language, as opposed to `iguana.' Nine novel item-level psycholinguistic
metrics of semantic fluency have been selected to: investigate how AD imaging biomarkers in nondemented
adults relate to psycholinguistic measures (Aim 1, K99); estimate the temporality of semantic impairment across
the AD continuum (Aim 2, R00); and determine the sensitivity and specificity of psycholinguistic measures to
predict progression to clinical AD (Aim 3, R00). Since the relationship of demographics to psycholinguistic
metrics is not well understood, this project strives to deconstruct cultural and demographic effects on these
metrics in order to maximize their potential utility in early diagnosis among diverse older adults. The project will
employ advanced statistical analyses to investigate data from three large longitudinal cohorts with diverse
participants and semantic fluency data in English, Spanish, and Dutch. This K99/R00 proposal lays the
foundation for an independent research program focused on semantic processing in normal aging and across
the AD continuum. The proposed project will provide the applicant with 1) new training in computational
semantics and structural equation modeling, 2) experience with imaging biomarker data, and 3) a strong
foundation in cultural neuropsychology. These experiences will supplement the applicant's strong background
in Neurolinguistics and Epidemiology. The results of the proposed research have the potential to translate into a

select for intervention trials."

 Our long-term goal has been to characterize the heterogeneous group of chronic lower airway
diseases (LAD) observed in World Trade Center (WTC) workers and volunteers, uncover their risk factors and
comorbidities, identify subgroups with adverse and favorable lung function trajectories and outcomes, and
develop and deploy novel imaging approaches to the investigation of the lung injury underlying them. Such
goal will in turn translate into better understanding of disease pathophysiology, more targeted,
personalized, and perhaps disease modifying treatment approaches, and improved surveillance and
prevention strategies.
 Our previous studies established valid clinical diagnoses and have demonstrated markedly diverging
longitudinal lung function trajectories in the largest and most diverse WTC occupational cohort. Besides our
expertise with longitudinal lung function analyses, we were uniquely able to demonstrate associated
quantitative chest computer tomography (QCT) metrics that have helped validate and characterize the
disease processes that have been associated with WTC occupational exposures. QCT has revolutionized
respiratory research, and has contributed important and novel information on interstitial, proximal and
distal airway, and vascular changes that underlie the process of inflammatory remodeling and disease
progression. Our observations in this cohort have also identified a subgroup who has experienced
unexpected and significant lung function gain in adult life, suggesting a process of resolution in need of
improved understanding. Our studies have been on the forefront of occupational respiratory research.
 We propose three specific aims to deploy novel QCT and spirometric markers to investigate early
interstitial and airway injury and remodeling in subjects who have experienced accelerated lung function

10848378,"Deep learning models have been deployed in an increasing number of edge and mobile devices to provide
healthcare in our life, from mobile dermatology assistant, mobile eye cancer (leukoria) detection, emotion
detection, to comprehensive vital signs monitoring. All these techniques rely on visual assistance of the
cameras that come with mobile devices and inevitably lead to different levels of fairness concerns, due to the
inherent gender, race and/or socioeconomic bias in existing AI models. Compounding contributing factors
include a lack of medical professionals from marginalized communities, inadequate information about those
communities, and socioeconomic barriers to participating in data collection and research. In the absence of a
diverse population that reflects that of the U.S. population, potential safety or efficacy considerations could be
missed. What is worse, with inadequate data, AI algorithms could misdiagnose underrepresented people,
leading to increasing health care disparities. Therefore, there is a critical need to address racial, skin color, and
socioeconomic inequities in AI-assisted mobile diagnosis.
 This project will address the fairness issue in mobile AI assistants, using dermatology diagnosis and skin
color inequity as the study case. Instead of collecting equitable demographic dataset in a centralized way, it will
develop a federated on-device learning framework for participation inclusion, selective data contribution, and
continuous personalization. The framework can continuously learn from new users’ data as they use the
mobile apps with little human supervision. An unsupervised federated learning (FL) framework will be
developed with heterogeneous hardware (high-end and low-end) and models such that users from all
socioeconomic status can participate in the research. While various FL techniques have been developed, how
to implement unsupervised FL with both hardware and model heterogeneity is not clear. It is also essential to
achieve this goal with as little human supervision as possible since it is impractical to have a doctor constantly
label the images when users are using these AI-based apps. In addition, even with FL, data from
predominating population will still dominate the data collected. Non-uniform data selection techniques will be
developed to automatically weigh the importance of different data for maximum fairness. Finally, not all neural
networks exhibit the same inherent fairness even with the same biased data. A fairness-aware neural
architecture search framework will be developed to find the networks that can achieve the most fairness.
 The expected outcome of this project is a holistic framework to mitigate the impacts of inequity by
improving the inference performance for minorities. The developed techniques will be implemented as mobile
apps with heterogeneous smart phones and evaluated with both public dataset and patients at UPMC. Data
and code will be made available for public research. The developed techniques can be easily extended to all
AI-assisted diagnosis and account for the inequity in various aspects such as age, sex, racial, etc."
10848483,"Project Summary and Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) - an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is associated with increased
metastatic potential and poor patient survival - is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and accounts for ~15-
20% of invasive breast cancers. TNBC represents an important clinical challenge because these cancers
respond poorly to endocrine therapy or other available targeted agents; thus, chemotherapy is currently the
backbone of standard therapy with a median survival of only ~13 months. Current FDA-approved nanoparticle-
drug formulations of doxorubicin (Doxil) and paclitaxel (Abraxane) have been studied for the treatment of TNBC,
however neither have been shown to significantly improve tumor control or patient survival. This is most likely
due to (i) limited extravasation from the tumor vasculature, (ii) poor penetration within breast tumor tissue, (iii)
inability to efficiently target tumor cell drug uptake within the tumor microenvironment, and (iv) development of
drug resistance via expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps such as P-glycoprotein. To address these
therapeutic barriers, we have recently: (1) engineered relatively large polymeric nanoparticles (between 63 to
114 nm) that rapidly penetrate in breast tumor tissue with tumor-specific fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14
(Fn14)-targeting to further improve particle dispersion, drug distribution, and tumor-specific cellular uptake within
the tumor microenvironment and (2) developed a novel high-throughput method for quantitative characterization
of Fn14-specific and nonspecific binding (towards tumor ECM) of various nanoparticle formulations. Thus, the
central hypothesis of this grant proposal is that by modulating the Fn14-specific equilibrium binding affinities (KD)
and minimizing the nonspecific binding to tumor ECM, Fn14-targeted tumor penetrating nanoparticles will (1)
provide well-dispersed, sustained delivery into the tumor and regions of the tumor tissue that contain TNBC cells
and (2) specifically target to and efficiently traffic within Fn14-positive TNBC cells while sparing adjacent healthy
tissues from toxic effects. This strategy is likely to result in significant improvements in efficacy and reduce toxicity
in TNBC primary tumors and disseminated metastases, compared to free drugs and their clinical nanoparticle
formulation counterparts, which will generate new insights into the rate-limiting barriers and mechanisms of
tumor-specific targeting for nanoparticle therapeutics. Future applications of the information obtained from this
project may be applied to improve the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of molecularly targeted drugs and drug
combinations, which has the potential to eventually translate into novel, more effective treatment strategies.
Importantly, the successful development of effective nanoparticle therapeutics for TNBC should allow us to
extend these findings to the treatment of other Fn14-positive cancer types (e.g., lung, prostate, ovarian, brain)."

students met or exceeded CAASPP Mathematics standards and only 8% of 11th grade students
reported a high level of opportunities for meaningful participation at school. Thus, these Salinas Valley
students face many challenges, including low income, English as a second language, poor housing,
violence and gang activity, water contamination, and exposures to pesticides and nitrate fertilizers and
other emissions from agriculture. The valley directly connects to the Pacific Ocean and Monterey Bay,
where these pollutants affect the marine ecosystem and also circle back and impact human health.
 Improved STEM skill-sets that include environmental health literacy can help students learn
how to solve environmental challenges and enter an expanding science-based labor sector. Few
curricula clarify the relationship between the health of oceans and human health. We aim to improve
local environmental health literacy in schools serving youth in these low-income agricultural
communities by developing an integrated Environmental Health Partnership and using the arts (visual,
music, theater) to improve understanding of the sciences and widen translation to a larger community
(STEAM). California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB), a Hispanic-Serving Institution and
national leader in science education will lead the partnership, with contributions from the Monterey
County Office of Education (MCOE), the Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) and its longstanding teacher
training summits, the CHAMACOS study (the University of California, Berkeley) with its 20 years
history engaging youth in environmental health community projects in the Salinas valley, and local
community-based art groups. To accomplish our goals, we will: (1) contribute environmental health
expertise to MCOE implementation of NGSS standards; (2) integrate environmental health literacy
into NGSS-aligned Aquarium teacher training programs addressing ocean plastics, climate change,
and agriculture and with Salinas Valley teachers, conduct project-based learning approaches to these
subject area; evaluate the impacts of these training programs on student knowledge, competency,
and self-efficacy; and, (3) work with youth to develop and showcase professional-grade art
productions to bring environmental health literacy education to wider audiences."

The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Fei Jiang, Ph.D., a candidate with
an excellent foundation in statistical and machine learning research, to enable her to become an independent
investigator in the ﬁeld of quantitative data analysis and statistical/machine learning methods development for
neuroimaging research. The proposed research aims to extract dynamic resting-state functional connectivity
from multimodality imaging and use them for the prediction of cognitive decline. The central hypothesis is that
the resting state functional connectivity changes over the imaging acquisition period, and this dynamic pattern is
crucial for the optimal prediction of cognitive decline. Towards proving this hypothesis, a unique machine learn-
ing framework is proposed to (1) robustly extract dynamic resting-state functional connectivity from multimodality
imaging; (2) identify the important features that are associated with individuals' cognitive scores; and (3) predict
cognitive decline using the identiﬁed important features. Successful completion of the proposed research will
provide the next generation machine learning framework for the extraction and analysis of dynamic resting-state
functional connectivity and lead to potential endpoints that can be used in the assessment of treatment effects.
Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with
an expert committee from multiple scientiﬁc areas of relevance to the project (Neuroimaging, Neurodegenerative
disease, Biostatistics): Srikantan Nagarajan (primary mentor), Ph.D., Department of Radiology and Biomedical
Imaging, Ashish Raj (co-mentor), Ph.D., Department Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, William W. Seeley (ad-
visor), M.D., Ph.D., Department of Neurology, John Kornak (advisor), Ph.D., Department of Epidemiology and
Biostatistics, Marilu Gorno Tempini (collaborator), M.D., Ph.D., Department of Neurology, Charles McCulloch
(collaborator), Ph.D., Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. This committee will be coordinated by Dr.
Nagarajan. The goal is that by the end of the K25, Dr. Jiang will have the requisite knowledge, technical skills,
and expertise to submit a successful R01 proposal that integrates her expertise in statistical and machine learn-
ing methods with a knowledge of the questions and approaches pertaining to imaging in neuroscience, acquired
through this training period."

 The overall mission of the San Diego Digestive Diseases Research Center (SDDRC) is to support basic,
translational and clinical research that will lead to improved treatment and prevention of important inflammatory
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The foundation of our research efforts lies in a distinct group of
academic investigators, carefully selected for Center membership based on the alignment of their work with the
Center theme of ""Inflammation in the Digestive Tract"". The SDDRC provides Core services to the research
groups of its members located at three adjacent research institutions in the San Diego area that foster
research productivity and new research directions, and encourage productive collaborations. In addition, the
SDDRC enhances new digestive diseases research through Pilot/Feasibility and Enrichment programs. The
research base includes 45 outstanding and diverse investigators with current digestive diseases-relevant
funding of $22,479,419 in total annual direct costs, of which $7,722,286 (34.4%) are from NIDDK. Since the
SDDRC was originally funded by the NIH/NIDDK as Silvio O. Conte Center in 2019, the Center has
experienced remarkable success. Over the past four years, 95% of all Center members have utilized Core
services. The Center's exceptional productivity and impact are evident in the publication of 274 papers that are
100% compliant with NIH public access policy and acknowledge the Center grant in the publications based
upon usage of SDDRC Core services. Collaboration among SDDRC members has played a pivotal role in
driving this success, with ~50% of publications resulting from joint and collaborative projects between Center
members. The Pilot/Feasibility program has supported 20 diverse and predominantly early-career
investigators, who achieved an impressive success rate of ~80% in securing subsequent funding. Educational
and training events organized by the Enrichment Core have been popular and well-received, as demonstrated
by consistently high attendance rates and positive feedback. Building on these accomplishments, the SDDRC
will continue to offer services to Center members through its three interrelated Biomedical Research Cores.
The Human Translational Core leverages clinical and translational research expertise to offer access to human
biospecimens, and provide consultation in biostatistics and histopathology. The Preclinical Models Core
facilitates and assists in phenotyping and understanding of gastrointestinal and liver diseases using
conventional and gnotobiotic murine models. The Microbiomics and Functional Genomics Core provides
cutting-edge and cost-effective access to sequencing-based technologies and bioinformatic analysis. An
Administrative Core supports the Center administratively and coordinates the Pilot/Feasibility and Enrichment
programs. By creating a unique environment to nurture novel research ideas and interactions, the SDDRC is
exceptionally well-positioned to integrate clinical and bench research to advance the basic understanding of
digestive diseases, and enhance the health and care of patients suffering from those diseases."

 The Preclinical Models Core assists members of the San Diego Digestive Diseases Research Center
(SDDRC) in applying and phenotyping preclinical models of digestive diseases in their research. Tremendous
progress in understanding the pathophysiological principles governing many of these diseases has been made
by the use of animal models. The Core provides SDDRC investigators with access to a range of conventional
and gnotobiotic murine models of infection and inflammation in the intestinal tract and liver, cutting-edge
technologies for histological and intravital analysis, and primary human liver cells for functional studies. The
Core also assists SDDRC investigators in model selection and interpretation, data acquisition from animal
models, and histopathologic evaluation. The Core is directed by highly experienced investigators at the
University of California San Diego (UCSD) with a deep background in studies using animals and primary
human cells. The Core cooperates closely with an existing shared facility, the Microscopy and Histology Core
of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) on the UCSD campus, for cost-effective access to histological
services and leverages technical services from the UCSD Animal Care Program. Past Core utilization has
been excellent, as demonstrated by overall use by 61% of all Center members during the reporting period,
generation and use of 2,323 gnotobiotic mice and 696 genetically engineered mice and processing of ~27,400
histological samples, leading to 67 publications over the past 4 years that acknowledge SDDRC support
primarily based on Core use. Center investments contributed, on average, to 25% cost reduction for
gnotobiotic mice and services, and a 43% reduction in histology costs. Building on these accomplishments, the
Core will continue to provide access to a range of murine models of digestive diseases and give extensive
histological and phenotyping support. In addition, member requests have led the Core to expand the model
offerings to normal human liver cells isolated from rejected donor livers. Specific Core services include; 1)
Tissue phenotyping by histology and live animal imaging; 2) Support for gnotobiotic animal models; 3) Access
and guidance for a range of murine models of digestive diseases; 4) Access to isolated hepatocytes and non-
parenchymal cells from normal human livers; and 5) Histopathological consultation and scoring. Core experts
also provide individual advice and guidance on selection and interpretation of the most appropriate animal
models of luminal or liver disease, train Center members and their lab personnel in gnotobiotic and other
animal techniques, so they can conduct their own colonization and challenge experiments, and give regular
workshops on relevant lab skills and histological approaches. Together, the models, services and protocols
provided by the Preclinical Models Core will support and empower Center investigators to conduct cutting-edge
research with sophisticated animal models and phenotyping techniques that have been tailored to research on
the prevention and treatment of diseases of the digestive system."

Sven Heinz). Together with a team of experts in microbiome science, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and
computational biology, the Core leadership has a wealth of experience in guiding SDDRC members in the use
and analysis of cutting-edge and cost-effective technologies for microbiomics and functional genomics. The Core
has had excellent success in serving its membership as evidenced by usage by 70% of SDDRC members;
processing and sequencing of ~10,000 microbiome and ~4,000 genomic samples; over 6,000 hours of
bioinformatic analysis; and acknowledgement of Center support on 72 publications based upon primary usage
of services by this Core. Building on these achievements, the Core will continue to leverage three established
institutional shared resources for providing services: the Microbiome Core at the University of California, San
Diego (UCSD), the Genomics Center of the Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) at UCSD, and the UCSD
Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Service entails sample preparation, sequencing and data
analysis in an integrated workflow whereby samples are processed either at the Microbiome Core or IGM
Genomics Center, sequencing is performed at the IGM Genomics Center, and data are seamlessly transferred
and analyzed in the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. The Core also offers consultation and
training in genomics technologies to enhance the ability of members to implement these technologies in their
research. The Core has established rigorous procedures for quality control and data validation, and interacts
with and complements the other SDDRC Cores. Together, the unique combination and integration of outstanding
existing infrastructure and expertise enables the Core to provide a range of high quality and cost-effective
microbiomics and functional genomics services that greatly enhance the ability of Center members to advance
digestive diseases research."

 Laminin-α2-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD), also known as Merosin Deficient
Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), is a devastating neuromuscular disease characterized by
progressive muscle weakness from birth. LAMA2-CMD is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which results
in the loss of the Laminin-α2 protein. Laminin-α2 is critical for the formation of laminin-211 and laminin-221
heterotrimers, which are major components of the muscle basal lamina that support muscle structure and
function. LAMA2-CMD patients exhibit muscle weakness from birth, loose ambulation, require ventilator support,
feeding tube insertion and die prematurely. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for LAMA2-
CMD and patients die as young as the first decade of life. Laminin-111 is functionally similar to Laminin-211
and found abundantly the basement membrane of kidneys. Laminin-111 is therefore unlikely to trigger and
immune response in the adult compared to Laminin-211 replacement in LAMA2-CMD. We have shown that
treatment with EH&S derived mouse Laminin-111, a form of laminin found in embryonic muscle, reduces muscle
pathology, maintains muscle strength and dramatically increases life expectancy in a mouse model of LAMA2-
CMD. We have shown that mouse Laminin-111 treatment can functionally substitute for Laminin-211 to slow
muscle disease progression after disease onset in the dyW-/- mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. Finally, we have
demonstrated mouse Laminin-111 protein therapy is scalable and promotes muscle regeneration in the GRMD
dog model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Together these data support the idea that Laminin-111 could serve
as an effective protein substitution therapy for LAMA2-CMD. Recently, large quantities of recombinant human
Laminin-111 (rhLAM-111) have been produced in using a propriety cell line and purification strategy. Our studies
have shown rhLAM-111 treatment improved the activity of dyW-/- mice, reduced kyphosis and increased the
strength of Laminin-2 deficient muscle. These studies have also raised important questions concerning the
biological role that Laminin isoforms play in myomatrix remodeling, muscle cell signaling, myogenesis, motor
neuron myelination and nerve conduction. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that recombinant
human laminin can restore the myomatrix, promote muscle regeneration and improve neuromuscular
function in a mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: First, we will
examine and quantify changes to the muscle myomatrix and muscle signaling pathways with rhLAM-111 or
rhLAM-211 treatment using CosMx digital spatial profiling and super-resolution microscopy. Second, we will
investigate if rhLAM-111 or rhLAM-211 protein therapy restores myogenic repair program by assaying myogenic
renewal and muscle repair in a mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. Finally, we will determine if rhLAM-111 or rhLAM-
211 protein therapy restores motor neuron myelination and nerve conduction in a mouse model of LAMA2-CMD.
Together, this study will contribute to our understanding of how laminin treatment can remodel the extracellular
matrix, the role laminin plays in muscle regeneration, and if laminin treatment can improve nerve conduction and
restore neuromuscular function."

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and negatively impacts daily functioning, quality of life, and work
productivity. Despite the high prevalence of insomnia, particularly in women, and >40 years of extensive
research efforts, the field still lacks a solid understanding of how insomnia should be assessed and defined.
For example, polysomnography (PSG) has failed to yield a consistent pattern of objective impairment and, in
fact, often fails to distinguish individuals with insomnia from good sleepers. Clinical diagnosis of Insomnia
Disorder is therefore based solely on subjective report of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (DIMS)
associated with perceived distress or impairment. Earlier diagnostic editions differentiated multiple subtypes
based on patterns of clinical symptoms that failed to demonstrate reliability and validity and have since been
abandoned. Insomnia is now operationalized as a monolithic subjective entity despite the likelihood that it is
instead a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial etiology and presentation with complexity akin to
depression. Heterogeneity significantly reduces the likelihood of understanding the pathophysiology of
insomnia or realizing a goal of personalized insomnia treatment. We propose that the time is ripe for a
reconceptualization that combines knowledge about subjective and objective DIMS with mechanistic factors
known to be associated with insomnia: hyperarousal and circadian misalignment (i.e. sleeping out of phase
with endogenous rhythms). To that end, this proposal seeks to revisit the operationalization of insomnia to
derive a classification system with high reliability and validity. We will recruit n=400 individuals with subjective
DIMS, defined as sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, and/or early morning awakenings >30
minutes. Following home sleep apnea screening, in depth phenotyping will assess four constructs of insomnia:
1) subjective DIMS based on sleep diaries and retrospective self-report; 2) objective DIMS with actigraphy and
home PSG; 3) physiologic (heart rate variability), cognitive (self-report) and cortical (beta EEG) hyperarousal;
and 4) circadian misalignment defined as the phase angle between dim light melatonin onset and midpoint of
sleep along with subjective and actigraphic measures of rhythmicity. Structural equation modeling and latent
profile analysis will be used to both derive latent factors underlying each dimension (dimensional model) and to
categorize individuals into distinct subgroups based on these inputs (categorical model). Reliability will be
examined in a subset (n=200) by conducting a second assessment one month later to assess for temporal
stability of categories and dimensions. Concurrent validity of each dimension and category will be assessed by
examining associations with validators of subjective distress, mental health symptoms, quality of life,
neurocognitive performance and peripheral inflammation."

The vascular endothelium forms a highly regulated permeability barrier between the blood stream and
interstitial tissues. Excessive vascular leakiness contributes to many inflammation related disease processes,
including edema, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemic stroke, and hemorrhage. To
prevent tissue damage resulting from vascular leakiness during inflammation, there is a need to be able to
enhance endothelial barrier function. Intercellular junctions control changes in endothelial paracellular
permeability, and Vascular-endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin, CDH5) is a major regulator of endothelial
junctions and paracellular permeability. We will explore a novel hypothesis and approach to understanding its
role in permeability regulation, based on our findings of allosteric regulation of other cadherins at the cell
surface in response to signaling events. The main hypothesis to be examined is that allosteric regulation of VE-
cadherin, in coordination with activities of the actin cytoskeleton, is a key mechanism by which it regulates
endothelial permeability in response to a range of vascular factors. We will use two novel activating
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to VE-cadherin that prevent the increase in endothelial permeability induced by
thrombin, VEGF, and TNFa, as major tools to test this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo and to study the
mechanism of regulation. The specific aims are: A. Determine whether VE-cadherin cell surface regulation is a
common mechanism for a range of endothelial physiological processes. In vitro experiments will be used to
determine whether it is similarly regulated by other key factors, including histamine, angiopoietins, Tie2
receptors, and S1P. Endothelial cells from different microvascular beds will be examined. Collaborative
experiments will be done to determine flow and shear forces affect mAb induced barrier function. We will also
investigate whether activating mAbs inhibit leukocyte diapedesis or affect endothelial morphogenesis and
angiogenesis. B. Elucidate the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying VE-cadherin cell surface
regulation. We will investigate the structural and biophysical basis of its activation by mAbs and test the roles
of the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and associated catenins in activation. We’ll also explore the relationship
between cell surface regulation and endocytosis as well as barrier altering cytoskeletal functions.
C. Investigate whether activation of VE-cadherin by mAbs enhances barrier function in vivo in mice in leaky
vascular conditions or inflammation. We’ll test the effects of activating mAbs on induced acute induced
vascular leak, and leukocyte infiltration. We will also examine their effects on mouse models of inflammatory
disease processes involving the vasculature, including sepsis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. These studies
will help us understand regulation of endothelial permeability and develop novel approaches to enhance
endothelial barrier function to reduce inflammatory processes and diseases."

This proposal seeks continued support, via an institutional training grant, for a training program for pre and
postdoctoral fellows who will pursue research careers that focus on genetic influences on mental health
behavior genetics. The faculty, from the Institute for Behavioral Genetics (IBG) and collaborating units, is
distinguished and active in research, and IBG scientists are actively pursuing well-funded studies of genetic
influences on brain function and plasticity, psychological, cognitive and brain development directly relevant to
mental health, and psychiatric disorders. The application of biometrical, statistical, and quantitative genetic
techniques, together with bioinformatics, genome-wide analyses and next generation sequencing, and
epigenetics, is providing real advances in knowledge. Neuro-chemical, -pharmacological, -physiological, and
molecular genetic studies, are providing an understanding of gene function related to behavior. Since our last
application, we have added a major commitment to functional and structural brain imaging as a research tool
and have expanded our faculty and training program accordingly. Our research and training include the use of
large scale collaborative studies that are amassing DNA repositories and rich phenotypic data sets available
for studies of mental health. These include the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, for
which our training faculty are PIs of the twin study component, the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium, the UK
Biobank, and GSCAN, a genome wide study of over 1 million cases. IBG facilities are available for gene
function and expression studies, and behavioral, biochemical, and neurophysiological studies, and we are
actively pursuing animal model studies of the functional implications of genetic variation robustly associated
with phenotypes in the human population. To reflect the expanded need for training, particularly for genetics
expertise applied in the context of ABCD, brain imaging, translational research, and `big data' studies, funds
are requested to support 6 pre-doctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees. Trainees will typically be supported for up
to 3 years. Pre-doctoral trainees receive doctorate degrees from a cooperating academic unit and certification
in behavior genetics. Academic requirements in the training program include training in behavior genetics,
quantitative and biometrical genetics, theoretical and computer-based statistics, molecular genetics,
neuroscience, bioinformatics and genomics, mandatory training in the responsible conduct of research, and
courses on behavioral, brain imaging, and clinical phenotypes. Additional requirements vary according to the
degree granting academic unit. Research is an integral part of training. Postdoctoral trainees also pursue a
formalized program that emphasizes individual research as well as competence in molecular and quantitative
behavior genetics. Other activities in preparation for research careers in mental health include: supervision of
students and/or technicians, hosting of seminar speakers and conference organization, guest lecturing, a
weekly journal club, grant writing, and the development of individual professional plans."
10861934,"Project Summary/Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious medical challenges of our time. This crisis puts patients at risk
of untreatable bacterial infections and threatens major advances of modern medicine that rely on antibiotics
(transplants, chemotherapy, etc). There are at least 2 million antibiotic resistant infections each year in the US,
leading to over 23,000 deaths. It is estimated that without significant action, worldwide annual mortality due to
these infections will reach 10 million by 2050, surpassing the predicted mortality from cancer. Unfortunately,
some bacteria, including specific isolates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and
carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), are now resistant to all available antibiotics and are
essentially untreatable. In such instances, combinations of antibiotics are employed to try to overcome the
resistance to individual drugs, but are only sporadically effective. When and why combinations work is unclear,
and clinicians therefore lack a sound scientific rationale for choosing antibiotics to include in these regimens.
Our research has revealed an unexpected principle, distinct from antibiotic synergy, that can be used
to design personalized combinations to kill clinical bacterial isolates including pan-resistant strains.
This combination therapy approach is based on heteroresistance, an enigmatic form of antibiotic resistance in
which a bacterial isolate harbors a resistant subpopulation that can rapidly replicate in the presence of an
antibiotic, while the majority susceptible population is killed. However, we now show that when combined, two
antibiotics to which a given strain is heteroresistant, kill the bacteria as each drug inhibits the subpopulation of
cells resistant to the other [Band et al, Nature Microbiology, 2019]. Thus, heteroresistance towards multiple
antibiotics (“multiple heteroresistance”) can be exploited as a bacterial Achilles' heel and the basis of effective
combination regimens. Importantly, this method employs existing FDA-approved antibiotics and can be
employed in the clinic immediately. This paradigm-shifting approach to combination therapy has the
potential to have a major translational impact, but must first be broadly and thoroughly interrogated. Here, we
propose to use a robust set of CRE and CRAB clinical isolates from a Georgia-based surveillance initiative to
test for heteroresistance to a wide range of antibiotics. This will allow the selection and in vitro and in vivo
testing of combinations targeting multiple heteroresistance. We will further study the relationship between the
resistant subpopulations in multiple heteroresistant isolates, as well as performing dynamic flow experiments to
determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of effective combinations. This research has the
potential to provide clinicians with a rational and predictable method with which to prescribe effective antibiotic
combinations to treat bacterial infections, including those currently considered untreatable."

(40 with disability, 80 without disability) will be evaluated utilizing each test. Their scores will be
correlated to the PROMIS Short Form for Physical Activity, surface electromyography,
kinematics, and pressure produced at the foot. The findings of the study will result in an
understanding of how trunk function impacts the ability to move and stabilize the trunk. VoAS

tests."
10855667,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Implantable neuromodulation devices for seizure control have emerged as an important treatment for medically
refractory epilepsy, particularly for focal seizure disorders increasingly identified as distributed in networks not
amenable for surgical resection. Current devices, however, are not suited for monitoring and modulating a
brain network due to limitations in channel count, computational capabilities, programmability, and power
budget. Our long-term goal is to develop a programmable, low power embedded device which can be used for
the control of seizures through monitoring and modulating brain network activity. The overall objective of this
application, which is the next step towards attaining our long-term goal, is to develop a programmable
computational device to perform signal processing in real-time and monitor and modulate multiple brain
locations within a tight power budget. In conjunction with this hardware solution, we will implement an open
language and evaluate the hardware and software solutions through bench and animal studies. Our central
hypothesis, based on our preliminary work, is that instead of the current approach of performing feature
detection in an analog front-end or using a single application specific IC (ASIC) – which place hard constraints
on programmability – a programmable and low power digital design can be achieved with asynchronous (clock-
less) design. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the hardware and software solutions are
developed, we will be able to more readily advance the use of devices for seizure control and for research on
brain networks. We will achieve the objective of this program through three aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a
processor called neuro Stream for real-time processing of streaming multichannel data. Neuro Stream will
feature a reduced instruction set computer-V (RISC-V) microcontroller unit, processing elements for specific
signal processing tasks, and a vector engine. Neuro Stream will be designed using asynchronous techniques,
operate within a limited power budget, and support execution of a wide range of computational methods. In
Aim 2 we will implement open languages neuro Octave and neuropy. Neuro Octave will be a subset of Octave,
an open-source language. Neuropy will be a subset of Python. Neuro Octave and neuropy will allow users to
develop their own programs for neuro Stream using familiar, commonly used, languages. In Aim 3 we will
implement monitoring and control algorithms in neuro Stream and control seizures in a model of epilepsy. This
contribution will be significant because it will bring the development of epilepsy devices fully into the realm of
the network theory of epilepsy allowing developments in the modulation of networks to emerge and be applied
for the device-based control of seizures. The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because in
contrast to previous advances, we will develop a programmable, powerful, all-digital solution which can be

Candidate: The overall goal of this K01 career development proposal is to provide me with the training
experience needed to become a leader in health equity research with American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN)
populations. My preliminary Community Based Participator Research (CBPR) work with AI/AN communities
showed that grief symptoms negatively impact health and wellness. As my research progressed, it became
clear that culturally grounded mental health services were needed for people struggling with losing a loved
one. These findings helped shape the direction for this K01 proposal, which aims to culturally adapt and pilot
test the feasibility of Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure for Grief (BATE-G) with AI/AN
participants. To accomplish research and training goals for this K01 project, I will work closely with community
partners and academic mentors. The training plan is structured to support training in: 1) designing randomized
control trials for behavioral health interventions, 2) developing advanced quantitative analysis skills, 3)
developing and leading CBPR projects, and 4) developing skills in implementation science. The mentorship
team will also provide guidance throughout the proposed research project.
Research: AI/AN populations in the United States have the highest early death rates for young people
compared to White, Black, and Hispanic populations.1-4 High mortality rates in AI/AN communities are
attributed to chronic illness, accidental injuries, interpersonal violence/homicide, and suicide.1, 5 Experiencing
the sudden or unexpected death of a loved one increases the risk of developing disabling grief-related
symptoms, which can lead to Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder (PCBD).6 PCBD is characterized

Cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have provided unprecedented
access to the human central nervous system (CNS). They have enabled the assembly of models for the
investigation of neurodevelopment and neurological disease mechanisms, which have led to significant
advancements in our understanding of these processes. However, culturing iPSC-derived neurons in vitro
remains technically challenging. Neurons grown in cell autonomous systems exhibit insufficient levels of
morphological maturation, synaptic connectivity, metabolic function, and electrophysiological activity, while
transcriptional analyses suggest they resemble neurons of late embryonic to early postnatal stages hindering
the study of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that the lack of a physiological,
developmentally appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) platform is a major contributor to these limitations. The
ECM is an intricately organized intercellular scaffold of secreted proteins and complex sugars that configures
spatiotemporal microenvironments throughout the CNS. It provides critical structural support to neurons,
astrocytes, and glial cells, serves as a reservoir for soluble factors, and mediates cellular signaling. Through
these actions, the ECM can modulate neuronal development, maturation, and aging. However, the temporal
diversity and functional effects of the matrisome, defined as the ensemble of the ECM and ECM-associated
proteins, in the CNS is poorly characterized. As a result, the design of in vitro platforms for culturing iPSC-derived
neurons that truly recapitulate the physiological ECM is impossible. Here, we will refine iPSC-neuronal model
systems by providing developmentally appropriate ECM cues. In Aim 1 we will utilize biochemical purification
and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to define the composition and nature of remodeling
of the in vivo matrisome from extracted mouse spinal cords at 3 developmental stages (postnatal, adult, old). In
Aim 2 we will leverage our combined expertise in iPSC technologies and biomaterials to establish ECM mimetic
matrices that can recapitulate the architecture and modulatory activity of the physiological matrisome to facilitate
the maturation and aging of stem cell derived spinal motor neurons in vitro. In Aim 3 we will improve the
development and reproducibility of 3-D spinal organoids by growing them in structured scaffolds with
incorporated candidate ECM cues. Our proposed aims will shed light into the contribution of the temporal
matrisome on neuronal diversity, development and function and facilitate the establishment of physiological
iPSC-based spinal cord model systems."
10836269,"Project Summary: Parent award: Biological processes ranging from gene transcription to behavior oscillate and
are synchronized to the 24-hour day/night cycle. Mammalian circadian rhythms, orchestrated by the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) allow appropriately timed physiological and behavioral responses
to daily recurring external cues (i.e. sunrise or timed meal availability). The resulting synchrony of physiology to
the astronomical day maximizes metabolic efficiency and good health. However, many of the stresses of modern
society (i.e. artificial lighting and omnipresence of food) weaken and desynchronize circadian rhythms. This in
turn increases the prevalence of many pathologies including metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative
diseases. The aim of my laboratory is to determine how circadian rhythms are synchronized to external cues
(circadian entrainment) and how desynchronization impacts health. Although the neuronal pathways of light-
driven entrainment are well-established, how other external cues, such as food availability, social interactions or
exercise, influence the workings of the SCN remains unknown. In a recent breakthrough, we identified a neuronal
connection between midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are activated in response to salient events and SCN
neurons that express the dopamine receptor Drd1. We showed that this pathway accelerates photoentrainment
and drives palatable food consumption outside of mealtimes. In parallel, we identified a novel molecular player
that is necessary for anticipation-related activity to time-restricted food access. Here, we propose to leverage
our expertise in disentangling circadian entrainment neurocircuitry to delineate the mechanisms by which
rewarding cues modulate the SCN circadian clock. Furthermore, we will determine whether strengthening
circadian rhythmicity ameliorates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Our first objective is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how salient events impact SCN activity and circadian entrainment. We hypothesize
that activation of dopaminergic signaling decreases the amplitude of SCN oscillation and allows faster
photoentrainment. This novel insight will be useful to develop strategies to curb the negative impact of circadian
desynchrony. Our second goal is to identify the midbrain dopaminergic cell population that targets the SCN and
promotes palatable food consumption outside of meal times, leading to weight gain and metabolic disorder. We
predict that by mimicking dopaminergic signaling in the SCN, we will control food consumption. Delineating this
pathway will provide therapeutic targets against diet induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity. Our final
objective is to determine if high amplitude circadian rhythms, by daily consolidation of light and food access, is
sufficient to slow the progression of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). If successful, entrainment
strategies will become potential treatments for AD patients and people with high-risk of developing AD. We
expect our work will provide a better understanding of the relationship between entrainment cues, physiology
and behavior while providing tangible strategies against the adverse consequences of circadian misalignment."
10854799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally impacted rural communities, which are often health
professional shortage areas that lack health care infrastructure, including hospitals1-3. When compared to
urban populations, individuals living in rural areas are more vaccine hesitant8,9, have a higher prevalence of
comorbid health conditions that increase their risk for severe COVID-19 complications12, and are at greater risk
from SARS-CoV-2 variants due to lower vaccination rates and fewer vaccination mandates33,40. Thus,
interventions to increase vaccine uptake in rural areas are greatly needed. As the most accessible healthcare
professional in rural areas4,5 and one of the most trusted sources of medication information16, community
pharmacists are well-positioned to address vaccine hesitancy with underserved, rural populations.
Because vaccination conversations are sensitive and often politically charged, pharmacists need
implementation support, including training and ongoing guidance to deliver evidence-based vaccine
hesitancy counseling interventions18. Implementation facilitation, in which trained facilitators coach and
troubleshoot problems with professionals as they implement new practices, increases adoption of practices
with fidelity23-26. However, implementation facilitation generally, and virtual facilitation (e.g., video coaching) in
particular, has not been systematically studied in community pharmacy settings. The need to examine the
effectiveness of virtual facilitation as a means to increase vaccine hesitancy counseling and COVID-19
vaccination is of great importance given the large travel distances to rural areas and social distancing.
Our goal is to test if virtual facilitation increases rural pharmacists’ ability to implement COVID-19 vaccine
hesitancy counseling when compared to a “standard” implementation approach (e.g., training and
dissemination of implementation support tools). Using a rural pharmacy practice-based research network
(PBRN) that spans 5 southeastern states, we propose two aims. Aim 1 involves a stepped-wedge trial with 30
rural pharmacies to test whether virtual facilitation outperforms the standard approach in increasing: (a) the
fidelity with which pharmacists implement the vaccine hesitancy counseling intervention and (b) the number of
vaccine hesitant patients who agree to receive the vaccine. Using a project-sponsored data collection system,
we will gather data on implementation outcomes, including fidelity and effectiveness. In Aim 2, we will conduct
a cost assessment to explore the sustainability of virtual facilitation. We are uniquely positioned to test these
competing implementation approaches and leverage rural community pharmacists to engage in vaccine
hesitancy counseling in rural communities that have low vaccination rates."
10854800,"This application requests T32 funding to support pre-doctoral training at the chemistry-biology interface at the
University of Georgia. This award will replace the current T32 Glycoscience Training Program (GTP) that was
established in 2014. The mission of the GTP is to train the next generation of glycoscience researchers and
prepare them for impactful careers in the biomedical workforce. In 2012 the National Academy of Sciences and
Engineering issued a report concluding that the Glycosciences were significantly understudied in the United
States and encouraged government agencies including the NIH to develop training programs to accelerate
discovery in this critical research area. Despite the significant role that glycans play in biology and medicine, no
other T32 training program in the United States focuses on glycans; thus, the GTP broadens the scope of NIH-
supported training programs. The GTP capitalizes on the uniquely rich environment for carbohydrate research
that exists at the University of Georgia. Twenty-four researchers from eight departments will serve as trainers
for a diverse group of pre-doctoral students. Trainees are selected from a pool of applicants that enter the
university’s graduate program either through the Integrated Life Sciences (ILS) umbrella program or through
admission into the Department of Chemistry. The grant will provide stipends for six trainees per year for two-
year appointments. The university will provide funding for two additional trainees per year to expand the impact
of the GTP. The principal objective of this program is to provide a broad background in glycoscience with the
ability to carry that knowledge forward into a variety of careers. Training emphasizes scientific reasoning, rigor
in research design, quantitative skills, and data analysis. All trainees will enroll in professional development
courses on the Responsible Conduct of Research and on Rigor, Reproducibility, and Transparency, and take
foundational courses in Glycochemistry and Glycobiology. All of these courses are open to any student,
broadening the impact of the GTP beyond the T32-supported trainees. Trainees can select from a variety of
courses to build knowledge and skills in analytical, computational, or biological methods. Opportunities will be
provided to develop strong written and oral communication skills in coursework, journal clubs, and seminar
programs. The trainers will provide a supportive, inclusive, and diverse training environment, and are
committed to continuous improvement as mentors through participation in workshops and training programs on
topics such as effective mentoring, safe space in the workplace, and implicit bias. Mentor effectiveness will be
evaluated using metrics developed with a recent supplemental grant to T32 and T25 programs on the UGA
campus, and these data will guide the continuous improvement of mentoring in the GTP. We will track student
outcomes and use annual program evaluations to make evidence-based decisions to refine recruiting and
training practices. Improved methods for mentoring and training will be disseminated widely to impact graduate
training on a national scale."
10854802,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic has had significant impact on the health and well-being of
adults and children alike. In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fractures in many
systems including education, the economy, housing, and healthcare, widening known racial disparities. This is
of particular importance considering the criticality of the peripartum period on early neurodevelopment. Recent
findings suggest that early maternal symptomatology can have lasting, and negative effects on parent-child
interactions, infant/child development, and mental health of both women and children. Overall, these findings
take on further importance when contextualizing the disparate exposure of Black children and their families to
structural racism and the COIVD-19 pandemic. Although there is increasing knowledge of the impact of structural
racism on child development beginning prenatally, mechanisms underpinning this transmission are still being
investigated. Identifying women disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic conditions
(syndemic) during the peripartum period, provides an opportunity to understand the developing child’s
environment, mother’s mental health, and parenting experience, with the long-term goal of improving
infant/young child neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes by ensuring appropriate, precise, culturally-
informed interventions. The proposed multi-methods project consists of three aims that will longitudinally
examine child neurodevelopmental outcomes by early identification of racially/ethnically diverse mothers with
mental health challenges. The first aim implements extensive screening of postpartum Black and non-Latinx
White (NLW) mothers using a battery of questionnaires and clinical psychiatric interviews to identify mothers
currently experiencing distress and psychopathology, as well as determining resilience factors uncovering cross-
cultural differences that may exist. Fathers/secondary caregivers will also complete similar questionnaires
assessing levels of support. The second aim identifies maternal concern about their child’s development and
mental health at two developmental time points (24 and 48-months) and assesses mother/child interactions on
a series of dyadic tasks. The final aim consists of qualitative interviews with a sub-sample of Black women
characterizing the impact of the syndemic on their mental health, parenting practices, perceptions of their child’s
early development, and trust in the healthcare system. The overarching goal of this application is to deeply
characterize the experiences of women and children impacted by the syndemic, filling the gap in the research
by identifying specific maternal and environmental factors and mechanisms that critically influence early child
development and mental health and allowing for future intervention development."

The Brown University Proteomics Core Facility seeks to acquire cutting-edge instrumentation to advance
research in cancer biology, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, immunology, and infectious diseases.
Specifically, we propose to acquire an Eclipse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, Vanquish Neo UHPLC, and FAIMS
Pro Duo Interface through an S10 HEI Grant. This acquisition will benefit major and minor users at Brown
University and the broader research community in Rhode Island in a state designated by the NIH as an IDeA
state identified as needing increased research infrastructure support. The proposed instruments will significantly
enhance the capabilities of our Proteomics Core Facility, enabling advanced, accurate, and precise analysis of
proteins and peptides. The Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer combines high-resolution mass
spectrometry with sensitivity, speed, and dynamic range. This instrument will enable the identification and
quantification of proteins, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions with unparalleled
precision and accuracy. The Vanquish Neo UHPLC is a high-performance liquid chromatography system that
delivers exceptional separation and resolution. It will allow for efficient sample preparation and increased
throughput for large-scale proteomic experiments at nanoliter amounts. The FAIMS Pro Duo Interface provides
additional selectivity and sensitivity in protein and peptide analysis. It enhances ion separation and increases
the dynamic range of mass spectrometry, enabling the detection of low-abundance peptide species with greater
accuracy. In support of the newly formed Legorreta Cancer Center at Brown, these instruments will benefit
research in cancer biology, where the ability to detect and quantify specific proteins and their modifications is
critical for understanding disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. The instruments will also facilitate
research in the Center on the Biology of Aging, and the Carney Institute for Brain Science, where identifying
disease-related biomarkers from precious samples is essential. In immunology and infectious diseases, the
instruments will enable the identification and quantification of immune system proteins and parasite or pathogen-
derived molecules, aiding in the development of vaccines and therapies. Overall, the acquisition of these
instruments will enhance the Proteomics Core Facility's capabilities and enable cutting-edge research in major
disease areas. The benefits will extend beyond Brown University to the broader research community in Rhode
Island, including undergraduate institutions. This proposal aligns with the NIH's mission to support research that
advances our understanding of disease mechanisms and improves human health."

 The University of North Alabama (UNA) Occupational Health Science (OHS) Program (formerly called
Industrial Hygiene) is one of four baccalaureate programs in the United States accredited by the Applied and
Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC) of ABET. The program, which requires a major in OHS
and chemistry minor, has earned a reputation for graduating a pool of qualified industrial hygienists who
provide valuable services to workers and employers in this geographical region and beyond. Enrollment in the
program remains sufficient, necessitating consistent offerings of OHS courses and yielding viable graduation
outputs. The continuation of the NIOSH Training Project Grant (TPG) is essential to remain effective in
recruiting and retaining students with good scholastic merits, to maintain the current expectations of academic
quality, and to expand into new and promising foreseeable opportunities. The objectives of this proposal for the
continuation of the NIOSH-TPG are threefold: (i) to promote and further the recruitment of qualified students in
the OHS field; (ii) to support and strengthen continuous academic improvement; and (iii) to expand and
develop the educational opportunities and services of the OHS Program.
 Recruitment will be promoted by academic scholarships (NIOSH TPG and departmental) and strategic
recruitment and retention efforts involving on-campus events to promote retention of current majors and target
undecided majors; off-campus events focused on area high schools identified as feeder schools and schools
with underrepresented populations; and an enhanced social media campaign utilizing custom made videos
highlighting the OHS major. Continuous improvement will be approached by periodic evaluations of
educational objectives, annual evaluations of student outcomes, and timely correction of shortcomings.
Expanded educational opportunities will include an initiative to develop international collaborations for this
degree program and an evaluation of the potential and opportunity to add a related master’s program.
 The NIOSH TPG has been pivotal in supporting this baccalaureate program in OHS housed at a regional
university. From dismal enrollment figures that threatened its viability, the UNA OHS program blossomed into a
successful academic program that is often highlighted as exemplary by UNA administrators and noticed by
stakeholders as an effective contributor to the advancement of OHS. The discontinuation of this grant may
certainly halt the continuous path of success and affect our ability to recruit students, particularly those
academically gifted students whom we have seen populating our program over the years."

This is an application requesting funds to purchase a Bruker timsTOF HT mass spectrometer and NanoElute 2
liquid chromatography system that will be used for proteomics research. The instrument will be integrated into
the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School/Rutgers-New Brunswick Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility in
Piscataway New Jersey. We current operate two mass spectrometers, a Thermo Eclipse tribrid, which is used
for the majority of our projects and an almost 10-year old Thermo QExactive HF. There are two justifications
for our request. First, we need additional capacity. The Eclipse is used at maximal capacity thus we require
additional an instrument to meet the demands of our NIH-funded investigators. In addition, we have no substitute
for the Eclipse when the instrument in inoperable - the QExactive, which is close to the end of its functional
lifespan, cannot replace the Eclipse for most projects. Second, we need additional capabilities. The proteomics
field is increasingly turning towards label-free, data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteome-wide
quantitative mass spectrometry. Our Eclipse is an excellent instrument in many respects but our comparison
studies clearly indicate that the Eclipse is inferior to the Bruker timsTOF in terms of proteome coverage, number
of peptides assigned and accuracy of quantitation. This instrument will greatly enhance the ability of NIH-funded
scientists on the Piscataway and New Brunswick campuses of Rutgers University to conduct cutting-edge
biomedical research and it will also provide access to cutting-edge technology for the many new junior Faculty
recruits at Rutgers. Availability of this technology will allow our User group to better address a wide range of
specific diseases including asthma and respiratory disease, neurological disease, bacterial and viral infection,
disruption of endocrine function, skin disorders, sleep disorders, diabetes, digestive disease, inflammation and
cancer, as well as other fundamental issues of biomedical importance. The requested instrument will represent
a significant asset to our research community and will accelerate the pace of basic and applied biomedical
research of NIH-funded investigators on the New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses of Rutgers, the State
University of New Jersey."
10851375,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aging is a complex condition with diverse physiological effects ranging from the cellular to organismal levels,
such as the dysregulation of metabolism. While many distinct aspects of aging have been characterized, a
wholistic understanding of how these aspects function together will be necessary to define and treat age-
associated health decline and diseases more effectively. One way to address this is by better understanding the
inter-organ communication (IOC) that coordinates aging mechanisms between tissues. Our proposal focuses on
the IOC between aging metabolic tissues and how this communication alters metabolism and impacts biological
age. We propose a multi-omics approach of single-cell transcriptomics, tissue-specific proteomics,
metabolomics, and bioinformatics to work towards a system-level understanding of IOC, metabolism, and aging
in Drosophila melanogaster. We have recently generated the Aging Fly Cell Atlas (AFCA), the most
comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic dataset to-date of an entire aging organism. We will exploit and build
upon these data to identify novel IOC, tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming, and sex differences during
natural fly aging. Additionally, we propose system-level IOC and metabolomic characterization of 1) pro-longevity
models of mTOR inhibition in adult flies using tissue-specific FoxO activation and rapamycin feeding and 2)
advanced aging models of degenerative muscle stress and human Tau-induced neurodegeneration. We will
correlate findings from these models with those from the AFCA to discover anti-aging targets within the IOC
network that will modulate aging metabolism in a tissue-specific fashion. This work has the potential to 1) better
understand how organismal metabolism is regulated via IOC; 2) develop strategies to enhance anti-aging
therapies such as rapamycin; 3) identify disease mechanisms of muscle and neural degeneration that affect
otherwise healthy distant tissues; 4) ultimately elucidate fundamental system-level aging biology and accelerate
the discoveries of new anti-aging therapies."

Vascular calcification is the major precursor to cardiovascular disease and is further
exacerbated by chronic kidney disease. Black or African Americans are more than 3
times as likely and Hispanics or Latinos are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure
compared to White Americans. In addition to Black Americans having higher rates of
heart and kidney diseases, they also often live in rural or impoverished areas that are
food deserts. Low-income areas are more than often communities with a lack of access
to healthy foods, otherwise known as food deserts. Heart disease and other CVCs such
as chronic kidney disease, Stroke, and etc are the leading cause of death for African-
Americans, more so African-American males. While phosphate is a natural element that
is found in meat and dairy products, it is also a known precursor to vascular calcification
which leads to the onset of CVCs and other complications. The levels of phosphate in
industrially processed foods and meats are found to be much higher than levels in fresh
produce. Increased serum levels of inorganic phosphate leads to calcification of
vascular smooth muscle cells and a phenotypic switch to an osteoblast-like cell. Once
thought to be a passive process of calcium and phosphate deposition within arteries,
vascular calcification is now known to be an active, cell-regulated condition. There is a
clinical need to develop a therapy for vascular calcification that reduces calcification
without causing arterial damage similar to current therapies such as endovascular stent
and atherectomy. This project will examine the role of phosphate in vascular smooth
muscle cell calcification and the potential of protein therapy to reduce calcification. The
proposed protein therapy would include reestablish fetuin-A to its native levels to treat
smooth muscle cell calcification in patients with the comorbidities of heart disease and
chronic kidney disease. Fetuin-A forms in the liver, gets released into the blood stream,
then stabilizes free calcium-phosphate clusters into calciprotein particles that are filtered
from the blood by the kidneys and excreted through urine. Through a collaboration with
MSU Extension we will work to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce while
allowing the participants to give back to their communities and help older generations."

The San Diego Biomedical Informatics Education & Research (SABER) training program was awarded an NLM
training grant in the summer of 2012 and renewed in 2017. In this renewal proposal, we describe our
accomplishments for the past 8.75 years and our vision for the next five years. The SABER training program
includes core faculty from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Health Department of Biomedical
Informatics, as well as multiple faculty across UCSD. Since the start of this program in 2012, we have hosted 78
long- and short-term trainees.
Our pre-doctoral trainees enroll in competitive doctoral programs in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB),
Computer Science, Cognitive Science, or Biomedical Sciences. Trainees complete a foundational curriculum in
biomedical informatics (BMI), taught by our core faculty, in addition to core curricula from their respective degree
programs. All of our trainees have been meeting their academic milestones and 11 have graduated. Our post-
doctoral trainees enroll in a master’s program (Computer Science or Advanced Sciences), in addition to
completing our foundational BMI curriculum. These trainees are embedded in projects at the medical center that
help them contextualize the research methods they learn through coursework. All of our short-term trainees are
under-represented minorities in science and participate in various research projects leading to presentations and
publications. Most trainees who completed our BMI training have research positions in industry and academia—
a few are continuing their training, two are employed in non-profit organizations, and several became assistant
professors at various institutions (Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UCSF, UCSD, Vanderbilt, etc.).
Some highlights of our training in the past five years have been the high productivity of our trainees, who are
pursuing innovative research in a wide spectrum of informatics areas of specialization, from translational
bioinformatics to clinical research informatics to healthcare informatics. Additionally, the proportion of women
(57%) and under-represented minorities (49%) is high in our overall trainee pool. We have filled all of our slots
each year with highly qualified candidates from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds, who have already
produced first-author publications in high impact journals (e.g., Cell, Science, JAMIA, PNAS) and conferences."
10860971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell type-specific transcriptional networks are gene regulatory networks that dynamically reconfigure to drive
precise spatio-temporal expression patterns of genes. These networks are central to cell type specificity and are
often disrupted in many diseases. The structure of these networks is defined by a trans component that specifies
which regulatory proteins control a gene’s expression and a cis component that species the regulatory regions
that can regulate a gene’s expression both proximally and distally. Identifying these regulatory networks has
been a significant challenge for mammalian cell types because of the number of potential regulators of a gene
and the large number of assays needed to define these networks accurately. Advances in single cell omics
technologies, such as single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), offer new
opportunities to define cell type-specific regulatory networks because of their ability to comprehensively profile
the transcriptome and accessibility for thousands of individual cells. However, computational methods for
integrating these data to define both cell lineage structure and cell-type specific regulatory networks are limited.
Most methods have used only one type of assay focusing either on the cis or trans components and have not
modeled temporal or hierarchical relatedness of multi-sample datasets. Finally, performance of computational
network inference methods has remained low when compared to experimentally detected networks. To address
these challenges, we will develop novel computational methods and powerful resources for mapping gene
regulatory network dynamics driving cell type specificity. Our aims are to (a) develop a computational toolkit to
integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to infer both cell type lineage (Aim 1) and cell type-specific
transcriptional regulatory networks from scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (Aim 2), (b) identify the rewired network
components during a dynamic progress such as cellular reprogramming (Aim 2), and (c) develop an active
learning based approach to infer causal regulatory networks and apply this framework to refine the regulatory
networks for cellular reprogramming (Aim 3). We will apply our tools to public and newly collected datasets as
part of this project. Our analysis will reveal cis and trans regulatory network components associated with cell fate
specification during a dynamic process such as reprogramming or development. Our active learning approach
will use Perturb-Seq to perform regulator perturbations to both validate the predicted networks as well as to
establish improved gold standards for a system with high significance for translational and basic research. The
tools and datasets generated by this project will be publicly available and will serve as a powerful resource to
understand regulatory network dynamics in cell fate specification. Our tools should be broadly applicable to
define regulatory network dynamics for diverse biological processes."

and practice of macromolecular chemistry, mechanism, and structure. All aspects of the
program - formal course curriculum, laboratory rotations, informal specialized area-interest

at the question: how do biological macromolecules work? How do proteins, membranes,
nucleic acids, and high-order complexes of these huge molecules use physical-chemical and
structural principles to act in the enormous variety of contexts that underlie biological function?
The Training Program provides support for selected students in the Graduate Program in
Biochemistry and Biophysics at Brandeis University. This is a flexible PhD program designed for
two broad types of students: those with strong quantitative backgrounds but who may have
weaker prior training experience in biological chemistry, and those with more traditional training
in biochemistry and cell biology. Our intention is to bring these two groups of students to the
same end-point and to prepare them for careers in basic research. Currently, 34 students are
enrolled in this Ph.D. program; the Training Program includes 25 participating faculty, from four
departments, working in the following areas: macromolecular structure determination by x-ray
crystallography and NMR, mechanistic enzymology, bioinorganic chemistry emphasizing epr
and Mössbauer spectroscopy, membrane transport and ion channel mechanisms, single-
molecule analysis, virology, chemical biology, computational biophysics, and protein evolution."

 There are no effective therapies to treat Cryptosporidium, a waterborne parasite that is now recognized
as significant cause of diarrheal disease worldwide and an important AIDS defining pathogen. In the process
of mining compounds produced by marine symbiotic bacteria for anti-parasitic activity, we identified a
compound, tartrolon E (trtE) that potently inhibits in vitro growth of Cryptosporidium parvum, as well as several
other apicomplexan parasites, without toxicity to their respective host cells. We further established that trtE is
highly effective at reducing Cryptosporidium infection in neonatal mice. In fact, trtE is 10-fold more effective in
vitro and 2-fold more effective in vivo against Cryptosporidium than the most effective compounds reported to
date, and the only compound to hold the promise of a broad spectrum anti-apicomplexan therapeutic. These
observations strongly encourage further exploration of the clinical potential of trtE for the treatment of
cryptosporidiosis. In the studies proposed here, we will test the hypothesis that trtE possesses the activity
necessary to be lead candidate therapeutic for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis by completion of the following
aims: Aim 1: To evaluate species specificity and life cycle stage specificity of trtE against
Cryptosporidium. TrtE will be tested against C. parvum field isolates and C. hominis and the activity of trtE
against oocysts, sporozoites, asexual and sexual stages will be determined. Aim 2: To optimize trtE dosing
regimens. Pharmacodynamics (A), pharmacokinetics (B) and bioavailability (C) studies will be conducted to
design optimal treatment strategies. Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of trtE against Cryptosporidium
infection in the setting of severe immunosuppression and in a ruminant model of cryptosporidiosis. A.
We will test trtE’s ability to inhibit and eliminate Cryptosporidium infection in NOD-SCID gamma mice. B.
Because mice do not manifest the symptoms of human disease, we will test the trtE’s ability to inhibit infection
and diarrheal illness in neonatal lambs. Aim 4: To optimize production of trtE from Teredinibacter
turnerae T7901: Like many natural products, trtE has a complex structure that renders synthesis challenging
and prohibitively expensive. The Natural Products Discovery Institute (NPDI), experts in the field of natural
product production, will be producing trtE for these studies using established protocols. During that process,
NPDI will apply their expertise in this area to increase production efficiency. These studies will provide data
essential to establish trtE as a lead candidate for an anti-Cryptosporidium therapeutic. Moreover, because this
compound is highly active against multiple parasites, these investigations will underpin future studies
evaluating this compound as a broad spectrum therapeutic for diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites,
but most critically for cryptosporidiosis, a neglected disease of world-wide significance for which there are no
good therapeutic options."

Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a crucial role in keeping the immune system in balance and preventing
autoimmune disease. Defective Treg function leads to autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, Treg cells inside tumors can block effective anti-tumor immune responses.
The development and maintenance of the Treg cell lineage are dependent on the transcription factor Foxp3, as
loss of function mutations lead to severe lymphoproliferative disease in mice and humans. Thus, understanding
the mechanisms that govern Foxp3 induction and stability may lead to the development of novel therapies for
autoimmune disease and cancer. Dr. Zheng and colleagues recently developed a system to perform genome-
wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify Foxp3 regulators in mouse induced and natural Tregs. The
unbiased screen results not only confirmed a number of known Foxp3 regulators but also revealed many novel
factors that control Foxp3 expression. Gene ontology analysis of the newly identified Foxp3 regulators revealed
significant enrichment of multiple genes encoding subunits of the BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling
complexes, indicating an unknown role for this regulator in Treg development. Among the three BAF related
complexes, the newly described GBAF complex promotes the expression of Foxp3, whereas the PBAF complex
represses its expression. Furthermore, deletion of the bromodomain-containing protein Brd9, specific to GBAF
complexes, led to reduced Foxp3 expression and compromised Treg function. Additionally, bromodomain
inhibitors and chemical degraders of BRD9 act similarly to Brd9 genetic deletion to impair Foxp3 expression and
Treg suppressor function. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies suggest that Brd9 cooperates with Foxp3 to potentiate
its binding to Foxp3 target genes and regulate their expression. The overall objective of this study is to define
the role of BAF related complexes in Treg function through regulation of and cooperation with Foxp3. This goal
will be accomplished by elucidating the role of G/PBAF in Foxp3 induction and maintenance (Aim 1), defining
the biochemical association of G/PBAF complexes with Foxp3 (Aim 2), identifying the functional role of GBAF in
Foxp3-dependent transcription (Aim 3), and characterizing the functional consequences of disrupting G/PBAF
subunits in Tregs in autoimmune disease and cancer models (Aim 4). The outcomes of the proposed studies
are expected to fundamentally advance the understanding of epigenetic control of Foxp3 gene expression and
Treg transcriptional networks. Additionally, these studies will provide key insights into the function of the newly
described GBAF complex and its relationship with PBAF complexes. Finally, the outcomes of this research could
provide evidence to support using drugs to target BAF related complexes for the treatment of autoimmune
diseases and cancer."
10846576,"Organisms eat to live, and diet provides material for growth and maintenance. However, complex
webs of nutrient-responsive signaling pathways ensure that nutrients are properly allocated and utilized
to support cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, commensurate with the demands
of developmental stage and organismal needs. We know that signaling in response to diet is key to
functional provisioning of dietary components, since signaling pathways can be manipulated to overcome
nutritional deficits that would otherwise impair these processes. However, despite the fundamental
nature of diet and metabolic signaling, the identity of key dietary factors, how they trigger particular
signaling pathways in vivo, and how they operate within organismal metabolism to regulate cell behavior
are poorly understood. We are addressing this gap using C. elegans germline progenitor cells as a
model system. Germ cells are exquisitely sensitive to diet, making them an ideal model. Stem and
progenitor cells are important targets of diet-based signaling, since they must continuously maintain
tissues and organs under changing conditions. C. elegans offers experimental advantages including
facile genetic and dietary manipulation. In addition, the C. elegans laboratory diet, E. coli, is itself a
genetically tractable organism. Using complementary candidate and unbiased approaches, this project
will identify dietary components that drive progenitor accumulation. Dietary cues will be linked to specific
known (insulin, TGF-beta and TOR) or yet-to-be-implicated signaling pathways and cellular response
mechanisms. The project will also address how robust accumulation of germline progenitors, in response
to parental diet, impacts subsequent generations. Due to the highly conserved nature of metabolism and
nutrient-reponsive signaling across evolutionarily divergent organisms, our studies will contribute to the
understanding of fundamental mechanisms that maintain proliferating pools of cells, with possible
implications in humans for fertility, development, degenerative diseases, cancer, stem cell biology, and
parasite biology."
10846578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality and current therapies have limited efficacy.
Respiratory failure in influenza results from either prolonged viral replication or lung injury induced by an
over exuberant immune response. It follows that a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate
the host immune response to IAV could lead to new therapies. Effector CD8+ T cells are responsible for
clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) during primary infection but have also been implicated in immune-
mediated lung injury. Effector CD8+ T cells also give rise to influenza-specific CD8+ tissue resident memory
T cells (Trm), which mediate heterosubtypic immunity, decreasing the severity of subsequent IAV infection.
Thus, the magnitude and quality of the CD8+ T cell response to IAV must be tightly controlled to achieve
viral clearance, limit immune-mediated lung injury and promote the formation of tissue-resident memory.
Dendritic cells (DC) activate naïve T cells in the lymph node to generate an effector CD8+ T cell response,
interact with effector CD8+ T cells within infected lung to promote viral clearance and attenuate
immunopathology and are required for the generation of optimal CD8+ Trm. Thus, DC play a critical role in
regulating both effector CD8+ T cells and in the formation of protective memory. Effector CD8+ T cells are
also regulated by inhibitory (i.e. checkpoint) receptors. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim3)
is an important checkpoint receptor that is induced on activated T cells and constitutively expressed on
DC. Tim3 modulates the immune response to IAV, but it is not known whether it constrains viral clearance
or protects from lung injury. We previously demonstrated Tim3 attenuates effector CD8+ T cell responses
and protects against mortality in a mouse model of IAV. We now have data demonstrating that Tim3
promotes antigen cross presentation by DC – a process critical for generating both effector and tissue
resident memory CD8+ T cells in IAV infection. Our central hypothesis is that Tim3 determines the
balance between viral clearance and lung injury and promotes the formation of CD8+ Trm. In Aim #1, we
will test the hypothesis that Tim3 promotes antigen cross presentation by DC and DC-mediated activation
of naive CD8+ T cells during IAV infection. Specifically, we will (A) identify the intracellular mechanisms
utilized by Tim3 to promote cross presentation, (B) characterize the expression and function of Tim3 on
human lung DC, and (C) determine the role of Tim3 on lung DC in activating naïve CD8+ T cells during IAV
infection. In Aim #2, we will test the hypothesis that Tim3 promotes viral clearance and attenuates immune-
mediated lung injury during IAV infection and promotes IAV-induced CD8+ Trm formation. Experiments in
this aim will A) define the effect of Tim3 in regulating effector CD8+ T cell responses in the lung during IAV
infection and (B) determine the role of Tim3 in IAV-induced CD8+ Trm formation. These experiments are
a critical first step toward developing Tim3 as a therapeutic target for influenza."

Food contains a vast collection of bioactive small molecules that encounter enormous populations of
commensal microbes in the gastrointestinal tract. Microbiome metabolism has been reported across dietary
compound classes; however, the microbial enzymes that metabolize dietary small molecules can be highly
substrate specific and these activities can vary widely between individuals. The impact of diet on the
microbiome is also well established. Thus, the gut microbiome is likely a determining factor in an individual's
dietary metabolite exposure, with implications for infection, cancer, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular
diseases, and other diseases impacted by diet. Microbes and diet directly intersect in the context of infections
caused by the food-borne enteropathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Campylobacter
jejuni, which cause tens of millions of cases of food-borne illness every year, largely through consumption of
chicken and other poultry products. Progress understanding these interactions would transform our ability to
manage this major public health challenge, enabling interventions in humans and in our food chain where diet
can be directly prescribed. This proposal will test the hypothesis that modification of dietary compounds by the
gut microbiota, and disruption of the microbiota by dietary compounds, determines the function of these
molecules in modulating colonization resistance (pathogen exclusion by the microbiome), pathogen growth,
and virulence in humans and in our food chain. In Aim 1, we will generate a systematic map of the metabolism
of over 100 dietary compounds by over 100 gut microbes and microbiomes from two human cohorts and
chickens at the level of communities, species, enzymes, and metabolites. In Aim 2, we will determine how
these compounds modulate colonization resistance in gnotobiotic mouse and gnotobiotic chicken models of S.
Typhimurium and C. jejuni infections. In Aim 3, we will measure how dietary compounds and their microbial
metabolites impact pathogen growth and virulence in vitro, in 2D monolayers derived from intestinal organoids,
and in gnotobiotic animals. Together, these studies will define how the reciprocal interactions between diet and
the microbiome determine the outcome of food-borne infections, a major public health risk."
10846788,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Picornaviruses have both asexual and sexual RNA replication mechanisms. Asexual RNA replication involves
one parental template whereas sexual RNA replication involves two or more parental templates. Sexual RNA
replication mechanisms optimize the biological fitness of pathogens in enterovirus species A (EV-A71), species
B (CVB3), species C (polio and CVA21) and species D (EV-D68). Our study will reveal how these viruses
exchange genetic material during sexual RNA replication. Mankind could exploit these mechanisms to
control or eradicate important pathogens, from polioviruses to rhinoviruses to EV-D68.
Asexual template-dependent RNA replication, while efficient, renders viruses susceptible to error catastrophe,
an overwhelming accumulation of mutations in viral RNA genomes incompatible with viability. Sexual RNA
replication counteracts error catastrophe by purging mutations from viral RNA genomes. It remains uncertain
how asexual and sexual RNA replication mechanisms work coordinately to maintain virus populations in nature.
During the previous funding period, we discovered molecular features of the poliovirus polymerase required for
sexual RNA replication mechanisms (aka viral RNA recombination). We were able to use these discoveries to
specifically disable sexual replication mechanisms without impairing asexual replication mechanisms. Among
our more striking findings is the relationship between sexual replication mechanisms and error catastrophe.
When we disable sexual replication mechanisms, poliovirus becomes exquisitely sensitive to ribavirin-induced
error catastrophe. These data substantiate long held theories regarding the advantages and disadvantages of
asexual and sexual replication mechanisms among RNA viruses.
Overarching hypothesis: Viral RNA recombination is a form of sexual replication that shapes &
maintains picornavirus species groups and counteracts error catastrophe.
During the next funding period, we plan to identify the features of viral polymerases required for sexual RNA
replication. As outlined in this application, conserved features of the viral polymerase interact with nascent
RNA products and RNA templates near the active site of the polymerase - providing a mechanism for viruses
to distinguish between homologous and non-homologous partners in RNA recombination. The experiments
outlined in this application will advance our understanding of picornavirus species groups, reveal molecular
features of viral polymerases that maintain viral species groups in nature, further elucidate the antiviral
mechanisms of ribavirin, and provide opportunities to control or eradicate important pathogens."

Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the leading cause of dementia among the middle aged and elderly. It
is characterized by progressive loss of memory culminating in complete loss of cognitive function. Pathological
manifestations in brain include neuronal loss, gliosis, extracellular amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles.
Among genetic risk factors, APOE-ε4 is the strongest, but genome association studies (GWAS) have identified
and confirmed several additional loci. However, a substantial portion of the genetic source of heritability of LOAD
is still unknown.
Large-scale sequencing efforts in Alzheimer’s Disease are underway to identify detect putatively causal rare
variant (RV) associations that might explain the missing heritability. To detect modest RV effects, large sample
sizes are required. Here we propose a powerful approach to study RVs in extended families with large numbers
of affected individuals where they are likely to aggregate and have stronger effect sizes. The major goal of this
proposal is to harmonize phenotype and whole genome and exome sequencing (WGS and WES) data from
~1000 LOAD families and apply existing and novel family-based analytics to identify LOAD susceptibility variants
and loci that can be tested as therapeutic targets. Factors such as a three to five-fold higher incidence rates of
LOAD compared to the general population, clustering of putatively deleterious variants, inbreeding, low level of
sequencing artifacts and the ability to control for population substructure/admixture using a family analysis design
(compared to unrelated case-controls) make these families ideal for identifying LOAD associated genetic risk
and protective factors. The efforts in this proposal will be in parallel with and complementary to analyses in the
unrelated case-control analyses being conducted on Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP)
discovery, extension replication and follow-up datasets."

 Prevalence rates for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) range from 7-25% for adults over the age of 60, with
risk increasing with age. Impairments in new learning and memory (LM) are common in persons with MCI and
negatively impact several aspects of everyday life, including independence in daily activities and social
functioning. Despite the demand for LM treatments by older adults and clinicians alike, few cognitive
rehabilitation (CR) protocols to date are supported by Class I research evidence, thereby limiting the degree to
which potentially efficacious treatments can be applied to individuals with MCI.
 The Kessler Foundation modified Story Memory Technique (KF-mSMTTM) is a manualized, 10-session CR
protocol designed to treat impaired LM. Over a decade of research and development conducted at our center
has demonstrated the KF-mSMT to be effective for improving LM in individuals with neurological conditions (e.g.,
MS, TBI), across three realms of functioning (objective behavior, neural functioning, and everyday life) with
improvements maintained over time. This convincing data provides Class I evidence supporting the efficacy of
the KF-mSMT for improving LM in these populations. In addition, we have accumulated strong pilot data on the
efficacy of the KF-mSMT in individuals with MCI, highlighting the likely successful application of the KF-mSMT
to individuals with MCI.
 We will conduct a multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), administering
the KF-mSMT to 120 participants who meet criteria for MCI. Outcome will be assessed immediately following
treatment, 6 months following treatment as well as 18 months following treatment to examine the long-term
impact. Outcome will be measured via 3 mechanisms: (1) Neuropsychological Evaluation (NPE) to examine
post-treatment changes on objective cognitive performance (2) Assessment of Global Functioning (AGF) to
examine post-treatment changes in cognition in daily life and (3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
to examine pre to post-treatment changes in patterns of cerebral activation underlying LM performance. The
examination of daily life activities as an a priori endpoint in this RCT is a highly innovative aspect of the proposed
work, highlighted as a significant gap in the rehabilitation literature by many experts in CR. Importantly, the
rigorous research design employed in the current study is highly responsive to the objectives set forth by the NIA
in their strategic directions (p.14), to “determine how individuals can maintain function with age or regain that
function after loss due to immobility, illness, or trauma”, while also designed to identify the “mechanism through
which common interventions, both medical and behavioral, may slow the physical and cognitive decline.”"

Each year 13- to 24-year-olds disproportionately compose the number individuals diagnosed with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a
once daily antiretroviral regime, is an effective method to prevent the transmission of HIV in
adolescents at substantial risk for acquiring HIV, however, the effect of this regimen on the
development of critical brain structures during adolescence is unknown. Adolescents taking PrEP
are uniquely vulnerable to myelin impairments as the adolescent brain is undergoing high rates
of myelination. Our lab has shown that primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell cultures treated
with therapeutic concentrations of select antiretroviral drugs displayed dose-dependent
decreases in oligodendrocyte maturation. A gap in our knowledge is the mechanistic basis of the
inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation by antiretrovirals in an HIV-negative, adolescent
population. My preliminary data suggests that emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (TDF), the drugs composing PrEP, de-acidify oligodendrocyte lysosomes. Furthermore,
my preliminary data also suggests that PrEP decreases SREBP2 expression in oligodendrocytes
in vitro. mTORC1 regulates lipogenesis through the transcription factors SREBP 1 and 2, with the
latter regulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, the rate-limiting step
of myelination. Lysosome de-acidification has been shown to result in increased mTORC1
signaling in osteoclasts but remains to be investigated in oligodendrocytes. Additionally,
overactivation of mTORC1 in oligodendrocytes is known to result in hypomyelination and
decreased SREBP2 expression. Taken together, I hypothesize that oligodendrocyte maturation
is inhibited by PrEP through lysosome deacidification resulting in increased mTORC1 activation
and decreased lipogenesis. I will address this hypothesis in the following specific aims. In Aim 1
I will demonstrate oligodendrocyte maturation is impaired by PrEP through lysosome de-
acidification in vitro. In Aim 2, I will demonstrate that PrEP inhibits oligodendrocyte maturation
through increased mTORC1 signaling and subsequent decreased lipogenesis in vitro. In Aim 3,
I will demonstrate that oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination are impaired by PrEP and
lysosome acidification rescues myelination in vivo. Overall, these experiments will investigate the
previously unanswered question of whether PrEP affects oligodendrocyte maturation in HIV-
negative individuals."

The burden of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease in the US is substantial. A safe and effective
vaccine has been available for >10 years, yet the current rate of completion for the HPV series is only 49% for
U.S.13-17 year olds. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV
vaccination at age 11-12 years (yrs), but states that the vaccine “can be given starting at age 9 years.”
Currently, the majority of pediatricians begin recommending the vaccine at ages 11-12 yrs, however, a recent
retrospective study showed that on-time completion rates for HPV vaccine were much higher when the vaccine
series was initiated at ages 9-10 compared to ages 11-12 (adjusted odds ratio, 12.8).
HPV vaccine should be given prior to sexual activity which occurs earlier than 13 yrs for many teens.
There are compelling reasons to think that earlier initiation of vaccination at ages 9-10 might result in higher
rates of acceptance of the vaccine and earlier series completion. First, many parents refuse HPV vaccine
because they have concerns that vaccination could result in higher promiscuity in early adolescents if the
vaccine is discussed in the context of sexuality. Initiation at 9-10 yrs, when few providers discuss sex,
could put the focus squarely on cancer prevention, decreasing vaccine refusal. Second, three vaccines
are recommended at the 11-12 yr visit, but many parents/adolescents are unwilling to receive all three at
one visit. When one of the vaccines is delayed, it is almost always HPV vaccine. Initiation at 9-10 yrs
when no other vaccines are given could result in less deferral of vaccination to mid-adolescence and
higher rates of vaccination prior to early sexual activity. Finally, initiation at age 9-10 years has been
shown to be feasible and, in an observational study, to result in higher rates of on-time series completion.
Therefore, we plan to test the effectiveness of shifting initiation of HPV vaccine to 9-10 yrs in a randomized
pragmatic trial. Our Specific Aims are to: SA 1: Recruit practices in two states (Colorado and California),
randomize in a balanced fashion to recommending HPV vaccine at ages 9-10 yrs or 11-12 yrs and provide
standardized training to both arms. SA 2: Conduct a trial to assess effectiveness of early initiation on the 1⁰
outcome of age at HPV series completion; secondary outcomes will examine HPV series completion by
age 13 and age at HPV series initiation. SA 3: Examine the effect of earlier initiation on length of time for
HPV vaccine discussions and on parent/provider communication about HPV vaccine via audio-taping of
visits, audio-elicitation interviews with parents and structured interviews with providers and clinic staff. If
earlier HPV initiation is successful in promoting higher HPV series completion by 13 yrs, this intervention
could be rapidly disseminated and would have the potential to prevent thousands of cases of HPV-related
cancers, their attendant morbidity and mortality as well as the costs of screening, diagnosis and treatment
for these cancers yearly."

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in women and the leading cause of disability in the US. New
proteomic techniques measure a wide profile of proteins, providing a comprehensive picture of protein
functions. Since proteins perform most biological functions, they may be leveraged as biomarkers or drug
therapy targets. Although results for proteomics and cardiovascular disease have been promising, only one
small prospective proteomics study of ischemic stroke has been conducted.
The over-arching goal of this study is to discover novel proteome-wide and multi-omic associations for
incident ischemic stroke. Building on an established record of success in this R01, we will measure 3072
proteins (Olink platform) in the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS; 460 ischemic strokes/ 460 controls) and VITamin
D Omega3 TriAL (VITAL; 300 ischemic strokes/ 300 controls), as well as leverage separately measured data
from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI; 214 ischemic strokes), Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort
(FHSOC; 103 ischemic strokes), and UK Biobank (UKB; ~450 ischemic strokes). In Aim 1, we will test
candidate protein hypotheses in 1334 strokes in meta-analyses using Olink data from the NHS, VITAL, WHI,
FHSOC and UKB. Ischemic stroke subtypes, and interactions by sex and race will be tested. In Aim 2, we will
perform robust, proteome-wide discovery in NHS and VITAL with validation of significant proteins in meta-
analyses of WHI, FHSOC, and UKB. Validated proteins will be evaluated for causal associations using
mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Using proteomic and genetic data from UKB (53,000), we will
generate protein polygenic allele risk scores for the validated proteins and test these protein polygenetic risk
scores for ischemic stroke in MEGASTROKE and SiGN. Ischemic stroke subtypes, and interactions by sex and
race will be explored. In Aim 3, we will leverage prior measures of metabolomic profiles and extensive
biomarker and risk factor data in NHS, VITAL and WHI, using novel integrative approaches, including similarity
network fusion, to combine proteomic and metabolomic data, biomarker and risk factor data, in associations for
ischemic stroke and stroke subtypes. Findings will be compared in NHS, VITAL and WHI.
The proposed study leverages Olink proteomic data from five cohorts to identify proteins and multi-omic
signatures integral to the incidence of stroke, which can be used to improve stroke prediction and prevention
strategies and identify new drug targets for stroke prevention."
10843767,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial malignant solid tumor in children. High-risk NB
remains an incurable disease. Since recurrent somatic mutations in NB occur with relative paucity,
dysregulation of oncogenic signal transduction may contribute to NB tumorigenesis. This proposal will pursue
that goal by defining the role of CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated (CAMKV) in NB development and
examining the therapeutic potential of CAMKV kinase inhibition for treating NB in mouse models. In our
preliminary studies, we have found that CAMKV, structurally a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase family, is quite specifically overexpressed in NB tumor samples, and its high expression predicts
poor patient outcome. Furthermore, CAMKV acts as an active CREB kinase in NB cells. Knockdown of
CAMKV expression caused a cell proliferation defect and decreased phospho-CREB level in the NB cell lines
tested. In addition, we identified K252a and OTSSP167 as CAMKV inhibitors that potently inhibited cell
proliferation of several NB cell lines in culture and tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model. Interestingly,
our recently generated Camkv knockout mice are viable and fertile.
 Our long term goal is to develop novel targeted therapies for children with high-risk NB. The objective of
this application is to understand the role of CAMKV in NB tumor development and demonstrate the utility of
CAMKV as a biomarker and kinase target for NB therapy.The central hypothesis of this work is that CAMKV
plays an important role in NB development and is a molecular kinase target in NB. The proposed experiments
will test this hypothesis by dissecting the function of CAMKV signaling in NB cells and determining the effect of
CAMKV inhibition on NB tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. We will also use recently generated Camkv
knockout mice to define the role of CAMKV in NB development in the Th-MYCN transgenic mouse model. The
specific aims for this project are: 1) To determine the mechanism of CAMKV regulation and function in NB
cells; 2) To determine the role of CAMKV in NB development in tumor mouse models; 3) To determine the
therapeutic potential of CAMKV inhibition in vivo. This contribution is significant because it will demonstrate
the critical role of CAMKV kinase in NB development and prove that CAMKV kinase inhibition is a potential
strategy to treat NB and overcome chemotherapy resistance in vivo. Furthermore, uncovering the regulation of
CAMKV kinase signaling will generate a blueprint for CAMKV-based design of treatment for refractory high-risk
NB. The proposed research is innovative since it is the first study to specifically uncover and target the
CAMKV signaling for designing NB therapeutics and to specifically study CAMKV inhibition by small molecule
inhibitors as a mechanism for overcoming chemotherapy resistance. This project will firmly establish CAMKV-
based therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy for refractory high-risk NB."

The current proposal addresses fundamental neurophysiological questions related to oxytocin (OXT)
pharmacology and pain neurobiology in normal and nerve injury settings. We aim to define (a) the OXT PK/PD
relationships on fast-conducting afferents (A-fibers), both tactile (LTMRs: low threshold mechanoreceptors) and
nociceptive (AHTMRs: A-fiber high threshold mechanoreceptors), (b) to study the effects of L5 SNL at the peak
of maximal sensitization (week 2) on injured (L5) and uninjured (L4) afferents and the OXT-mediated modulation
of these sensitization process and (c) to correlate the OXT-induced modulation of sensibility (L4) and excitability
(L5) with the animal behavior (normal or abnormal) after recovery (weeks 8-12).
Our working hypothesis has two parts: 1) that A-fibers response to injury (LTMR: desensitization and AHTMR:
sensitization) is critical for the development of a peripheral mediated neuropathic state and 2) that OXT can
resolve this state and modulate the recovery by rescuing these afferents from they abnormal excitability. We
anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the physiological effects of OXT, how much of overall
central effects can be explained by the OXT peripheral modulation (interaction with Project 2, Dr. Martin), and
how these effects can be optimized for the treatment of pain in human patients (interaction with Project 3, Dr.
Eisenach)."
10843778,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Centrosomes are organelles used to build microtubule-based protein machines, including mitotic spindles and
cilia. At the centrosome core lies a pair of `mother-daughter' centrioles, barrel-shaped structures that act as the
duplicating elements of the organelle. Normally, the centriole pair duplicates only once each cell cycle and,
during mitotic entry, centrioles recruit a shell of pericentriolar material (PCM) – a process called `maturation' –
from which microtubules grow. Not only are they one of the largest protein complexes in eukaryotic cells but
one of the most ancient of organelles, and have fascinated cell biologists since their discovery in the late 19th
century. During the past 20 years, advances in imaging, proteomics and functional genomic screens have led
to an explosion of discoveries in the centrosome field. At present, we have a complete inventory of the proteins
comprising centrosomes. In our model system, Drosophila, centrosomes assemble from a surprisingly small
number of components (approximately 20). Despite these advances, many important questions remain
unanswered. Although only two conserved master-regulators, Polo kinase and Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), initiate
centriole maturation and duplication, respectively, it is not known how they are activated specifically on
centrioles. Also, what are the phosphorylation targets of these kinases and how do they promote centriole
duplication and maturation? How are mother centrioles restrained to spawn only a single daughter once per cell
cycle? How is centriole length controlled? Understanding these processes at the molecular level is important
because alterations in centrosome function or number cause a number of serious pathologies, including birth
defects, ciliopathies and cancer. Plk4 has been the centerpiece of our research program because it is both
necessary and sufficient to induce centrosome overduplication (amplification) when overexpressed, a scenario
observed in cancer cells. We have published a series of studies that have defined Plk4 regulation and identified
several of its substrates. Notably, Plk4 utilizes multiple mechanisms of control to restrain its activity and prevent
rampant centrosome overduplication, using an elaborate combination of autophosphorylation, ubiquitination and
autoinhibition. We continue to pursue two overarching goals: 1) identifying the molecular mechanisms that
suppress centrosome amplification (funded by R01 GM110166) and 2) characterizing the inherent mechanisms
that govern centrosome function and duplication (funded by R01 GM126035). Building on our progress during
the past five years, we propose to extend our studies that will define the mechanisms underlying the five
sequential steps in the assembly process. Specifically, we will determine (i) how a single site of daughter
centriole assembly is selected on mother centrioles, (ii) the composition of the pre-procentrioles and how it forms,
(iii) how nascent daughter centrioles assemble, (iv) how centriole growth is controlled, and (v) the initial steps in
centrosome maturation."
10843779,"The US continues to grapple with an opioid epidemic, with ~69,700 opioid overdose deaths in 2020. Health
systems have instituted multiple interventions to reduce patient risk, many focusing on decreasing unsafe
opioid prescribing among those viewed as high-risk. However, there are limited tools to identify who is truly at
high risk of overdose, leading to burdensome interventions targeting an overly broad population or missing key
high-risk individuals. Even if those who are at risk can be identified, the interventions lack effective strategies to
change clinician behavior, focusing instead on blunt tools to reduce prescribing rather than reduce risk.
In prior work, we developed and externally validated machine-learning algorithms that identify patients at high
risk of opioid overdose, even if not actively prescribed opioids. Separately, we demonstrated how behavioral
nudge alerts embedded in the electronic health record (EHR) can be combined with risk prediction tools to
change clinician behavior. In this project, we propose to reduce opioid overdose risk by bringing together
machine-learning based overdose risk prediction and behavioral nudges through a scalable EHR intervention
to improve clinician prescribing behavior. In a large academic health system (UPMC), we propose the following
specific aims: (1) Incorporate our previously validated machine learning algorithm into the EHR to predict 3-
month risk of opioid overdose; (2) Pilot test a clinician-targeted behavioral nudge intervention in the EHR for
patients at high predicted risk for opioid overdose; (3) Evaluate the effectiveness of providing risk scores in the
EHR with and without a behavioral nudge to improve opioid prescribing safety and reduce overdose risk.
In Aim 1, we will apply our gradient boosting machine overdose prediction algorithm to the UPMC Epic-based
EHR. We will optimize the algorithm for use in UPMC primary care practices, addressing model accuracy and
algorithmic biases. In Aim 2, we will combine the risk score generated by our algorithm with clinician nudges in
the EHR, using a 3-phase pilot with focus groups, silent testing, and live testing in 3 primary care practices.
The nudge intervention will target clinicians caring for high-risk patients and will use active choice prompts for
naloxone and accountable justifications for opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing. In Aim 3, we will conduct a
cluster randomized trial in 45 UPMC primary care practices, with 3 arms: (1) usual care; (2) EHR-embedded
risk score; 3) EHR-embedded risk score coupled with the nudge from Aim 2. The EHR-embedded risk score
arm will consist of an alert in the EHR that identifies the patient as high risk for overdose. In the risk score
coupled with nudge arm, a similar EHR alert about high-risk status will flag, along with the nudges from Aim 2.
The primary outcome will be a composite of 3 prescribing practices associated with reduced risk of overdose:
naloxone prescription, opioid dosage <50MME per day, and no opioid/benzodiazepine overlap.
Our proposal builds on our prior NIDA-funded work and experience with nudge interventions and is aligned
with NIDA’s strategic goals to develop and test novel strategies for preventing opioid misuse and overdose."
10843887,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Aging is an evolutionarily conserved process of physical and mental decline in the
later years of life. The aging of multicellular animals from fruit flies to humans share many similarities. For
both flies and mammals, aging leads to loss of circadian rhythms or 24-hour oscillations in function and
behavior, including sleep, feeding, metabolism, and other tissue-specific functions. The core circadian ""clock""
is a negative transcriptional feedback loop: a heterodimeric transcriptional activating complex that drives the
expression of hundreds of genes, including their own inhibitors, driving circadian oscillation of gene expression.
In both flies and mammals, these clocks exist in nearly every tissue tested. The brain clock (also called the
central clock) coordinates many other tissue-specific clocks in the body (also called ""peripheral clocks"").
These peripheral clocks drive circadian oscillations in tissue-specific gene expression, which in turn drive
tissue-specific circadian oscillations in function. Thus, age-related loss of circadian gene expression is thought
to affect multiple tissues and have pathologic effects on health. Unfortunately, there are currently few central
or peripheral clock therapeutic interventions that enhance circadian regulation in the elderly.
 In preliminary data, my lab developed two time-restricted feeding, or TRF, regimens that robustly
extend lifespan (15-20%), improve circadian function, and increase lipid metabolism in Drosophila. TRF is a
dietary regimen in which eating is restricted to a specific daily time window. We found that TRF enhanced
circadian-regulated transcription and that TRF-mediated lifespan extension required both circadian regulation
and autophagy, a conserved longevity pathway. We also found that, independent of autophagy, TRF
increases lipid metabolism, the most common health benefit sought by people who undertake TRF.
 Here we propose to test the hypothesis that TRF enhances circadian clocks in multiple tissues that
promote anti-aging health benefits. Specifically, we will 1) investigate the impact of TRF on different circadian
clocks (both peripheral and central), as well as examining clock-to-clock communication; 2) investigate TRF
health benefits for the immune system and brain and identify tissue-specific clock(s) required for diverse TRF
health benefits; 3) investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying autophagy-independent TRF-induced
changes in lipid metabolism (storage and usage). These results will help to characterize the anti-aging effects
of TRF and identify potential therapeutic targets.
 Drosophila have provided crucial information about circadian regulation and aging and the fly is a
powerful genetic model system. Circadian regulation, metabolism, and aging are highly evolutionarily
conserved processes. Thus, we expect that the results of the proposed experiments will have relevance for
human health and aging-related therapeutic intervention."

Prevention of late life cognitive decline ranks among the most important public health challenges, and
identification of the profile of healthy cognitive aging is an essential step. The proposed study will continue a
highly successful program of research that has transformed the field’s understanding of healthy cognitive aging
(R01AG34374). We conceptualize healthy cognitive aging as the late life cognitive change that is not due to
known pathologic processes (e.g., AD/ADRD pathologies), and our research capitalizes on the detailed
longitudinal cognitive and pathologic data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging
Project (ROSMAP). The central idea is that we can precisely characterize pathologic cognitive aging by linking
pathologic indices to longitudinal cognitive trajectories and then identify healthy cognitive aging (i.e., residual
change). In prior cycles, we reported that: a) common AD/ADRD neuropathologies account for much of the
decline previously attributed to healthy cognitive aging but less than half of the variation in decline overall; b)
nonlinear, terminal change represents a separate pathologic process and a major driver of decline; c)
AD/ADRD neuropathologies differentially impact trajectories of specific cognitive systems; and d) our newly
developed “cognitive age” metric is a robust prognostic indicator of adverse cognitive outcomes. The overall
goal of the proposed continuation is to further elucidate the profile of healthy cognitive aging and
translate our work in decedents into the living to prospectively distinguish healthy from pathologic
cognitive aging. The proposed study will incorporate new neuropathologic indices, neuroimaging, and
promising blood biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration and apply a highly innovative statistical approach to
precisely identify the profile of healthy cognitive aging. Building on prior work, we will first identify healthy
cognitive aging among autopsied persons with detailed pathologic data. Importantly, we will then extend this
approach to living persons. Finally, we will integrate new biomarker and ante-mortem neuroimaging data with
our cognitive age metric to develop criteria for prediction of incident MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia and
validate them in an independent dataset from a biracial, population-based sample, the Chicago Health and
Aging Project (CHAP). Thus, the proposed study offers an innovative approach to address a fundamental and
longstanding challenge in cognitive aging research. This work also will facilitate early and accurate
identification of individuals at high risk of developing cognitive impairment, an urgent priority in aging research."
10843790,"PRO PROJECT SUMMARY
Macrophages (MO) play a crucial role in the propagation of inflammation in many diseases. Recent work has
highlighted functional MO heterogeneity in synovial tissue of rheumatic diseases. The presence of activated MO
and the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory MO populations in the synovium has been related
to disease progression and clinical manifestations. Among other stimuli, MO in the joints are activated by damage
associated molecular patterns (DAMP), that are sensed by NLRP3 inflammasome and activate IL-1 and IL-18-
dependent inflammation that shifts joint cells from a resting regulatory state to a highly metabolically active one.
Abnormal choline metabolism is emerging as a metabolic hallmark of cell activation and inflammation. Choline
is a vitamin-like essential nutrient that is phosphorylated by choline kinase alpha (ChoK) as precursor to newly
synthesized phosphatidylcholine (PC). Emerging lipidomic studies indicate that some rheumatic diseases exhibit
an increase of choline circulating levels and an altered phospholipid (PL) profile in the synovial fluid. In addition,
synovial MO express choline transporters, suggesting a role of choline metabolism in synovial MO activation.
Previous work by the PI has established an essential role for the vitamin-like nutrient choline uptake and
mobilization towards PC synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent production of IL-1 and IL-18 in
activated MO. Inhibition of choline uptake or phosphorylation by ChoK altered mitochondrial PL content and
reduced cellular ATP, which resulted in the initiation of mitophagy, prevention of mitochondrial DNA oxidation,
and ultimately, prevention of activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-1 and IL-18. In addition,
ChoK inhibition decreased inflammation in murine models of gout and Muckle Wells syndrome.
The PI now provides preliminary data suggesting that choline utilization in MO modulates MO biology including
MO polarization. She also describes that LPS-induced MO activation is accompanied by metabolic and PL
reorganization changes that are dependent on choline availability. Additionally, she shows novel data about the
role of ChoK in osteoarthritis. These findings suggest the attractive hypothesis that nutrient metabolism could
modulate synovial activated MO phenotypes in the context of rheumatic diseases.
The current proposal will provide a comprehensive vision of the role of choline metabolism and PL composition
in MO activation and biology, through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will evaluate choline metabolism in MO
differentiation and polarization; Aim 2 will explore the role of choline availability on their associated metabolic
and bioenergetic changes; Aim 3 will investigate choline availability and its phosphorylation in the OA synovium.
The proposed studies and training plan will help PI’s transition to an independent investigator and will provide
her with expertise in immunometabolism, translational research, metabolomics, and mitochondrial bioenergetics.
The work will be performed with the mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin, an expert in myeloid biology, and Dr. Monica
Guma, an expert in arthritis research, as well as guidance from a stellar Advisory Committee."
10843791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary disease burden in the US. Extensive research has established
exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5 and ozone as cause or likely cause of increased CVD mortality and
morbidity. While the US has made steady progress in reducing air pollution from industrial and vehicle
emissions, recent increase in wildfires has slowed or even reversed this progress particularly in the Western
US. Massive quantities of air pollutants in fire smoke can travel hundreds of kilometers affecting highly
populated areas in states far from the original fire. As climate change is projected to substantially increase the
already high wildfire risk in this region, there is an important public health need to establish the effects of
smoke exposure, which has a distinctly different chemical composition from ambient air pollution, on CVD
risks. Understanding the key distinctions between the cardiotoxic effects of smoke constituents is important to
design effective emergency response measures to fire smoke, and to assess the long-term health care needs
in the Western US. We will investigate the relationship between CVD risks and acute or chronic exposure to
major air pollutants in smoke, including major PM2.5 constituents (i.e., sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon,
elemental carbon), and gas pollutants such as ozone and formaldehyde (HCHO). Specifically, we will first
estimate daily smoke and non-smoke PM2.5 constituents, ozone and HCHO at 1 km resolution from 2001 to
2020 in the Western US using EPA’s Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) calibrated by ground-
level EPA measurements and satellite data in a machine learning model. Second, we will link this rich
exposure dataset with ED visits and hospitalization data from six Western US states to assess the adverse
health effects of acute exposure to fire smoke on various CVD outcomes including acute myocardial infarction,
stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and all CVD events. Third, we will link this exposure dataset with
Medicare data in Western US to characterize the effect of chronic exposure (i.e., previous weeks, months or
year) to fire smoke on these CVD outcomes. As a sub-analysis, we will develop an enhanced machine learning
model by including available low-cost sensor measurements for 2016 – 2020 to estimate daily PM2.5, and use
this dataset to conduct similar epidemiological analysis to the main analysis. Finally, we will assess the future
CVD disease burden of chronic smoke exposure due to climate change from 2050 to 2100 using the
concentration-response functions developed in this study. With large study populations and high-quality
exposure estimates, we expect to generate robust estimates of the associations of acute and chronic exposure
to wildfire smoke and CVD risks. With high-resolution regional climate model simulations, we will also be able
to project smoke-related long-term CVD burden imposed by climate change."

Over 190,000 people suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome in the US each year, with mortality rates
from 30-40% with the best treatment. In addition, there are over 12 million patients with chronic lung disease,
6.9 million emergency room visits, and over 180,000 deaths. When mechanical ventilation is insufficient to
support these patients, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as a bridge to recovery or bridge
to transplantation. Unfortunately, ECMO is plagued by bleeding and thrombotic complications that reduce patient
survival by approximately 40 and 33%, respectively. The cause of coagulation is primarily surface adsorption of
plasma proteins, subsequent activation of the intrinsic branch of the coagulation cascade, and platelet binding
to adsorbed fibrinogen. This is combated using systemic, intravenous heparin, but this inhibits both biomaterial-
induced coagulation in the ECMO circuit and tissue-factor induced coagulation in the patient’s tissues, resulting
in bleeding complications. To eliminate both of these problems simultaneously, we propose to combine two
means of selectively inhibiting coagulation at the blood-biomaterial interface while leaving tissue-based
coagulation intact. The first is biomaterial surface coating with zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine (PCB). Our initial
results demonstrate that the PCB coating dramatically decreases protein adsorption and platelet binding in vitro
and long-term clot formation during sheep ECMO. The second is FXII900, a potent, highly-selective bicyclic
peptide FXIIa inhibitor. FXII900 inhibits surface-induced activation of coagulation at nanomolar concentrations
without affecting the tissue-based extrinsic branch or common branch of the coagulation cascade. In our
preliminary, short-term rabbit ECMO studies, we demonstrate a 94% reduction in clot formation vs. standard
clinical heparin anticoagulation. At the same time, FXII900 plus PCB maintained a normal bleeding time, while
the heparin increased the bleeding time to 2.9 times normal. The goals of this proposal are to extend this
technology toward clinical applications by i) proving the effectiveness of combined PCB plus FXII900
anticoagulation during 5-day in vivo extracorporeal life support and ii) developing long-acting FXII900
formulations that enable bolus dosing every 8 or 12 hours rather than a continuous intravenous drip. If successful,
these studies would lead to a clinical anticoagulation strategy that i) reduces bleeding and thrombotic
complications during ECMO, ii) reduces ECMO mortality, and iii) simplifies clinical application of ECMO. These
benefits, when combined, might also allow safe long-term ECMO outside the intensive care unit."

10929321,"Abstract.
Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and three-dimensional (3D) genome
topology, combine with genetic content to determine mammalian transcriptional factor (TF) binding and thus,
gene regulation. Gene activation or repression potential, however, cannot be entirely predicted by looking at a
single measurement. Accurate predictive models require multiple measurements to be measured simultaneously.
At present, we are limited by the number of simultaneous measurements that we can perform in a single cell. In
addition, the interactions between different epigenetic marks and their effects on gene expression are revealed
either in homogenous cultured cells or bulk tissues that average the readout. The study of interactions between
different cell-type-specific epigenetic marks and gene expression in heterogeneous tissues at the single cell level
is still in its infancy. Progress made during the last decade addressed the heterogeneity of individual cells in
terms of gene expression and epigenetic marks at different primary mammalian tissues using single-cell
sequencing techniques, such as single-cell RNA-seq. Recently, we and others developed several technologies
to simultaneously capture multiple measurements in the same assay (multi-omics techniques) and extended
them to the single-cell level. However, current single-cell multi-omics technology can only capture a couple of
measurements, which limits our ability to fully understand the integration of epigenetic marks, genomics, and
their effects on gene expression. Importantly, adding an additional “omics” assay in the existing experimental
protocol is not a simple combination of two existing assays. On the contrary, the add-on assay will often require
the re-design of the whole experimental protocol and/or the development of a new computational method. Adding
additional “omics” assay to the same experiment or single cell will significantly expand our current knowledge on
gene regulation. This is not achievable by joining separate mono-omics experiments in aliquots of the same
sample. Given these challenges, significance, and my unique multidisciplinary academic training, my long-term
goal is to develop high-throughput experimental assays and computational methods to understand gene
regulation by integrating the multi-omics information from the same assay or single-cells. In this proposal, we
will develop a combined experimental assay and computational approach to characterize multiple high-quality
cell-type-specific epigenomic and transcriptomic maps in the same assay and single cells. We will further develop
an integrated assay to characterize the regulatory role of genetic variants on gene expression through multiple
intermediate epigenomic activities in the same single cells. These approaches will eventually allow us to address
the fundamental questions for the interpretations of genetic variants and therefore bridge the gaps between
genetic and phenotypic variations across different healthy and pathological conditions."
10929333,"PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As a molecular detection platform, antibodies have growing importance in modern medical
technology, ranging from diagnostic tests, to imaging, to therapeutics. The current market size for
antibodies and their related products is estimated to be around $200 billion USD. The growing
need for antibodies with customized specificity provides a rich environment for engineering efforts.
Computational protein design has seen rapid progress in recent years. Many methods have been
developed to address antibody engineering needs. Researchers have hoped that, through
modeling and design, the cost for antibody development and improvements can be reduced and
the pace for creating new targeting molecules can be expedited. In recent years, the experimental
pipeline has been streamlined, but even so, extensive libraries and screen campaigns are usually
required to get an initial binding signal. A major advancement would be to directly design a binder
from scratch, providing a signal for potential optimization by artificial evolution. Current
computational methods, however, have not taken a leading role due to a number of shortcomings
with the current modeling approach. We have extensive expertise in protein design and have
pioneered the use of generative neural network models for protein structures in recent years. We
have observed several key advantages in neural network approaches over existing methods:
namely, their ability to make inferences, interpolate, incorporate topological information, and
accelerate sampling. These advantages can be developed independently or used in conjunction
with existing methods, and they can significantly boost the performance of protein design. This
project aims at leveraging several new advances we have developed to date to inspire new
strategies in response to the challenges in antibody engineering, or AI-based protein design in
general. We will develop new tools and design pipelines for expanding the specificities for multi-
specific antibodies and customizing epitope-specific antibodies (using snake venoms and CXCR4
as targets). This project will deliver both computational methods and constructs that can be
deployed in clinical settings. The results from this research will be highly impactful."
10847311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suboptimal vaccination rates and the constantly shifting vaccine landscape resulting from changing vaccine
recommendations; the development of novel vaccines or vaccine technologies; “vaccine scares”; and
outbreaks from vaccine preventable diseases means organizations that are responsible for creating vaccine
recommendations, policies, etc. need information about health care providers and the general public to inform
their decision-making by anticipating possible reactions to their efforts in these groups.
Sentinel physician networks—pre-recruited groups of physicians—have been the predominant method for
obtaining this information since 2004 but suffer from major methodological weaknesses: 1) repeatedly
surveying a potentially biased set of respondents, months-long data collection, and inflexibility beyond
established sentinel physician networks. As a result, there is a critical need to utilize new survey
methodologies that has similar speed, costs, and representativeness as sentinel physician networks but
overcomes its weaknesses. Without this knowledge, we will continue to collect information on immunization-
related issues using a method that is potentially biased and lacks the speed and flexibility that CDC needs.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish a new methodology for collecting data on immunization
issues that provides this information more quickly, affordably, flexibly, and arguably more representative than
sentinel physician networks. The overall objective of this application is to recruit health care workers and
members of the general public via opt-in, online survey panels and use computer-assisted self-interviewing
(CASI) instruments to meet the information needs of CDC and other groups who make vaccine
recommendations, policies, and programs. To that end, our objectives for this proposal are listed below.
• Develop, revise, and finalize survey items within 4 weeks of identifying the survey topic
• Program the survey and conduct user testing within 2 weeks of survey items being finalized
• Obtain IRB approval from for each new survey within 2 weeks of submitting the IRB application
• Finish data collection for each survey in ≤3 weeks if surveying pediatricians, family physicians, general
 internists, and/or obstetricians-gynecologists (N=300/specialty), or U.S. adults (N=1,000)
• Finish data collection in ≤6 weeks if surveying other medical specialties (e.g., geriatricians)
• Analyze data within 3 weeks of finishing data collection
• Complete report of initial findings to the CDC within 4 weeks of finishing data collection
• Complete a minimum of 3 surveys of pediatricians, family physicians, & general internists each year
• Submit abstracts based on the survey results to at least 2 national or international conferences each year
• Submit 3 manuscripts based on survey results each year after Year 1
• Present requested results to ACIP and other immunization-related organizations, at their request"
10894271,"SUMMARY
Long-term expression of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has the potential to suppress an established
HIV-1 infection. However, current methods for maintaining high bNAb concentrations necessary for this control
are inadequate. Passive infusion of bNAbs is prohibitively expensive and requires HIV-1 positive individuals to
receive infusions on a weekly or monthly basis. Delivery of bNAbs by gene-therapy vectors almost invariably
raises anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against expressed bNAbs, which are immunogenic due to their extensive
hypermutation. Most importantly, no single set of antibodies can adequately suppress the range of viruses in the
population, in large part because current antibody delivery systems fail to do what an immune system does well:
adapt to a diverse and evolving pathogen. Here we describe a series of technical advances that allow us to
introduce bNAb heavy- and light-chain genes into their native loci in primary B cells. These technologies enable
in vivo improvement of bNAbs through affinity maturation in mice and primates, using the acquired wisdom of
the humoral response to rapidly increase antibody potency, breadth, and bioavailability. They also allow us to
test the core hypothesis of this proposal that B-cell delivered bNAbs can permanently suppress an established
infection in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
The chief technical advance that enables these studies is the development of an efficient double-editing
technique for simultaneously replacing the variable heavy and light chain segments of B cell receptors. This is
made possible through use of a newly characterized Cas12a ortholog and a unique homology-directed repair
template design capable of efficiently replacing nearly any endogenous BCR variable region. The net
consequence is that, unlike related B-cell editing approaches, the full regulatory apparatus of the B cell is left
intact, facilitating robust B-cell development and efficient affinity maturation of the B-cell receptor.
The project is divided into three aims. Aim 1 will increase the breadth and potency of three well characterized
bNAbs through affinity maturation in vivo. Aim 2 will extend CRISPR editing to the Fc domain, introducing a
recently described set of mutations into the IgG1 Fc domain that facilitate antibody transfer across the blood-
brain barrier. Finally, Aim 3 tests the ability of primary B cells expressing the bNAbs improved in Aim 1 to control
a SHIV infection in rhesus macaques. A series of structured treatment interrupts will be performed to drive CAR
B proliferation and generate an individualized response to virus that emerges from the reservoir. After these
structured interruptions, ART will be permanently withdrawn to determine if CAR B cells alone can control an
established infection."

10848314,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a painful and debilitating condition that affects 50% of people with diabetes. Despite
its high prevalence, the precise biological mechanisms of DN are not known and no disease arresting treatment is
currently available. There is therefore a critical need for the identification of therapeutic targets and preventative
strategies for DN. Recent data show that sphingolipid metabolism is altered in type 2 diabetes (T2D), resulting in
the accumulation of atypical, neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids (dSLs). dSLs are known to increase in the setting of
low levels of the amino acid L-serine and high levels of L-alanine, but the cause of dSL accumulation in diabetes is
not known. Importantly, oral supplementation with the amino acid L-serine suppresses formation of dSLs and
improves neuropathy in animal models of DN, suggesting that dSLs could play a role in DN. The proposed study
aims to define the specific dSL molecules that are most closely associated with DN and evaluate the contribution of
altered L-alanine to L-serine ratios to dSL accumulation in T2D. Defining the specific molecules in the dSL
pathway that are most closely associated with DN and understanding the cause for their formation could
lead to the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for the disease.
Advanced mass spectrometry techniques have been used to demonstrate elevations in select dSLs (1-
deoxydihyroceramides) in a small cohort of adults with morbid obesity, T2D and DN. Results showed that 1) L-
serine levels were lower and L-alanine levels higher in subjects with DN as compared to controls; and 2) that
increased L-alanine to L-serine ratios correlated positively with dSLs and with DN severity. In Aim 1 of the
proposed studies, the same state of the art techniques will be used to examine detailed dSL profiles and amino acid
levels cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the Treatment Options for T2D in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY)
cohort. These studies will examine whether L-alanine to L-serine ratios are associated with dSL accumulation in
youth onset T2D in a cross sectional comparison (Aim 1a); and test whether elevations in L-alanine to L-serine
ratios and dSLs are associated with an increased odds of developing DN using a retrospective case-control study
design (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, correlations between dSLs and L-alanine to L-serine ratios to DN severity will be
examined in an adult T2D cohort (without the confounder of morbid obesity) at the University of Colorado using
validated DN measures including nerve fiber density on skin biopsy.
The K23 grant will allow the candidate to pursue training in 1) clinical outcome measures specific to DN, 2)
epidemiologic principles and statistical methods, and 3) fundamentals of lipid biology and mass spectrometry. The
mentorship and advising of Drs. Jane Reusch, Robert Murphy, Bryan Bergman, Eva Feldman, and Leslie Lange,
whose expertise spans endocrinology, DN, epidemiology and lipid biology, is ideally suited for this project. The

vertebrate models, where endogenous opioid peptides bind to their cognate receptors to dampen behavioral
responses to painful stimuli. Genetically tractable model organisms such as Drosophila have recently been used

such pathways are likely to exist is evidenced by our preliminary findings that the opiate compound morphine is
analgesic for Drosophila larvae and that a conserved G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is required in this
organism for thermal analgesia. Morphine feeding to fly larvae causes transient analgesia that spans multiple
sensory modalities (heat, cold, touch, chemical), is mimicked by other opiates (fentanyl) and is partially naloxone
reversible. Our short-term goals over the initial project period will be to characterize the GPCR required for
thermal analgesia. Using our knowledge of which tissues express the GPCR we will determine which tissues
functionally require it for analgesia, and assess whether the putative receptor’s analgesic effects extend to other
sensory modalities beyond heat. At the biochemical level we will test whether the GPCR (and it’s clearest human
ortholog) directly binds morphine to activate signaling. At the genetic level we will identify endogenous peptide
ligand(s) and probe genetic interactions with previously identified nociceptive genes and nociceptive sensitization
signaling pathways. In our final aim we will probe cellular effects of morphine administration (calcium changes)
and whether known deleterious biological side effects of morphine, development of tolerance and constipation
are also observed in our new model. Successful completion of these aims will provide a comprehensive cellular
and genetic analysis of analgesic signaling in this new model- basic information that is likely to generate testable
hypotheses for ongoing work in vertebrate models. Moving forward, this new model of analgesic signaling will
provide the possibility of unbiased gene discovery approaches that should allow for identification of novel
conserved genes required for analgesia- targets that may in some cases be potentially relevant to human and
health and worthy of further exploration in vertebrate models and clinical settings."
10848323,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with advanced stage disease for which available treatment interventions offer minimal survival benefit.
Early detection through screening is vital to achieve cure and minimize lung cancer morbidity and mortality. Low-
dose computed tomography (LDCT) has become the standard lung cancer screening modality based on data
from randomized clinical trials. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) relaxed its lung
cancer screening eligibility criteria (based on age and smoking history) providing coverage to younger and lighter
smokers. Even though the eligibility expansion is expected to enhance benefits in specific population groups,
many newly eligible individuals would have low lung cancer risk making it less likely to benefit from screening,
but will be subject to potential harms such as false-positive findings and risks from invasive diagnostic
procedures, emotional and psychological distress, and cost. Thus, it is imperative to accurately identify
individuals that are likely to benefit from screening. Management of indeterminate findings is challenging, given
the high rates of benign nodules detected by LDCT. Existing lung cancer screening and diagnostic guidelines
ignore important risk-factors, whereas promising risk prediction models assessing screening eligibility of
individuals and malignancy of indeterminate findings omit life-expectancy and remain underutilized.
This research aims to develop individualized, dynamic risk-based screening and diagnostic strategies through
stochastic, dynamic decision models. This project leverages the individualizEd luNG cAncer screeninG dEcisions
(ENGAGE) framework – a previously developed and validated framework – that offers individualized screening
decisions by dynamically assessing the risk and life expectancy of ever-smoked individuals. We will expand the
current version of ENGAGE, which is based on age, sex, and smoking history, to incorporate non-smoking risk
factors including race, family history and history of pulmonary disease among others, into the decision-making
process. We will develop microsimulation models to simulate the progression of pulmonary nodules and overlay
a partially observable Markov decision process to optimize the diagnostic management of pulmonary nodules at
the patient level, based on a risk assessment for the nodule’s malignancy and information collected from serial
LDCT, biopsy, PET/CT or a diagnostic blood-based biomarker. We will integrate the diagnostic module into
ENGAGE to derive state-of-the-art individualized screening and diagnostic recommendations, and compare the
effectiveness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of the updated ENGAGE framework against current practice.
This project presents a new direction in lung cancer screening research paving the road towards individualized
secondary cancer prevention. The expansion of the ENGAGE framework to facilitate a personalized risk-based
program that integrates smoking and non-smoking risk factors, along with life expectancy, will form the basis for
the development of optimal, cost-effective lung cancer screening guidelines tailored to individuals."
10848285,"Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their families are especially vulnerable during a disaster. Disasters it limit caregivers’ ability to continue with care due to disaster related stress and reduced access to resources and support. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the extreme vulnerability of persons with ADRD and their caregivers as they struggled to access support and resources due to fear associated with COVID-19 infection; such impact was exacerbated in rural areas where caregivers are geographically isolated and disaster management resources are scarce. With the number of federally declared disasters increased dramatically over the past 50 years, active public health efforts are needed to support caregivers develop emergency caregiving plans usable in disasters such pandemics and extreme weather emergencies. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance emergency preparedness and support networks of caregivers of individuals with ADRD to increase their resilience and minimize distress by implementing an intervention program, Disaster PrepWise (DPW). In the DPW program, a trained Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) volunteer will provide step-by-step guidance to caregivers to jointly develop emergency preparedness plans and personal support networks. The objectives for this proposed study are to 1) test the impact of DPW on caregiver outcomes (i.e., resilience, stress) and perceptions that may mediate the association between DPW and outcomes (caregiver self-efficacy, preparedness, social support); and 2) evaluate implementation strategies in a real-world setting to optimize future dissemination. We will conduct a randomized control trial of 200 caregivers of persons with ADRD involving two arms: DPW intervention group and information-only control group (print information on disaster preparedness). Assessments will occur before randomization (baseline), and 3- and 6-month after the baseline. This study is innovative in its use of highly personalized disaster preparedness program with built-in assistance to support caregivers; the support will be provided through an existing national-level public health infrastructure (MRC) that has a great potential to reach older adults and caregivers in rural areas. The knowledge and data obtained through this study will lay the foundation for a future larger-scale multi-state pragmatic trial to assess dissemination potentials."
10848287,"SUMMARY. MarR (Multiple antibiotic resistance Repressor) proteins comprise an ancient family of transcription
factors that are widely conserved in bacteria. In the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, MarR is a
negative regulator of the AcrAB-TolC drug efflux pump, while another MarR transcription factor called SlyA is a
counter-silencer required for the expression of horizontally-acquired virulence genes. We have recently shown
that despite its divergent function, SlyA shares with MarR the ability to undergo allosteric modulation by aromatic
carboxylate molecules and can influence the mar phenotype by repressing the marRAB operon. Inactivation of
TolC, an essential component of the AcrAB and other RND-family efflux pumps, phenocopies a slyA mutation,
reducing the expression of Salmonella virulence genes. This suggests that efflux regulates the levels of an
endogenous metabolite that interacts with SlyA, which in turn controls MarR expression, completing a regulatory
circuit that coordinately links antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and bacterial metabolism.
This proposal investigates the hypothesis that Salmonella antimicrobial resistance and virulence are
coordinately regulated in response to metabolic signals by the MarR and SlyA transcription factors
through the following specific aims:
(1) Identification of endogenous ligand(s) that modulate MarR/SlyA activity. Preliminary data indicate that
SlyA-interacting ligand(s) are aromatic carboxylates. Specific endogenous ligands will be identified by genetic
and metabolomic methods and characterized with regard to affinity and allosteric inhibition.
(2) Functional characterization of MarR-SlyA-TolC regulatory interactions in Salmonella antimicrobial
resistance and virulence. The contribution of the MarR-SlyA regulatory network to Salmonella phenotypic
antimicrobial resistance and virulence will be assessed in vitro and in vivo.
(3) Comparative analysis of the MarR and SlyA regulons. MarR/SlyA-regulated genes and binding sites will
be comprehensively identified to determine the regulatory requirements for repression and counter-silencing,
respectively, and to elucidate the mechanisms of transcriptional network evolution.
These studies will provide important insights into a central regulatory network linking bacterial virulence, drug
resistance, and metabolism, which can lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for the prevention or
treatment of bacterial infections."
10848372,"Project Abstract/Summary
 The goal of this proposed F32 postdoctoral fellowship is to provide the applicant with a
multi-disciplinary training experience in genetic epidemiology and nutrigenetics analysis. The
applicant will engage in advanced scholarly activities to understand genetic and nutrigenetic
influences on the susceptibility to, and severity of, developmental delays and traits that the
constitute fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continuum. The overarching aim of this
application is to characterize the effect of maternal nutrition, maternal and child genetic
predisposition, and maternal diet-by-genetic interaction as it relates to the child's physical
dysmorphology, neurodevelopmental abilities, and FASD diagnosis. This application capitalizes
on previously collected biological samples (circulating plasma concentrations) and genetic data
from pregnant women in the Western Cape Province of South Africa whose offspring have been
followed since birth with standardized dysmorphology and neurodevelopmental assessments.
This project will (1) determine whether maternal nutrient status mediates the relationship
between alcohol exposure and child growth, dysmorphology, and neurocognitive outcomes; (2)
develop a polygenic risk score associated with FASD diagnosis; and (3) determine whether
there is a choline-related diet-by-gene interaction which partially explains the susceptibility and
severity of an FASD diagnosis. Key components of the training plan include advanced
instruction in genetic epidemiology and nutrigenomic theory and applied statistical analysis.
Specific skills to be mastered during this fellowship include: (1) quantitative analytic skills in the
genetics of complex diseases; (2) advanced training in nutrigenetics data analysis; and (3)
enhancement of leadership and grantsmanship skills. The proposed fellowship will enable these
goals through carefully selected coursework, research experiences, seminars, and workshops.
Collectively, these will provide an unparalleled opportunity to gain the advanced skills before
applying the methods and techniques to important, yet largely unanswered questions about the
etiology of FASD. This application provides a rich training environment to carry out the research
plan. The proposed research plan will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent
investigator by establish the applicant's expertise in genetics and nutrigenetic analysis and
applying this expertise to determining nutritional, genetic, nutrigenetic influences on the
susceptibility and severity of an FASD diagnosis, an area of research remains vastly
uncharacterized within the field of FASD."
10856695,"Project Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal form of progressive lung fibrosis (scarring), resulting in a loss of
40,000 Americans a year - a number of deaths similar to that of breast cancer. The role of basal cells or basal-
like cells in IPF is unknown. Basal cells are stem cells in the airway. However, accumulation of aberrant basal-
like cells has been reported in IPF. Using the state-of-the-art technology, we identified that basal-like cells are
significantly expanded in IPF lungs, and may have a pathological role. Furthermore, dysregulated signaling
pathways in basal-like cells cause excessive production of WNT7A. Our preliminary studies showed that WNT7A
promotes fibroblast activation and impairs renewal of type 2 alveolar epithelial stem cells (AT2). We therefore
formed a unified hypothesis that the dysregulated signaling pathways in the pathogenically accumulated basal-
like cells in IPF promote fibrogenesis by activation of the WNT signaling, leading to impairment of AT2 renewal
and to exaggerated fibroblast activation. We will test this hypothesis in human samples collected from lung
transplants and also in genetically modified mouse models. Therapeutic strategy to target WNT7A could improve
alveolar progenitor activity and damper fibroblast activation, thus leading to alleviate lung injury and prevent lung
fibrosis."

 Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunostimulatory cytokine that plays a central role in antitumor immunity,
particularly in the activation and proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells for tumor eradication.
Proleukin® is the first FDA approved immunotherapy drug with curable responses in a subset of renal and
skin cancer patients. However, significant immune-related toxicities, short half-life, and inadvertent activation
of immune tolerant regulatory T cells (Tregs) restrict the wide clinical adoption of Proleukin® therapy.
Pleotropic effect of IL-2 in the activation of both immune suppressive Tregs and tumor killing CD8+ T cells and
NK cells drove the development of IL-2 mutein superkines with polarized affinity toward CD8+ T/NK cells.
Moreover, tumor acidity has been shown to deactivate wildtype IL-2, which spurred the design of low pH-
resistant IL-2 muteins. Long circulating IL-2 has also been developed by fusion of Fc or albumin proteins to
IL-2. Despite extensive efforts, most protein-engineered IL-2 still encounter significant systemic toxicities that
limit the dose and efficacy in cancer therapy. The long-term goal of this application is to establish tumor-
activatable IL-2 mutein superkine nanoparticles as an integrated paradigm for IL-2 therapy. We aim to
combine nanoparticle engineering with protein engineering to minimize systemic toxicity while maintaining
antitumor efficacy in the acidic tumor microenvironment. In the past decade, our lab invented a library of ultra-
pH sensitive (UPS) nanoparticles with cooperative micelle/unimer phase transitions in response to a specific
pH threshold. Preliminary data show UPS delivery of wildtype IL-2 Fc greatly reduced systemic toxicities
(e.g., >100-fold reduction in interferon- levels) while maintaining the antitumor efficacy of IL-2 Fc. Our
collaborator Dr. Tao Yue’s lab recently identified a low pH-resistant IL-2 superkine with 20-fold higher binding
to IL-2 receptor  (R) than wildtype IL-2 while maintaining high activity at pH 6.4 whereas wildtype IL-2 lost
its activity. In this application, we will test the central hypothesis that tumor-activatable delivery of R-tropic,
acidity-resistant IL-2 superkine by the ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles will effectively mask the systemic
toxicity in normal tissues while achieving robust activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in tumors for efficacious
therapy. We will carry out three specific aims. Aim 1: Establish acidity-resistant IL-2 superkine-UPS
nanoparticles with stable loading and pH-activatable release. Aim 2: Investigate the safety and antitumor
efficacy of IL-2 Fc superkine-UPS nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice and elucidate tropism of CD8+ T/NK
cell activation over Tregs. Aim 3: Investigate the synergy of sodium lactate treatment with IL-2 Fc superkine
nanoparticle therapy. We anticipate successful execution of the proposed application will lead to a new
paradigm in interleukine-2 therapy with improved safety and antitumor efficacy outcomes."

tune the reactivities of unusual intermediates to achieve mild, versatile syntheses of stereochemically rich,
densely functionalized N-hetero- and carbocycles, including those in bioactive molecules that bind to specific
ribosomal subunits. The synthesis of macrocyclic compounds displaying stable axial chirality that play important
roles in biology and medicine is the focus of research in the Gellman lab, where new bifunctional foldamer
catalysts are being developed to exploit non-traditional peptide scaffolds that orient reactive groups to achieve
high stereoinduction during macrocyclization. The Martell group's growing research program is developing hybrid
biological-synthetic catalysts consisting of three-dimensional, self-assembled DNA and protein scaffolds as
catalysts for stereo- and regio-selective transformations, coupling reactions, and the tagging of endogenous

Funds are being requested to purchase a Super Argus PET/CT 6R small-animal PET (positron
emission tomography) and CT (transmission computed tomography) scanner (Scintica, Webster, TX)
to replace our Inveon microPET/microCT scanner. Importantly, Siemens Medical Solutions (the
manufacturer of the Inveon) has informed us that the support of the Inveon will end within the next 1 to 2
years (i.e., by the end of 2025), meaning that parts and service for needed repairs, software upgrades, and
applications support will very likely not be available beyond that end-of-support date. The proposed Super
Argus PET/CT 6R will be used in mouse and rat models to non-invasively and longitudinally: monitor cancer
and other disease processes; assess trafficking of cancer, immune, and stem cells; evaluate cellular
responses to investigational anti-cancer therapies and other interventions; assay genetic pathway
expression; and measure tumor targeting and biodistribution of new radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic
agents. Like the Inveon, the state-of-the-art Super Argus PET/CT 6R, to be installed in our existing Animal
Imaging Core Facility, will be a critical, broadly used resource for the pre-clinical and translational oncology
research program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The Super Argus PET/CT 6R, as
noted, will replace the ageing Inveon, installed in 2013 and now over 10 years. With its impending end of
support, should the Inveon require service support and replacement parts, they likely will not be available and
this heavily used, mission-critical resource would be immediately and permanently disabled - a devastating
blow to our entire pre-clinical research program. Funds for a new, fully supported, higher-performance, and
more functional small-animal PET/CT system, the Super Argus PET/CT 6R, are therefore urgently requested
to maintain, enhance, and expand our PET and CT imaging capabilities. In addition to maintaining
manufacturer service and applications support, among the critical advantages of the Super Argus PET/CT 6R
over our existing, now-outdated Inveon are: (1) superior spatial resolution – 0.7 mm full-width half-maximum
(FWHM) for PET and as low as 15 µm for CT; (2) phoswich detector-based depth-of-interaction (DOI)
correction for PET and resulting constant resolution across the 120-mm transaxial field of view (FOV); (3)
high PET sensitivity - 12%; and (4) a long axial FOV - 15 cm. The Super Argus PET/CT 6R is a fully
integrated multi-modality system providing transparent registration of PET and CT studies or serving as
stand-alone PET and CT systems. In addition to numerous new and ongoing funded projects which will use
the Super Argus PET/CT 6R, our Facility and MSK have well-established technical and scientific expertise to
continue to productively utilize this instrument and an efficient administrative and solvent financial
infrastructure in place to support and maintain this instrument and its effective use long-term."

The human 7SK RNP is a dynamic assembly of the long non-coding 7SK RNA and cellular proteins that
regulates the activity of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is an essential eukaryotic
transcription factor for mRNA transcription elongation, which regulates the transition from promoter proximal
paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation. P-TEFb is also an essential human cofactor
for HIV-1 Tat transactivation and therefore viral replication. The human 7SK core RNP comprises the 331 nt
RNAPIII-transcribed non-coding 7SK RNA, an unusual methyl capping enzyme called MePCE that methylates
the γ phosphate on the RNA 5' terminus, and the La related protein 7, Larp7, that associates with the terminal
hairpin and UUU-3'OH. In the active 7SK snRNP, Hexim and P-TEFb, a heterodimer of Cyclin T1 and the
kinase Cdk9, bind the 7SK core RNP; interaction of P-TEFb in this complex inactivates it by sequestering its
active site. Despite the central role of 7SK in transcription regulation of mRNA, other RNAPII RNAs, and HIV-1
transcription, relatively little is known at a structural or mechanistic level about how cellular proteins assemble
with 7SK RNA to form a functional 7SK RNP or how Tat interacts with it to ultimately release P-TEFb. We will
employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and cryo electron microscopy along with
biochemical methods to investigate the structures and assembly of the 7SK core RNP (MePCE–7SK–Larp7)
and 7SK core RNP plus Hexim and P-TEFb (the `active' 7SK RNP) in order to achieve an atomic-level
understanding of this important host RNP for HIV-1 viral replication. These structural studies will lay the
groundwork for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of Tat-Hexim competition in the context of 7SK RNP.
We aim to dissect the potential intermediate steps (i.e. Tat-bound 7SK RNP) that lead to P-TEFb hijacking
from 7SK RNP into the HIV-1 viral super-elongation complex. The results of these experiments will provide
fundamental molecular insights into and a structural basis for drug targeting of this largely structurally
uncharacterized RNP that is essential for HIV-1 transcription and therefore escape from latency."

To ensure continued progress towards the regional goal of malaria elimination all residual parasite reservoirs
and emerging drug resistance need to be detected and eliminated with effective treatment to prevent ongoing
transmission.
This requires new surveillance tools and approaches to accurately quantify malaria transmission and identify the
main drivers of continued transmission to ensure efficient allocation of resources to eliminate malaria. It requires
new, more sensitive diagnostic tools and local evidence that can support a shift towards more effective radical
cure of vivax malaria. We need to understand the emergence and spread of P. falciparum artemisinin and partner
drug resistance in PNG, learning from the experience in Cambodia and using this evidence to guide PNG
treatment policy. Additionally, there is a need to confirm and mitigate the emergence of P. vivax drug resistance
in Cambodia. Lastly, there are gaps in our knowledge related to the role that parasite and host genetics play in
determining the efficacy of 8-aminoquinolines, as well as the factors that underpin the rapid acquisition of clinical
immunity to P. vivax that drives continued transmission by asymptomatic carriers.
The overall aim of the Asia-Pacific ICEMR Epidemiology Project is therefore to generate evidence to improve
surveillance, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, with a specific focus on P. vivax and drug resistance, which
are major roadblocks to achieving elimination in the Asia-Pacific region.
To achieve this novel genomic, sero-surveillance and point of care diagnostic approaches (Diagnostics and
Surveillance Core) will be used to identify current Plasmodium spp. infections, drug resistance and population
structure in samples from passive and active surveillance, enabling efficient and highly detailed resolution of
malaria transmission risk. This data will be used in interventions scenario models (Data, Biostatistics and
Modelling Core) to evaluate optimal surveillance, case management and targeted intervention approaches for
different transmission settings in the Asia-Pacific region. Evidence generated will directly inform national
diagnosis and treatment guidelines in Cambodia and PNG, to ensure the most effective case management in
the face of drug resistance and persistent P. vivax."

The Asia-Pacific region is facing serious emerging threats to malaria control and elimination goals, and some
have already led to documented increases in malaria case numbers in recent years. Most importantly,
substandard and poorly understood vector control products have diminished the impact of the national vector
control program in PNG, the region's most important malaria arena. Critical threats also include the emerging
pyrethroid resistance detected in our PNG ICEMR sites, the expected vector range expansions due to the
accelerating impacts of climate change and the overarching challenge of addressing an increasing proportion of
P. vivax malaria. While Cambodia is currently progressing towards elimination as a result of deforestation and
effective implementation of malaria control strategies against P. falciparum, malaria elimination success in the
Asia-Pacific region will be decided in PNG where anthropogenic landscape transformation is still in the early
stages, and by the ability to control P. vivax.
Addressing these threats will require robust new vector surveillance approaches to map the spread of insecticide
resistance and trace vector range expansion into highly vulnerable populations due to climate change. The
context-specific performance of vector-control tools such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, will need to be robustly
evaluated to inform national vector control strategies and procurement policies. New transmission-blocking
interventions including new vector control approaches and transmission blocking vaccines will be needed to
effectively limit the spread of P. vivax. Learning experiences from countries further along the pathway to
elimination such as Cambodia will be needed to guide vector control strategy and policy in countries that are
less advanced such as PNG.
The overall aim of the Asia-Pacific ICEMR Transmission Project is therefore to generate critical evidence to
improve malaria vector surveillance and malaria prevention through vector control, with a specific focus on
pyrethroid resistance, substandard bed net products and environmental changes driving P. vivax transmission.
To achieve this, novel integrated vector surveillance strategies will be developed and piloted in our ICEMR sites
to understand the spread and impact of emerging pyrethroid resistance and accelerating climate change-related
vector range expansion using cutting-edge vector population genomics tools (Diagnostics and Surveillance
Core). We will use the world-leading vector control tool evaluation capacity in our ICEMR sites linked to spatially
explicit transmission modelling (Data, Biostatistics and Modelling Core) to rank LLIN products by product and
context-specific cost-effectiveness enabling national malaria control programs to select the best possible
products. We will provide critical support to accelerate the development of novel transmission-blocking drug and
vaccine candidates by providing access to globally unique, multi-country P. vivax human-to-mosquito
transmission study capacity in our ICEMR sites."

Medicaid claims linked to social services data to evaluate the overall and differential effects by race, ethnicity,
age, socioeconomic status, and geography of the CDI on 1a) birth, mental health, cardiovascular, and SMM
outcomes; 1b) prenatal and postpartum healthcare utilization; and 1c) receipt of social services, among
Medicaid-eligible birthing people from 2022 to 2027. In Aim 2, we will analyze diverse perspectives on and
experiences with the MHQIN program components and its implementation among birthing clients and hospital,
Medicaid, and doulas/community stakeholders via in-depth individual interviews, focus group discussions, and
surveys. In Aim 3, our Community Coalition Research Leadership Advisory Board will lead a co-design process
to develop an evidence-based strategic plan for policy implementation to scale and sustain Medicaid-supported
ISC, including doula reimbursement. We will generate new evidence on the role that doulas play in improving
maternal health equity, strengthen local partnerships for policy action, and serve as a model for national
replicability. Our proposal is highly aligned with NIH’s strategic plan for innovative research to advance
community-derived, multi-level policy solutions to redress the crisis of MM for birthing people across the U.S."

Global estimates suggest that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) now has the highest incidence and prevalence of stroke.
However, limited system resources, meager patient resources, uncoordinated care, and shortage of clinicians,
greatly hamper the capacity of countries in SSA to implement effective measures aimed at controlling key
vascular risk factors such as hypertension (HTN) to thwart stroke recurrence in routine clinical practice. In
particular, SSA has the highest estimated effect size of HTN for stroke causation worldwide. HTN is often
unrecognized, undertreated and uncontrolled in a significant proportion of the adult population in this region due to
a clustering of factors including cultural beliefs and misconceptions about hypertension, low self-efficacy, non-
adherence to treatment, unavailability of health facilities, health personnel, lack of access to of antihypertensive
medications, therapeutic inertia by physicians, and other factors. With the anticipated continued transition from
primarily infectious conditions to chronic non-communicable diseases, the burden of stroke in SSA is likely to
increase even further over the next several decades. Given all of the aforementioned factors, it is an urgent
priority for countries in SSA to develop and test self-management interventions to control hypertension among
those at highest risk of adverse outcomes. The overall objective of Phone-based Intervention under Nurse
Guidance after Stroke II (PINGS-2) is to deploy a hybrid study design to firstly, demonstrate the efficacy in a
randomized controlled trial of a theoretical-model-based, mHealth technology-centered, nurse-led, multi-level
integrated approach to substantially improve longer term BP control among 500 recent stroke patients
encountered at 10 hospitals in Ghana. Secondly, PINGS II seeks to develop an implementation strategy for
routine integration and policy adoption of mhealth for post-stroke BP control in a LMIC setting. We will leverage
experience gained from the NIH Global Brain Disorders funded R21 pilot study (NS094033) to test efficacy of a
refined, culturally-tailored, and potentially implementable intervention aimed at addressing the premier modifiable
risk for stroke & other key variables in an under-resourced system burdened by suboptimal care & outcomes. The
primary outcome is blood pressure control at month 12 alongside a host of secondary outcome measures such as
medication adherence, self-efficacy, cardiovascular emergency department encounters, quality of life, and
mediator outcomes. While it is important to establish the efficacy of a nurse-led, m-health-centered self-
management intervention for blood pressure control in LMICs, it equally crucial to simultaneously begin crafting an
implementation plan. Hence we will seek to identify context-specific implementation facilitators and barriers, to
understand the implementation context, and craft evidence-based implementation strategies for routine use &
policy adoption of the PINGS intervention in Ghana through multiple stakeholder engagements."
10835914,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Colorectal adenoma is the precursor for the vast majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs). We and others have
shown that lifestyle factors play an important role in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Western diet
and obesity have been associated with increased risk of colorectal neoplasia, whereas physical activity and
regular use of aspirin has been associated with lower risk. Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbes are
pivotal in integrating environmental cues with host physiology and metabolism, and disturbances in the gut
microbiota have been linked to colorectal neoplasia and other chronic conditions. Although a role for microbiota
in carcinogenesis is gaining acceptance, available human data are largely cross-sectional and do not lend
themselves to interrogation of whether microbes are intrinsically oncogenic (i.e. “drivers”) or a consequence of
tumorigenesis (i.e. “passengers”). Thus, there is a high unmet need to conduct a large, prospective study to
examine the network of interactions between the gut microbiota and their associated metabolites, lifestyle
factors, and colorectal neoplasia within diverse populations. We propose to characterize the gut microbiota
leveraging stool samples currently being collected from women and men enrolled in the ongoing Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS)II (n=25,000) and the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) (n=8,500). Participants have been
followed since 1989 (NHSII) and 2002 (SCCS) and have provided validated, updated assessments of diet,
lifestyle, medication use, and diagnoses of chronic diseases with high follow-up. After stool collection, we will
continue to follow these cohorts and document the incidence of adenoma. We will test the hypothesis that
lifestyle factors linked with CRC are associated with a higher abundance of immunomodulatory and tumor-
permissive gut microbes and a depletion of microbes that protect against tumorigenesis. In turn, these gut
microbiome patterns and their associated metabolites will be associated with risk of adenoma on follow-up
colonoscopy. To provide additional evidence of causality, we will examine if the gut microbial features in baseline
stool samples linked to adenoma will be stable in stool samples collected after adenoma development and is
associated with gut microbial features and expression of human host genes and pathways in adenoma tissue.
By leveraging ongoing, already funded stool collections within a cohort of predominantly white women (NHS II)
and a cohort of women and men with a high proportion of African-Americans (65%) and the socioeconomically
disadvantaged (SCCS), our proposal is highly cost-efficient and will offer rigorous and reproducible results
relevant to diverse populations. Our established multidisciplinary team proposes the next critical step in
understanding the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota, lifestyle factors and colorectal neoplasia in
diverse populations. This investigation will illuminate significant insights into the etiopathogenesis of CRC and
launch novel research into CRC prevention through gut microbiota-targeted diagnostics and therapeutics."
10835916,"ABSTRACT
Hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a significant public health issue and
represents a sentinel prognostic event, with high risk of poor clinical outcomes during and after the
hospitalization. Investigation to improve the care of ADHF patients is a public health priority. The kidneys
have a central role in the acute management and prognosis of ADHF. Kidney injury is highly prevalent in
ADHF and is the culmination of hemodynamic alterations, neurohormonal dysregulation, and oxidative stress
which cause intra-kidney endothelial damage, inflammation and ischemic injury. Kidney injury is also a key
component in decisions of initiation and withdrawal of standard AHDF therapies, which ultimately affects
clinical prognosis of ADHF. However, systematic measurement and consideration of kidney injury is not
incorporated into algorithms of ADHF therapies, likely due to limitations of current clinically available kidney
injury measures. Serum creatinine has traditionally been used to define kidney injury in ADHF, however rises
late and is slow to change in response to ongoing kidney injury or repair; which limits its use in dynamic
conditions such as ADHF. Studies have shown that serum creatinine is not associated with systemic
decongestion or with short-term prognosis in ADHF. Thus, current ADHF guidelines do not endorse serial
measures of serum creatinine. The goal of this proposal is to identify novel kidney injury markers that can
guide therapy and better determine prognosis in ADHF; thereby improve in-hospital and long-term outcomes.
To address this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct a large, prospective study of ADHF patients to
determine: (1) if systematic, serial measurements of novel kidney injury markers change in response to a
standardized, evidence-based ADHF treatment protocol; (2) and whether these changes are associated with
patient-reported, in-hospital and long-term outcomes. Based on previous literature, we have chosen to study a
panel of novel kidney injury measures of endothelial injury, inflammation, tubular stress/damage which may
better reflect intra-kidney pathophysiology, and may be more dynamic to reflect kidney injury/repair compared
with serum creatinine. These novel kidney injury measures are poised to be clinically available in the near
future, however are not well studied in ADHF. To support our hypothesis, we conducted a pilot prospective
study of 62 patients admitted with ADHF and found that novel kidney injury measures demonstrated greater
relative change in response to standardized ADHF therapies and correlated well with systemic congestion;
while serum creatinine was relatively static and correlated poorly with systemic congestion. This
promising pilot data supports the scientific rationale and feasibility of the proposed work. The data
from this study will be used to identify the most promising kidney injury markers in ADHF patients and may be
the foundation of future mechanistic studies or a clinical trial to test an ADHF treatment strategy guided by
novel kidney injury markers."
10835918,"The pathogenic mechanism of Huntington’s disease (HD), a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative
disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, is poorly understood, stymieing
therapeutic development. Our overarching goal is to better understand HD pathogenesis and identify targetable
pathways for therapeutic intervention by studying genetic modifiers of HD, initially identified by the GeM-HD
consortium. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate one HD modifier, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase
subunit M2 B (RRM2B), by delineating its isoform-specific biological activity on mitochondrial regulation and
characterizing its effect on HD pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that the two SNPs in chr8 GWAS modifier
haplotype, rs1037699 and rs5893603, shown to lower RRM2B isoform 2 levels, play a critical role in isoform 2-
specific complex(es), altering overall RRM2B activity and HD pathogenesis. Upon completion, this work will
validate RRM2B isoform 2 as a modulator of HD pathogenesis and serve as a foundation for novel therapeutic
disease-altering strategies as well as providing insight into the fundamental mechanism of HD by: 1)
Characterizing isoform-specific RRM2B activity, focusing on its role in mitochondrial regulation, on subcellular
localization, stress-response assays, and knockdown experiments in LCLs and human neuronal progenitor cells
(hNPCs) and neurons differentiated from our new HTT isogenic series of iPSCs with different CAG sizes (17, 40,
51 and 61); 2) Identifying key cellular protein complexes containing RRM2B isoform 2 in a stress and time
dependent manner using APEX-mediated quantitative proteomics; 3) Evaluating potential therapeutic effects by
augmenting RRM2B isoform 2 levels in HD patient cells using novel technologies, such as non-coding antisense
RNA (SIENUP). Novel techniques and resources include sensitive allele-specific SRM-MS for targeted
quantification, recently optimized gene therapy tools, and innovative HD cell model systems, designed to
precisely delineate CAG signatures relevant for HD. This proposal will unveil the interface between RRM2B
biology and HD pathogenesis, establishing RRM2B as a targetable pathway and potentially revealing other
players in the pathogenic cascade. Our expectation is that strategies to upregulate RRM2B isoform 2 level will
have a positive effect on HD phenotypes, providing a key candidate for therapeutics. Overall, the positive
outcomes of this work will enable us to better understand the effect of genetic modifiers on HD and validate
immediate targets for rational drug design, providing additional avenues for future therapeutic strategies."

Impaired social communication is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This proposal will evaluate
a series of peer-mediated interventions for preschool-age children (3 to 6 years) with ASD and limited or no
spoken language, using an innovative Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design.
Available evidence supports the beneficial effects of peer-mediated interventions for improving social
communication skills in children with ASD.1, 2 Peer-related social competence is vital to a wide range of child
outcomes.3 Children who achieve positive peer interactions in preschool show improved social communication
and fewer behavioral problems in elementary school.4 In spite of considerable early intervention efforts,
approximately 30% of children with ASD remain minimally-verbal in kindergarten5, restricting participation in
inclusive activities. Recent studies report improved communication between children with ASD and peers after
a speech-generating device (SGD) is included in treatment.6-9 A repertoire of effective interventions that can be
applied and modified is necessary to ensure optimal social communication outcomes when children do not
make anticipated progress. A strength of the study is that these interventions can be adopted by community-
based, early service providers. All participants will receive an adapted Stay-Play-Talk (SPT)7, 10-12 peer-
mediated intervention that varies in active ingredients examined by the PI in preliminary studies. Now, with
SMART designs, it is possible to test and identify alternative combinations of peer-mediated approaches, such
as the addition of a SGD to improve social communication of children with ASD and complex communication
needs.7, 8, 13 In the current proposal, 132 preschoolers with ASD (and N=264 peers without disabilities) will be
initially randomized to SPT and SGD with spoken peer input only (SPT Basic; peers taught to model language)
or SPT and SGD with augmented peer input in which peers are taught to model verbal responses while
simultaneously selecting screen icons (SPT Plus; peers taught to use verbal language models concurrently
with the SGD). Each child’s response to treatment after 5 weeks will determine that child’s next phase in the
SMART design. Children showing a positive response will continue in their originally assigned group. Children
who are slow responders after 5 weeks will be randomly assigned to receive added treatment components to
improve peer-directed communication (either SPT Plus or SPT Advanced). SPT Advanced adds direct
instruction strategies for the children with ASD (i.e., adult prompts, reinforcers, and teaching trials) shown to
increase child vocalizations in SGD interventions.9, 14 The use of a SMART design extends our prior work by
testing the systematic addition of selected peer-mediated strategies in combination with an SGD8 that allows
for flexible application of interventions based on child response measured at important nodal points.15-17 We
have assembled an outstanding team of highly qualified investigators with complementary skills in preschool
assessment, language intervention, clinical trials, and statistics."
10836039,"Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to
identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS
screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require
collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an
important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA
amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive
cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic
disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and
mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical
feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be
pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic
diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and
Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel
second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and
translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work
with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this
combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic
delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby
reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families."
10854904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains largely incurable and recent studies have shown that the
metabolic pathways of PDA cells are profoundly rewired. Nonetheless, this metabolic rewiring may also
engender liabilities that can be exploited for PDA treatment. Using genetically-engineered mouse models and
pancreatic ductal organoids, we previously showed that PDA cells are dependent upon KRAS-mediated
increases in protein synthesis. As several key oncogenic signaling pathways converge on the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), we recently examined whether an inhibitor (CR-31) of its associated RNA
helicase (eIF4A) affects the viability of PDA cells. Strikingly, CR-31 impaired the translation of mRNAs encoding
enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways selectively in cells of PDA, but not normal, ductal organoids.
Moreover, while gemcitabine, the only existing monotherapy for PDA, does not extend the survival of PDA-
bearing mice, we observed that CR-31 alone suppressed PDA tumor growth in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that
eIF4A is a key regulator of pancreatic cancer translation with unique potential as a therapeutic target against
PDA. To realize the potential of eIF4A inhibition in the clinical setting, we propose to define the mechanism of
eIF4A-dependent transcript-specific translation in pancreatic cancer cells (Aim 1), determine the translational
targets of eIF4A that promote PDA (Aim 2), and identify adaptations induced by eIF4A inhibition that can be co-
targeted to more effectively treat this lethal malignancy (Aim 3). This project builds on our expertise in PDA
biology, organoid culture, RNA genomic analysis, as well as access to patient-derived specimens to evaluate
clinical relevance. In addition to illuminating basic mechanisms, the proposed studies will test several novel
treatment options for PDA."

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) can cure a variety of benign and malignant
hematopoietic disorders, but graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant cause of transplant-
related mortality and morbidity. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis of GVHD has
been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. The intestinal microbiota consists of a
community of diverse microbes that reside in the gut and are critical for the host development, homeostasis,
and immune regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in
aberrant systemic immune responses as well as pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the
development of GVHD. A clear rationale exists for targeting the microbiota with the goal to benefit patients
after allo-HCT. Several interventional strategies have been explored by means of antibiotics, diet and
prebiotics, probiotics, microbial metabolites, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT). However, the
identification of optimal FMT donors and appropriate stool screening for immune compromised patients is of a
considerable challenge. Identifying and applying one or more live microorganisms that are safe and effective
in improving health of HCT patients are of high merit. In the preliminary studies, we observed that abundance
of Barnesiella in gut microbiota was associated with the reduction of GVHD in mice after allo-HCT.
Furthermore, administration of a single Barnesiella strain, Barnesiella intestinihominis (BI), was safe and
effective in preventing both acute and chronic GVHD in preclinical murine models. Our preliminary studies
provide initial support that Barnesiella may be a means of probiotics that could benefit to patients after allo-
HCT in the clinic. In fact, BI has been shown to clear of intestinal vancomycin-resistance Enterococcus that
positively associates with GVHD severity in patients after allo-HCT. In this proposal, we will extend our exciting
preliminary studies by further pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) to define the mechanisms by which BI and its
derived metabolites modulate GVHD through maintaining gut homeostasis; 2) to determine the mechanisms by
which BI and its derived metabolites modulate GVH/GVL responses through regulating donor T cells. We
expect to firmly validate Barnesiella as a safe and efficacious probiotic to prevent and treat GVHD without
compromising the GVL effect. Furthermore, we expect to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms
by which Barnesiella regulates microbiota, adaptive immunity, and intestinal barrier functions. If the proposed
studies are successfully executed as expected, we will provide a compelling rationale that Barnesiella
probiotics can be a therapeutic approach that benefits to patients after allo-HCT."
10855766,"Project Summary
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an orphan hematologic malignancy that is clinically
aggressive and fatal in most patients within one year of diagnosis. The disease pathogenesis is largely
unknown, there is no standard treatment, and patients with BPDCN have a clear unmet medical need. The
long-term goal is to improve outcomes in BPDCN by deeper understanding of disease biology. DNA
sequencing in BPDCN revealed a high frequency of mutations in RNA splicing factors, with particular
enrichment in loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2 compared to other cancers. Functional assessment of
patient tumors found that BPDCN is uniquely dependent on the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 and is highly
sensitive to treatment with the BH3 mimetic venetoclax. New genetically engineered models of dendritic cell
leukemia and BPDCN patient-derived xenografts offer a unique opportunity to test the contribution of disease
alleles to splicing abnormalities and therapeutic response. The overall objective of this application is to test the
hypothesis that genetic alterations associated with BPDCN contribute to dendritic cell transformation and
create targetable vulnerabilities. Guided by strong preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory and an
established network of expert collaborators, this central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims:
1) Determine how ZRSR2 mutation promotes dendritic cell transformation; and 2) Identify factors that generate
unique apoptotic dependencies in BPDCN. Under the first Aim, the applicant will use genetic models of ZRSR2
deficiency in dendritic cells and BPDCNs to determine how splicing mutations alter the transcriptome and
cause transformation of the dendritic lineage. They will also test how mutations in ZRSR2, a gene located on
the X chromosome that escapes X-inactivation in female cells, contributes to the male bias of BPDCN and
sensitizes to splicing modulator therapy. Under the second Aim, the mechanisms of BCL2 dependence in
normal and malignant dendritic cells will be investigated in human and mouse hematopoiesis. Adaptations to
chemotherapy in BPDCN will be measured to determine if BCL2 inhibition can overcome chemoresistance,
which is the major barrier to improved outcomes in patients. The approach is innovative by making use of
novel model systems and samples from BPDCN patients on active clinical trials. The downstream effects of
ZRSR2 mutations on BPDCN and male cancer predominance have not been clarified, and the mechanisms of
protection from apoptosis in normal and malignant dendritic cells are unknown. The proposed research is
significant, because it is expected to define the biological role of clinically-relevant mutations in an
understudied and highly fatal disease. The expected output for the proposed research is that the knowledge
gained will be immediately clinically significant for patients with BPDCN because it will inform new treatment
strategies in a cancer that is currently lacking in significant biological and therapeutic insight."
10851499,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The dominant paradigm for clinical engagement during BME design education involves creating
educational experiences for students to access clinical settings as a path to solving problems. Our proposal
addresses three challenges with that paradigm. (1) practical limits, e.g., class size caps, that necessarily restrict
the scope of clinical engagement; (2) the, often overwhelming, nature of the immersion environment amplifies
novice designers’ tendency to approach design as fact gathering instead of creating shared understanding, and
(3) students’ perceptions of medical doctors as omniscient and authoritative information sources results in bias
in how BME students’ use information from them in design. Summarily, the current paradigm reinforces the
deductive thinking and post-positivist perspective to teaching design that design education seeks to disrupt.
 Our proposal, and approach to challenging this paradigm, places student health professionals into courses
across our undergraduate BME curriculum. Our approach builds on frameworks for user-collaborative as
opposed to user-centered design. Doing so ensures that all our BME students interact with health professionals
in a way that centers the development of shared understanding, over an extended period of time, and in a way
that avoids problematic social perceptions. We propose three specific aims: (1) Scale our pilot clinical TA
program across all four required design course in our curriculum while also broadening it to include students
pursuing degrees in a variety of health professions; (2) Establish an educational experience for health
professions students to develop their understanding of the FDA design process, engineering processes and
knowledge, and designing thinking; and (3) Assess the learning impact of both aim 1 and aim 2 on both
populations so as to enable dissemination of a longitudinal, scalable, and access-independent approach to
teaching BME students to team with healthcare professionals.
 Any improvements made in teaching BMEs to design are limited without strong consideration for
developing interdisciplinary collaboration skills. Identifying interested and capable healthcare partners is an
ongoing challenge to biomedical innovation. This is despite health professions students in our pilot noting a
strong interest in such collaboration within their peer groups. However, little training in engineering or working
with engineers is available to health professionals. Previously funded work to improve design education has
created significant progress in how BME students learn to design in teams, especially using authentic problems
and in real clinical settings. However, BME design education’s current path of innovation has learning and
scalability limits. Further improvement necessitates centering a collaborative as opposed to observational
approach to teaching user interaction. Doing so has the potential to improve the capacity of both the BME and
healthcare workforces to work together as a joint solution to solve biomedical challenges.

10857573,"Project Summary/Abstract
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study how the human brain interacts with the
world and how regions of the brain function as networks. However, head movement during the experiment –
even just a few millimeters – leads to errors in the results. This problem confounds research conclusions and
often severely limits studies in populations that are likely to move, such as young children. Previous research
on motion in fMRI has shown that simply correcting for the head movement with prospective motion correction
of the image encoding is not sufficient to recover artifact-free data and accurate resting-state networks, i.e., the
secondary effects of head movement on the fMRI experiment must also be addressed. Hence in this project
we will develop comprehensive correction of head motion by developing acquisition and analysis software to
measure, understand, and correct the relevant effects of head motion. We will develop MR navigator scanner
software to perform real-time measurements of head motion, the B0 environment, and the B1– receive intensity
profile and account for these effects prospectively during acquisition, in image reconstruction, and in data
analysis. Our aim is to produce acquisition, image reconstruction, and analysis tools that can be easily
distributed to researchers to further our understanding of motion artifacts in fMRI and provide stable, high-
quality data that allow for accurate assessment of functional networks despite being acquired during head
motion."
10853505,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In epidemiological cohort studies, the onset of an asymptomatic disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection, cancer, or dementia) cannot be observed
directly but rather is known to occur sometime between two consecutive clinical examinations. The two examina-
tions bookend a time interval, such that the event time is “interval-censored”. It is highly challenging to analyze
interval-censored data because none of the event times is exactly known; therefore, investigators have resorted
to statistical methods that are unreliable or even invalid. The broad, long-term objectives of this research project
are to develop semiparametric regression models, with associated inference procedures and numerical algo-
rithms, for analyzing interval-censored data from current epidemiological investigations. The specific aims of the
project are: (1) to explore semiparametric regression models for assessing the impact of an interval-censored
event (e.g., onset of diabetes) on future outcomes (e.g., stroke, heart attack, methylation level); (2) to build a
system of proportional intensity models with random effects for analyzing interval-censored multi-state processes
that characterize disease progression over time; (3) to provide graphical and numerical techniques for checking
the adequacy of semiparametric regression models with interval-censored data; and (4) to relax the proportional
hazards assumption by allowing time-varying regression coefficients. All of these aims are motivated by the
unmet methodological needs in the cohort studies that the investigators are currently conducting and address
the most timely and important issues in human population health research. The estimation of model parame-
ters is based on nonparametric likelihood (with an arbitrary event-time distribution) and other sound statistical
principles. The large-sample properties of the estimators will be established rigorously through innovative use
of modern empirical process theory, semiparametric efficiency theory, and other advanced mathematical argu-
ments. Computationally efficient and stable algorithms will be created to implement the inference procedures.
The operating characteristics of the numerical algorithms and inference procedures will be evaluated extensively
through simulation studies that mimic real data. The proposed methods will be applied to the Atherosclerosis Risk
in Communities Study and the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study, both of
which are being carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These studies exemplify the broad
challenges and opportunities arising from modern epidemiological research. The results will be published in both
statistical and medical journals. Efficient, reliable, user-friendly, open-access, and well-documented R packages
will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientific community. This research will create new paradigms
in survival analysis, advance population health research in the United States and elsewhere, and accelerate the
search for effective strategies to prevent and treat many diseases of critical importance to public health, including
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and dementia."

In this proposal, we will develop, manufacture, and perform a multi-site sub-Saharan African clinical
validation of KS-COMPLETE — the first true point-of-care sample-to-answer diagnostic system for
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Our recent large-scale studies in Africa have shown that KS can be diagnosed through
quantification of Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) DNA in a skin biopsy with high sensitivity and specificity.
These efforts have also resulted in the development of TINY — a robust, easy-to-use, infrastructure-free, point-
of-care (PoC) technology for KSHV DNA quantification — which is being currently deployed in a multi-site
evaluation. The work has also revealed that the key challenge to widespread adoption of skin biopsy-based PoC
systems is the time and manual steps required to extract DNA from a skin biopsy — which can be up to 4 hours.
KS-COMPLETE will be the first “direct-to-LAMP” diagnostic system for skin punch biopsies. Similar
direct-to-LAMP methods have greatly simplified PoC diagnostics for other sample matrices but the solid-phase,
collagenous nature of skin has made this a challenge for biopsies. KS-COMPLETE will address this issue with
our “SLICER” technology that will automatically process a punch biopsy into smaller “micro-cores” on which we
can directly perform DNA quantification in TINY through our “direct-to-LAMP” approach. This approach will
reduce the time to result to around 60 minutes, eliminate all the current manual and intensive sample processing
steps, and is compatible with cost, robustness, infrastructure, and simplicity requirements for operation in LMICs.
Clinical validation of the system will be done through our established network of KS clinical sites in Africa. By
the end of the project, we will deliver 12 KS-Complete systems and conduct a multi-site clinical validation.
KS is one of the most common cancers in men and women in sub-Saharan Africa. KS is difficult to distinguish
from other skin conditions, particularly in Africa where access to trained pathologists is limited and
immunohistochemistry is practically non-existent. Early-stage and more accurate diagnosis would confer many
clinical benefits. For patients who have KS, it obviates the need for the difficult to obtain, slow, and unreliable
histopathology and allows for detection at earlier clinical stages resulting in better clinical outcomes. For patients
with mimickers, rapid exclusion of KS allows for timely re-orienting of the diagnostic process and prevents use
of potentially toxic chemotherapy. Our direct-to-LAMP diagnostic test could have significant impact beyond the
diagnosis of KS as multiple other viral, mycobacterial and fungal-related skin diseases currently diagnosed
through traditional pathology could be transitioned to this method and ultimately the point of care."
10860973,"ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be effectively treated if detected early. However, most tumors are detected at
an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. There has been a resurgence in assessing altered
cell metabolism in cancer growth. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells rely mainly on aerobic glycolysis for ATP
production. Aerobic glycolysis is inefficient in ATP generation, but the glycolytic and TCA cycle
intermediates are rerouted for the production of biomass. These studies have led to identification of several
critical pathways that have the potential to be therapeutic targets. Currently, much less is known about the
contribution of micronutrient metabolism in cancer. Our recent work has established that iron accumulation
is critical step in the growth and progression of colon cancer. Colon cancer cells are addicted to high iron
levels for cell proliferation. We have clearly shown that there is an accumulation of intra-tumoral iron
compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Genetic or dietary restriction of iron leads to a robust decrease in
tumor proliferation and progression. However, it is unclear how cancer cells maintain high iron levels,
resistant to iron-mediated oxidative toxicity and utilize iron for signaling, survival, and growth. Our goals are
to identify mechanism underlying these major gaps to lay the foundation for iron-based therapies in colon
cancer. We hypothesize that CRCs bypass the toxicities of high iron accumulation to fuel oncogenic
signaling. Cellular iron levels are regulated via a hepatic hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin binds to an iron
exporter ferroportin leading to degradation and inhibition of iron export. We show that colon tumor

axis is the major mechanism leading to iron accumulation and if it can be targeted for therapy. Iron is
essential for growth but can be highly toxic to a cell. Iron levels need to be tightly controlled. Iron via the
Fenton reaction leads to high superoxide formation and initiates a form of non-apoptotic cell death called
ferroptosis. Our recent data suggest that CRCs actively suppress ferroptosis. Aim 2 will understand
mechanisms leading to resistance of iron induced damage. In Aim 3 we will address why CRCs need high
levels of iron to maintain growth. Our previous work showed that iron can directly activate oncogenic
kinases through a putative posttranslational modification we termed ferritinylation. In this Aim we plan to
explore the importance of ferritinylation using cell models and patient-derived organoid models.
Accomplishing these Aims will (i) uncover mechanisms of iron accumulation (ii) define novel iron
related vulnerabilities, and (iii) characterize how iron drives oncogenic signaling in CRC. These studies

Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be effectively treated if detected early. However, most tumors are detected at
an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. There has been a resurgence in assessing altered
cell metabolism in cancer growth. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells rely mainly on aerobic glycolysis for ATP
production. Aerobic glycolysis is inefficient in ATP generation, but the glycolytic and TCA cycle
intermediates are rerouted for the production of biomass. These studies have led to identification of several
critical pathways that have the potential to be therapeutic targets. Currently, much less is known about the
contribution of micronutrient metabolism in cancer. Our recent work has established that iron accumulation
is critical step in the growth and progression of colon cancer. Colon cancer cells are addicted to high iron
levels for cell proliferation. We have clearly shown that there is an accumulation of intra-tumoral iron
compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Genetic or dietary restriction of iron leads to a robust decrease in
tumor proliferation and progression. However, it is unclear how cancer cells maintain high iron levels,
resistant to iron-mediated oxidative toxicity and utilize iron for signaling, survival, and growth. Our goals are
to identify mechanism underlying these major gaps to lay the foundation for iron-based therapies in colon
cancer. We hypothesize that CRCs bypass the toxicities of high iron accumulation to fuel oncogenic
signaling. Cellular iron levels are regulated via a hepatic hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin binds to an iron
exporter ferroportin leading to degradation and inhibition of iron export. We show that colon tumor
epithelium express high levels of hepcidin and low ferroportin. Aim 1 will delineate if hepcidin/ferroportin
axis is the major mechanism leading to iron accumulation and if it can be targeted for therapy. Iron is
essential for growth but can be highly toxic to a cell. Iron levels need to be tightly controlled. Iron via the
Fenton reaction leads to high superoxide formation and initiates a form of non-apoptotic cell death called

10860975,"We propose to study the relation between prenatal, early postnatal, and adult exposure to metals and
cognitive function in older age, and whether early life exposures modify effects of adult exposures. We will also
explore whether those exposures and cognitive outcomes are associated with changes in blood-derived
extracellular vesicle (EV) micro RNA expression (miRNA), which could represent epigenetic mechanisms
underlying associations. We will conduct a cohort study among a subset of participants in the original St. Louis
Baby Tooth (SLBT) study who donated their baby teeth in the 1950s and 1960s. Based on our pilot work, we
anticipate easily being able to enroll 1,000 former SLBT participants (500 men and 500 women) who will have
completed questionnaires and cognitive function testing, and from whom we will collect blood for miRNA
analyses and repeated toenail samples for adult metal analyses. Prenatal and early postnatal exposure to
several metals will be assessed by measuring metals in baby tooth enamel (using laser-ablation inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry). Adult metal exposures will be assessed using X-Ray Fluorescence to
measure metals in the toenail samples. EVs will be isolated from the blood samples and analyzed for EV
miRNA expression levels. The SLBT provides a unique setting that will allow us to have individual-level
biomarkers of early life and adult metal exposures in older adults on whom we can conduct cognitive function
testing. This study setting allows us to have an unprecedented ability to examine whether early life exposures
are related to late life cognitive health—a hypothesis suggested for metals exposure from animal research, but
extremely hard to test in humans without the biomarker of such early exposure that the already collected baby
teeth in the SLBT can provide."

10846673,"Project Summary
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of genetic loci associated with a variety of
complex traits and diseases. Nonetheless, deciphering how most GWAS variants are linked to diseases
remains exceptionally challenging, as the majority of these variants are noncoding. Noncoding variation can
affect the regulation of genes that are either physically nearby (in cis), or physically distant (in trans). Mounting
evidence suggest that genetic regulation in trans plays a dominant role in the control of gene expression and
disease risk. Thus, high-quality trans-eQTL and trans regulatory networks are critically needed to fully
understand how disease-associated variants flow through gene networks to affect causal genes and pathways.
However, most studies to date have solely focused on studying genetic regulation in cis owing to the extreme
difficulty in detecting trans-QTLs. Therefore, the lack of high-quality trans-eQTL maps represents a significant
gap in our understanding of disease mechanisms. In this grant, I propose to address this gap by developing
powerful statistical methods to produce high-quality, comprehensive maps of trans-QTLs in multiple human
tissues and cell types. We will use these maps to uncover major mechanisms that underlie trans genetic
regulation. Finally, we will develop novel methods to identify disease genes using our high-quality maps of
trans-eQTLs."

The UAB Nathan Shock Center (NSC) has as its research focus the comprehensive assessment of energy
intake and use from the level of organelles, cells, and tissues (Comparative Mitochondrial Health Assessment
Core) to whole organisms (Comparative Organismal Energetics Core) as it relates to aging and later-life health
in a diversity of species. Findings at these various levels are analyzed and integrated by our Comparative Data
Analytics Core. Comparative energetics is a cornerstone of what has come to be called “geroscience,” the
study of interactions between fundamental aging processes and maladies of later life. The Administrative
Program Enrichment Core (Admin Core) is the oversight, administrative, and outreach arm of the UAB NSC as
a whole. Under the leadership of Drs. Steven Austad and Thomas Buford, the Admin Core will continue to
manage, coordinate, publicize, and integrate the diverse activities of the Center. It also will be responsible for
facilitating interactions with the other Shock Centers, the Nathan Shock Centers Coordinating Center, and
relevant National Institute on Aging (NIA) staff. In consultation with the Internal and External Advisory
Committees, the Admin Core will issue annual evaluations and reports on each Core's performance and on the
performance of the NSC overall and will make programmatic changes as warranted. This Core also will be the
organizational unit responsible for promoting basic aging research at UAB, regionally, and nationally, seeking
particularly to attract trainees and early career researchers from allied disciplines into geroscience research."
10842083,"Project Summary
A major thrust of the proposed studies is founded on the principle that a molecule's contour is key
to its ability to elicit biological response, making it crucial that methods for precise alteration of its
three-dimensional shape are available. The PI's long-standing experience in the design and
development of olefin metathesis strategies, catalysts and methods will serve toward establishing
innovative ways of transforming highly complex but readily available (i.e., purchasable and
inexpensive) bioactive natural products to their corresponding skeletally altered analogs. The
resulting entities, as shown recently in the PI's NIH-funded program, will represent new drug leads
for the same or a different disease area. Molecules containing a medium or large ring and at least
one olefin will be at the center of the proposed investigations. A new class of catalysts will be
designed to promote efficient ring-opening metathesis of otherwise unreactive rings; after chain
extension by cross-metathesis or olefin isomerization, ring-closing metathesis will be used to
access expanded or contracted cyclic structures, respectively. Another aspect of the proposed
studies will entail developing ways of precisely altering the shape of complex and easily
accessible cyclic or polycyclic compounds that do not contain a readily modifiable functional
group. New strategies will thus be developed for introducing unsaturation and then using olefin
metathesis-based processes to expand or contract their ring(s), resulting in precise alteration of
the molecule's overall shape. Another key aim will be the development of catalytic
multicomponent diastereo-, and enantioselective transformations that will transform readily
accessible molecules to highly complex and readily modifiable products, which can be used as
platforms for the generation of a variety of bioactive compounds and potential drug leads."
10843769,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging-associated brain disorders, including cognitive decline, are among the greatest public health challenges.
DNA repair is emerging as a potential regulator of age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, and
may be a powerful potential target for effective therapeutic strategies in the future. The brain may be vulnerable
to genomic alterations due to its network structure, the complexity of its transcriptome, and the low or absent
turnover and long lifespan of neural cell types. This suggests genome maintenance pathways are crucial for
brain health: persistent or incorrectly repaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) could contribute to genomic
alterations, thus promoting age-related cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the
role of post-developmental, neuronal DSB repair in brain physiology with age has not been addressed. The
broad implication for this fundamental gap in knowledge is that crucial opportunities for development of
therapeutics for treatment and prevention of brain disorders may be missed. This provides a strong rationale for
elucidating the biology of neuronal DSB repair at multiple levels. Thus, our long-term goal is to determine the
extent to which neuronal DNA double-strand break formation and repair impact brain function and brain
disorders. We will elucidate the relationship between neural circuit function and the classical non-homologous
end-joining (C-NHEJ) DNA repair machinery in neurons with age. Moreover, we will elucidate the extent to which
post-developmental, neuronal DSB repair suppresses brain aging phenotypes related to chromatin structure,
genome organization, and gene expression.
The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that DNA double-strand break formation and repair in mature
neurons impacts neural physiology. To test this hypothesis and to advance toward our long-term goal, we
propose the following specific aims: (1) Define consequences of aging and C-NHEJ inactivation in neurons at
the cellular and genomic level; (2) Elucidate impact of aging and C-NHEJ inactivation on the neuronal epigenomic
landscape; and, (3) Determine impact of aging and C-NHEJ repair on circuit-level neuronal physiology. The
proposed approach involves a comprehensive, multidisciplinary analysis of neuronal function at the genomic,
epigenomic, organismal, and neural circuit level. The proposed project is significant because it uses innovative
approaches to investigate emerging concepts with major implications for human brain health, age-related
cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, the project will lead to the development of new
research tools and models. Insights gained from the proposed studies are also expected to inform research and
knowledge in other fields related to genomic stability and aging."
10843771,"ABSTRACT
 Losses in limb muscle mass and increased fatigability compromise the ability of older adults (≥65 yrs) to
generate the power necessary to maintain mobility and perform daily activities. Recently, we showed that the
age-related increase in fatigability during dynamic contractions is due to a greater accumulation of metabolites,
hydrogen (H+), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and diprotonated phosphate (H2PO4-), eliciting greater disruptions in
contractile function within the muscle. However, the mechanisms for the greater metabolite accumulation are
unknown. Our central hypothesis is that the greater accumulation of metabolites and increased fatigability are
due to age-related impairments in skeletal muscle bioenergetics and/or vascular function. To test this hypothesis,
we will use cutting-edge techniques to assess whole-muscle and single fiber bioenergetics and macro- and
micro-vascular function. Additionally, we will study the effectiveness of a novel exercise-training intervention in
older men and women aimed at improving contractile economy, vascular function, muscle power and fatigability.
Aim 1 will determine the bioenergetic basis for the age-related increase in fatigability in the whole quadriceps
muscle and in single fibers isolated from muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis. Quadriceps muscle contractile
economy and the accumulation of intracellular metabolites (H+, Pi, H2PO4-) will be assessed with 31phosphorus
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) during dynamic knee extension exercise. Myofibrillar and
sarcoplasmic reticulum-Ca2+ ATPase activity and fiber efficiency will also be measured during shortening
contractions of single fibers using epifluorescence microscopy. We hypothesize that older adults will have a
lower whole muscle and single fiber contractile economy compared with young adults. Aim 2 will assess whether
dysfunction of the macro- and micro-vasculature is a mechanism for the increased fatigability with aging. During
dynamic knee extension exercise, femoral artery blood flow will be quantified via Doppler ultrasonography and
tissue oxygenation measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Microvascular function will be assessed
in arterioles isolated from vastus lateralis biopsies using video microscopy. We hypothesize that older adults will
have reduced femoral artery blood flow and greater reductions in quadriceps muscle oxygenation compared with
young adults, in part, due to a blunted vasoreactivity of arterioles. Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of a
high-velocity resistance exercise training coupled with blood flow restriction to improve fatigability in older men
and women. Older adults will perform 8 weeks of dynamic unilateral resistance exercise, where one leg is
exercised with freely perfused conditions and the other with blood flow restriction. We hypothesize that
fatigability, bioenergetics and vascular function will improve in the exercise training leg with blood flow restriction
and these improvements will be greater than exercise-training alone. This proposal will provide insight into the
mechanisms of age-related fatigability and translate into the development of clinically relevant exercise programs
that maximize the training adaptations in older men and women to improve mobility and quality of life."
10843866,"Project Summary
Implantation of biomaterials and devices often leads to the development of a foreign body response (FBR), a chronic
inflammatory condition that can ultimately lead to implant failure, which may cause harm to or death of the patient.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the FBR remain poorly understood. Improved understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the generation of FBR is the most important step for the development of novel and effective
therapeutic strategies that eliminate or reduce the FBR. Macrophages are central to development and progression of
the FBR. They participate in the expression of inflammatory proteins, formation of destructive foreign body giant
cells (FBGCs), remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and encapsulation of the implant. Emerging data support a
critical role for a mechanical signal, e.g., matrix stiffness, in macrophage activation. MicroRNAs (miRs) are
endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs that have emerged as powerful regulators of gene expression in numerous
cellular processes including macrophage activation, cell fusion, inflammation, and fibrosis. The function of specific
miRs in regulation of FBR to biomaterials is uncertain; specifically, it remains an open question whether matrix
stiffness regulates miR expression to drive FBR. These gaps pose a significant barrier to progress in the FBR field.
In recent, exciting preliminary data, we obtained evidence that miR-146a may be a negative regulator of FBR to
biomaterials. Specifically, we found that: 1) miR-146a expression levels decreased in the implant-adhered tissues in
a subcutaneous (s.c) implantation model, which correlated with increased macrophage accumulation, FBGC
formation, and collagen accumulation; 2) miR-146a deletion in mice exacerbated FBR processes in a s.c
implantation model; 3) the severity of the in vivo macrophage accumulation at the tissue-implant interface was
dependent on the stiffness of the implant; 4) genetic ablation of miR-146a augmented macrophage adhesion and
spreading on stiff matrix, FBGC formation, and inflammation in macrophages, and 5) genetic ablation of TRPV4, an
ion channel in the transient receptor potential vanilloid family, inhibited development of implant-adhered tissue
stiffness under FBR as determined by Atomic Force Microscopy. Further preliminary data suggested an association
between matrix stiffness, miR-146a activity, and TRPV4, under FBR conditions. The objective of this proposal is to
define the role of miR-146a in the FBR, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Based on our
preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that miR-146a modulates the FBR to biomaterials by regulating
macrophage activation and fibrogenesis in a manner dependent on implant-induced change in tissue stiffness. We
will test our hypothesis through molecular gain- or loss-of-function studies. We expect that the results of this study
may provide invaluable information and insight regarding the molecular mechanisms mediating the FBR to
biomaterials, which may lead to the development of a novel and effective microRNA-based therapeutic strategy for
the amelioration of the poorly understood FBR to biomaterials."

The means by which cells respond to virus infection is critical for survival. Moreover, the cellular response to
virus differs dramatically depending on its position on the tree of life. This observation suggests that there are
many successful strategies to inhibit virus infection, just as there are many viral antagonists that have evolved
to interfere with them. Interestingly, while the cellular response to virus infection in mammals is primarily
mediated by the family of Type I interferons (IFN-I), we recently characterized an IFN-I-independent defense
system that involves an evolutionary conserved RNAse III nuclease. We find that this nuclease, called Drosha,
rapidly translocates to the cytoplasm in response to virus infection and forms a high molecular weight structure
by associating with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which we have termed the ADAR-RISC Complex
or simply, ARC. Here we seek to better understand the physiological relevance of this complex."

(PI: S.D. Levene)
Project Summary/Abstract
The existence of endogenous circular DNA elements, termed extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), has
been established in a wide range of organisms from plants to humans for close to fifty years. Until recently,
little was known about the functions, biogenesis, and sequence properties of these molecules. However, a
recent “explosion” in the field has begun to amass evidence that the mechanisms producing these species play
important roles in genome dynamics. The connection between eccDNA biogenesis and variations in DNA-
locus copy number generate cellular heterogeneity, which has important implications for healthy and
dysfunctional cells and major impact on cancer progression and treatment. This application offers an
unprecedented opportunity to fuse biophysical and genomic approaches that are crucial to advance eccDNA
research and builds on the PI's nearly thirty years of experience in DNA topology and nucleic-acid physical
chemistry. We will use an innovative, multi-faceted approach that combines biophysical and DNA-topology-
based techniques for DNA/chromatin isolation and characterization with leading-edge tools for genetic
analysis. Using standard and engineered human cell lines, we will define the roles of eccDNA topology (e.g.,
supercoiling), sequence, size, and nucleosomal organization in the biological activities of endogenous circular
DNAs. A major outcome of this work will be an advanced quantitative understanding of eccDNA biogenesis,
maintenance, organization, and biological function. In addition, we will identify structural properties unique to
eccDNA elements, which can be exploited for molecular therapeutics and other applications including
diagnostics."

and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating both cancer and immune cell functions; 2) elucidate the impact
of inflammation on cancer cell biology and immune cell activity; and 3) define the mechanisms by which the
tumor microenvironment (TME) regulates cancer and immune cell communication to promote tumor
progression. CBI is co-led by Philip H. Howe, PhD, a leader in the TGF and tumor progression field, and
Sophie Paczesny, MD, PhD, an expert in basic and translational immunology. Members: CBI has 44
members from 13 departments, with 16 women and four members who identify as an underrepresented
minority (URM). The cancer-focused direct peer-reviewed funding base for CBI is $8M (excluding training
grants), an increase of 40% since the prior renewal, with 12 NCI projects ($3.1M, 35% increase), 29 cancer-
related grants from other NIH institutes ($4.2M, 68% increase), three other cancer-relevant peer-reviewed
grants, 13 training grants, and 134 students and postdocs. During the calendar years 2018-2022, CBI
members authored 392 publications: 116 (30%) were published in top-tier journals (JIF ≥ 10); [intra-(17%),
inter-(26%) programattic, and inter-institutional (70%)]. Current Scientific focus: CBI investigators have
shown that the tumor suppressor, BRCA1, inhibits transcription by blocking the recruitment of the chromatin
reader and oncogene regulator, BRD4, which led to collaborative studies that examine how the hypoxia
response and phosphorylation by the ATM kinase affect BRCA1/BRD4 function in breast cancers. CBI
members are also investigating the involvement of the macroenvironment and inflammation in pancreatic
cancer development and cachexia in a P01-funded project. Other CBI members are studying the roles of TME
alarmins and RNA binding proteins, HuR and hnRNP E1, on tumor and immune cell functions. Demonstration
that aneuploidy leads to a loss in the expression and function of genes involved in autophagic pathways led to
a phase I/II clinical trial in advanced solid tumors using a combination of autophagic drugs. Program
activities: CBI fosters intra-, inter-, and transdisciplinary research through monthly meetings, annual retreats,
and seminars. In participation with the Transdisciplinary Cancer Teams (TCTs), CBI members promote team
science with an emphasis on multi-PI R01 and P01-type awards. Members are frequent users of the Flow
Cytometry, Cell and Molecular Imaging, Biorepository, and Translational Science Lab Shared Resources. With
committed leadership, strong faculty recruitment, and promotion of transdisciplinary and team research, the

The HCC Cancer Control (CC) Program continues to foster transdisciplinary population science research to
reduce cancer morbidity and mortality and eliminate disparities in South Carolina and beyond. Program Aims
are to: (1) Investigate biological, behavioral, and health systems-related risk factors for cancer occurrence and
its consequences, (2) Develop, evaluate, and translate novel interventions that modify risk behaviors, reduce
mortality, improve quality of life, and enhance survivorship, and (3) Examine individual, community, and
system-level barriers and facilitators that influence the delivery, uptake, and adherence of cancer prevention
and control interventions. Research Highlights: The Program offers sustained thematic strength in cancer
health disparities and tobacco control and has achieved significant growth in the areas of early detection and
survivorship. Impactful research ranges from the discovery of novel biomarkers to understand cancer
disparities, to innovative tobacco cessation trials among diverse populations and settings, to survivorship trials
to advance cancer care delivery. Impact: The CC Program has achieved significant growth across all metrics,
reaching its highest levels for NCI funding ($5.2M; 475% increase), and peer-reviewed cancer-relevant funding
($6.6M; 187% increase), leading to 524 cancer-relevant publications (186% increase), of which 21% were
within high impact journals (IF>10), and 49% were published in collaboration with other HCC members. CC
members have received $670k in intramural pilot grant funding support from HCC, which resulted in $18.6M in
peer-reviewed funding, a 27.5-fold return on investment. The impact of CC research is equally impressive, with
a range of policy-shaping, practice-changing, and/or paradigm-shifting studies. Through bidirectional
engagement with Community Outreach and Engagement, CC research reaches across the catchment area.
Expansion of CC science through the newly acquired health systems within the Regional Health Network helps
to ensure relevance and responsivity to community needs. Members: CC membership increased to 38
members from 11 departments, with 17 women and six members who identify as an underrepresented minority
(URM). The program is co-led by Matthew Carpenter, PhD, and Ashish Deshmukh, PhD, national leaders in
tobacco control, cancer screening, and decision science. Program activities/initiatives: With significant HCC
support, CC has set a foundation for three new initiatives to increase program synergy and value to HCC, as
well as to extend the impact of its research across SC and beyond 1) a newly developing Social Determinants
of Health Shared Resource (SHARE), 2) a focused initiative on Survivorship and Cancer Outcomes Research
(SCOR) to guide faculty recruitment, and 3) the South Carolina Center for Health Equity (SC CHEQ) to extend
the geographic reach of CC research. These programmatic priorities closely align with the strategic priorities of
the HCC, further positioning the CC Program to conduct compelling and innovative research that aims to
prevent cancer and its consequences and to advance cancer health equity and care delivery."

interests center around three aims: 1) to identify novel biomarker and lipid-specific metabolic cancer
vulnerabilities; 2) to interrogate cancer-specific immunologic and oncogenic targets in human tumors; and 3) to
develop and test small molecules and biologics in investigator-initiated clinical trials. Research Highlights:
Intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations led to the identification of age-dependent ceramide signaling
pathways that reduce anti-tumor T cell responses; elucidation of ancestry-dependent cancer risks through the
identification of novel collagen modifications in a unique South Carolina Sea Island population in collaboration
with Community Outreach and Engagement; identification of a critical kinase signaling pathway that results in
CXCR4 dependent T-cell infiltration in T-ALL; and initiation of national trials to examine the efficacy of novel
immunotherapy combinations. New compounds and biomarkers led to statewide opportunities for therapeutic
intervention and prevention of human cancers impacting the HCC catchment area, including in the
socioeconomically and geographically underserved Black/African American communities. Membership: DCT
consists of 48 members from 12 departments, with 14 women and six members who identify as an
underrepresented minority. DCT is co-led by two exceptional scientists: John O’Bryan, PhD, a basic scientist
with expertise in therapeutic targeting of RAS, and Nancy Klauber-DeMore, MD, a physician-scientist surgical
oncologist with expertise in translating fundamental discoveries into investigator-initiated clinical trials. Direct
peer-reviewed funding is $7M, with 27 active NCI-funded projects totaling $5.1M, a 46% increase from the last
funding cycle, and a growing number of multi-institutional and programmatic awards. In collaboration with
Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination, multi-disciplinary collaborative research opportunities
in DCT have enhanced the entire education and career development continuum, from undergraduates in
minority colleges to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior clinical members leading to members
mentoring 105 students and post-docs. DCT efforts culminated in 499 publications since 2018, the majority of
which are collaborative (intra- and inter-programmatic and multi-institutional), with 103 published in top-tier
journals (IF >10). Program Activities: DCT provides a structure to foster multidisciplinary research across
programs and institutions. This process is mediated through one-on-one discussions with members, bi-weekly
program meetings, annual retreats, and seminars. With investments in cutting-edge technologies, targeted
faculty recruitment, inter-programmatic team-based funding initiatives supported by HCC leadership, and

10847770,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE): SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
Office is to lead activities to reduce the burden of cancer in South Carolina (SC). HCC has supported a
centralized COE Office since 2006. HCC is located in Charleston, SC, but HCC’s outreach efforts have
reached every county of the state. The COE Office works with community stakeholders to identify cancer-
related community needs and works with the HCC leadership and research programs to develop strategies to
address these needs. As in the rest of the United States, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer account
for most newly diagnosed cancer cases and cancer-related deaths; but there is an excess burden of these and
other cancers among Black/African American people in SC. The bidirectional communication between SC
communities and HCC, led by the COE Office, fosters the development and dissemination of evidence-based
interventions, guidelines, and community education around cancer prevention/screening, and early
detection/and treatment, leading to public health policy recommendations to improve cancer health equity.
These activities also increase access to HCC’s clinical trials while simultaneously expanding the diversity of
trial participants. The COE Office engages HCC members in all three research programs to ensure that the
catchment area cancers are reflected in, and addressed by HCC-based research. Importantly, the COE Office
facilitates community input on the spectrum of research activities. To this end, HCC has invested significantly
in establishing institutional and community-based infrastructure to facilitate community engagement. COE
efforts provide evidence-based cancer screenings via a mobile health unit to more than 25 SC counties, lay
navigation for medically underserved individuals newly diagnosed with cancer, diverse educational forums
supported by dedicated Community Health Educators, and an organizational focal point for HCC’s statewide,
cancer-focused advocacy and public policy efforts. The COE Office is supported by a Community Advisory
Committee, comprised of statewide community stakeholders. Guided by this committee’s input, the COE Office
participated in or directed more than 850 community engagements throughout the catchment area during the
past five years. The COE Office leads HCC’s Catchment Area Committee, comprised of statewide researchers
and state health department leaders, which helps to better define the catchment area needs, target the COE
Office’s interventions, and shape its future vision. During the current funding period, the COE Office has
reached more than 2 million people in SC with cancer prevention and early detection messaging, strategies,
and programs; launched a new human papillomavirus vaccination van program; supported community
engagement in five extramurally funded grants; and contributed to HCC’s overall minority trial accrual of 24%.
These strategies have impacted the downward trajectory of cancer mortality rates in SC; the remaining
inequities continue to be addressed."

some. It is unclear how the presentation of ASD changes from early childhood into adolescence or adulthood.
The causes of ASD are also unknown, though substantial evidence supports the contribution of both genes
and environmental factors. These gaps in knowledge exist because US studies to date have lacked the
sample size, depth of data collection, or appropriate life course timing to address these questions. The Study
to Explore Early Development (SEED) is now able to address these prior limitations. SEED is a large case-
control study of children ages 2-5 years and their families, implemented across eight states over three phases.
SEED collected detailed data on children's core ASD symptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-
occurring conditions in early childhood, along with extensive risk factors related to maternal health and the
perinatal environment as well as genomics. The SEED sample includes 2044 children with ASD, 1950 children
with non-ASD developmental disabilities (DD), and 2285 population control children (POP), making this the
largest etiologic study of ASD in the US. Recent ancillary studies - the SEED Teen Pilot and SEED COVID
studies -- will soon add data on adolescent health and the consequences of the pandemic, respectively, for
some SEED participants. The work proposed here, SEED Follow-up Studies (SEED FU), will maximize the
impact of extant SEED data through analyses that characterize ASD phenotypes and assess the potential
interplay between genetic and modifiable risk factors. SEED FU will also facilitate new data collection in
middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood to characterize changes in ASD phenotype across
developmental stages, and the associated health, educational, and service needs across the early life course.
These data will further enable prospective analyses of associations between early life factors and later
childhood through early adulthood outcomes. Studying risk factors in relation to life course phenotypic
subgroups may also help elucidate etiologies previously masked in ASD case-control studies. The MO SEED
Team in combination with the SEED Network's collaborative infrastructure and extensive extant data
resources, will ensure the successful implementation of the SEED FU Study in Missouri and contribute to
success across the network. SEED is well-powered for making significant contributions to our understanding
of the complex autism phenotype and identifying factors associated with ASD risk in the population. The
knowledge gained by SEED FU will greatly advance our ability prevent adverse developmental outcomes and
to support individuals with ASD and their families to ensure optimal wellbeing through early adulthood."

With an annual occurrence of over 200,000 cases per year, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a leading
debilitating disorder in the United States. The mechanisms that underlay its development are highly sought
after, because current therapeutics fail to offer relief in over half of patients. A high-fat western diet and obesity
play crucial roles in neuronal hyperexcitability that lead to painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In certain
instances, evidence dissociates diet, diabetes, and obesity, and understanding these disparate mechanisms of
action will play a divisive role in identifying therapeutic targets that can modulate neuronal activity. Peripheral
sensory neurons express toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor whose agonist are dietary free fatty acids,
dietary sugar metabolites (methylglyoxal), and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) expressed
during diabetes (HMGB1). This suggests that neurons can be directly activated by TLR4 agonists from various
sources to play a role in plasticity leading to painful states during diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Moreover,
macrophages are closely situated next to peripheral sensory neurons, express TLR4, and release additional
pro-nociceptive factors that sensitize neurons. This study will focus on the peripheral nervous system, utilizing
genetic tools to clarify the minimum circuitry necessary to mediate TLR4-dependent activation of DRG
nociceptive neurons in developing diet-induced/diabetic neuropathic pain.
 A key feature of this proposal is that we will study the physiological relevance of TLR4 in specific cell
populations in vivo to determine whether nociceptor or macrophage TLR4 is sufficient for the development of
diabetic neuropathic pain. We will take advantage of the cre-lox transgenic system offering cell-specific
reactivation of TLR4 using newly developed null-reactivatable mice. We have crossed these animals with
Nav1.8-cre (sensory neuron) and LysM-cre (macrophage) animals to assess these particular populations in
developing neuropathic pain in response to diabetes, diet, or obesity. Our research is aimed at understanding
mechanisms driving chronic pain and moving these molecular insights toward new therapeutic strategies for
pain alleviation. To accomplish these goals we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of
neuron-specific vs. macrophage-specific TLR4 to develop neuropathic pain and 2) Determine the contribution
of dietary components as cell-specific TLR4 agonists to induce sensitization and pain states.
These studies will hopefully point to novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment and prevention of diabetic
pain by targeting nociceptor and macrophage TLR4 signaling and identify elusive mechanisms through, diet,
obesity or diabetes."
10847565,"SUMMARY: OVERALL
The overarching goal of this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application is to reverse the notoriously poor outcome
of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and medulloblastoma (MB), the most common primary tumors in adults and
children, respectively. This goal is achieved through a focused pursuit of our central hypothesis that an
organized, multidisciplinary, integrated, flexible, and highly translational (“bench-to-bedside-and-back”) research
program will lead to advances in the treatment of brain cancers. We seek to discover mechanistically diverse
therapeutic strategies (including bio-therapies, targeted therapies, cellular therapies and immunotherapies) that
attack intrinsic vulnerabilities of brain cancers, develop these strategies through rigorous preclinical testing, and
deploy them in novel window-of-opportunity clinical trials. By pursuing this hypothesis over the past three funding
cycles, we have successfully transitioned multiple agents from the bench to bedside by successfully undertaking
a remarkable twelve clinical trials, including trials of Delta-24-RGD, an oncolytic virus , which we tested alone
or in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab; Delta-24-RGDOX, an immune activating
oncolytic viruses; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells loaded with Delta-24; targeted therapies including
BKM120, a PI3Kinase inhibitor; WP1066, a pSTAT3 inhibitor; IACS-010759, an OxPhos inhibitor; and
engineered cord blood-derived Natural Killer (NK) cells. Also, in our current funding cycle we deciphered the
genomic landscape of gliomas in underrepresented minority Black and Hispanic populations. Building on this
exceptional track record, in this renewal we propose three fully translational projects that are specifically focused
on overcoming the notoriously immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBMs and MBs, and
which are supported by four mission-critical Cores (Administrative, Pathology/Biorepository, Biostatistics/
Bioinformatics, Animal). Our Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs continue as
incubators of new projects and portals for new investigators, with two of our proposed projects coming directly
from these programs. The aims of our projects are: Combine Delta-24-RGD with genetically engineered NK cells,
testing the hypothesis that oncolytic viruses and NK cells can shape the GBM immune TME to synergistic
therapeutic effect (Aim 1): Restore phagocytosis in GBM-associated myeloid (GAMs) cells by targeting the
QKI/PPARβ/RXRα (QPR) complex, testing the hypothesize that QPR agonists (bexarotene/ KD3010) can drive
GAMs from an immunosuppressive to an anti-glioma state through QPR’s role in phagocytosis and antigen
presentation (Aim 2); And exploit the immune consequences of U1 mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) MB,
testing the hypothesis that the post transcriptional hyper-mutated state caused by a point mutation (r.3A>G) in
the non-coding small nuclear RNA U1 of Shh MBs will exquisitely sensitize Shh MBs to ICIs and will provide
novel antigens for the development of CAR T-cell strategies (Aim 3). Through these projects we will reverse the
poor outcomes of GBM and MB and give new hope to patients with these devastating cancers."
10849814,"Program Summary/Abstract
 The International Union, UAW and its partners propose to address three problems. The first
is the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material
exposure. The second is occupational and environmental health disparities, particularly as they
affect the Hispanic/Latino population of Southeast Michigan. The third problem is the opioid
epidemic, an emerging environmental health issue.
 To address the first problem, we will continue development of an ongoing program whose
paramount goal is to prevent illnesses and injuries by providing training on health and safety
topics that are directly or indirectly related to elimination and/or reduction of potential
exposure to hazardous materials. UAW members throughout the United States are exposed to a
wide variety of hazards. Manufacturing workers can face exposure to carcinogens, such as
welding fume and hexavalent chromium and emerging hazards, such as engineered
nanomaterials (ENM). Members employed in casinos are often heavily exposed to carcinogenic
tobacco smoke. In healthcare and academic labs, union members can be exposed to bloodborne
pathogens, sterilants, radioactive isotopes and/or emerging hazards, such as ENM. The UAW
has established a partnership with the University of Puerto Rico to provide training to the
union’s six thousand active members on the island who are still dealing with the aftermath of
Hurricane Maria.
 The second problem is occupational and environmental health disparities in Southeast
Michigan, where the Hispanic/Latino population includes many who are disadvantaged by
environmental injustice, less formal education, limited English proficiency, and/or limited
access to training. The UAW is working with two partners who serve the Hispanic/Latino
communities in Southeast Michigan, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan – Hispanic
Outreach Services (CCSEM/HOS) and La Casa Guadalupana. Many in these populations are
exposed to pesticides when doing landscaping or agricultural work, silica and other dust when
working in construction and/or toxic cleaning solvents when working in housekeeping or
childcare. Some work outdoors, where they are exposed to temperature extremes, UV radiation
and/or air pollutants. They may work 6-7 days per week in jobs characterized by seasonal
instability, shifting hours, low pay and physically harmful or dangerous work conditions.
 The third problem is the opioid crisis, which has affected many UAW members, especially in
manufacturing.
 In the first year of the grant, the UAW and its partners together propose to train 2,661
participants in 163 programs for a total of 20,442 contact hours. The five-year totals would be
13,305 participants in 815 programs for a total of 102,210 contact hours. The consortium
proposes to address the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous
material exposure by conducting training in health and safety. We will address occupational
and environmental health disparities by continuing and expanding collaborative partnerships
with community groups and other NIEHS-WTP grantees for the purpose of delivering health
and safety training to underserved populations. The opioid crisis will be addressed by
developing and delivering population-specific curricula that address treatment and prevention
of opioid addiction, including alternatives for pain management. In addition, we propose to
develop, pilot, evaluate, and scale a peer recovery support program that will help workers seek
services to address opioid addiction.
 All of the above programs will be evaluated to provide feedback for continual improvement of
curricula and delivery methods. This will include monitoring trainee perceptions of quality,
appropriateness, and usefulness as well as assessing new curricula and training delivery
methods; evaluating the long-term impact of training on worker and organizational outcomes
using innovative and conventional quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Worker-
evaluators will be incorporated into evaluation when possible."
10849852,"HWWT Project Summary The ICWUC seeks to continue its national multi union training program to
protect a range of collateral duty emergency responders and develop a cadre of worker trainers (total of 496
classes; 7,258 trainees; 80,852 contact hours). Our goal is to have active, informed workers and trainers on
the front lines of handling toxic substances to recognize the danger of spills, leaks and catastrophic releases,
protect themselves and strive to improve their workplaces. To accomplish this, we use a range of adult
education principles and techniques that rely on the knowledge and experiences of the participants to teach
key principles in a non-threatening and engaging method that motivates trainees to improve their worksites.
We will include two new partners, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) and the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics (AOEC) to form a 12-member
Consortium. Both AFSCME and AOEC fully participated in our NIEHS Infectious Disease grant (IDR).
AFSCME, represents workers in a wide range of public sector jobs with a diversity of hazards and is the
nation's largest public services employee’s union with more than 1.4 million members including police,
corrections, fire, social workers, ancillary healthcare providers engineers and environmental services. AOEC
has physicians who reviewed and improved our infectious disease modules and attended the IDR Train the
Trainer class to answer technical questions.
We will conduct expand our Spanish classes including a Spanish Trainer development class (trainers who
have been through or taught a Spanish Train the Trainer class), hold a three day Spanish Hazmat awareness
class and have bilingual staff and trainers teach these classes. We will continue to develop worker trainers,
offer hazmat classes to industrial, health care, government and school workers and continue to work with a
number of other NIEHS Grantees.
The ICWUC Center will continue to collect pre and post-training survey data of participants' attempts to
change their workplaces (which has resulting in two published papers). By comparing this paired data from
the same individuals, this has indicated that the intervention of the ICWUC Center's program motivates,
educates and arms these workers with skills to return to their worksite and make improvements in site safety
plans and procedures. Two other articles documented the specific improvement after training all hourly and
salaried employees at two facilities."
10849853,"HDPT Project Summary The ICWUC seeks to continue its range of disaster response programs to
prepare workers and communities to protect themselves (246 disaster response programs to 3,657
workers and volunteers for 24,142 contact hours, many being short awareness classes).
We will launch a major trainer initiative to conduct disaster training and Train the Trainer (TtT) classes in
Spanish or bilingually. This builds off the Spanish Disaster TtT classes we held in Houston after Hurricane
Harvey and then four in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. We will train new bilingual trainers and further
the skills of the 28 trainers and partner staff who delivered these programs using participatory adult
education techniques. The new worker trainers will conduct Disaster awareness training either as
preparedness or post disaster to remediation workers. The ICWUC Center, AFSCME, LCLAA and NCOSH
will each conduct at least one Spanish Disaster TtT class with language determined in each location.
We will include two new partners, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME), the largest public sector union with members who perform a wide range of jobs after a disaster
and the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics (AOEC), a national network of experienced
occupational health professional with a range of expertise in chemical and biological exposures and their
health effects in the context of a disaster.
We will continue our Plume Software and infectious disease pandemic classes, authorize trainers in the
OSHA 5600 Disaster Site Worker and continue our work with a number of other NIEHS Grantees. Field
programs will include Disaster and Trauma awareness through our partners, disaster First Aid/CPR/AED
(using ASHI curriculum and NIEHS Protect Yourself booklets) and Mold, Muck and Gut.
We will continue to collect pre/post training data of participants in our Plume class to evaluate workplace
changes by participants and to evaluate how worker trainers who assist this class utilize this knowledge
and skills in the workplaces and communities. We will evaluate participant views on the benefits of disaster
awareness training."
10856946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose MomGenes Fight PPD: Expanding to Increase Participation from Diverse Ancestries to
systematically investigate the genomic risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) and their interplay with
major environmental contributors. PPD affects ~500,000 women annually in the US, with an increased
prevalence among black, indigenous, people of color (BIPOC) mothers. The effects of PPD are not only
present in the mothers, but also can be seen in offspring at a critical developmental period. Despite the public
health issues PPD poses, it is under-studied and its precise etiology is unknown. There is pressing need to
develop methods for early detection of PPD for all women to mitigate severe outcomes and identify features of
the disorder which can lead to personalized therapies.
The need for diversity is evident across biomedical research and healthcare. Within genomics, increasing
representation of BIPOC individuals results in improved locus discovery, fine-mapping, and genetic score
accuracy. However, as we diversify research participants, we must also capture environmental contributors to
PPD that disproportionately affect BIPOC women: adverse life events (ALE), which increase risk for PPD, and
discrimination. Combined with our proposed increase in phenotyping and genetic analyses, we can have a
more complete understanding of risk factors contributing to PPD.
In 2016, we began the MomGenes Fight PPD study (formerly called PPD ACT) to power genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) for PPD. Using our existing ascertainment platform, MomGenes will: Aim 1)
expand the study to recruit 8,000 new samples (4,000 PPD cases and 4,000 ancestry-matched controls) from
across the United States, focusing on BIPOC women and recontact ~12k existing MomGenes participants to
collect deeper phenotypes; Aim 2) conduct trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses for PPD and a pre-planned
set of secondary analyses using newly ascertained samples and existing PPD samples (~51,000 cases,
~141,000 controls from first GWAS and eight new cohorts); Aim 3) examine the impact of ALE (natural
disaster, sexual abuse, physical abuse) and discrimination (racial, gender, religion, sexual orientation, weight)
on PPD risk.
This proposal expands on our team’s success in PPD genomics research. Samples collected in our initial
MomGenes study contributed to the first PPD GWAS meta-analyses. With the proposed work, we will continue
to build on this success, identifying genetic and environmental factors that increase risk for PPD. Ultimately,
this can lead to actionable findings that aid all women suffering from PPD."
10855504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, impact over
554 million people worldwide and are major contributors to the non-communicable disease burden in the
United States. Individuals with CRD show pronounced disparities in disease risk by factors such as age, sex,
community type, and environment. Air pollution is one environmental risk factor of concern with nearly 135
million people in the U.S. residing in counties experiencing poor air quality. Evidence suggests that air pollution
regulatory standards, despite their design to protect public health, may be inadequate for CRD populations
who exhibit elevated sensitivity to even low levels of air pollution exposure. It is critical to estimate air pollution
health effects, specifically for vulnerable populations, and identify the underlying and unexplored factors that
elevate risk, including the intersection between personal and community-level disadvantage. Minimizing
vulnerabilities across groups and by environment is a core principle of environmental justice. Our central
hypothesis is that individuals with diagnosed CRD represent a high vulnerability population who display
increased mortality risk from acute exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone air pollution. An
additional emphasis is to identify which individual and neighborhood characteristics increase air pollution
inequities among CRD patients and unpack their joint contribution to poor health outcomes. To test our
hypothesis, we will utilize 20 years of records from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and
spatiotemporally align individual patient data with state-of-the-art high-resolution air pollution models,
environmental metrics, and community sociodemographic and social vulnerability characteristics. Detailed VHA
records provides data innovations absent from many large cohorts, including diagnosis of comorbidities,
geocoded home addresses to reduce exposure misclassification, and individual characteristics and behavior,
such as smoking status and body mass index. In Aim 1, we will estimate the mortality risk in CRD populations
attributed to daily PM2.5 and ozone exposure and identify individual characteristics that exacerbate
susceptibility. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the intersection between individual vulnerabilities and neighborhood
inequities for air pollution associated mortality risk in CRD populations and estimate the differential risk of
these contributing causes. In Aim 3, we will estimate the association between air pollution exposure and
underlying mortality cause, and quantify non-linear exposure-response relationships, including low-dose
exposures. Our research will have a meaningful public health impact by informing air quality regulations as
they pertain to individuals with CRD and provide evidence for behavioral interventions and treatment of CRD
populations to reduce mortality risk. As a modifiable risk factor, reductions in air pollution will disproportionately
benefit CRD individuals and reduce potential health disparities in this high vulnerability group."

The goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel dual-layer flat-panel detector (DLFPD)
based on mature energy-integrating detector technology and translate it clinically for dual-
energy spectral digital breast tomosynthesis (DE-DBT). This will improve the outcome of breast
cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Our objectives are two folds: 1. Develop
a DLFPD to allow rapid clinical translation of spectral breast imaging without patient motion
artifact. 2. Develop spectral imaging techniques based on DLFPD and establish its clinical
feasibility using patient studies. Our objectives will be accomplished through the following three
specific aims: (1) Design, optimize and fabricate a prototype DLFPD for spectral breast imaging.
Aim 1 will lead to the development and clinical translation of DLFPD that acquires two
mammograms at different energies using a single exposure, allowing perfectly registered
spectral images without artifacts due to patient motion. (2) Develop DLFPD based DE-DBT
techniques using simulation methods. Aim 2 will lead to the development of spectral image
processing techniques for DLFPD based systems with and without iodinated contrast agent. (3)
Integrate the prototype DLFPD with a clinical DBT system and investigate DE-DBT performance
through phantom and patient imaging studies. Aim 3 will translate the DLFPD and DE-DBT
techniques developed in Aims 1 and 2 into clinical reality. The outcomes of the proposed work
are: 1. Advancement in DLFPD hardware that permit rapid clinical translation; 2. Development
of a variety of DLFPD based DE-DBT techniques, with and without iodinated contrast agent; 3.
Clinical evaluation of the feasibility of DE-DBT for breast cancer detection."
10835278,"SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) contributes to disability, loss of work, and over 100,000 overdose deaths per year
in the U.S., emphasizing the critical need for novel medications for OUD treatment. Ibogaine, a
psychoactive alkaloid from the Tabernanthe iboga shrub, has shown promise in interrupting opioid
dependence, reducing withdrawal symptoms, and increasing abstinence rates, even after a single
treatment. However, ibogaine's cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity pose significant barriers to its development
as a drug. To leverage ibogaine’s potential as an OUD therapeutic and address the risks to patient safety,
we have developed a new class of synthetic iboga alkaloids, named “oxa-iboga”. These compounds show no
pro-arrhythmic potential, no neurotoxic effects, and enhanced efficacy in OUD-relevant preclinical behavioral
assays compared to ibogaine. We propose to advance one of these compounds, GM-3009, into clinical
studies by advancing GMP-manufacturing and formulation of GM-3009, completing IND-enabling toxicity
studies, and determining the expected therapeutic exposures of GM-3009 and target engagement via
translational biomarkers. These studies will complete the UG3 portion of this grant. If successful, the
proposal will advance to the UH3 portion, which will conduct first-in-human trials, including safety and
tolerability studies in healthy volunteers (a single ascending dose study, SAD) and a safety study with
exploratory measures of efficacy in OUD patients undergoing opioid withdrawal. The endpoint of the entire
project is generation of clinical safety and preliminary efficacy data to support subsequent Phase 2 efficacy
studies in OUD. The development of GM-3009 builds on decades of research on ibogaine and has the potential
to deliver an innovative OUD therapy with rapid and long-term mitigation of acute and protracted withdrawal
symptoms and cravings, which lead to non-medical opioid use."

This renewal application requests the continued funding of our Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (GCID)
in the Texas Medical Center (TMC) which comprises a multidisciplinary, integrated team of basic and physician
scientists at Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health, MD Anderson
Cancer Center, and Rice University. The TMC-GCID: i) leverages our decades of experience in genomic
sequencing technology with our renowned clinical expertise, and the use of novel ex vivo organotypic
models of human intestinal and pulmonary function, to create a platform for large scale genomics-based
interrogation of host-mucosal pathogen interactions in the context of human tissues, and ii) utilizes this
platform for the discovery of novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets based on host and microbial
genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Project 1 (PL: A. Maresso, PhD) will build on discoveries made from
dissecting genomic elements of pathogenic members of the Enterobacteriaceae that associate with human
intestinal mucosa colonization and translocation. Project 2 (PL: R. Atmar, MD, S. Ramani, PhD and T. Piedra,
MD, PhD) will continue integrated analyses of human norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus full-length genomic
sequences and characterization of the ecological niche of samples from clinically relevant patient sub-groups for
new understanding of viral replication, recombination and evolution, induction of disease and host factors
required for susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis. Project 3 (PL: M. Lorenz, PhD) will examine the impact
of commensal Candida albicans on gut health and susceptibility to disease. Surprisingly little is known about the
genetic diversity of C. albicans isolated from the gut (as compared to those isolated from the skin, for example).
Mapping the fungal-host-microbiome interplay in relevant gut niches using the latest genomic, metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic technologies will greatly improve the understanding of how commensal fungi can influence
gut homeostasis. Project 4 (PL: P. Okhuysen, MD) will build on a novel Cryptosporidium discovery made by the
project leaders and test the hypothesis that one or more indole-producing commensal microbes in the gut can
prevent or eliminate Cryptosporidium infection. All four research projects will continue to utilize human intestinal
and lung organoid cultures along with niche-specific, defined microbial communities supplied by the Organoid
and Minibioreactor Array Cultivation Core. Meanwhile cutting edge, high-throughput sequencing strategies and
technologies and the latest analysis tools and outputs will be supplied, and disseminated, by the Sequencing
Analysis and Resource Dissemination (SARD) Core. The result will be a comprehensive genetic profiling of hosts
and microbes in human infection models that will reveal pathogen genetic variants, and individual host response
phenotypes to inform precision medicine-based therapeutics and diagnostics, both for the pathogens in this
proposal and a broad spectrum of mucosal infectious diseases that severely impact human health."
10852596,"Project Summary/Abstract
Interorgan communication between the brain and peripheral tissues maintains a range of homeostatic
responses. Efforts to identify new facets of interorgan crosstalk remain sparse. Missed opportunities exist
because of the siloed nature of physiological research, especially between the brain and body. Cracking the
molecular code in the brain-body dialog is also technically challenging and requires time-consuming,
interdisciplinary preclinical in vivo studies. We previously discovered that eliminating ERa in a subset of
hypothalamic neurons leads to a massive increase in trabecular bone mass and strength that persists with aging
in female mice. Our focus on a brain-bone interaction that influences bone mass and bone fat underscores
the potential role of select neurons to significantly alter peripheral tissues. Here, we will ask how this brain-
derived factor increases bone mass while permanently decreasing bone fat, two opposing features of skeletal
aging.
In new data, we find that the high bone mass in our mutant mouse model system results from humoral rather
than neuronal cues. An essential first step toward translating this work will be to identify this circulatory anabolic
bone factor. While this goal is simple in principle, it is extremely difficult to achieve. We were fortunate to discover
that this high bone mass phenotype reverses with a dietary challenge. High-resolution genomic approaches then
allowed us to identify and test the most promising candidates through gain-of-function and loss-of-function
approaches. Using in vitro, ex-vivo, and in vivo model systems, we provide the first molecular and cellular insights
into how the brain influences bone mass, bone fat, and skeletal stem cell function. We will elucidate how and
why this brain-derived anabolic bone factor increases bone formation.
Our team brings together expertise in neuroendocrinology, bone and skeletal stem cell biology, and the clinical
practice of treating metabolic and bone disorders. We are using state-of-the-art methods to pursue hypothesis-
driven questions aimed at decoding a powerful dialog between the brain and bone. Eventually, we wish to
translate these preclinical studies to skeletal and metabolic disorders that are associated with or accelerated in
human aging. Our research program fits squarely within this new NIA mandate to transform our understanding
of interorgan interactions and advance strategies for improving age-related decline in skeletal health, especially
in women."
10851591,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Colorado Anschutz medical campus requests funds to purchase a Zeiss LSM980 confocal/2-
photon microscope system equipped with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). This is to replace an
equivalent LSM780 confocal/2-photon FLIM system that was purchased in 2013 but is now aging and will
very soon no longer be supported by the manufacturer. The LSM780 system we seek to replace represents
the only inverted 2-photon microscope system available for use on campus. This system has received
consistently high usage since its purchase (>185h/month in 2023, close to maximum capacity) by 149
principal investigators over the past 5 years, and it is critical to support NIH funded research across a wide
range of disciplines. The proposed system consists of a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope system with
spectral detector unit that is equipped for 2-photon excitation via coupling of a Ti;sapphire fs infra-red laser,
and inclusion of non-descanned detectors. This system also includes a specialized Picoquant multiharp FLIM
module that consists of fast detectors and high-speed photon counting card. This Zeiss LSM980 confocal/2-
photon FLIM system will be housed within the institutional Advanced Light Microscopy Core (ALMC). The
ALMC is well equipped to house the instrument, which includes in depth expertise with the technologies
included via PhD-level staff. The ALMC also receives strong institutional support from the school of medicine
via the Neurotechnology center (NTC). This includes -2000sq ft of space that houses 10 instruments, as well
as salaries for 3 full-time professional staff and support to backstop any budget shortage to cover instrument
service contracts. For the proposed system, institutional support in the shape of $155,000 is provided, as well
as a recent purchase of a new Ti:saphhire laser. In choosing the proposed Zeiss LSM980 system, we tested
3 other microscope systems and quantified multiple aspects of the system performance (resolution, detection
sensitivity, live sample handling), finding the Zeiss system showed superior performance. Similarly, we
determined the proposed Picoquant FLIM module provided the most accurate lifetime measurements. Every
component of the system is required by all major users (5) and either the majority of or all minor users (8).
These users represent those performing the most cutting-edge microscopy in their NIH-funded research that
includes 2-photon microscopy and FLIM and requiring the highest level of usage. These users demonstrate
the broad range of microscopy use among the 149 principal investigators who are using the current aging
system. Thus, replacement of the current Zeiss LSM780 confocal/2-photon FLIM system with the proposed
Zeiss LSM980 confocal/2-photon FLIM system is urgently needed in order to maintain ongoing access to
required multi-spectral confocal microscopy, 2-photon microscopy and FLIM, for NIH funded research."
10857668,"Project Summary
Periodontitis is a polymicrobial-driven and prevalent inflammatory disease of the tissues supporting the teeth
in adults. Studies revealed highly active biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of the
Gram-negative bacteria, and also components of cyclic di-3', 5'-adenylic acid (c-di-AMP) second messenger
signaling in the periodontal pockets of the periodontitis subjects. Findings from our laboratory demonstrated,
for the first time, that the LPS structure and function is regulated by c-di-AMP signaling in Porphyromonas
gingivalis (Pg) strongly implicated in the onset and development of periodontitis. Our studies indicate that c-
di-AMP regulation of LPS structure and therefore, function, is an essential aspect of the pathogenesis of the
periodontal pathogens. We have identified genes encoding some of the key components constituting the c-di-
AMP signaling pathway in Pg, including the essential c-di-AMP synthase gene (dacpg; PGN_0523), the c-di-AMP
phosphodiesterase gene (pdepg; PGN_0521), and the predicted regulatory gene cdaR (PGN_1486), all of which
regulate Pg LPS structure and function. However, we do not yet know the mechanisms of the regulation of LPS
structure and function by c-di-AMP signaling and its contribution to the pathogenesis of the periodontal
pathogens and periodontitis progression. We will investigate these mechanisms in Pg in molecular detail through
these aims: Specific Aim 1: We will conduct a comprehensive analysis of structural differences in LPS
synthesized by WT (strain 381), the strain lacking the c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase gene (∆pdepg) and a regulator
of c-di-AMP levels (∆cdaR) mutants. This will involve large-scale LPS purification, followed by chromatographic
fractionation, and thorough characterization of LPS constituents using FLATn, MALDI-ToF MS, and NMR
techniques. Specific Aim 2: We will determine the protein interaction network of the c-di-AMP-regulated LPS
structure and function and identify c-di-AMP receptors and effectors through various genetic and biochemical
approaches. The significance of the interactome will be demonstrated by creating mutations in the corresponding
genes in Pg and determining their effect on LPS structure and function. Specific Aim 3: We will use highly
pure individual lipid A/LPS fractions isolated from WT, ∆pdepg and ∆cdaR mutants, purified through
chromatographic fractionation, to test their immunostimulatory activities in relation to the TLR4 signaling
pathway, the complement system, and cytokine production. These assessments will involve cell culture assays,
human whole blood studies, and an animal model of inflammation. Upon completion of the proposed
studies, we will learn how c-di-AMP signaling controls LPS structure-function, impacts immunostimulatory
potential of LPS variants, and subsequently host defense responses. Since c-di-AMP signaling does not exist in
mammals, our findings will inform about a novel druggable target."

In EBV+ lymphomas viral protein expression is the oncogenic driver and progressive force. However, the
mechanisms by which EBV infection alters B cell biology to contribute to the development of EBV+ lymphomas
are not well understood. EBV infection of primary B lymphocytes results in cell activation, proliferation, and
immortalization. These programs are induced by EBV mimicking the normal activation of B cells by antigens or
T cells. Since LMP1 is needed for EBV to transform naïve B cells into immortalized B cells, considerable work
has been attempted to pharmacologically target the LMP1-activated oncogenic pathways. However, in vivo
attempts to target these pathways have failed to abolish EBV-driven oncogenesis completely. This lack of
efficacy of the targeted approaches suggested to us that another, undiscovered or unappreciated, oncogenic
mechanism downstream of LMP1 might be at work. This proposal aims to identify the mechanism by which EBV
infection contributes to developing B cell malignancies.
Our recent, published work showed that the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 activates the chromatin-associated factor
PARP1 to epigenetically regulate genes that are important for sustaining cell proliferation. Expanding upon these
findings, our preliminary data indicate that the reorganization of the 3D structure and function of chromatin in B
cells is a novel and underappreciated mechanism targeted by EBV through LMP1 to alter gene expression and
reprogramming in EBV infected cells. We discovered that: 1) expression of LMP1 alone is sufficient to alter the
3D structure of the B cell genome; 2) the EBV/LMP1-induced changes in chromatin structure are associated with
PARP1 activity, and with occupancy by the chromatin organizers CTCF and YY1; 3) EBV activation of PARP1
requires ERK activation by LMP1; and 4) PARP inhibitors elicit cytotoxicity in EBV+ lymphomas in vivo. Based
on these preliminary data and our previous work we hypothesize that in EBV+ B cells, LMP1 expression
activates, via the ERK pathway, PARP1, promoting conformational changes in the host genome architecture that
drive oncogenesis. We will also test the hypothesis that PARP1 is an attractive therapeutic target for EBV
lymphomas."

Chromatin remodeling complexes play a critical role in regulating gene expression, differentiation, and
development. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is mutated in ~25% of all human tumors. The
12-15 positions within SWI/SNF are filled from ~30 unique subunits. The combinatorial assembly of these
genes can yield 1000-2000 biochemically distinct complexes . While often studied as a single complex, these
biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF have different functions in gene regulation.Understanding the
mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF function, and that are therefore disrupted in SWI/SNF mutant tumors, is of
critical importance for developing new therapies.
We propose that post-translational modifications of SWI/SNF and interactions between SWI/SNF and RNA
modulate function of the complex. Understanding how these mechanisms contribute to how different SWI/SNF
complexes are defined is the focus of my lab. The key questions we will address in this project are 1.) Do
variant SWI/SNF complexes have different functions? 2.) What regulates different activities of biochemically
distinct complexes? 3.) How are changes to the composition and the targeting of complexes regulated? Our lab
combines computational, molecular, and biochemical analyses to answer these questions and develop deeper
insight into the mechanisms of SWI/SNF activity. Over the next five years, we will investigate mechanisms that
combine to regulate the composition and function of SWI/SNF and determine how different functional outcomes
are mediated by distinct SWI/SNF complexes. Given the critical role of SWI/SNF in development and disease,
understanding how the complex is regulated to mediate different outcomes is critical for developing new
approaches to targeting cancer and other diseases."

 The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and
microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically
relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS),
as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to
spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration
distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota,
in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation.
The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural
environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality.
Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.
 Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally
control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on
an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this
phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes
with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal
concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these
electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms
and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2
concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture
gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode
potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.
 Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature.
The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native
environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic
chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and
temporal response of microbial systems."
10846793,"GIPC3, a member of Gα-Interacting Protein, C-terminus (GIPC) family, is known to be essential for
hearing. Eleven mutations in GIPC3, spread throughout its three structural domains, cause inherited
autosomal recessive hearing loss. However, the molecular basis for GIPC3 function in the auditory
system and the mechanisms by which these human mutations result in hearing loss are unknown. We
have recently determined the structure of GIPC3 bound to a prototypical receptor and determined the
molecular mechanism of GIPC3 activation and its subsequent binding to MYO6, the unconventional
myosin that is expressed in the auditory hair cells and is essential for hearing. These biochemical and
structural studies allowed us to predict the effects of known deafness-related mutations in GIPC3 on its
activation and MYO6 binding. We have generated two new mouse models, one that is lacking functional
GIPC3 and another one with a W301X point mutation in Gipc3 that corresponds to a mutation with the
most severe auditory phenotype in humans. This study will explore the central hypothesis that GIPC3 has
a dual role in the auditory hair cells. We hypothesize that in stereocilia GIPC3 is involved in shaping
mechanotransduction and hair bundle structure through its interactions with CDH23/myosin-VIIa and
myosin-XVa, respectively. In the cell body, GIPC3 is essential for apical endocytosis at the pericuticular
neckless region due to its interaction with myosin-VI. All these functions are crucial for normal hearing.
However, the exact molecular mechanisms that determine the resting tension in the mechanotransduc-
tion machinery as well as gradation of stereocilia heights and diameters in the auditory hair cell bundles
are still enigmatic. Likewise, very little is known about molecular mechanisms and even the role of
pericuticular neckless endocytosis in the hair cell function. The expected outcomes of this study are to
uncover (a) the precise mechanism of deafness associated with GIPC3 deficiency and (b) the
physiological role of GIPC3 in hair cell functions, especially in mechanotransduction, formation of the hair
bundle architecture, and endocytosis at the pericuticular neckless. Deciphering the function of GIPC3
protein and its known mutations is a critical step towards the development of therapies for the treatment
and/or prevention of GIPC3-dependent deafness and hearing loss."

Fibrotic disorders are associated with an estimated 45% of human deaths. Chronic inflammation-associated
intestinal fibrosis is a significant complication in ~40% of Crohn’s disease (CD) patients. This condition causes
severe intestinal thickening and blockage, and is the most common reason for bowel resection in CD patients.
Despite this public health problem, there is minimal understanding behind the disease process of CD-
associated fibrogenesis. The microbiota provides a putative causal link to CD and other inflammatory bowel
diseases, but it remains unknown which specific microbial products induce distinct cellular responses and host
phenotypes. We hypothesize that a class of secreted microbial small molecules from a dysbiotic microbiota
disrupts local host metal homeostasis and promotes inflammation-associated fibrosis by altering macrophage
function. Nutrient metals are essential for living organisms, and the intestine is a battleground where host and
resident microbes fight to acquire metal. Host metal scavenging and sequestration defends against infectious
diseases, but its contribution to chronic inflammation-associated disease is not well understood. Here we
reveal a novel inflammation-associated fibrosis model using gnotobiotic Il10-/- mice mono-colonized with
adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) NC101. Fibrosis requires bacterial production of a specific small
molecule metallophore that is over-represented in AIEC strains and abundant in the metagenomes of CD
patients. Surprisingly, fibrosis does not require bacterial uptake and utilization of the metallophore, suggesting
it targets the host. Indeed, this metallophore induces metal-starvation genes in macrophages. Metallophores
are abundant in the gut microbiota, with hundreds predicted in the metagenomes of the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP). Therefore, our project has broad implications and supports a model in which excessive metal
chelation may characterize a dysbiotic microbiota that favors fibrotic vs. non-fibrotic CD. Iron and zinc
deficiency are associated with CD and promote fibrosis in animal models of extra-intestinal fibrosis.
Accordingly, the objective of this project is to define mechanisms by which microbial metallophores promote
fibrogenesis, and link microbial metal scavenging and altered host metal homeostasis with CD-associated
fibrosis. We have generated numerous AIEC strains that abolish the synthesis and/or transport of
metallophores. We will utilize these strains and purified metallophores in our novel inflammation-associated
fibrosis mouse model, an essential tool that recapitulates the histologic and molecular features of CD-
associated fibrosis. We will define the metal specificity underlying the pro-fibrotic in vivo effects using NC101
and clinical strains. We will also identify the pro-fibrotic colonic monocyte/macrophage population and explore
mechanisms by which altered metal availability promotes this macrophage phenotype. Understanding
precisely how specific bacterial products impact distinct host disease phenotypes is essential for developing
microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics for inflammatory bowel diseases."

There is a critical need for validated objective biomarkers that predict therapeutic response for asthma
therapies in children. Children who require daily asthma treatment with a controller medication such as an
inhaled steroid are defined to have persistent asthma. Approximately 60% of children with asthma in the United
States have persistent disease. Variability in treatment response to standard guideline supported medications
(e.g. inhaled steroids, leukotriene modifiers, mono-clonal antibodies) exist among children with persistent
asthma. Clinical markers such as IgE level, exhaled nitric oxide level, eosinophil and neutrophil counts have not
been validated to predict treatment response to asthma medications in children. It is not possible to optimize
currently available treatments for asthma in achieving therapeutic efficacy and limiting exposure to adverse
effects from non-efficacious medications without robust non-invasive biomarkers that can drive therapeutic
decision making. The long-term goal is to advances and improve therapeutic intervention for pediatric patients
with asthma. The objective in this particular application is to establish the utility of Histamine Iontophoresis with
Laser Doppler monitoring (HILD) as biomarker for accurate prediction of therapeutic response to low cost and
low side-effect antihistamine treatment in children with allergic asthma. The central hypothesis is that “HILD is
predictive of treatment response to an antihistamine in children with asthma”. This hypothesis has been
formulated by the applicant's strong preliminary data and supporting literature. The rationale for the proposed
research is that HILD is able to identify distinct histamine pharmacodynamic response types that predict
treatment response to antihistamine medications in asthma. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis
will be tested by two specific aims: 1) to determine HILD prediction of therapeutic response to an antihistamine
among children with allergic asthma; 2) to develop a robust predictive model of therapeutic response to an
antihistamine among children with allergic asthma. The first aim will compare change in Asthma Control Test
(ACT®) scores by histamine response type in a six week, 2x2 cross-over, add-on trial of Levocetirizine (LTZ)
among children with uncontrolled allergic asthma. The second aim will determine the best predictive model
(incorporating HILD and clinical variables) for change in ACT® scores after LTZ treatment among children with
allergic asthma. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to alter the current treatment
paradigms for children with asthma where response to treatment is predicted a priori; and is innovative in testing
and validating a first biomarker accurately predicting response to an asthma treatment in children. The
knowledge gained will make available the first validated biomarker to predict treatment response in children with
asthma and will improve therapeutic efficacy and outcomes in these children."

Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that culminates in organ failure leading to millions of deaths
worldwide each year with an increasing incidence as the population ages. There is a fundamental lack of
understanding of the complex host immune response in sepsis that has limited the development of targeted
therapeutics for which there are none beyond antibiotics and supportive care measures. At its core, there is
substantial immunopathology in sepsis with contributions from an overly exuberant immune response and
ineffective pathogen clearance. We and others have studied the critical role of platelets in immune responses
during acute infections, including the role of the lung in extramedullary platelet biogenesis. In this application,
we will explore the role of the spleen, a central immune organ, in extramedullary megakaryopoiesis and platelet
production in sepsis. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that the spleen co-opts a significant role in
platelet biogenesis during sepsis and that the platelets produced from the spleen are immunomodulatory and
important in host defense. In Aim 1, we will utilize a mouse model of peritonitis and polymicrobial sepsis resulting
in thrombocytopenia to understand the mechanics of ‘stressed’ platelet biogenesis in this setting. We will study
the role of adrenergic-dependent hematopoietic progenitor mobilization from the bone marrow during sepsis and
the niche-promoting factors that regulate this process. In Aim 2, we will interrogate the engraftment of circulating
hematopoietic progenitors in the spleen, their maturation into megakaryocytes, and the mediators (SCF,
CXCL12, IL-3) regulating this process. Using state-of-the-art techniques such as intravital imaging and lineage
tracing enabled by splenic transplantation, we will test the hypothesis that the spleen significantly contributes to
platelet biogenesis during sepsis. In Aim 3, we will use novel methods of single-cell RNA sequencing of platelets
to test for platelet heterogeneity during homeostasis and sepsis in mice and humans. Within this aim, we will
test a novel cellular therapy for sepsis by transfusing immune-skewed platelets into septic mice and testing for
therapeutic benefit. In summary, these studies will produce paradigm-shifting knowledge on the role of the
spleen in extramedullary megakaryopoiesis and platelet production and the importance of platelet driven
immunity, which will be foundational in the design of new therapeutic approaches to treat sepsis."

The goal of the UCSF Chemistry and Chemical Biology (CCB) predoctoral training program is to foster research
in the use of chemical strategies to probe fundamental biological questions. The overall program curriculum
focuses on: 1) rigorous didactic and hands-on training courses at the chemistry-biology interface in the first year;
2) research rotations in three different labs during that same year; 3) selection of a thesis advisor and
development of an independent research proposal at the end of the first year; 4) an intensive oral qualifying
exam in the second year; 5) individual thesis research with a focus on impact, collaboration and publication and
finally; 6) a dissertation seminar. Integrated throughout this training program, from the first day to the last, are
activities that train and encourage trainees to: i) develop skills in responsible conduct of research (RCR), rigor &
reproducibility and chemical and biological safety; ii) openly receive and give feedback through evaluation and
assessment tools; iii) foster career interests, including use of Individual Development Plans (IDPs); iv) enhance
written and oral communication skills; (v) celebrate diversity and a sense of community and vi) gain training in
critical analysis via journal clubs, seminars and minicourses. The research in the CCB program is highly inter-
disciplinary and broadly categorized as: biological chemistry and synthetic biology, computational chemistry and
biology, chemical synthesis and natural products, drug discovery and design, macromolecular structure and
function and protein and cellular engineering. To enact this training program, the CCB program is not associated
with a specific department; rather, we bring together 48 faculty from nine different academic departments and
two research institutes across UCSF’s world-class research enterprise. These faculty are rigorously and
holistically evaluated by the CCB Executive Committee, for excellence in research, mentoring and commitment
to diversity, and these faculty are required to complete annual mentor training. They are among the best

10847414,"The goal of this proposal is to characterize mechanisms by which methamphetamine (meth) increases HIV
infected CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the BBB to CXCL12, increasing perivascular and
parenchymal infected macrophage accumulation in the CNS of people with HIV (PWH) with meth use disorder.
There is increased prevalence of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders or impairment (HAND, HIV-NCI) in
PWH, even with antiretroviral therapy (ART), greatly impacting their quality of life. A significant number of
people with meth use disorder are also infected with HIV, with increased neurocognitive impairments reported
in active meth using PWH. The mechanisms by which meth use disorder increases HIV-NCI in PWH on ART
are not completely characterized, impeding the development of interventional strategies to reduce or eliminate
cognitive dysfunctions in this population. HIV enters the CNS early after initial infection, in part, by chemokine
induced transmigration of infected and uninfected CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the blood brain barrier
(BBB), contributing to the replenishment of viral reservoirs and chronic low level neuroinflammation that
characterize HIV-NCI. The chemokine CXCL12 (SDF-1) is constitutively expressed at low levels in the CNS
and is increased in the CNS of PWH, suggesting that this chemokine contributes to influx of uninfected and
infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes into the CNS. Our laboratory reported the novel finding that CXCR7 or
ACKR3, an atypical chemokine receptor for CXCL12, is expressed on the surface of uninfected and HIV
infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes and contributes, along with CXCR4, to the transmigration of these cells
across the BBB to CXCL12. Our preliminary data indicate that meth increases CXCL12 induced transmigration
of both uninfected and HIV infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes. The role of CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 in these meth
mediated effects, particularly in increased transmigration of CD14+CD16+ monocytes that harbor HIV (HIV+)
compared to cells that are exposed to, but do not harbor, virus (HIVexp), is the focus of this proposal. We
hypothesize that CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 contribute to meth mediated increases in CXCL12 induced HIV
infected CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration, including the preferential transmigration of HIV+ cells
compared to HIVexp cells. Thus, CXCR7 may be a therapeutic target for HIV-NCI treatment in PWH with meth
use disorder. We will use our in vitro human BBB model to characterize the role of CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 in
meth mediated effects on transmigration and on cells of the BBB. We will determine effects of meth on CXCR7
and/or CXCR4 expression, and on CXCL12 induced signaling, adhesion, chemotaxis, and invasion in
uninfected/HIV infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes. The in vivo effects of meth on monocyte influx into the
infected CNS will be examined in CNS tissue sections from meth treated SIV infected macaques by
immunohistochemical analyses of BBB expression of CXCL12, and perivascular and parenchymal
accumulation of CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 expressing monocytes/macrophages."
10847494,"The research proposed in this application aims to understand risk and protective factors that promote
continuation and desistance of problematic substance use (SU) and antisocial behavior (ASB) that began in
adolescence. We propose a fourth wave of follow-up, approximately 18 years after initial recruitment, of an
extremely affected adolescent sample as they transition into middle adulthood; this is a developmental period
when we expect a portion of these individuals to decrease or desist problematic SU and associated high-risk
behaviors, while others will persist with the most serious, destructive behaviors leading to devastatingly high
rates of morbidity and mortality. The aims of this proposal are to:
Aim 1: Identify risk factors that predict level and change (growth or decline) in SU and ASB from adolescence
to middle adulthood.
 a. We hypothesize that early age of onset, male sex, child maltreatment, neurocognitive deficits, and
 personality traits (behavioral undercontrol/impulsivity) will predict higher levels and more growth in SU
 and ASB.
 b. We hypothesize that genetic vulnerability as indexed by polygenic risks scores (PRS) will predict faster
 growth in SU and ASB that persists through later adulthood.
 c. We will explore mechanistic relationships; e.g., we hypothesize that the relationship between PRS and
 level and change of SU and ASB will be partially mediated by behavioral undercontrol/impulsivity.
Aim 2: Identify protective factors associated with level and change in SU and ASB.
 a. We hypothesize that adopting adult prosocial roles (education, employment, marriage, parenting) will
 be associated with lessened growth in SU and ASB.
 b. We hypothesize that treatment will be associated with greater desistance of SU and ASB than
incarceration.
 c. We will explore moderators of genetic vulnerability, specifically whether prosocial roles and treatment
 attenuate the effect of PRS on level of SU and ASB.
Aim 3: Determine the extent to which findings are specific to our highly selected sample of individuals with
early-onset SU and ASB or generalize more broadly by conducting comparative and joint analyses of data from
our high-risk sample with similar longitudinal data from our currently funded study of twins, an unselected
community-based sample.
 a. We hypothesize that risk and protective factors will operate similarly across the two samples, although
 we will have a greater magnitude of risk factors in the high-risk sample.
 b. We will confirm this hypothesis in joint analyses of the high-risk and community twin samples."

Chemotherapy resistance remains a major barrier to successful treatment of patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), contributing to high rates of relapse and mortality. Development of more effective treatments
for AML is imperative, particularly therapies with alternative mechanisms of action to circumvent
chemoresistance. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy using CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-
expressing T cells has drastically improved the treatment of patients with multiply relapsed/refractory B-cell
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and lymphoma and was approved by the FDA. However, successful translation
of AML immunotherapies has lagged behind and remains a significant unmet medical need. To date, CAR T
cells targeting CD33 or CD123 for AML have shown potent preclinical anti-AML activity, but also induced severe
myelotoxicity via on target/off tumor damage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We have developed an
innovative system to isolate single-domain nanobodies (Nb) that preferentially bind AML cells and enable
cognate CAR T cells to kill the cancer cells. One of these nanobodies, Nb157, specifically binds to the cell surface
protein CD13 (aminopeptidase N), which is often upregulated in adult AML specimens and leukemia stem cells
(LSCs). In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that Nb157/CD13 CAR T cells (CD13CARTs) potently
eradicated AML cells in preclinical animal models. TIM-3, an inhibitory receptor of certain immune cells, is
upregulated in AML blast cells and LSCs, but not expressed in human HSCs. Thus, we generated the 1st
generation bispecific and split CD13/TIM-3 CARTs (1st G bCARTs) and demonstrated that the bCARTs potently
eradicated AML cells in preclinical animal models, with significantly reduced toxicity to HSCs. To further improve
the safety profile of the bCARTs, the 2nd generation bCARTs were generated and they did not induce obvious
toxicity to HSCs in our ex vivo analysis. We hypothesize that further development of the bispecific or inducible
bispecific CARTs can eradicate AML in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with little or tolerable off-tumor
toxicity. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will evaluate the 2nd generation bispecific
CD13/TIM-3CARTs (bCARTs) in maximizing selective AML killing. Aim 2 will investigate efficacy and specificity
of inducible CD13/TIM-3CARTs (ibCARTs) in killing AML cells. Aim 3 will develop bispecific CLL-1/TIM-3
bCARTs to selectively killing AML cells. Results obtained from these studies are imminently translatable to the
clinic in the near future for patients with relapsed/refractory AML."

The effect of analytic flexibility on brain-behavior relationships and predictive models of adolescent
socioemotional processing is not well understood. The Maturational Imbalance (or Dual System) Model often
lacks reliability and generalizability. Existing work has predominately focused on single task-designs and small
samples (median < 50) concentrating on brain-behavior associations using disparate operationalizations of
reward and affective processing. The proposed research will integrate three developmental functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) samples (N ~ 105; N ~ 180; N ~ 7,000), with analogous reward and affective
paradigms, to investigate key issues related to reproducibility and generalizability: (a) the influence of analytic
flexibility on brain-behavior associations and convergence and predictive validity in contrasts within/between task
domains; and (b) uncovering task-based fMRI (t-fMRI) brain features (latent neural characteristics) that can serve
as the basis for robust brain-behavior prediction models across multiple samples. It is hypothesized that t-fMRI
contrasts can be separated across a multidimensional plane of attention and valence, which elicits neural
responses leading to approach or avoidance. However, how researchers operationalize positive and negative
valence in t-fMRI often varies, and this variability in the decision-making process may influence the underlying
neural effects. Aim 1a will examine how brain-behavior associations in a given task change based on analytic
decisions relating to fitting general linear models (GLM), contrasts and neural regions. Then, Aim 1b will consider
whether changes in brain-behavior associations (as a functional of analytic flexibility) are reflected in changes in
construct validity of approach and avoidance within- and between-task domains, such as reward and affective
processing. Conversely, traditional univariate GLM approaches show mounting issues in test-retest reliability
and express associations that may not support generalizable prediction of behavioral phenotypes. However, the
neurodevelopmental literature has proposed that multivariate analyses that leverage dimensionality reduction
and machine learning can provide informative brain-behavior prediction models. To test this hypothesis, in Aim
2, dimensionality reduction will be used in a large adolescent t-fMRI sample to generate brain-behavior prediction
models and compared across a reward and affective task to consider the influence of constructs. Aim 3 will focus
on the dissemination of code and fMRI statistical maps. The fellowship will support the applicant's growth in
becoming an independent researcher and leader in the neurodevelopmental neuroscience by providing training
in: combining t-fMRI datasets, evaluating the effect of analytic flexibility in fMRI and impact on construct validity,
applying dimensionality reduction in neurodevelopmental samples to produce brain-behavior prediction models.
This training will support the applicant's long-term goals of understanding of neural mechanisms in adolescent
substance use and improving our understanding of traditional and non-traditional measurement models."

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) has become one of the most widely utilized mediators to promote
cartilage growth in tissue engineering (TE) applications. Conventionally, for in vitro culture phases, TGF- is
supplemented in the culture medium with the expectation that it will readily diffuse into tissues and promote
the biosynthesis of a healthy cartilage ECM. However, a growing body of evidence brings to light a central
paradox with this conventional TGF- delivery strategy: physiologic TGF- doses exhibit limited penetration
into the tissue, giving rise to undesirable non-uniform growth, while the alternative use of higher,
supraphysiologic TGF- doses promotes the formation of cartilage with compromised tissue quality (e.g.,
fibrosis, hypertrophy, hyperplasia). In contrast to conventional TE TGF- delivery strategies, the natural
process of TGF- delivery in native cartilage occurs quite differently, where chondrocytes are surrounded by
large stores of TGF- that are sequestered in an inactive form, termed latent TGF- (LTGF-). Chondrocytes
activate LTGF- stores via integrins or secreted enzymes, leading to highly advantageous, need-based
activity throughout the tissue, which allows for essential ECM biosynthesis while avoiding the induction of
pathological tissue formation.
 This proposal capitalizes on this native regulatory mechanism by creating a bio-inspired TE strategy,
whereby chondrogenic cells are encapsulated in a hydrogel scaffold conjugated with large stores of LTGF-,
akin to the native environment. This platform allows cells to endogenously activate these LTGF- stores,
giving rise to the highly beneficial delivery of uniform and moderated, near-physiologic TGF- doses to cells,
which promote biosynthetic enhancements in the absence of tissue quality limitations.
 Further, a novel reaction-diffusion modeling framework is developed to predict the activity of TGF-
exposed to cells in constructs while accounting for the critical patient-specific chemical reactions applied to
TGF- in the tissue. These patient-specific models can guide optimal LTGF- design parameters, allowing for
optimal activity doses and giving rise to improved TE cartilage quality and mitigation of pathogenic off-target
desorption of TGF- from the construct.
 In the current project, we examine the efficacy of this bio-inspired LTGF- scaffold platform by assessing:
1) the capability of reaction-diffusion models to optimize growth outcomes in patient-specific cell populations
(human chondrocytes and MSCs), 2) the capability of model-optimized LTGF- scaffolds to improve TE
cartilage performance in the hostile mechanochemical environment of the OA synovial joint through use of an
ex vivo synovial joint bioreactor, and 3) the capability of LTGF- scaffolds to improve TE cartilage performance
in an in vivo porcine focal defect model."
10843868,"Abstract:
Substance use disorder is a costly and debilitating chronic disorder, characterized by high rates of relapse
despite successful attempts at rehabilitation and periods of abstinence. In addition, the rates of overdose and
death associated with the opioid class of drugs have dramatically risen over the last decade and represent a
major public health burden. To identify putative drug targets for the treatment of opioid use disorder, the
molecular mechanisms that govern opioid seeking must be delineated. The goal of this proposal is to address
this critical barrier in the field of substance abuse research by exploring entirely new mechanisms that
modulate opioid seeking from a class of RNA called circular RNAs. Although circular RNAs have never been
studied in drug seeking behaviors, this species of RNA has the potential to broadly influence cellular signaling
at the epigenetic, transcriptional and translational levels, which in turn may impact a wide range of behavioral
phenotypes. Circular RNAs are single-stranded transcriptional splice products that result from backsplicing of
3' to 5' ends of mRNA. Such splice products are beginning to be explored in the brain, with some expressed at
higher levels than their mRNA counterparts, and have been reported to modulate critical processes including
microRNA activity, gene expression, protein translation and even cognitive behaviors. We have identified a set
of circular RNAs and their biogenesis enzymes that are regulated after heroin self-administration in the rat
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region essential to reward seeking. During the award period, we will explore
the hypothesis that altered OFC circular RNA signaling contributes to opioid seeking phenotypes. We will use a
multi-disciplinary approach to examine the cellular and behavioral consequences of heroin-induced circular
RNA expression in a rat model of opioid seeking. First, heroin-associated circular RNAs will be genetically
manipulated in the OFC to determine their contribution to motivation for opioids and relapse to opioid seeking
after extinction or abstinence. We will then define the cellular phenotype of heroin-associated circular RNAs in
the OFC for insights into the cellular circuits that have altered circRNA biogenesis as a result of heroin
exposure. Finally, we will identify signaling pathways downstream of heroin-associated circular RNAs in the
OFC to describe the molecular interactions of this novel class of RNA within drug-exposed neurons. Our
dataset of heroin-associated circular RNAs have never been studied in the brain before and represent an
entirely new area of research in the field of substance abuse. Therefore, the outcome of the unprecedented
proposed studies will shed light on novel mechanisms that govern drug seeking and provide essential insight
into the neurobiology of substance abuse."
10843869,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is characterized by vestibular schwannomas, and meningiomas that show loss of
the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Meningiomas arise from meningothelial arachnoid cap cells and are the most
common primary intracranial tumors in adults. NF2 inactivation is frequently associated with sporadic
meningiomas, particularly in primary atypical (WHO grade II) tumors. Meningiomas that progress despite
surgery and radiation are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, effective systemic
therapies are greatly needed. For meningioma modeling and preclinical drug screening, we employ human
primary meningioma (MN) cell lines derived from surgically resected tumors and CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited
isogenic, human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs) that either express or lack NF2. Employing these models, we
established that NF2-deficient meningiomas reveal aberrant activation of mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling, which
led to clinical trials for NF2 and meningiomas. Recently, we undertook large-scale kinome, transcriptome and
drug screening studies in our AC and MN cell models to identify other potential targets. Kinome and
transcriptome data revealed increased activation and expression of several EPH receptor family tyrosine
kinases (EPH-RTKs), Src family kinase members (SFKs) and c-KIT, which are all targets of dasatinib, which is
recently published. Our ‘omics approach also identified other interesting candidates, including ligands NRG1,
HBEGF and apelin, and AMPK-related kinases, particularly NUAK2, to be consistently upregulated in the
kinome and transcriptome of NF2-null AC/MN cells. Our recent results suggest that NRG1 expression and
ERBB3 signaling is regulated by mTORC1 signaling. We plan to examine whether NRG1 alone or factors such
as HBEGF and APLN are also regulated by mTOR or play a role in downstream signaling in NF2-null MN cells.
We propose to understand the mechanism and biological significance of elevated expression and activation of
NUAK2 in meningioma. Further, our large-scale drug screening efforts, in collaboration with NIH-NCATS,
revealed a set of proteasome pathway related drugs exhibiting cytotoxic effects in NF2-null cells. Here we
propose to examine three different drugs targeting the proteasome (provided by Millennium-Takeda
Pharmaceuticals), alone and combined with TAK-228 (mTOR inhibitor) in 5 grade I, 5 grade II and 5 grade III
MN lines with NF2 loss. More importantly, we propose to undertake single cell RNAseq along with array CGH
in NF2-deficient meningiomas and their corresponding primary cell lines to define tumor heterogeneity and
correlate with drug response. Anti-tumor efficacy of proteasome drugs will also be evaluated in orthotopic NF2-
deficient benign and malignant meningioma models. Our overall approach of (i) leveraging the ‘omics and drug
screening results, (ii) characterizing tumor heterogeneity and correlating with drug response, and (iii) testing
potential drugs in orthotopic NF2-deficient in vivo models is timely, novel and will provide a framework to
pursue new avenues in NF2 and meningioma research for clinical care."

Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and family violence are co-occurring risk factors for Native American (NA)
health disparities and are associated with the leading causes of death within this population, such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. However, extant interventions often fail to holistically promote
resilience, health, and wellness, instead addressing problems in isolation. To our knowledge, there have been
few NA culturally-based and family-focused interventions that enhance family resilience and prevent and
reduce AOD abuse and violence in families. Given the gap in community and culturally-grounded programs to
prevent AOD abuse and violence in families, there is a critical need to test the efficacy of such sustainable
community-based interventions. The long-term goal of this research is to promote health and wellness, while
preventing and reducing AOD abuse and violence in NA families by testing a culturally-relevant and family-
centered intervention for cross-national dissemination. Using community-based participatory research methods
(CBPR), the overall objectives of the proposed research are to use a stepped-wedge trial design (SWTD) to
test the efficacy of a culturally modified intervention that is facilitated by Tribally-based community health
representatives (CHRs) and to use the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to examine
the barriers and facilitators for intervention sustainability and implementation. Our central hypothesis is that the
community-based, “Weaving Healthy Families program”—a shortened, streamlined, and culturally adapted
version of the Celebrating Families! Program—will reduce and postpone AOD use, decrease and prevent
violence in families, and promote resilience and wellness (including mental health) among NA adults and
youth. This intervention seeks to promote wellness by targeting key behavioral (AOD abuse), mental/emotional
(emotional regulation/anger management, cognitions, and resilience), social and familial (healthy and non-
violent relationships, the family environment, and parenting), cultural (values and traditions), and physical
(nutrition and AOD abuse) factors. We accomplish the stated objectives through these aims: Aim 1: Test the
efficacy of the modified intervention on AOD abuse and violence reduction and resilience
enhancement. Using an open cohort, multiple baseline SWTD and multilevel and longitudinal modeling, we
will test our working hypothesis that the intervention will reduce parental AOD abuse and violence, postpone
youth AOD use, and enhance family members' resilience and wellness. Aim 2: Evaluate the sustainability
and feasibility of the intervention's implementation. We will use the CFIR and a convergent mixed-method
design to evaluate barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation, testing our working hypothesis that
the modified intervention will provide a culturally relevant and feasible model to promote wellness in a
sustainable way. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are an efficacious, culturally relevant, and
sustainable community-based program to promote health and wellness for tribes cross-nationally."
10844199,"Pilot Project Summary/Abstract
 SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease in which B cells have a major role in pathogenesis. Recent
studies identified a non-classical subset of B cells, named age-associated B cells (ABCs), which is expanded
in inflammatory diseases such as SLE. In SLE patients, expansion of ABCs is more evident in those with lupus
nephritis (LN) and with high titers of autoantibodies. Functionally, ABCs produce autoantibodies following ex
vivo stimulation with a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist and cytokines. ABCs also display features of
professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) with higher expression of MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules
than what is observed in other B cell subsets. In mice, inhibition of ABC generation alleviated lupus
manifestation mediated, in part, by prevention of effector T cell differentiation, especially follicular helper T
(Tfh) cells. While these observations support the contribution of ABCs to SLE pathogenesis, significant gaps in
knowledge exist regarding their pathogenic function.
 Our laboratory and others found that ABCs are a metabolically and transcriptionally distinct B cell
population compared to naïve or memory B cells. ABCs produce higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines,
including IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1β, and exhibit inflammasome formation. ABCs can uptake soluble antigens
through B cell receptor-independent manner. We also observed expression of HIF1A in ABCs. An
inflammatory function of HIF1A has been identified in myeloid cells, but not in B cells.
 The pilot project will characterize the function of ABCs as antigen presenting cells (APCs). There is the
potential to relate this phenotypic characterization of ABCs to the ANA response studied in the Principal
Project. Single cell analyses will also be available from patients with active SLE and pre-flare samples; this
data will be generated by the Collaborative Project. The pilot project will benefit from the infrastructure of the
ACE project and will use B cells derived from patients being studied in the cohorts available through the
Collaborative Project."
10841784,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.
Our research seeks to elucidate the mechanism of action and structure–function relationships of bioactive sec-
ondary metabolites, toward treatments for drug-resistant bacterial infections and cancer. The development of
syntheses that enable precise manipulation of each class of molecules, with correlated insights into molecular
and biomolecular mechanism, is a unifying goal of each project. We seek to complete the synthesis of the
dimeric isolate lomaiviticin A, a glycosylated bacterial metabolite that inhibits cancer cell growth at pM concen-
trations by inducing double-strand breaks in DNA. We recently showed that the structure assignment of lo-
maiviticin was incorrect and have made significant progress toward the synthesis of the revised structure. In
parallel we are pursuing the synthesis of the related nenestatins as these provide an opportunity to probe the
biosynthesis of both classes of isolates. We will advance our studies of gukulenin A, a pseudodimeric α-tropo-
lone natural product that has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in murine models of ovarian cancer. We
have come very close to completing the synthesis of gukulenin itself and are now in position to begin to evaluate
its structure–function relationships and determine its biological target. A novel linchpin reagent and a method
for the synthesis of highly-substituted α-tropolones were developed and will be further explored during the fund-
ing period. We developed a novel method for the stereocontrolled synthesis of deoxyglycosides involving the
addition of a configurationally-defined anomeric anion to a dialkyl peroxide. We will expand the scope of this
chemistry to incorporate the synthesis of C-aryl glycosides (by cross-coupling) and 2-hydroxy glycosides (by
prior removal of the hydroxyl proton) with the goal of applying these findings to the synthesis of altromycins,
antitumor isolates with demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in vivo. An additional effort involves discovering
new pleuromutilin antibiotics to treat drug-resistant infections. We developed a synthesis of pleuromutilins that
provided access to 17 structurally-distinct derivatives that are impossible to access by semisynthesis. We will
use recent structural data of pleuromutilins bound to cfr mutant ribosomes to guide the synthesis of derivatives
that overcome this widespread resistance mechanism. We have collaborations in place to evaluate our com-
pounds against modern cfr mutants and to obtain crystallographic data of lead compounds bound to mutant and
wild-type ribosomes. Finally we will pursue the synthesis of platinum-directed alkylation agents that selectively
alkylate O6-guanine. O6-Alkylguanine residues are reversed by MGMT, a DNA repair protein that is expressed
in all healthy tissue but which is not expressed in many tumor types. Current clinical agents provide <0.1% yield
of O6-guanine alkylation products; identifying agents with increased selectivity for O6-guanine will allow full ex-
ploitation of MGMT silencing in chemotherapy. We have a network of collaborators to advance the translational
aspects of each project. These studies advance basic chemistry through strategy and reaction development,
and will continue to deliver new preclinical candidates to treat cancers and drug-resistant infections."

The Viral Vector Core (Core 1) will provide customized lentiviral or retroviral vectors to all PPG projects.
Lentiviral or retroviral vector particles are fundamental reagents necessary for the efficient genetic engineering
of HTLV-1 infected cells. The vector particles will be used to overexpress or reduce expression of host, viral, or
novel fusion genes. Reduced expression will be achieved by delivery of either shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. The
vectors for reduced expression will be matched with vectors for complementation with wild type and functional
mutant genes with silent mutations to prevent shRNA or CRISPR recognition. Lentiviral vector particles will
also provide fluorescent and/or selection genes. Homology directed repair induced by a CRISPR/Cas9 vector
will modify the HTLV-1 genome sequence. Integrase defective lentiviral vectors will be used to quantify the off-
target effects of all CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. The Core will work with individual PPG labs to develop
CRISPR/Cas9 reagents and methodologies for modification of HTLV-1 infected cells. The Core will also
develop a novel vector that limits Cas9 expression both spatially and temporally to transcriptionally active
HTLV-1 infected cells and reduce potential off-target editing. Specific aims of the core are: Aim 1 to provide
custom retroviral vectors, Aim 2 to design, validate, and optimize CRISPR/Cas9 vectors, Aim 3 to develop an
inducible, self-limiting HTLV-1 CRISPR/Cas9 vector. The lentiviral or retroviral vector particles produced by the

The proposed K99/R00 award aims to guide the applicant to research independence, specifically in mobile health
(mHealth) interventions for emerging adults with alcohol misuse and comorbid conditions. Emerging adults have
the highest rates of alcohol use disorders, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts compared to any other age group.
These problems are highly comorbid, with alcohol intoxication serving as a risk factor for suicidality. However,
utilization of outpatient treatment services for alcohol or mental health is extremely low in this population, even
following emergency department (ED) visits for either problem. Emerging adults are likely to be responsive to
mHealth interventions, and mHealth is well-suited to the ED. mHealth can address an urgent public health need by
bridging the gap between discharge and access to outpatient care and by supporting emerging adults who do not
access outpatient care. This study seeks to design an evidence-informed interactive, avatar-guided mHealth
intervention to provide ongoing education, skills practice, mood and behavior monitoring, and personalized
feedback to reduce alcohol misuse and suicidality. This mHealth platform will be developed based on a review of
commercial suicidality and alcohol mHealth apps, in-person integrated interventions, and an existing avatar-based
mHealth platform, developed by co-mentor Easton. The study aims to: 1) seek feedback on the proposed mHealth
intervention avatar, content, and features from a national youth advisory board, consumers (e.g., emerging adults
with alcohol misuse and suicidality; n=25), clinical experts in emerging adult alcohol and suicidality treatment
(n=10) and ED staff (n=10) creating an alpha version of the intervention; 2) test [usability] of the alpha version and
[feasibility of research protocols] in an open pilot trial with (n=20) emerging adults, to inform a beta version, and 3)
evaluate [acceptability and feasibility] in a randomized controlled [feasibility] trial comparing the beta version [of the
avatar-guided mHealth intervention + standard ED care; n=30)] to an active control, a commercial suicide
prevention app (MY3 [+ standard ED care; n=30). Secondary aims of the RCT are to test for safety and early
signals of efficacy on a range of alcohol, suicidal ideation, and outpatient care variables at 6-, 12-, and 24-weeks
post-randomization.] An exploratory aim is to examine within-person changes in same-day alcohol misuse and SI
severity between intervention groups via daily diary and ecological momentary assessment. The training and
career development plan includes courses, workshops, seminars, reading, and hands-on research in areas critical
to the PI’s independence: mHealth intervention development within interdisciplinary teams, integrated alcohol and
suicidality interventions for emerging adults, randomized controlled trials with fully-technology-based interventions,
and lagged sequential analysis with ecological data. The R00 projects will provide pilot data to support future fully-
powered R01 applications for [efficacy trials] of the avatar-guided mHealth intervention. The K99/R00 award will set
the foundation of the PI’s independent research career, specializing in mHealth interventions for alcohol misuse."

The proposed Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) course Advanced Techniques in Molecular
Neuroscience (ATMN), to be held annually in July 2020– 2024, is part of the CSHL's postgraduate
training program in neurobiology. ATMN is a short, intensive sixteen day hands-on course which
prepares students to enter directly into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized
molecular techniques in contemporary aspects of neurobiological research. Experimental modules in
the course will include quantitative assays of RNAs bound to protein by crosslinking
immunoprecipitation (CLIP), translating mRNA isolation from specified neural subtypes (TRAP), tissue
clearing methodologies combined with single RNA molecule detection by hybridization chain reaction
(HCR), preparation of pure astrocyte and neural progenitor cell cultures, design and use of engineered
viral vectors in neuroscience research, design and use of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools, practical
exercises in gene delivery systems in vivo, genome-wide assessment of chromatin state and
transcription factor binding by ATACseq and Cut & Run, and use and design of BAC transgenic
vectors. Experimental techniques are taught in the context of the broader conceptual advances that
they may provide. The course invites lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to
give up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from
larger pools of applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators and research
physicians. Because of the short duration of this course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend
and receive a short, intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their
time and attention. The ATMN course also provides an unusual opportunity for established scientists to
apply these advanced techniques to their own research interests, or to retrain in an important specialty
within neuroscience with which they may not be familiar. Methods and concepts taught in the course
are disseminated to the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and
online resources."

Aging is a complex process brought about by a combination of genetic, hormonal and metabolic determinants.
Of the factors defined as mechanistically linked to fundamental processes of aging, often referred to as the
“pillars of aging”, inflammation and cellular senescence of adipose tissue take center stage. The focus of this
application is the interface between immune cells, adipocytes and cellular senescence with an emphasis on
the role(s) that lipids play in orchestrating B-cell biology, adipocyte oxidative stress and senescence.
Recently published work from Camell and colleagues describes the age-dependent decrease in catecholamine
signaling that occurs in adipose tissue due to the expansion of resident B-cells. Aged adipose B cells (AABs)
have a memory-like and inflammatory phenotype, but how they impair catecholamine signaling is unclear.
Age-dependent loss of catecholamine signaling decreases adipose lipolysis and release of monounsaturated
fatty acids (MUFA) from triacylglycerol droplets. Work carried out collaboratively by the Bernlohr laboratory
has shown that MUFAs bind directly to SIRT1 and allosterically activate the enzyme towards some, but not all,
deacetylation targets. Of the targets defined, loss of SIRT1 activation leads to attenuated dephosphorylation of
PGC1a and decreased transcriptional expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes leading to the
production of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy hexenal (4HHE), 4-oxononenal (4ONE) and 4-
hydroxynonenal (4HNE) that diffuse from adipocytes. Unpublished work carried out by the Robbins lab has
shown that 4HNE induces senescence in fibroblasts and preadipocytes leading to expression of b-
galactosidase, MCP1 and p21. This proposal represents a novel confluence of interest and expertise between
the Camell, Bernlohr and Robbins laboratories’ to mechanistically define the interplay between inflammation of
adipose tissue and lipid metabolism as key factors influencing senescence and aging.
The central hypothesis for this application is that diet, age and sex-specific decreases in adipose lipolysis
driven by resident B-cells leads to attenuated MUFA-dependent activation of SIRT1 and concomitantly
increased oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress in turn leads to secretion of reactive lipid aldehydes and
activation of the senescence program by tissue resident preadipocytes. To test this hypothesis, the following
specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Define diet, age, sex and depot-specific composition of adipose B cells and their impact on
 adipocyte lipolysis.
Aim 2. Evaluate the lipid-dependent regulation of SIRT1 and concomitant control of adipocyte
 oxidative stress.
Aim 3. Assess aldehyde-dependent adipose senescence in murine models and in response to
senolytics."
10848330,"Project Summary
Late life depression (LLD) is one of the strongest and most consistently identified risk factors for accelerated
cognitive decline and dementia but the mechanisms contributing to these relationships have not yet been
adequately clarified. Compelling evidence suggests that progressive cortico-limbic atrophy may act as a
primary mechanism of accelerated cognitive decline in LLD. However, a significant barrier has been
differentiating the effects of incipient and undiagnosed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from those of LLD. In our
parent award we partnered with the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to begin to address
this challenge. We created an adjunct arm of ADNI for individuals with LLD in order to collect genetic,
cognitive, and neuroimaging data, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measures of amyloid (Aβ)
and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measures of neurodegeneration that characterize AD. Our results
have shown that: 1) Accelerated cognitive decline is evident in LLD compared to Non-Depressed (ND) older
adults over 30 months after accounting for Aβ, AD genetic risk (Apolipoprotein ε4 alleles; APOE), and
measures of cerebrovascular disease (white matter lesions; WML), 2) Neurodegeneration in key regions
implicated in depression across the lifespan, including the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), superior temporal
lobe (STL), temporal pole (TP) hippocampus (HC), amygdala (AMG) and accumbens area (AA) were
characteristic of LLD independent of Aβ, APOE, and WML, 3) LLD was associated with focal regions of
abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) but not increased Aβ or WML relative to ND, and 4) Baseline cortico-limbic
volumes were the strongest neurobiological factors associated with baseline cognition and subsequent
cognitive decline and worse course of depression. However the parent study had only one neuroimaging
evaluation. As such, we could not evaluate progression of atrophy in LLD which is essential to determine
neurodegenerative mechanisms of cognitive decline in LLD. Additionally, we did not obtain tau PET data which
is critical given recent evidence that suggests LLD is associated with increased cortico-limbic tau deposition
even in absence of elevated Aβ and that tau is more strongly linked to atrophy and cognitive decline than Aβ in
ND. This study will: 1) Determine the association of LLD with progressive cortico-limbic atrophy independent of
Aβ, 2) Determine the association of LLD with increased cortico-limbic tau deposition and the relationship of tau
with neurodegeneration in LLD, and 3) Determine the association of cortico-limbic atrophy and tau deposition
with 7-year cognitive and 9-year depression outcomes in LLD. These goals will be achieved by conducting
additional evaluations of 100 participants from the parent study. We will conduct a second neuroimaging
evaluation (MRI, PET) 5 years after their initial scans, complete clinical evaluations (psychiatric, cognitive) at 5-
years and 7-years, and evaluate depression symptoms every six months. Data from 300 ND older adults from
the ADNI-III study matched for demographic and AD risk and pathology will be used for group comparisons."
10848331,"Mitigation of Radiation-Induced Immune Dysfunction by PrC-210 Treatment
PROJECT SUMMARY
Human risk of radiation exposure, possibly catastrophic in proportion, has risen. Whether from intentional or
unintentional nuclear events, such events could yield thousands to hundreds of thousands of surviving victims.
A recent government report stated, “the ideal medical countermeasures for radiation would be those that can
both mitigate and protect from injuries.., such a countermeasure remains a significant unmet medical need.”
 In our earlier work, we invented and have developed a novel, proprietary, compound, PrC-210, which
has demonstrated a profound survival benefit to mice when it was administered once 24 hr after an LD95/30
dose of whole-body radiation to the mice. In its preclinical development, PrC-210 has shown multiple protective
effects in multiple organ-protection settings; as a radiation countermeasure, PrC-210 was highly effective
whether it was administered a day after or 15 min before a 95% lethal radiation dose. PrC-210 has neither
nausea nor hypotension side effects. For this proposed U01 research our group will expand upon, and
pharmacologically optimize, systemic delivery of PrC-210 at 24 h post-radiation to maximize animal survival and
will explore underlying immune and gastrointestinal protection mechanisms to explain the post-radiation, PrC-
210-conferred, survival benefit. Our proof-of-concept studies showed a 45% survival benefit to mice that received
a single systemic PrC-210 dose 24 h following a single LD95 dose of ionizing radiation (P=0.002); the PrC-210-
treated mice also showed significantly greater body weights (P=0.012) following irradiation, and visibly improved
bone marrow cellularity. In this U01, using two established mouse irradiation models, we will identify the best
protocol for administering PrC-210 to post-radiation mice, establish the efficacy of PrC-210 in mitigating
radiation-induced damage to both immune tissues and circulating immune cells, and establish the efficacy of
PrC-210 in protecting the entire gastrointestinal setting from post-radiation immune infiltration and inflammation-
associated GI tissue destruction. A host of scored immune endpoints will be measured in post-radiation mice,
with and without PrC-210 protection, so we will have multiple, overlapping endpoints of immune function in post-
radiation mice, and then see what impact PrC-210 has in protecting them.
 The goals of this U01 proposal are to: i) determine the optimum +24 hr PrC-210 administration route and
dose that confers the greatest survival benefit against an LD95/30 radiation dose, and ii) determine the full extent
to which PrC-210 mitigates radiation damage to immune organs and their blood-borne cells, and to

10850575,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous condition caused by a range of injurious stimuli that
affects >1.5 million patients in the US each year. Ultimately, AKI accounts for ~$10 billion in US
healthcare costs and results in 2 million deaths annually worldwide. AKI has long-term health
consequences ranging from new onset of hypertension with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD),
to progressive CKD ultimately leading to kidney failure. Despite this, there are no effective clinical
therapies that reduce the severity of injury or accelerate recovery after AKI. To solve this, we have
assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in zebrafish, mouse, and human kidney
organoid models of AKI. Our team previously discovered a novel compound 4-
phenylthiobutanoate (PTBA) that when delivered as a prodrug (UPHD25 or UPHD186)
ameliorates injury in models after AKI. PTBA inhibits histone deacetylase-8 (HDAC8), which plays
a major role in deacetylating the cohesin subunit SMC3 (involved in sister chromatid cohesion
and the formation of gene-regulatory chromatin loops). In vitro studies have shown that HDAC8
inhibition leads to sustained SMC3 acetylation and delays cell cycle progression, without
compromising mitosis. In vivo mouse data shows that PTBA increases the proportion of cells in
G0/G1 and reduces the number of cells in G2/M after AKI. As tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can
arrest in a pro-fibrotic state in G2/M due to AKI-induced DNA damage, we hypothesize that PTBA’s
inhibition of HDAC8 promotes recovery from AKI by slowing down the cell cycle, giving TECs
more time to repair DNA damage and thus reducing the likelihood of arresting in G2/M. We will
test this hypothesis in two projects that will (1) Confirm HDAC8 as a therapeutic target for
promoting productive repair after AKI, (2) Develop novel HDAC8 inhibitors with improved potency,
drug-like properties, and efficacy that can ultimately be taken into clinical trials. Our highly
collaborative and complementary team is well placed to conduct this work with expertise in
medicinal chemistry and compound optimization (Hukriede, Huryn); and models of AKI in
mammals (de Caestecker); zebrafish (Hukriede, Davidson); cell culture and human kidney
organoids (Davidson, Hukriede)."
10850592,"Summary
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a wide spectrum of outcomes from recovery to a long-term transition to chronic
kidney disease (CKD). Between 2000 and 2014, AKI hospitalizations have increased from 3.5 to 11.7 per 1000
persons. Medicare patients aged 66 years and older hospitalized for AKI have a 35% cumulative probability of
a recurrent AKI hospitalization within one year and 28% will be diagnosed with CKD in the same time frame.
Men have a higher risk of AKI, and of developing progressive CKD, although the mechanisms are poorly
understood. In the mouse, males also show a heightened vulnerability to AKI. Recent single cell RNA-seq
studies from the McMahon and Kim groups have highlighted marked differences in gene expression between
the sexes in proximal tubule segments, the region of the nephron most susceptible to AKI. Preliminary studies
in the Humphreys and McMahon laboratories using single nuclear sequencing identified a cell type resulting
from failed repair of proximal tubule cells (FR-PTC) following mild to severe AKI with a pro-inflammatory, pro-
fibrotic signature. FR-PTCs are hypothesized to drive progressive kidney disease following AKI. This proposal
centers on the postulates that an understanding of sex differences in response to AKI, and the application of
genetic approaches to target proinflammatory properties of FR-PTCs and to eliminate FR-PTCs following renal
repair, will be effective routes to ultimately benefit patient outcomes post AKI. To this end, we have assembled
a complementary team, with prior collaborative experience: Humphreys (Washington University), Kim
(University of Pennsylvannia) and McMahon (University of Southern California). All team members have
participated in the ReBuilding a Kidney Consortium. In Specific Aim 1: we will characterize successful versus
failed proximal tubule repair with single nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) and single nuclear chromatin
accessibility studies (scATAC-seq) in male and female mouse models examining key findings in human kidney
biopsies. In Specific Aim 2: we will harmonize multimodal datasets generated in Specific Aim1 to facilitate
viewing and interrogation of these data by the broad research community. Mining of these data by the group
will focus on defining the regulatory logic of repair strategies and outcomes in the male and female kidney. In
Specific Aim 3: we will examine the hypothesis that adverse outcomes in the male kidney following AKI are
driven by NF-kB pathway components Nfkb1 and TNIK in FR-PTCs, genetically eliminating the action of these
genes. We will generate and validate a new transgenic mouse resource for the community, enabling genetic
modification and elimination of FR-PTCs. We will determine whether FR-PTC removal has a favorable
outcome, as we predict, on progressive kidney disease following AKI."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to left heart failure is a common and highly morbid disease characterized by
molecular, histophenotypic, and clinical heterogeneity that hampers progress in diagnosis and therapeutic target
discovery. Biochemical markers and treatments for left heart failure-PH patients are lacking. Some patients with
left heart disease develop combined pre- and post-capillary PH (CPH), characterized by severely elevated
pulmonary vascular resistance, vascular remodeling, and early death. This vascular profile cannot be ascribed
to pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) alone. For example, we show that compared to PVH, patients with
CPH are younger but have a similar duration and severity of left heart disease. We also reported that the genetic
profile of CPH is divergent from patients with PVH but is also highly diverse among CPH patients. This
observation is consistent with the complex patterns of vascular remodeling observed at autopsy in CPH, and,
collectively, suggest that opportunity may exist to leverage the unique pathobiological profile of individual CPH
patients for optimizing diagnosis and treatment.
 We present preliminary data innovating network medicine to exploit unique pathobiological features in
patients with a complex left heart disease associated with PH. We developed patient-specific networks focusing
on functional/physical protein-protein interactions (PPIs), generating a unique molecular ‘wiring map’ for each
patient. Network topology predicted pulmonary hemodynamics and tissue histologic features (e.g. fibrosis) in
individual patients despite phenotypic heterogeneity across the cohort. Therefore, we propose to use this
approach to advance precision medicine in CPH, which sets the framework for our central hypothesis: In CPH,
shared features across patient-specific PPI networks will identify next-generation biomarker(s) that are based
on functional molecular pathways, disease-specific, and prognostic. We postulate also that targeting PPIs unique
to individual patients using systems pharmacology will provide a novel avenue to individualize drug therapy.
 In Aim 1 we will profile the CPH, PVH, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) transcriptome (N=
50/group) to identify PPIs that are shared by all CPH patients, but distinct from PVH/PAH. We will use
endophenotype enrichment, network topology, genetic context, and protein expression data as filters to identify
next-generation CPH biomarker candidates in silico. Finally, we will validate the CPH biomarkers for associations
with functional capacity and prognosis in two external cohorts and human lung samples. In Aim 2 we will integrate
drug-protein interaction and PPI network data to identify patient-specific repurposed therapies and use functional
genetics, drug effect-protein expression data, and drug availability and safety profiles to filter therapeutic
candidates. Finally, we will perform five N-of-1 placebo-controlled cross-over trials using mechanistic endpoints
to test the validity of our systems pharmacology pipeline for individualized drug selection. These innovative
experiments advance precision medicine in CPH, a highly morbid disease that lacks treatment."
10850587,"Project Summary
Protein phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of many biological processes, including the response to
DNA damage. While kinase signaling has been extensively investigated, the role of phosphatases remains
understudied. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is responsible for the majority of phosphoserine and
phosphothreonine dephosphorylation within a cell and confers its substrate specificity through its regulatory B
subunit. The B56 family is the largest of the four families of PP2A regulatory subunits. All B56 isoforms recognize
an LxxIxE short linear motif (SLiM) on their substrates and interactors. We have developed a SLiM-mediated
competitive inhibitor approach to interrogate the PP2A-B56-dependent phosphoproteome, thus expanding the
understanding of B56-specific substrates. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms that govern the activity
of PP2A-B56 remains incomplete. Upon B56 inhibition, we found phosphoserines 88-90 of B56δ to be
differentially regulated. Our preliminary data suggest that these sites are inactivating in nature. B56δ is encoded
by the gene PPP2R5D, which is mutated in PPP2R5D-related developmental disorder characterized by cognitive
impairment and epilepsy. Furthermore, we identified Oxidative Resistance 1 (OXR1), an LxxIxE motif-containing
protein involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and the maintenance of genome stability, to be a B56
substrate. Yet little is known about the regulation of OXR1. Here, we propose to determine how phosphorylation
of S88-90 regulates B56δ and to expand upon our understanding of B56-dependent regulation of OXR1. Our
central hypothesis is that S88-90 of B56δ are critical regulatory sites on B56δ, which serves an essential role in
modulating DNA damage responses through OXR1 signaling. Specific Aim 1 investigates the regulation of B56δ
S88-90 phosphosites, the kinase(s) that phosphorylate them, and their biological function using innovative
approaches in mass spectrometry and in vitro and in cell studies. Specific Aim 2 seeks to determine the role of
PP2A-B56 in the dephosphorylation of OXR1, the contribution of the OXR1 LxxIxE motif to this interaction, and
the biological significance of the B56-OXR1 axis in DNA damage signaling. The successful completion of these
aims will elucidate the phosphoregulation of B56δ and the role of PP2A-B56 in the dephosphorylation of OXR1.
By understanding the regulation of these proteins, which are involved in a variety of human diseases, we will
gain a better understanding of their disease-relevant physiology, potential therapeutic targets, and points for
therapeutic intervention. The proposed projects and training plan in this application will enhance my skills in
biochemical and cell biological techniques, experimental design, data analysis, scientific communication,
mentoring, and translational research. The collaborative environment at Dartmouth College and the Norris Cotton
Cancer Center and the strong network of mentors and collaborators provide an ideal environment for me to
complete the research proposed in this application and support my development as a physician scientist."
10850588,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Periodontal disease is a complex inflammatory disease resulting from a dysbiotic community of oral
microbes working together to promote disease. Inflammation associated with disease is initiated by members of
the oral biofilm, but the host response to the microorganisms, including inflammatory reactions by neutrophils, is
primarily responsible for disease progression. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a keystone periodontal pathogen,
utilizes normally commensal bacteria such as Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) for recruitment and growth assistance,
with commensals, as well as keystone-pathogens, both required to promote periodontal disease development.
We have found Pg can alter the ability of macrophages to kill Sg by modifying macrophage activation phenotypes
where Sg survives in M1 macrophages at a higher rate than in M2 macrophages, likely due to differences in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS production is a major component of neutrophils’ defense
against pathogens, where ROS species can be produced both within the phagosome as well as externally.
Neutrophils, like macrophages, are efficient phagocytes that form a powerful line of defense against periodontal
pathogens with an array of defense mechanisms including phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)
production and degranulation. Neutrophils display a variety of phenotypes, including in the oral environment,
however, these phenotypes are not as well described as they are in macrophages. However, a number of
differences in neutrophil response to infections such as periodontal disease have been characterized, including
in ROS production. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to understand how oral bacteria, both
keystone pathogens and normally commensal, affect and respond to neutrophil phenotypes. The role neutrophils
play in innate immunity is well understood throughout the scientific research community as is the importance of
phagosome development to neutrophil mediated killing. Despite these cells being the predominant phagocytes
in periodontal tissue, the influence of a changing phagosome environment on bacteria involved in periodontal
disease has yet to be fully explored in neutrophils. Our central hypothesis is that the survival of Sg and Pg
is dependent on their cooperativity in evading neutrophil defense mechanisms. To investigate this
hypothesis this project aims to (1) investigate how activation of neutrophils, including by Pg, modulates neutrophil
phagosomal maturation dynamics and (2) investigate how Pg and Sg act collaboratively to increase their survival
and inflammation. To achieve these aims a wide variety of techniques, from classical cell biology and
biochemical techniques to advanced microscopy, flow cytometry and image analysis will be used. Completion of
this project will be a valuable step in understanding how the cooperative mechanisms of commensal bacteria
with periodontal pathogens contribute to evading neutrophil-mediated killing. It will also provide the investigator
with diverse mentoring, scientific and professional training, as further outlined in the proposal, to allow a
successful transition to the next stage of an independent research career."
10850595,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. One such
disease is left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC, OMIM604169). The prevalence of LVNC reportedly ranged
from 0.01% to 0.3%, and is higher in patients with heart failure, reportedly 3% to 4%. Genetic inheritance
occurs in at least 30–50% of patients and genes that cause LVNC include the genes that encode sarcomeric or
cytoskeletal proteins and Notch signaling pathway genes. In LVNC, trabeculae fail to undergo compaction.
Trabeculae are sheet-like structures extending from the myocardium to the heart lumen that function to
increase surface area when the coronary circulation system is not developed yet. A lack of trabeculation
causes embryonic lethality, and excess trabeculation causes LVNC and heart failure in humans. Our studies
demonstrated that the orientated cell division and directional migration of cardiomyocytes in the single-cell-
thick myocardium contribute to trabecular initiation by forming a multiple-layer myocardium. Then endocardial
cells (EndCs) invade the multiple layered myocardium and allocate cardiomyocytes to form trabeculae before
E9.5. Many mutations of contractile protein genes correlate with LVNC, and it has been speculated that the
contractile function of the myocardium is required for ventricular compaction; however, no genetic models have
been made to test this hypothesis. The subsequent questions in this field will be what are the mechanisms that
regulate the trabecular formation, de novo trabeculation, and ventricular compaction. Our preliminary data
show that early the Itgb1 gene causes defects in trabecular formation, growth, Notch1
activation and deposition of Fibronectin (Fn), and late deletion causes defects in compaction and Notch1
activation. Furthermore, global deletion of the Itga5 gene or Fn1 gene causes defects in cardiovascular
morphogenesis, but early lethality prevented the study of their functions in trabecular morphogenesis. Our
heart-specific deletion of
preliminary data show that heart-specific Itga6 gene (encoding integrin α6 subunit or α6), which
is expressed specifically in the trabecular zone during compaction, reduces cardiac contractile function.
Therefore, our central hypothesis is that integrin α5β1 and α6β1 have distinct functions in cardiac
morphogenesis with α5β1 regulating trabecular formation and growth, and integrin α6β1 regulating ventricular
contraction and the subsequent compaction and Notch1 activation. There are two aims to test the hypothesis.
Genetic tools such as trabecular specific and compact zone specific Cre lines will be used to test these
hypotheses. We have developed some unique expertise, e.g., single cell lineage tracing assay to study the
mechanisms of trabeculation; ECHO to measure the contractility of embryonic hearts treated with drug or
vehicle; rAAV9 system to rescue the LVNC defect. Completion of the studies will determine whether α5β1 axis
regulates the trabecular formation and α6β1 regulates compaction in vivo and determine whether
enhancement of contraction and activation of Notch1 can rescue the LVNC cardiomyopathy.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is on the rise, increasing by two-thirds in 20 years. Each year 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with OSCC, and 50% of these cases are early stage I/II. Despite the early stage at diagnosis, these patients suffer from significant morbidity, and a 5-year mortality rate of 40%. Treatment for early stage OSCC is highly variable, ranging from just cancer resection, to the addition of adjuvant treatments like elective neck dissection (END), radiotherapy (RT), or chemoradiation (chemoRT). While stage is primarily used to assess risk and assign adjuvant treatment, its prognostic value is low. There is currently no reliable clinical, histologic or molecular marker to determine individual risk in patients within the same cancer stage. There is a need to develop a robust prognostic biomarker to guide treatment and improve survival. We recently defined a mortality risk score for early stage OSCC patients, composed of methylation and clinicopathologic features, using a discovery cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, which has strong predictive performance to identify patients at high risk of death in 5 years. In this application, we propose to validate this methylation biomarker in early stage OSCC patients with known 5-year survival from a multi-institutional retrospective cohort of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. We will combine our validated methylation (molecular) biomarker with clinicopathologic (non-molecular) markers to construct the high-Risk Epigenetic And clinicopathologic Score for Oral caNcer (REASON) score. We hypothesize that this personalized score will accurately predict the risk of 5-year cancer-specific mortality. The study will proceed with three aims. Firstly, we will perform an epigenome wide association study (EWAS) using the EPIC array, to construct and validate the REASON score with a retrospective cohort (cohort 1, n=400) of early stage OSCC patients with known 5-year survival outcome, who underwent cancer resection only. Secondly, we will apply the REASON score to a separate retrospective cohort (cohort 2, n=400) of early stage OSCC patients who underwent adjuvant treatments (i.e., END, RT, chemoRT) in addition to cancer resection. We will determine whether these adjuvant treatments confer a survival advantage in high risk (high REASON score) patients over cancer resection alone. We will also determine whether these adjuvant treatments could be spared in low risk (low REASON score) patients. We will also perform technical validation of the methylation features discovered in the EWAS with MethylCap-Seq (MC-Seq), a robust, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certifiable platform. Lastly, in an exploratory aim, we will prospectively enroll early stage OSCC patients and collect noninvasive brush swabs and cancer tissues. We will determine the concordance of methylation signatures between paired brush swabs and cancer tissues in these patients using MC-Seq, and determine the prognostic performance of the REASON score in this prospective cohort (cohort 3, n=200). This study assembles the largest cohort (n=1000) early stage OSCC patients to date, and is expected to produce a clinically robust mortality risk score."

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect >1% of the population and are comprised of multiple
phenotypes including autism, intellectual disability, and other developmental delays. Over the last
ten years, there has been considerable progress in understand the contribution of rare protein-
coding variants in NDDs. However, the role of rare noncoding variation has been less clear due
to the limited number of individuals with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data previously
available. We were one of the first to identify aggregate enrichment for promoters and enhancers
in the first 516 families assessed by WGS; signals that have now been seen by multiple additional
groups. Currently, we have analyzed ~2,700 families with autism and identified enrichment in a
top enhancer. In Aim 1 of proposed studies we will expand this work to analyze 10,719 families
with NDDs to identify specific noncoding regions using statistical tests to identify enrichment
based on sequence context (fitDNM), enriched clustering of variants (GRUMP), and a
transmission-disequilibrium based test, respectively. We will perform massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRA) to follow up specific noncoding variants in the enriched elements and combine
this with deep phylogenetic assessment using existing and new reference genomes (ACES). Our
recent work suggests that dosage sensitivity is an important characteristic to consider when
testing specific promoters and enhancers for enrichment in NDDs. In Aim 2, we will build a copy
number map from 92,081 individuals, without NDDs, from the Centers for Common Disease
Genomics dataset. We will specifically assess 1,327,879 noncoding regulatory regions for
dosage-sensitivity in the human genome. As in Aim 1, we will follow up identified elements using
MPRA and our ACES phylogenetic workup. The primary goal of proposed studies is to improve
our understanding of noncoding variants in NDDs. We will do this by 1) identifying noncoding
regulatory regions with enrichment of variation in NDDs and 2) developing a dosage sensitivity
map of noncoding regulatory regions to inform studies of NDDs. This unique proposal, with its
mirrored aims, focuses on noncoding variation as opposed to the majority NDD focus on protein-
coding regions and it tests dosage in a large high-quality WGS dataset. This work will be integral
to the genetic understanding of NDDs and the consequences of noncoding variation. It will also
provide key insights into their role in the overall genetic architecture of NDDs."

Despite improvements in overall survival for pediatric cancers, treatment disparities remain for racial/ethnic
minorities compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity are both significantly associated
with decreased overall survival outcomes in childhood sarcomas, brain, and central nervous system tumors.
Thus, there is a large unmet need for reducing racial/ethnic disparities to improve detection, treatment, and
survival in pediatric cancer patients. It is well documented that Hispanic and Black children with cancer are
more than 50 percent less likely to enroll in clinical trials testing cancer treatments than non-Hispanic White
children. Particularly, studies that provide precision oncology approaches vastly underrepresent racial and
ethnic minority populations. Thus, it is imperative to provide precision oncology studies that encompass
children from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, so that meaningful precision data can be collected, and all
individuals may benefit from cancer research breakthroughs and personalized treatments. We propose to
address these problems by adopting, for the first time, a functional precision medicine (FPM) approach for
individual minority patients to understand the genetic, molecular, transcriptomic, and phenotypic properties
which may be particularly important for explaining Hispanic and Black cancer health disparities. We
hypothesize that distinct genetic variance in Hispanic and Black populations is likely to substantially contribute
to variability in drug treatment response and overall survival. Using our robust high throughput ex vivo drug
sensitivity assay (DST), and combining it with mutation analysis, we will be able to create a compendium of
drug responses in individual patients, match actionable mutations with selective targeted therapies, and
clinically apply individual treatment to refractory patients with no alternative options. Hence, we propose the
following aims: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate a functional precision medicine (FPM) approach as a tool to
reduce cancer disparities in children. We intend to expand access of personalized treatment options and
clinical management recommendations to Hispanic and Black pediatric cancer patients based on ex vivo drug
sensitivity testing (DST) and genomic profiling. Specific Aim 2: To uncover novel correlations between genetic
alterations and ex vivo drug responses in minority populations. We will perform multi-omics molecular profiling
and integrate a machine learning platform to uncover novel relationships between molecular alterations and
effective drugs specifically associated with Hispanic and Black pediatric populations. Our study will be the first
of its kind to demonstrate the clinical utility of FPM to improve patient outcomes and reduce or eliminate the
cancer disparities in Hispanic and Black children of South Florida. Our proposed work would also lead to
identifying unique genetic and phenotypic properties associated with minority populations, providing
opportunities for personalized interventions to promote health equity and more effective cancer treatments."

Atherosclerosis arises as a result of excess accumulation of cholesterol within vascular cells, with
macrophages comprising a majority of these lipid-laden foam cells within atherosclerotic lesions. Lipid-lowering
therapies, such as statins, have proven beneficial, but still only benefit a subset of patients. As such, there is
currently a need to develop new treatment options that can treat a larger portion of atherosclerosis patients to
reduce cardiovascular disease mortality. One potential strategy for treating atherosclerosis is to reduce foam
cells by decreasing cholesterol uptake (influx) and/or to promote cholesterol release (efflux) in macrophages.
However, no current therapy targets these mechanisms. Foam cells within atherosclerotic lesions are
developed from too much cholesterol influx without efficient efflux. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an integrin-
associated tyrosine kinase which contributes to vascular cell migration, proliferation, and inflammation. We
have discovered new functions for FAK in the regulation of lipid homeostasis within macrophages. Our
preliminary data revealed that FAK activation following oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) stimulation
was required for foam cell formation via endocytosis of CD36. Additionally, oxLDL increased FAK interaction
with CD36 and Filamin A. Importantly, pharmacological FAK inhibition blocked FAK-CD36-Filamin A interaction
and subsequent foam cell formation, suggesting that the ternary complex may contribute to oxLDL uptake.
More interestingly, FAK inhibition increased expression of cellular lipid sensors peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor g (PPARg) and liver X receptor a (LXRa) resulting in increased transcription of the
cholesterol antiporters ABCG1 and ABCA1. FAK inhibition also increased PPARg and LXRa nuclear
translocation, and this was associated with decreased expression of nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2).
In a new macrophage-specific FAK kinase-dead (KD) mouse model (CSF1R-iCre) on ApoE-/- background, we
observed that FAK-KD mice fed a western diet (WD) showed less foam cell formation and reduced
atherosclerotic lesions. Taken together, our central hypothesis is that FAK inhibition reduces oxLDL uptake via
disruption of FAK-Filamin A-CD36 complex formation while also increasing cholesterol efflux through increased
PPARg and LXRa activation via NCOR2 degradation. To decipher a molecular mechanism in which a two-fold
role of FAK prevents cholesterol uptake as well as enhances efflux in macrophages. Aim 1 will determine FAK
and Filamin A regulation of oxLDL-CD36 uptake in macrophages. Aim 2 will investigate FAK regulation of
cholesterol efflux via PPARg and LXRa activation in foam cells. Aim 3 will evaluate the effect of FAK inhibition
on preventive and therapeutic models of atherosclerosis. The proposed study will shed new insights on the role
of FAK in cholesterol homeostasis in macrophage foam cells and could produce a new treatment option in
atherosclerosis by reducing the foam cells via reduced cholesterol influx and elevated cholesterol efflux."

Efficient sensory processing requires the development of precisely wired circuits. Sensory deficits are common
in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), underscoring the importance of
proper wiring. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying precise sensory circuit wiring and the etiology of sensory
dysfunction in NDDs remain poorly understood, precluding development of effective therapies. To address these
gaps in knowledge, we have utilized the visual circuitry of the mouse superior colliculus (SC) to elucidate
fundamental mechanisms of circuit wiring and uncovered novel sub-circuit-specific visual deficits in FXS mice
(Fmr1-/y). Specifically, we will focus on the mechanisms by which topographic maps of space encoded by retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye and Layer 5 neurons in primary visual cortex (L5V1) are formed in the SC.
Previous studies by us and others suggest that each stage of visual circuit development in the SC - RGC

mechanisms underlying each are poorly understood. Based on our previous and preliminary data, we propose
a model in which the activity-dependent mechanisms underlying each stage of visual circuit development in the
SC are distinct. We will test this model in three specific aims, leveraging a unique combination of cutting-edge
techniques and novel genetic mouse models. In Aim 1, we will test previously developed computational models
of L5V1 alignment by manipulating neuronal activity in the SC (Aim 1A) or retina (Aim 1B) and evaluating

roles of Fmr1 in the development and maintenance of visual map alignment (Aim 2A) and maturation of visual
function in the SC (Aim 2B), as well as the region-specific roles in each (Aim 2C). In Aim 3, we will build on our
exciting preliminary data, suggesting that visual experience and Fmr1 may interact to regulate the maintenance
and/or maturation of visual circuits in the SC. To test this possibility, we will determine the requirement of visual
experience for visual circuit organization and function in control (Aim 3A) and Fmr1-/y (Aim 3B) mice. These
studies will be complemented with those exposing mice to a visually-enriched environment to test the possibility
that it may rescue deficits observed in Fmr1-/y mice (Aim 3C). These studies will uncover fundamental
mechanisms of sensory circuit formation and establish a platform for elucidating the molecular underpinnings of
activity-dependent wiring. Further, we will gain critical insight into the etiology of sensory dysfunction in FXS, the

Chromatin-associated proteins are a major class of genes mutated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
intellectual disability (ID). These genetic data indicate the importance of gene regulation for brain development,
however a significant challenge for the field is to determine how disruptions of chromatin regulators may
converge on specific biological processes in developing neurons. To address this challenge, here we focus in
detail on the biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which ID-associated frameshift mutations in the linker
histone H1.4 result in impaired neuronal development. As a histone, H1.4 is a direct component of chromatin;
thus, studying how mutations in this gene impair neural development offers the opportunity to gain specific
biochemical insight into mechanisms of chromatin regulation in neurons. Rahman Syndrome (RMNS) is a rare,
genetic form of ID caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in H1-4, which encodes histone H1.4. All
RMNS-associated mutations in H1-4 are small insertions or deletions that create a shared C-terminal
frameshift. Genetic data indicate that the mutant protein likely functions in a dominant negative or neomorphic
manner to lead to RMNS phenotypes, but the biochemical and cellular consequences of expressing RMNS
mutant histone H1.4 are poorly understood. We have found that expressing RMNS mutant histone H1.4 in rat
hippocampal neurons leads to the disruption of synaptic gene expression and neuronal firing. We hypothesize
that RMNS mutant H1.4 disrupts chromatin architecture in differentiating neurons to impair gene expression
programs that are required for synapse development and neuronal function. To determine how the RMNS
mutation of histone H1.4 leads to aberrant transcription and to evaluate the consequences for brain
development, we will use both biochemical and molecular genetic approaches in the developing mouse brain
and in human neurons. In Aim 1, we will build a foundation for these studies by using leading edge proteomic
and molecular genetic methods to characterize the expression, regulation, and chromatin distribution of histone
H1.4 over the course of neuronal differentiation in the mouse. To determine how RMNS mutations disrupt
synaptic gene expression in brain development, in Aim 2 we will use a novel in vivo protein tagging strategy to
identify proteins that interact with wildtype versus RMNS mutant H1.4. Finally, to determine how RMNS
mutations disrupt chromatin regulation, in Aim 3 we will study generate RMNS mutant H1.4 expressing iPSC-
derived neurons for biochemical histone H1 proteomics and gene expression analyses. We will then use a
novel method for low-input three-dimensional chromatin conformation capture to test the hypothesis that
RMNS mutant histone H1.4 disrupts higher level chromatin architecture. These studies will advance knowledge
of the causes of brain developmental abnormalities in RMNS, and they will contribute to understanding of the
specific mechanisms of linker histone dependent chromatin regulation that are key for neuronal maturation."

Experience-driven changes to chromatin architecture help activate gene transcription programs that allow
animals to learn and develop adaptive behaviors. Yet the forces that remodel chromatin in response to neuronal
activity remain obscure. Torsion from DNA supercoiling injects free energy into the DNA and has the potential to
organize chromatin, yet how dynamic supercoiling distributes and acts within the neuronal genome are poorly
understood. RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and DNA topoisomerases generate and resolve supercoils,
respectively, and their concerted actions affect dynamic supercoiling distribution. However, to what extent
supercoils propagate from the sites of RNAP activity, and how chromatin structure affects supercoil distribution
remain unexplored. Furthermore, while supercoiling is a ubiquitous feature of DNA topology, how torsional free
energy from supercoiling affects chromatin structure and gene activity patterns is also unknown.
To address these issues, psoralen crosslinking and sequencing (TMP-seq) was recently performed to map the
distribution of underwound (negatively supercoiled) DNA at high resolution in cultured mouse cortical neurons
under basal conditions. Additionally, new methods were developed to map genome-wide sites of catalytically
engaged topoisomerases (TOP1cc-seq and TOP2Bcc-seq). These studies revealed that supercoils transmit
widely (> 200 kb) from the sites of active RNAPs, while topoisomerases only act at selective locations to resolve
supercoils. These data indicate that torsional free energy from supercoiling could be widely available to influence
chromatin structure. Based on these results, this project will perform TMP-seq at various times following neuronal
stimulation and assess how activity-driven supercoiling distributes within the genome. Additionally, TOP1cc-seq
and TOP2Bcc-seq will be performed under the same conditions to determine how topoisomerases are utilized
to regulate dynamic supercoiling in stimulated neurons. While supercoils generally distribute freely within
chromatin, preliminary data indicate that they also accrue at specific nucleosome configurations, particularly at
active promoters with broad H3K4me3 distributions and in regions flanking H3K27me3-rich chromatin.
Intriguingly, a broadening of H3K4me3 has been observed following neuronal stimulation in vivo, suggesting that
specific stimulus-driven epigenetic changes could “constrain” dynamic supercoils. The proposed research will
test this idea by assessing how knockdown of WDR5, which mediates H3K4 methylation, and expression of
JMJD3, which erases H3K27me3, affect neuronal activity-dependent supercoiling patterns. Finally,
topoisomerase inhibitors and locus-specific modulators of DNA supercoiling will be used to perturb supercoiling
patterns in stimulated neurons, and chromosome conformation capture (Micro-C), ATAC-seq, and nascent
transcription analysis (fastGRO) will performed to test the idea that dynamic supercoiling has a causal role in
neuronal activity-driven chromatin reconfiguration. Together, these efforts will provide new insights into how DNA
mechanics regulates neuronal functions during development and disease."
10856411,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background. Agents that inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling are the standard-of-care treatment for
prostate cancer (PC) patients. Unfortunately, essentially all patients develop resistance to AR targeting
therapies (ART). We previously found robust B7-H3 (CD276) expression in metastatic PC patients resistant to
ART. In our recent phase II clinical trial, we found that B7-H3 targeting agents improved clinical outcomes for
66% of PC patients for reasons unknown. We separately examined mechanistic regulators of B7-H3
expression with computational and laboratory approaches. We preliminary found that B7-H3 expression was
regulated by AR and its co-regulators (FOXA1, HOXB13) at four transcription regulatory sites. Altogether, we
hypothesize that AR activity regulates B7-H3 expression and thus response to B7-H3 targeted therapies.
Specific Aims and Study Design. We propose to determine mechanisms of B7-H3 expression by examining
the necessity of all B7-H3 transcription factors and regulator sites in PC (AIM 1). This includes the AR co-
regulators HOXB13 and FOXA1, as well as the four B7-H3 enhancer sites that were hyperactivated in
metastatic PC compared to primary disease. We will also determine how androgens or ARTs, which are used
clinically, impact the susceptibility of ART resistant tumor cells towards B7-H3 targeted therapies (AIM 2). We
will utilize single cell RNA-sequencing platforms to identify the genes and signaling programs associated with
response to B7-H3 therapies in single cells. Lastly, we aim to identify the clinical and molecular characteristics
of the PC patients with predicted response to B7-H3 targeted therapies (AIM 3). We will use computer-
modeling tools to characterize the somatic changes and clinical features of patients that previously responded
to a B7-H3 targeted therapy. We will then apply this response signature to ~7000 additional tumors to identify
significant clinical and molecular features that are predictive of response.
Anticipated Outcomes. We anticipate that the candidate transcription factors and regulatory sites of B7-H3
will control B7-H3 expression in PC tumors. Further, such changes in cell surface B7-H3 expression will greatly
impact the tumor-forming capacity and ART resistance. We also anticipate that clinical forms of androgens or
ART will alter B7-H3 expression and thus impact response to the B7-H3 targeted therapies. Lastly, we expect
to identify many of the additional clinical and molecular features associated with B7-H3 expressing tumors.
Future Directions and Impact. We anticipate this study will uncover mechanistic insights of B7-H3 expression
and a further understanding of PC patient response to B7-H3 targeted therapies. We shall also identify the
mechanisms by which B7-H3 regulates ART resistance, tumor formation, and cell signaling. Lastly, our findings
will impact patient stratification methods in the upcoming B7-H3 clinical trials, which will be essential to the
development and deployment of future B7-H3 therapeutics in PC patients."

The goal of this center is to understand how gene expression and function within neuronal subtypes regulates
neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable decision-making and behavioral
adaptations. The Center will address this topic through in-depth biological investigations of Trio and Syngap1,
two regulators of GTPase signaling in the brain that are also causally linked to NDDs. A defining feature of the
Center is that these genes will be studied at multiple levels of neural function - molecular, cellular, synaptic,
circuit, behavior. In keeping with the theme of the center, Project 4 will assess the function of these genes at
the highest levels of brain function – how they regulate the functional integration of neuronal subtypes into
circuits required for behavioral adaptations. Project 4 will address the unifying themes in the Center by
measuring neuronal subtype functional circuit integration, circuit plasticity, and behavioral adaptions, by
utilizing three classes of mouse perturbation models that target expression or function of these genes. The first
set of perturbation models will assess how the cell-autonomous expression of each gene -- within unique
neural subtypes and at different periods of development -- impact cortical circuit function and behaviors these
circuits are known to guide. The second set of models will express point mutations within known functional
domains of the proteins encoded by these genes. Finally, the third set of models will include acute and/or
chronic pharmacological manipulations of Trio and Syngap1 GEF/GAP domains. The impact of this research
is that it will highlight, when, where, and how these genes regulate circuit assembly and circuit plasticity
required for transforming sensory signals into decisions that drive behavior."
10896246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder affecting approximately 36,000 children in the United
States, approximately 90% of whom are Black. The disease is characterized by recurrent, severe pain crises
which result in high rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, as well as the American Society of Hematology, have endorsed
pain management guidelines regarding the timeliness of care for children presenting with these acute pain
crises. These evidence based guidelines are infrequently followed, resulting in increased pain and
hospitalizations. In additional to other barriers to following the guideline, structural racism has been proposed
as a significant contributor and the New England Journal of Medicine recently called for the institution of SCD-
specific pain management protocols to combat structural racism and reduce time to opioid administration.
Our long-term goal is to improve the care and health outcomes of children with acute painful vaso-occlusive
crisis treated in the emergency department. Our overall aim is to test a care pathway using multifaceted
implementation strategies to increase guideline adherent care for children in the emergency department with
acute painful vaso-occlusive crisis. Our primary aims are: 1) To compare the primary implementation outcomes
of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation for the care pathway for treatment of children with acute painful vaso-
occlusive crisis in the emergency department, between control and intervention groups and 2) To compare the
primary clinical outcomes of guideline adherent care for opioid dose timing, hospitalization rates, and pain
scores for the care pathway for the treatment of children with acute painful vaso-occlusive crises in the
emergency department between control and intervention groups. We will test these aims using a randomized,
multicenter stepped wedge design to conduct a type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the care
pathway. Our proposal will institute the care pathway across seven emergency departments with the goal of
improving guideline adherent care for children with SCD presenting with an acute pain crisis, thereby improving
pain, decreasing hospitalizations and improving quality of life for this vulnerable population."
10855205,"Abstract
Freezing of gait (FOG) is characterized by episodes during which an individual is unable to step, despite
intending to do so, and is a common cause of falls, decreased mobility, and increased morbidity in people with
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Effective treatment for FOG remains elusive, due to a lack of understanding of the
complex underlying pathophysiology. The expression and factors contributing to FOG are highly
heterogeneous across individuals, however, a common feature is that episodes are predominantly triggered
during movement-state transitions (e.g. initiating walking or turning)4,5. Impaired transitions leading to FOG
typically occur when the change in movement-state is self-initiated (uncued), but when the same transition is
cued by an external sensory stimulus, movement execution is improved, and the incidence and duration of
FOG is markedly reduced. FOG may be caused by abnormal communication between subcortical systems
controlling posture and balance (e.g. vestibulo- and reticulospinal systems) and cortico-fugal systems driving
the initiation of the intended action (e.g. stepping). Currently, the mechanisms contributing to impaired
self-initiated movement transitions in people with PD and FOG, and how they are improved by external cues,
are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the capacity to downregulate the communication (coherence) of
systems controlling posture and balance during self-initiated transitions from one movement state (standing) to
another (walking) is impaired in people with FOG, and that sensory cues ameliorate FOG by restoring
transition-related modulation of posture/balance systems. This hypothesis will be tested using biomechanical
and neurophysiological measures to examine the dynamics of the vestibulo-postural (Aim 1), cortico-cortical
and cortico-muscular (Aim 2), and cortico-basal ganglia (Aims 3 and 4) systems during cued and uncued
posture-locomotion transitions in PD, with and without FOG, and controls. Aim 1 will examine the
vestibulo-postural system in FOG by measuring the dynamic changes in coherence between vestibular input
(electrical vestibular stimulation) and the ground reaction forces controlling balance. Aim 2 will utilize
high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to examine movement-related
cortical potentials and cortico-cortical and cortico-muscular coherence. Aim 3 will use EEG and local field
potential (LFP) recordings from implanted Medtronic PerceptTM deep brain stimulators (DBS) to examine the
interaction of the globus pallidus and cortex (cortico-pallidal coherence). Aims 1-3 will utilize standardized gait
initiation paradigms that may or may not provoke freezing. Aim 4 will use wearable sensors and a
FOG-provoking course, involving multiple posture/gait transitions, to wirelessly capture LFPs associated with
FOG episodes in participants with PD with the PerceptTM DBS system. This project will provide insight into the
mechanisms and neurological biomarkers of FOG, which will be critical for the development of interventions to
reduce the incidence and severity of FOG, reduce falls, and improve the quality of life of people with PD."
10855464,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are stem cells that replenish the entire suite of blood cells needed throughout
adult life, and are an important source for cell replacement therapies and disease modeling studies. The overall
goal of our research is to understand how to derive these important cells, in a petri dish, from human pluripotent
stem cells (hPSCs). While the signal requirements for this remain unclear, we have recently uncovered a novel
differentiation approach, yielding CD34+ progenitors that harbor both transcriptional and functional properties
that are similar to nascent HSCs. This methodology employs stage-specific retinoic acid (RA) signaling, and
yields a population of cells capable of homing to recipient bone marrow, and give rise to differentiated progeny.
We hypothesize that this population is unique, and a precursor to the HSC that requires additional signals during
its specification, to confer self-renewal capacity. We will test this hypothesis across 2 Specific Aims. In Aim 1,
we will characterize the transcriptional and signal dependencies for the development of these cells, and
understand the role of differential splicing in a critical transcription factor. In Aim 2, we will define the translational
potential of the lymphoid cells that can be obtained from hPSCs, via RA-dependent and RA-independent
mechanisms. The objective of these studies is to understand the development and regulation of HSCs from
hPSCs, and whether HSC-independent lymphoid cells may be a viable alternative source for adoptive
immunotherapeutics. This is of fundamental importance to both basic and translational biology, and the insights
generated from these studies will have clinical implications. Our unique cellular and molecular tools, combined
with our expertise in hematopoiesis, stem cell biology and bioinformatics puts us in an ideal position to make a
significant impact in this field."
10855938,"Expression of activated forms of the multifunctional type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII)
were recently demonstrated to confer robust retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neuroprotection in mouse models of
optic nerve injury and NMDA excitotoxicity, making CaMKII a leading target for therapeutic intervention in
glaucoma. However, new preliminary data show that expression of constitutively active CaMKII (caCaMKII) not
only promotes RGC survival after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, but also suppresses axon regeneration. As
axon regeneration will be a necessary feature of any potential treatment for glaucoma that would restore
vision, a better understanding of the mechanisms how caCaMKII confers neuroprotection will be important for
the successful development of CaMKII-directed therapeutics. We hypothesize that the phosphorylated
effectors driving CaMKII-dependent neuroprotection and axon growth repression are different. In this
project, we will derive strategies that promote RGC survival, but not prevent axon regeneration by investigating
how differential compartmentation and activation confer CaMKII phosphorylation of relevant effectors and their
respective cellular processes. In particular, we hypothesize that induction of CREB and/or NF-κB gene
expression by nuclear CaMKII and potentially CaMKIV is required for RGC survival, while as an off-target
effect, caCaMKII expression elsewhere in the cell suppresses axon growth. Specific Aim 1: The role of
endogenous CaMKII in RGC neuroprotection and axon suppression. In this Aim, we will use knock-out
mice to test whether endogenous CaMKII and CaMKIV expression is required for maintenance of basal RGC
survival or for neuroprotection after ONC. In addition, we will test whether CaMKII knock-out will promote axon
regeneration. By AAV-mediated expression of CaMKII-activating peptides, we will differentiate between
alternative mechanisms for caCaMKII’s neuroprotective effects: replacement of insufficiently expressed
CaMKII or activation of insufficiently active endogenous CaMKII. In parallel to assay for neuroprotection, we
will study the activity of CaMKII in vivo by transpupillary imaging of a CaMKII fluorescent reporter. Specific
Aim 2: Compartment-specific caCaMKII neuroprotection and suppression of axon regeneration. We will
test whether exogenously expressed caCaMKIIα fusion proteins localized to different intracellular domains
selectively promote neuroprotection or suppress axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Conversely, we will
test whether localized expression of CaMKII inhibitory peptides will rescue caCaMKII-suppressed axon
regeneration without inhibiting neuroprotection. Specific Aim 3: CaMKII-dependent RGC gene expression
conferring neuroprotection. We hypothesize that activation of CaMKII signaling confers neuroprotection by
induction of CREB- and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. scRNA-seq and scATAC-Seq will be used to
identify genes and regulatory elements associated with neuroprotection, while Creb1 and Rela RGC-specific
knock-out mice will be studied for RGC survival and axon regeneration."
10856315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deviations from the order or timing of developmental events often result in abnormalities. Understanding how
such well-regulated process can remain plastic, that is, be able to flexibly change depending on the environment
is an important question. Social signals exchanged by members of the same species constitute a prominent
class of environmental effects that can alter development. A representative example of such social effects is the
observation that female mammals attain sexual maturity faster if exposed to adult males. We found that males
of the classic model species C. elegans also excrete signals that hasten sexual maturation of the opposite sex.
Our preliminary studies revealed the following features of this process. (A) Developmental acceleration occurs
late indicating that the onset of adulthood is specifically hastened. (B) Developmental acceleration involves faster
progression of events in multiple cell lineages suggesting that it is systemic. (C) Developmental acceleration is
accompanied by appropriately accelerated organismal growth. (D) Males excrete small-molecule signals that
belong to two distinct chemical classes. Either molecule alone can accelerate development implying redundancy.
(E) Sensory neurons are required for acceleration, suggesting that they may detect the acceleration-inducing
pheromones. (F) In addition to causing accelerated growth and development, these pheromones also alter
behaviors involved in obtaining food, presumably to provide additional resources to sustain faster development.
These findings serve as a foundation for our research program that will pursue the following goals. (1) Taking
advantage of the unique strengths of C. elegans as a model system, delineate neuronal circuits required to
accelerate development in response to pheromones. These circuits are expected to consist of multiple neurons
that signal to each other via specific transmitters and receptors. Major impact of this work will be the identification
of ways in which the nervous system non-autonomously regulates organismal growth and development. The
promise of this approach is the ability to alter the rate of development and growth by opto- and chemogenetic
manipulation of specific neurons. (2) To identify components of signaling pathways that are required for
acceleration, particularly those that coordinate development and growth. (3) An unexpected theme emerging
from our work is that regulation of developmental events and appropriate behaviors are coupled because both
rely on the same neuronal circuits. We are using machine-vision to simultaneously monitor behavior,
development, and growth to test this hypothesis. Our quantitative and innovative approach bridges concepts and
tools from several distinct fields. We aim to provide an undertesting of developmental processes enriched by
considerations of social interactions that are emerging as a major contributor to inter-individual developmental
variation, including as possible causes of disease states."
10856381,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) can affect multiple organ systems and result in functional
impairment. Neurologic PASC symptoms (neuro-PASC) including cognitive impairment, headache, and
neuropathy are among the most debilitating. Structural and functional brain changes – as defined by changes in
cerebral blood flow, white and gray matter morphology, and neurocognitive performance – have been observed
post-COVID and have variably been associated with neuro-PASC. Data from our group and others have
implicated virus persistence, coagulation dysfunction, and inflammation as potential causes. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein drives downstream clot pathology,
microcirculatory dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, leading to damage to neuronal tissues and resulting in
neuro-PASC. To test this mechanistic model, we will leverage one of the longest prospective studies of Long
COVID (Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus cohort; LIINC; NCT04362150), which includes
detailed clinical data and biological specimens on 700 individuals following mostly mild-to-moderate COVID-19,
over 250 of whom report neuro-PASC symptoms. In Aim 1, we will use banked specimens and data from
individuals followed for up to 4 years post-COVID to conduct both a cross-sectional analysis and a longitudinal
study of three well-defined groups: (1) neuro-PASC (n=200), (2) non-neuro-PASC (n=200), and (3) fully
recovered (n=100). We will determine whether spike persistence is present among those with neuro-PASC,
whether it drives fibrin dysregulation and microclotting, and whether it causes systemic and/or neurologic
inflammation. In a subset, we will determine whether the primary determinants of neuro-PASC emerge during
the acute phase (first 10 days) and how they evolve over 4 years. In Aim 2, we will conduct a prospective,
intensive characterization of individuals with and without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 persistence (n=75 per group).
These cohorts will be characterized clinically by neurocognitive testing and a suite of state-of-the-art MRI studies.
Lumbar punctures and gut biopsies will be performed. Multiple biologic studies will be conducted, including
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue reservoirs, characterization of
microclots, and assessment of inflammation. We will determine the effect of spike persistence on neurocognitive
performance and on MRI parameters of cerebral blood flow, neuroinflammation, axonal loss, and tissue atrophy.
Finally, we will determine whether spike persistence drives changes in CSF profiles including fibrin dysregulation,
neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. In Aim 3, we will study specimens from a separately
funded randomized trial of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (AER002; NCT05877508) to test whether
disruption of tissue reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen in the post-acute phase alters the pathway proposed
in our model. Our proposed studies provide the unprecedented ability to examine in detail how virus persistence,
coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction cause neurologic injury and result in neuro-PASC."

Mutations in the S1R are causative of ALS and the degree of loss of function in S1R protein

S1R activation impacts pathways that are known to be implicated in ALS, i.e., nucleocytoplasmic
transport, protein quality control, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial function, and
autophagy. Riluzole, edaravone, and PB-TURSO, the current standard-of-care medications for
ALS in the US, offer only modest clinical benefit and are not known to act through the S1R.
Nuedexta, a non-selective S1R agonist, is approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect and
has been shown to improve bulbar function in a subset of people living with ALS.
Pridopidine (Prilenia Therapeutics) is a potent and highly selective small molecule S1R
agonist. The S1R shows high expression throughout the brain, particularly in brainstem motor
nuclei. In the G93A SOD1 ALS mouse model, pridopidine modified disease progression.
The safety and efficacy of pridopidine are currently being tested inthe HEALEY ALS Platform
Trial. The trial design includes an efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT) followed by an open
label extension (OLE). The RCT portion of the pridopidine regimen enrolled 162 ALS participants.
While it did not reach the primary endpoint, it showed trends toward beneficial effects of
pridopidine on several outcome measures, with the greatest identifiable effect on functional
scores, quantitative motor speech, and neurofilament light levels in early and faster progressing
participants. The OLE is ongoing. A second efficacy trial targeting a selected population of people
with ALS is being planned. Unfortunately, a large segment of the real-world ALS population won’t
be eligible to enroll in this second efficacy study due to the restrictive eligibility criteria.
The current proposal is an expanded access protocol (EAP) of pridopidine in 200
individuals with ALS who are ineligible for clinical trials. Participants would receive
pridopidine for up to 24 months, while the OLE and the planned second efficacy trial are ongoing.
This study will provide real- world data by evaluating the effects of the drug in a population
that is broader than the one included in the efficacy trials and by collecting safety, clinical,
and biological outcomes over longer term exposure."

Salmonellae are Enterobacteriaceae that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans and animals, including
enteric (typhoid) fever and gastroenteritis. Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhi (S. Typhi), results in a life-threatening systemic disease that is responsible for significant morbidity and
mortality annually worldwide. The disease is endemic in many parts of Africa, including Kenya. 1-5% of
individuals infected with S. Typhi become chronic carriers with the gallbladder (GB) as the site of persistence.
S. Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen, therefore asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for
further spread of disease. We have demonstrated that gallstones (GSs) aid in the development and
maintenance of GB carriage in a mouse model and in humans, serving as a substrate to which salmonellae
attach and form a protective biofilm. However, the epidemiology regarding the development of Salmonella
chronic carriage and spread of the disease from both acute and chronic carriers is poorly understood. In this
proposal, we intend to prospectively study a population in a typhoid fever endemic region in Kenya to better
understand: (1) genomics, antibiotic resistance and biofilm phenotypes of the S. Typhi strains causing typhoid
fever and chronic carriage, (2) the linkage of GSs to the establishment of chronic carriers, and (3) the local
epidemiology and geospatial distribution of typhoid fever in the target urban community. Modeling the data
gathered will allow a greater understanding of the strains causing acute and chronic infection and the
associated epidemiologic factors contributing to S. Typhi spread in a community. This will also help healthcare
practitioners better treat and predict the likelihood of disease transmission as well as asymptomatic carriage."

The Southern and Central Africa International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR),
consisting of the Tropical Diseases Research Centre and Macha Research Trust in Zambia and the Johns
Hopkins Malaria Research Institute in the United States, has conducted innovative, applied research to
understand the epidemiology of malaria across diverse transmission settings. However, progress towards
malaria control and elimination has stalled across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa despite continued
and intensified investment, including in Zambia. Novel approaches are needed to better understand
epidemiological, entomological, and transmission patterns to strengthen malaria surveillance systems and
guide interventions and strategies. Longstanding studies like the ICEMRs provide a unique opportunity to
address outstanding scientific questions, explore novel data streams, and integrate research with
programmatic efforts to translate scientific knowledge into practice. In this third funding cycle of the ICEMRs,
we will leverage the deep understanding we have gained over the past 13 years to explore innovative data
streams, metrics, analytics, and surveillance tools to fill knowledge gaps, improve strategic decision-making,
and better equip the Zambian National Malaria Elimination Programme and local research institutions to
achieve the country’s malaria elimination goals across high, medium, and low transmission settings beyond
the duration of this ICEMR program. The theme of this ICEMR renewal application is to harness innovation to
transform malaria surveillance into key interventions, derived from the World Health Organization’s Global
Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030. These innovative approaches will include the use of crowd-
sourced data, volatilomics, machine learning forecasting models, data visualization tools at small spatial
scales for local use, and periodic serological surveillance using residual blood specimens. By harnessing
innovation and exploring novel data streams, malaria metrics, analytical methods, surveillance tools, and
their applications to fill existing knowledge gaps and inform strategies, we hope to transform malaria
surveillance into key interventions in collaboration with the Zambian National Malaria Elimination
Programme, the President’s Malaria Initiative, and other partners to achieve national and regional malaria
control and elimination goals."
10837565,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Burkina Faso ICEMR Research Project 1
Burkina Faso has the 6th highest mortality and morbidity from malaria despite aggressive multifaceted control
interventions including rapid diagnosis and treatment, bed nets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventive
treatment in pregnancy, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention. While Plasmodium falciparum continues to be
the focus of control programs and most clinical and epidemiologic studies, our group, and others, have gathered
data from several settings across sub-Saharan Africa, including from Burkina Faso, demonstrating a notable
prevalence of non-falciparum mono- and mixed infections that is persistent and robust. In particular, Plasmodium
malariae, with its longer 72-hour life cycle, and P. ovale, with its dormant hypnozoite stages, both tend to maintain
low parasite densities, go undetected with current point-of-care diagnostics, and are undertreated due, in part,
to a lack of evidence regarding their sensitivity to currently utilized antimalarials. In addition, due to insensitivity
of current diagnostics, our understanding of their dynamics and multi-species interactions in the host remain
largely unstudied using state-of-the-art molecular tools. Through our project, and synergy with the rest of the
Burkina Faso ICEMR, we will leverage a novel surveillance approach, known as xenosurveillance, to first
characterize the epidemiology of all human species via testing of mosquito blood meals. Following this initial
spatiotemporal analysis of parasite and vector diversity throughout three distinct ecozones in Burkina Faso, we
will select a subset of sites in each zone to conduct longitudinal household-based cohorts over three years. The
goal of these studies will be to carefully characterize the epidemiology and clinical impact of mono- and mixed
species infections and to understand the performance of current diagnostics for detecting the symptomatic and
asymptomatic reservoir of infection. We will utilize samples from these cohort to further elucidate the population
structure of circulating Plasmodium species, and characterize their ex vivo and genetic resistance profiles to
current and promising antimalarials. Our ultimate goal is to create a sustainable multidisciplinary malaria
surveillance system across the Sahel, Sudan-Sahel, and Sudan regions of Burkina Faso that simultaneously
characterizes vector, host and parasite epidemiology, with explicit inclusion of all human parasite species in
circulation, and through synergy with Project 2 of the ICEMR, to characterize the role of primary and secondary
vectors in perpetuating this complex multi-species malaria transmission cycle."
10837566,"Project Summary / Abstract – Burkina Faso ICEMR Project 2
Malaria control has been stagnating in Burkina Faso for years, including in vector control efforts. Insecticide
resistance is widespread and modest, or inapparent malaria vector control has been achieve even from the
deployment of next generation IRS and ITNs. To begin to reverse these trends, a reassessment of malaria
vector bionomics and parasite transmission by mosquitoes in Burkina Faso is necessary, and the key goal of
this Research Project 2 of the Burkina Faso ICEMR. Central to the issues is the diversity in ecozones within
the country that vary in climate and vector diversity, from the northernmost Sahelian ecozone with a short but
intense 2-3 month transmission season driven mostly by Anopheles coluzzii, to the southern Sudanian
ecozone with a long rainy season lasting 5-6 months, extremely high human biting rates and sporozoite rates
in vectors, persistent low levels of transmission during the dry season, and numerous vector species including
An. gambiae s.s., An. coluzzi , An. funestus, An. nili, in rural regions and An. arabiensis in urban areas such as
the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. This diverse set of highly competent and seasonally abundant vector species tend
to occupy specific niches across ecological zones and vary in abundance across landscapes (rural village,
towns and cities, migrant/artisanal gold mining camps) and seasons with different larval water sources. The
variable spatiotemporal clustering of vectors, each vector species’ insecticide resistance status and their
diverse and adaptable blood feeding habits and behaviors (e.g. endophily vs. exophily and endophagy vs.
exophagy) have resulted in their resistance to indoor-applied vector control measures. New evidence from our
RIMDAMAL II trial showing that An. gambiae s.l. preferentially transmits Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
sporozoites and An. funestus preferentially transmits P. ovale (Po) sporozoites likely increases the
spatiotemporal heterogeneity and duration of human infections as does ours and others’ data showing
antimalarials and sub-lethal insecticide exposure (including ivermectin) can influence sporogony outcomes.
Our objectives in this project are to assess the natural vector bionomics and parasite transmission across
spatio-temporal gradients in Burkina Faso in Aim 1, and to perform laboratory experiments of parasite
transmission to validate our field findings in Aim 2, which will use natural parasite infections and mosquitoes
with wild-type genetics, and also expose the infected mosquitoes to sub-lethal insecticide concentrations or
drugs that the vectors are likely to encounter during the extrinsic incubation period in the field."

 Since its inception in 1991, the Society for Prevention Research (SPR) has galvanized the growth and
relevance of the field of prevention science. SPR has played a central role in prevention science’s identity
formation as a self-standing discipline and professionalization of the field. SPR strives to improve the science
of prevention intervention across all dimensions of behavioral, mental and physical health. By fostering the
development of new methodologies and statistical tools, SPR promotes knowledge across time with
longitudinal studies and prevention trials. The National Prevention Strategy, an important component of the
Affordable Health Care Act, was adopted as a way of addressing the problem of preventable causes of illness
and death and elevating prevention as an important focus for the country. The importance of prevention is
further underscored by the fact that of the top 10 leading causes of death, seven are behaviorally based and
preventable: tobacco use, poor diet and physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes,
firearm use, unsafe/unprotected sexual behavior, and illicit drug use. These behavioral problems, if not
prevented, can make their presence felt during the life course and lead to morbidity and mortality.
 SPR’s Annual Meeting fills an important role in promoting prevention science as a transdisciplinary field,
bringing together scientists to promote cross-fertilization of theory, methods, and intervention with the goal of
building the science of effective strategies for health promotion and prevention. The meeting features science
that directly addresses a number of critical needs raised in the NIH Roadmap Science of Behavior Change
Meeting, including (1) the use of multilevel approaches and understanding the effects of environmental
contexts; (2) the use of approaches that target multiple outcomes and behaviors; (3) research informed by a
developmental perspective, (4) research to better understand the mechanisms underlying behavior change;
and (5) research on the development, dissemination, and use of innovative methods. Further, the meeting and
SPR’s Strategic Plan have synergy with many NIH initiatives including data science, eliminating health
disparities, and translating evidence-based prevention programs into practice settings. Consistent with
SPR’s strategic goals, the aims of this proposed R13 application are to: Aim 1. Use the Annual Meeting to
further develop a centrally integrated scientific forum for the exchange of new concepts, methods, and results
from prevention research and related fields; Aim 2. Support the development of the next generation of
prevention scientists through training, career building, and leadership development; and Aim 3. Ensure that the
scientific developments emanating from the Annual Meeting have maximum reach and impact on public health."

 We propose to purchase a new Mediso nanoScan preclinical SPECT-CT scanner at Case Western
Reserve University (CWRU). This new SPECT-CT system will restore the preclinical SPECT-CT capability in
Cleveland for the first time since the failure of our last system before the pandemic, and will efficiently
synergize our extensive preclinical radionuclide imaging research programs to support 20 major users with
research in a wide range of areas including development of novel theranostic agents, animal models of
diseases, new therapeutic strategies, effective anti-viral therapy and exciting immunotherapies. The proposed
system will not only reinstitute SPECT-CT scanning to our regional institutions, and also provide opportunities
to scan larger animals (e.g., marmosets, ferrets, woodchucks, rabbits, etc.), and animal models with infectious
diseases using a BSL-3 compatible sealed imaging chambers, in addition to the rodents. Overall, this system
provides the capability to support a broad set basic science research throughout Northeast Ohio.
 The nanoScan system includes: 1) a 4-headed SPECT subsystem with 3/8” NaI crystal and fully digitized
detectors; 2) multi-focus, multi-size, multi-pinhole apertures in addition to the parallel hole LEUHR collimators;
3) CT subsystem (80W/1000µA) with standard QC phantom set; 4) multiple software licenses allowing efficient
SPECT-CT image analysis and visualization for multiple users at a time; and 5) an animal monitoring,
respiratory gating, and temperature control to keep the animal stable during imaging. Additional options
requested with this new SPECT-CT system include sealed, BSL-3 compatible imaging chambers to specifically
provide support for multiple users. This new preclinical SPECT-CT capability will be available to all regional
investigators and will be operated by the Imaging Research Core at CWRU which is an integral component of
multiple research centers at CWRU including the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCI P30CA043703),
the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (NIDDK P30 DK097948), the Clinical and Translational Science
Collaborative (NCATS UL1 TR002548), the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, and the Center for Modular
Manufacturing of Structural Tissues. This ongoing support for the Imaging Research Core is in addition to the
direct institutional support of $148,500 to partially offset the cost for the extended warranty. An advisory
committee with highly experienced imaging and therapy faculty at CWRU and an external institution will
oversee the organization and usage of the system and recommend policies to maintain system performance
and maximize utilization."

Through the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, Veterans and their families who are
experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless can receive of financial support and other
services from private non-profit organizations with the goal of stabilizing their housing. The impact on Veteran
housing, healthcare cost, and health outcomes as well as Veteran satisfaction with this program is not known.
Specific aims
Aim 1: Describe geographic variation in the amount of SSVF services provided and identify predictors of this
variation for SSVF recipients for FY2012-FY2017 using data from the HMIS.
Aim 2: Perform an outcome and economic assessment of the SSVF program.
2a: Measure the impact of the rapid re-housing component of SSVF on housing, health, and healthcare cost
outcomes through retrospective cohort analyses for FY2012-FY2017.
2b: Conduct grantee-specific and overall economic evaluations of the SSVF program compared to usual care
using input parameters from the published literature and from Aims 1 and 2a.
Aim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators to SSVF use and Veterans' satisfaction with the program using semi-
structured interviews with VA operations partners, SSVF grantee employees, VA homeless services providers,
and Veterans using SSVF services.
Significance of the proposed research and relevance to Veterans' health
The loss of stable housing has a devastating effect on Veterans' health and well-being. In addition,
homelessness can be costly both to the healthcare system and society as a whole. Solving the problem of
Veteran homelessness is one of the most important initiatives the VA is currently pursuing.
Unique features and innovation of the project
Our study – comprising over 400 sites within the US – will be by far the largest study of a homeless
intervention ever conducted in the US. In addition, we will use both structured and unstructured data and
detailed, Veteran-level data on services and financial assistance received by Veterans enrolled in this program.
Methodology to be used
In Aim 1 we will construct multi-level regression models to identify both individual- and community-level
predictors of SSVF services and expenditures. In Aim 2a, we will fit outcome models relating SSVF program
initiation to the subsequent mortality, exit from homelessness, and cost outcomes in weighted populations
defined by propensity scores. In Aim 2b, we will construct simulation models using input parameters from a
variety of sources. And in Aim 3, we will conduct interviews with national VA stakeholders, SSVF grantee
employees, VA homeless service providers, and Veterans who have enrolled in the SSVF program.
Expected results
In Aim 1, we expect to find considerable variation in services and expenditures across the country, which will
be explained by observable Veteran- and community-level characteristics. We anticipate that our Aim 2a
analyses will find that enrollment in SSVF will lead to increased rates of stable housing, lower mortality rates,
and greater outpatient healthcare costs but lower emergency department and inpatient costs. in Aim 2b, our
hypothesis is that the SSVF program will be cost-effective overall and yield a positive return on investment
compared to usual care but these effects will vary substantially across SSVF sites. Finally, our qualitative data
from Aim 3 will provide insight into ways to improve the SSVF program, enhance implementation strategies,
and explore the experience of Veterans with housing instability."

Research Idea/Rationale: Corneal scarring (or fibrosis) from corneal puncture injury or laceration is one of the
 leading etiologies for blindness. Currently, none of the potential treatments for corneal fibrosis have been FDA-
 approved and none have been shown to reverse an existing corneal scar. Therefore, finding a therapeutic with
 the ability to reduce or control scarring, but that is not invasive or has minimal adverse effects, remains an
 unmet need. Studies from both in vivo and in vitro models have demonstrated that transforming growth factor-
 beta1 (TGF-beta1) is one of the key factors that drive corneal scarring after incision injury. However, TGF-
 beta1 is not an ideal therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases due to its importance in normal physiological
 processes (e.g., proliferation and migration).
Objective/Hypothesis: During our preliminary in vitro studies, we found that an inhibitor for the TGF-
 beta/p38MAPK (p38)-signaling pathway, SB202190, almost completely blocked human corneal scar formation.
 This discovery led us to examine if p38 inhibitor could prevent the transformation of human corneal fibroblasts
 (normal active stromal cells) into myofibroblasts, a stromal cell phenotype that is involved in scarring. We
 found that p38 inhibitor accelerated the conversion of these myofibroblasts back to their normal phenotype.
 We hypothesize that the p38 inhibitor, SB202190, can be used as a local therapeutic for preventing and
reversing corneal scarring.
Specific AIMS: Aim 1:Safety evaluation of SB202190. AIM 2: Determine the therapeutic effect of the
SB202190 to prevent corneal scar formation. AIM 3:Determine if an established corneal scar can be reversed by
treatment with SB202190.
Study Design: In this model, a 3mm perforating incision injury will be made in the center of the right cornea of
 Sprague-Dawley rats. For AIM 1, treatment will be applied immediately after wound creation and reevaluated
 at 24 hours to ensure SB202190 does not cause wound healing delays. Cytotoxicity will also be evaluated in
 human corneal fibroblasts. For AIM 2, SB202190 or control PBS will be applied locally for 1-15 days as
follows: eye drops (topical) will be applied 3 times daily or subconjunctival injection once every three days.
For AIM 3, the injured corneas will be allowed to heal for 14 days. Rats will be randomly grouped and treated
locally as in AIM 1 for 0-8 weeks. Corneas will be examined for haze and proteins associated with scarring at
0-14 days post-treatment in AIM 2 and 0-8 weeks post-treatment in AIM 3 using the following techniques: 1)
Slit lamp and OCT examination; 2) TEM and standard Hematoxylin and Eosin stain 3) Indirect-
immunofluorescence and Western blot. Absence, or at least significant decrease, of haze and scar proteins will
indicate that the inhibitor prevented scarring in the animal model."
10851242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application seeks support from the ORIP High-End Instrumentation (HEI) Grant program to fund the latest
generation Siemens 7 Tesla (7T) whole-body human MRI system to be used for basic/clinical/translational re-
search at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital. This
system will replace our existing 22-year-old prototype 7T human MRI scanner, which was the second in the world
and the first with a clinical console. While this prototype 7T system supported the Martinos Center’s ultra-high
field research program for over two decades, the 7T magnet is no longer serviceable by the manufacturer (Agilent)
and the scanner is no longer supported for future upgrades by the manufacturer (Siemens). Therefore, usage
of this system is winding down as the final projects are completed, and we plan to gracefully retire this historic
7T system in 2024. The new system – a Siemens Terra.X whole-body 7T scanner – will provide a substantial
increase in performance for the wide range of NIH-funded research at the Martinos Center and the greater Boston
area community, including clinical and neuroradiological studies of the central nervous system (brain and spinal
cord), as well as imaging of the throat, knee, and skeletal muscle; cognitive, psychiatric, and basic neuroscience
and brain mapping studies; multinuclear spectroscopy; and novel instrumentation development.
 The features and benefits provided by the Siemens Terra.X include: streamlined and standardized workflows
for greater ease of use, enabling a broader user base as well as robustness and consistency across sessions;
standardized hardware and software for compatibility with other sites, enabling new, collaborative large-scale
multi-site trials; improved manufacturer support and maintenance for a product system moving forward, reduc-
ing the burden currently placed on Martinos Center staff; enhanced system performance including 16 parallel
transmit channels and 64 radiofrequency (RF) receive channels, stronger and faster gradient coils, higher-order
magnetic field shims, increased RF power, a faster image reconstruction computer, high temporal resolution phys-
iological monitoring, and new sequence and application packages compatible with the newly released Siemens
platform; and an up-to-date testbed for the unique instrumentation and technology research and development
performed at the Martinos Center, including advanced imaging sequences and reconstruction, higher-density
receive coil arrays, and shim-RF multi-coil arrays to be both shared with our industrial collaborators and freely
disseminated to the MRI community. Additionally, this scanner will operate in either “MR only” mode or – after the
insertion of a next-generation removable, custom-designed positron emission tomography (PET) camera (funded
by U01EB029826) – as a novel 7T PET/MR system with an order of magnitude improvement in PET sensitivity.
Therefore, this unique Next-generation Upgrade for 7T Human MRI System is poised to support the next two
decades of innovative 7T research at the Martinos Center by dissolving the barriers between 7T and PET, thus
serving both the ultra-high field MRI and PET imaging communities."

Only about 4% of biomedical scientists at US research institutions and universities are from
underrepresented (UR) groups, even though these groups make up 33% of the US population. To support
diversification of the biomedical workforce, with particular focus on the field of the chemical senses, the
Monell Science Apprenticeship Program (MSAP) has a mission to increase participation of disadvantaged
and/or UR students in biomedical research. We are meeting this mission: 5 years after participating in the
MSAP, 15/69 (22%) of the cohort is pursuing postgraduate education, more than 50% higher than the 2021
US Census estimate of 14% of the general population 25 and older holding a master’s degree or higher.
Through our proposed innovations for MSAP 2.0, we will expand and enhance this program’s
positive footprint. MSAP 2.0 offers undergraduate students (and high school students, for whom support is
not requested) training at Monell Center, whose mission is to improve health and well-being by advancing the
scientific understanding of taste, smell, and related senses. The 16 faculty members participating in the
MSAP have diverse scientific backgrounds and conduct collaborative research using methods spanning
such disciplines as electrophysiology, molecular biology, genetics, analytical chemistry, and psychophysics
(in both humans and animals). MSAP 2.0 offers full-time, paid apprenticeships that include 8 summer weeks
of structured research activity with a Monell scientist, as well as enrichment activities that include lectures on
the mechanisms and functions of the chemical senses and instruction on public speaking, written
communication, hypothesis testing, and responsible conduct of research. At the concluding Capstone
Symposium, apprentices present their research findings to all scientists at Monell, peers, stakeholders,
teachers, family, and friends. Mentors are supported by diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB)
experts, and our evaluation plan ensures an inclusive, safe, and supportive experience for the apprentices.
MSAP 2.0 is structured to specifically meet these goals: (1) develop and implement a systematic recruitment
plan to double UR undergraduate participation in MSAP 2.0; (2) provide UR undergraduates with an
intensive, hands-on biomedical research experience, a didactic program, and mentorship in the field of the
chemical senses; and (3) develop and implement systematic evaluation and long-term mentorship and
networking plans to optimize the impact of MSAP 2.0 on future biomedical career choices. The activities
described in this proposal are both a tangible step toward diversification of the workforce in biomedical
sciences, especially the chemical senses, and a way to inspire and prepare the next generation of scientists
to make meaningful contributions to the field. Our 42-year history of continuously running and improving
MSAP provides evidence to anticipate that growth and improvement represented by MSAP 2.0 will lead to
greater future success."

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are uniquely vulnerable to medication errors and adverse drug events
because of their extreme polypharmacy, underlying medical fragility, and reliance on complicated medication
schedules and routes. CMC have 5 times higher odds of an adverse drug event leading to an Emergency
Department (ED) visit than other children. Over 1 of 50 CMC ED visits are due to adverse drug events, and
38% of CMC ED visits for adverse drug events result in hospital admission. Having accurate knowledge to
accurately give high-risk medications is an absolute requirement for safe medication management. Prior work
observed that medication administration accuracy, i.e., knowing indication, formulation, dose, frequency, and
route of administration, was successfully described by fewer than half of CMC caregivers. Low medication
administration accuracy leads to adverse drug events, including potentially preventable hospitalizations,
emergency department visits, and morbidity. Currently, no tools exist to support families of CMC to ensure high
medication administration accuracy across their network of “secondary” caregivers involved in CMC daily care
(e.g., family, in-home care professionals, school caregivers, etc.). To address these critical unmet needs, we
will create a mobile health (mhealth) platform, Medication Safety @HOME (MedS@HOME) to improve CMC
medication safety by supporting standardized medication management across the caregiving network. We
anticipate that MedS@HOME will increase medication administration accuracy and reduce medication-related
adverse events, and ultimately improve chronic care management through the creation and promotion of
standardized medication management practices across the caregiving network. To achieve this goal, we
propose to conduct the following aims: 1) Design the MedS@HOME intervention through participatory co-
design with stakeholders in a parallel design process with three design teams: one with primary CMC
caregivers, one with secondary caregivers, and one with experts in medication safety and CMC clinical care; 2)
Evaluate the effectiveness of MedS@HOME on medication administration accuracy of high-risk medications
(e.g., antiepileptic drugs, opioids) in a randomized controlled trial, testing the hypothesis that medication
administration accuracy is improved for primary and secondary caregivers with use of MedS@HOME.
Completion of the aims will result in a scalable mhealth intervention that improves medication safety for CMC
across the caregiving network. MedS@HOME, when perfected, can improve medication safety and chronic
care management across the wide range of populations that depend on caregiving networks."

Diabetes is widespread in the United States, and its complications have devastating effects on health and quality of life. Impaired wound healing is a serious complication that leads to the development of chronic wounds in the lower extremities. Patients with such wounds display decreased mobility, and overall health, and are the most frequently subjected to limb amputation. Five year mortality following major amputation is over 80%. Wound care practices can be effective, but a large fraction of diabetic ulcers still persist or lead to amputation. Novel therapeutic strategies must focus on the pathological mechanisms underlying impaired healing in order to improve patient outcomes. Wounds become chronic due to diabetic hyperglycemia, including reduced blood flow, hypoxia, and aberrant behavior of immune cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes that are critical to healing. Recent unbiased analyses, such as single RNA seq, have revealed the critical involvement of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the role of ECM proteins as negative modulators of healing. Work in our laboratory suggests the contribution of the matricellular protein thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) to diabetic wounds. Normally, TSP-2 is expressed in wounds and contributes to ECM remodeling and vascular regression, in part, by increasing and decreasing the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and lysyl oxidase (LOX) and ECM crosslinking, respectively. Our recent work has shown that TSP-2 is elevated in the wounds of diabetic patients and mice suggesting a correlation between compromised wound healing and high TSP-2 expression. These findings allowed us to put forward the overarching premise that abnormal ECM production and assembly contribute to prevention of wound closure. We obtained partial confirmation for this hypothesis by generating diabetic mice lacking TSP2 (dbdb-DKO mice) and observed normalization of healing. In this application, we propose studies to explore and exploit ECM phenotypes in diabetes. Specifically, we plan to characterize ECM abnormalities and their contribution to cell dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the newly generated dbdb-DKO mouse will be used to probe a novel ECM phenotype. We also aim to translate our findings into a bioengineering approach that will provide proof-of-principle for the utilization of novel ECMs as part of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy. These studies will include ECM obtained from a TSP2 KO pig that we have created for the provision of clinical grade materials. Accordingly, the specific aims of this application are:
Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that fibroblast dysfunction and altered ECM production and assembly in diabetes contribute to delayed wound closure. 
We will perform wound healing in these mice and monitor recovery of biomechanical integrity, a critical aspect of healing. We will also perform in vitro studies to investigate the indirect impact of diabetes on cell functions by studying the interactions of dermal fibroblasts with ECM derived from WT or dbdb mice. Specifically, we will evaluate migration, production of traction forces, and contraction. Inclusion of cell-derived ECM and cells from dbdb-DKO mice will allow us to probe the role of TSP2 in greater detail. In order to obtain a broader understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the diabetes-induced fibroblast dysfunction we will perform bulk RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis of all genotypes.
Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that novel engineered native constructs can restore healing in diabetic animals. 
We have previously shown that decellularized skin constructs and skin-derived hydrogels from TSP2 KO mice can increase cellular integration, vessel maturation, and healing in diabetic mice. In this aim, we will combine such constructs with drug delivery approaches to develop combinatorial strategies. These studies will be complemented by skin-derived ECM derived from our newly created TSP2 KO pigs. Specifically, we will prepare drug-loaded TSP2-null constructs embedded with alginate microspheres to combat infections, reduce chronic inflammation and restore healing. Full thickness excisional wounds will be made and the rate of healing will be quantified through daily measurements of wound area. Additionally, wounds will be subjected to histological and immunohistochemical stains in order to assess wound closure, epithelialization, inflammation, angiogenesis, and ECM remodeling. 
Completion of this project should allow us to establish a major molecular mechanism in impaired wound healing, which could inform the development of engineering solutions to non-healing wounds. In exciting parallel studies, we have generated a TSP2 KO pig, which we anticipate will be used to produce ECM-based products for clinical use. We believe the proposed rigorous studies in this application will provide significant support for the advancement of regenerative ECM constructs towards the clinic."

Cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction impairs blood flow throughout the brain and is a causative factor of age-
related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Approximately 6.2 million Americans are living
with AD, whereby more than 95% of patients are over the age of 65; a demographic that will likely double by
2050. Cerebrovascular endothelium coordinates vasoreactivity of blood vessel networks for delivery of oxygen
and nutrients throughout brain tissue in accord with metabolic demand. Using a comprehensive, integrative and
longitudinal research approach, we endeavor to delineate and mechanistically clarify how endothelial dysfunction
precedes and accompanies progression of age-related dementia in the presence of ApoE Ɛ4 (Aim 1) and how
the advancement of AD pathology impacts cerebrovascular endothelial function towards endothelial dysfunction
(Aim 2). A central pathway for modulation of blood flow to and throughout the brain, but particularly in the
microcirculation, involves vasodilatory signaling pathways defined by the function of endothelial K+ channels
[Ca2+-activated (SKCa/IKCa; KCa2.3/KCa3.1) and inward-rectifying (KIR2.x) subtypes]. In particular, our recently
published data indicate that there are sex-independent reductions in cerebrovascular endothelial KIR2.x channel
function with both advancing age and AD pathology in mouse models. Further, our preliminary data demonstrate
that mild removal of membrane cholesterol using methyl β-cyclodextrin selectively restores KIR2.x (vs. SKCa/IKCa)
channel function to that of young, healthy conditions or better. Thus, we will test the central hypothesis that
impairment in endothelial KIR channel function caused by cellular cholesterol underlies cerebrovascular
aging and development of dementia. The Aims utilize an innovative integration of ex vivo (isolated cerebral
arteries/arterioles, freshly isolated endothelium), in vivo (cerebral perfusion, hyperemia, behavior), and
interventional (lipid regulation, cerebral endothelial KIR2.1 channel overexpression) approaches to
comprehensively test this hypothesis. The investigating research team includes experts in the biophysics of
endothelial function, vascular aging, cerebrovascular physiology/pathology, and cholesterol modulation of
endothelial K+ channels. Animal models entail aging endothelial cell-specific KIR2.1+/- & KIR2.1-/-, ApoE Ɛ2 / Ɛ3 /
Ɛ4 targeted replacement and 3xTg-AD vs. respective wild-type mice. In such manner, the Research Strategy
will be the first to delineate endothelial dysfunction, caused by changes in cellular cholesterol, as a causative
pathway of brain aging and AD while focusing on endothelial KIR2.x channels as a novel therapeutic target for
pharmacology and gene therapies. We will pursue fine-tuning of K+ channel activity spanning from molecular
approaches to the whole organism; reconciling molecular mechanisms with therapy. The ideal outcome is to find
and treat precise transitions between physiology and pathology uniting structural and functional vascular
“signatures” with behavioral alterations surrounding progressive phases of age- and AD-related dementia."
10830335,"NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S.
ABSTRACT
Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each
year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality—
miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know
little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small
recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.
 These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring
a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute
most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the
study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely
understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are
consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though
pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is
unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.
 Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a
large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among
reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles,
ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to
measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced
information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners
live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid.
We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in
the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates
of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification,
and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and
pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to
provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains
on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied
public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing,
the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple,
connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences."
10830338,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to establish a high-priority research network to identify mechanisms through which
soft tissue manipulation (STM), such as massage, exerts biological effects on the nervous system, non-neural
cells and tissues. Neuromusculoskeletal pain afflicts up to half of the adult U.S. population and is the most
commonly cited health reason for receiving massage. Soft tissue manipulation has been shown to promote
relaxation, reduce anxiety, attenuate pain, mitigate inflammation, and promote functional change. STM also
offers non-addictive alternatives to pharmacological interventions for short-term pain relief. Although STM has
been used widely since ancient times, the underlying mechanisms of STM’s beneficial effects are not well
understood, and STM interventions are not optimized based on rigorous and compelling scientific evidence.
Although mechanistic studies over the past decade have identified molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms of
discriminative touch sensation in mammals, how these neural pathways are engaged by STM is unknown.
Moreover, the cells and circuits that mediate affective components of touch sensation have not been defined.
To enable mechanistic research into therapeutic effects of STM, interdisciplinary research and new resources
are needed. The field requires collaboration between manual therapists, neuroscientists, engineers, and cell
biologists. Scientific conferences or other networking opportunities that bridge these disciplines do not currently
exist. This application in response to RFA-AT-21-006 will create a cross-disciplinary research network of
scientists and clinicians with the shared goal of developing technologies and collaborations to break barriers to
progress. First, few quantifiable standards exist to rigorously measure either how therapists apply hands-on
manipulations, or how these manipulations alter stress/strain fields in receiving tissues. Second, the field lacks
technologies and computational models to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of STM techniques. Third, how
non-neural signals and cell types, including cytokines, immune cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, promote
restorative repair versus fibrotic healing have not been defined. Our core investigative team consists of scientists
and clinicians whose collective expertise spans physical therapy, neuroscience from molecules to circuits in the
mouse and human nervous systems, engineering and tissue mechanics, and extraneural tissues including the
immune, myofascial and integumentary systems. To advance mechanistic research on STM and
mechanosensory signaling, the U24 network aims to 1) Organize a Conferences Program to promote inclusive
networking and cross-disciplinary collaborations, draw diverse researchers and clinicians to the field, and foster
mechanistic, multi-scale research on the neurobiology of mechanotherapy. 2) Implement a Pilot Project Program
to generate new tools for quantifying force-based manipulations, testable hypotheses, and new mechanistic
knowledge. 3) Rapidly and freely disseminate high-impact research to advance the field by sharing innovative
concepts and technologies that define neural mechanisms of the beneficial effects of STM."
10830412,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cellular and molecular alterations that accumulate during cell division are considered to be contributors to
aging phenotypes. Changes in epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, have been widely documented in
aging. This has spurred the development of epigenetic molecular clocks, which rely primarily on replication-
independent gain of methylation at CpG islands. As molecular clocks tuned to chronological time across
different tissue types with varying mitotic rates and histories, these clocks are not directly linked to mitotic cell
division. In contrast, we have found that loss of DNA methylation at lamina-attached, late-replicating regions of
the genome is closely tied to apparent mitotic history. We propose to use primary human cell culture to
experimentally validate that mitosis is a driver of hypomethylation, and to explore the underlying mechanisms
and consequences of this hypomethylation, to define genomic and chromatin features driving hypomethylation,
and use this data to construct a mitotic molecular clock.
 In Specific Aim 1 we propose to use primary human cell culture to provide experimental evidence for the
contribution of mitosis to PMD hypomethylation, and to disentangle the time-dependency and mitosis-
dependency of the phenomenon using cell cycle inhibition. We will also investigate whether enhancing
maintenance methylation machinery is able to counteract the progressive loss of DNA methylation. In Specific
Aim 2 we propose to investigate whether DNA hypomethylation contributes to replicative senescence or
associated phenotypes in primary human cell culture. We will investigate whether inhibition of maintenance
methylation accelerates senescence, and whether progressive hypomethylation is extended in telomerase-
immortalized primary human fibroblasts, contributing to premalignant phenotypes associated with such
immortalization. We will also investigate whether accelerated senescence by progerin expression or supra-
physiologic O2 leads to accelerated DNA hypomethylation. In Specific Aim 3 we will characterize the genomic
and chromatin features that influence individual CpG hypomethylation rates. We will measure the rates of DNA
hypomethylation of individual CpGs in six different primary human cell types and use this information to identify
cell-type-specific, as well as universal genomic and chromatin drivers of hypomethylation. Finally, we will use
elastic net regression on the assembled data to construct cell-type-specific and universal epigenetic mitotic
clocks in Specific Aim 4. The preliminary studies strongly support the concept and feasibility of a DNA
hypomethylation-based mitotic clock. The outcome of this proposed research could have important impacts on
our understanding of the contribution of widespread hypomethylation to aging phenotypes, with potential
implications for aging interventions. The availability of accurate molecular clocks specifically designed to
measure mitotic history would provide a valuable molecular tool to characterize cells and tissues in human
health and disease."

The UCSC Genome Browser and associated tools are used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical
researchers including clinical geneticists, bioinformaticians, researchers working with model organisms, and
wet lab scientists researching human physiology at the molecular level in both healthy and disease states. The
browser integrates the results of thousands of biomedical labs – including a wide range of biochemical assays,
genetic studies, curations, sequencing projects, and computer analyses into a series of tracks aligned to the
underlying genomic sequence. The genome provides a natural integration framework for these diverse data
sources, which the browser showcases at a variety of display scales ranging from the single base to individual
genes, entire chromosomes, and ultimately to the genome as a whole.
The Genome Browser is implemented using robust, fast, high-quality software capable of handling over one
million hits per day. This web software provides a window into an exceptionally detailed and well-documented
database that can be queried computationally as well as browsed graphically. The database is loaded with a
suite of programs, developed both at UCSC and elsewhere, capable of distilling huge genomics data sets into
high-quality annotations of the genome. Significant engineering effort is invested to ensure the quality of the
software and data sets, including those developed by external contributors. The system is designed to make it
easy for users to view their own, unpublished, data sets alongside those that we have fully curated and
integrated. Consortia and other resources can make their data visible in our browser via “track hubs.”
We plan to extend our resource in significant ways. We will help make genomics more equitable to currently
underserved populations by moving to a more inclusive “pangenome” reference that includes sequences that
represent the greater genomic diversity of humanity, not just samples of convenience from largely European
populations. We will enable visualization of individual genomes, not just a single haploid reference genome.
We will address the opportunities and challenges of new technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and
single-molecule long-read DNA sequencing. We will collaborate with others in the increasingly complex
ecosystem of biomedical consortia and resources, and will integrate their results into the Genome Browser,
and also, through our APIs and our helpful staff, ensure that others can make the best use of data available in
their efforts. We will provide tools and data for medical users to understand the significance of sequence
variants in the patients they care for and will help characterize regions of greater genomic complexity and
medical importance. We will extend our outreach effort to include more online content to help engage a new
generation of users."

Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infections in the U.S. are increasing and no Ct vaccine exists. Annual urogenital
tract (UGT) screening of <25 and high risk women of any age is recommended, but testing for rectal Ct infection
is not recommended in women without rectal exposure. However, rectal Ct prevalence rates are similar in women
regardless of anal sex exposures and up to 19% of Ct infections occur only in the rectum and would be missed
by screening recommendations. Animal studies suggest that rectal infection is beneficial by inducing potent
transmucosal immunity that protects the UGT against reinfection without pathological effects. It is critical that we
understand whether rectal Ct infections in women are potentially harmful, by cross-contaminating the UGT, or
beneficial, by inducing mucosal protection against UGT infection. Further, understanding if rectal Ct infections
are immunogenic will establish if a mucosal chlamydia vaccine is feasible. We will enroll women at high-risk for
chlamydia but who have never engaged in anal sex. Over 12 months, we will (1) obtain monthly oral, vaginal,
and rectal swabs to detect incident Ct infections, (2) collect quarterly blood and cervical cytobrush specimens to
study systemic and cervical T-cell responses, and (3) capture weekly sexual behavior and symptoms data to
screen for exposure and Ct-related symptoms. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that (1) rectal Ct
infections are frequent, long-lasting, asymptomatic, associated with specific rectal-tropic strains, and do not
increase risk for UGT infection (Aim 1) and (2) assess their influence on systemic and cervical memory T-cell
immunity and if they decrease incident UGT infections (Aim 2). By understanding if rectal Ct infections increase
or decrease UGT infection risk, these studies may change screening guidelines and lay the foundation for
development of an oral attenuated chlamydia vaccine."

Patients with advanced acral melanoma (AM) suffer worse outcomes relative to patients with cutaneous
melanoma (CM), in part, because they do not respond as well to treatments approved for CM including immune
checkpoint blockade and BRAFV600E inhibitor strategies. Tailored therapies are warranted for patients with
advanced AM given that AMs differ from CMs in a) cell of origin (volar melanocytes versus non-volar
melanocytes, respectively) and b) mutational frequencies in targetable driver genes (e.g., BRAF hotspot
mutations in 18% of AMs versus 46% of CMs). In this application, we focus on the unique biological
dynamics induced by the plantar skin microenvironment of the foot where AMs most commonly arise
in. The plantar microenvironment is mechanically stiffer relative to non-plantar skin sites (e.g., arm) where CMs
arise, and the resident dermal fibroblasts in plantar skin display cancer associated fibroblast (CAF)-like markers
in the absence of cancer cells. In the first aim, we will mechanistically define how matrix stiffness impacts AM
metabolism. Our preliminary data identify elevated lysosome catabolism and collagen degradation gene
signatures in AM cells grown in the stiffer plantar skin of the foot versus softer non-plantar skin of the flank in
mice. We will track changes in lysosomal catabolism in a panel of in vitro and in vivo AM model systems using
a) live cell reporters (e.g., mCherry-eGFP-LC3), b) Western blotting of protein markers of lysosome activity
(e.g., LC3B, p62, NBR1), and c) bulk and single cell RNA sequencing analyses. In the second aim, we are
testing the hypothesis that matrix stiffness-induced lysosomal catabolism promotes metastasis to the liver and
insensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. These studies will not only determine whether liver metastasis and
therapy resistance emerge via elevated lysosomal catabolism, but will also provide us with information on the
relationship between matrix stiffness and lysosomal catabolism that will extend to other tumor types including
breast and pancreatic where tissue stiffening is associated with poorer survival. In the third aim, we are testing
the hypothesis that plantar fibroblasts promote AM metastasis and therapy resistance through the secretion of
factors including matrix gla protein (MGP). We expect that targeting separate aspects of the plantar skin
microenvironment in a rationally designed way (in vitro and then in preclinical in vivo models) will enable the
reduction of resistance onset and metastatic disease in patients."

 The maternal-fetal/infant axis of transport represents one of, if not the highest duration and intimacy of
long-distance communication across multi-tissue barriers between two individuals. Transporters enable such
communication by controlling the uptake and distribution of metabolites across membranes, tissues, organs, and
even between the mother and the infant. Remarkably, only a few hundred human transporters control the
exchange of tens of thousands of nutrients and metabolites between different tissue compartments. A
comprehensive map of transporters to tissue barriers, and to the substrates (nutrients, metabolites, dietary
supplement constituents, xenobiotics, and drugs) whose passage they facilitate along the maternal-fetal/infant
axis, are yet to emerge because we simply do not know the identity of most transported metabolites, or how to
prioritize candidate hits. We propose to create a Mother-infant Metabolite-transporter Atlas (MiMA) devoted to
the deorphanization of transporters, while prioritizing our studies by considering their expression, abundance,
localization and importance at tissue barriers of mother and developing infant, including the fetal blood-brain
barrier (BBB) and infant gut in the context of the lactating mother and child. MiMA will leverage existing advanced
infrastructures and apply process innovations/expertise to produce an atlas that can be used as a basis for
system integration of metabolomics, proteomics, and transporter biology. MiMA seeks to answer the following
questions: (1) How does a network of only a few hundred transporters control and optimize levels of perhaps
thousands of small molecules along the mother-infant mammary gland-gut-brain axis? (2) Which endogenous
small molecules and xenobiotics/drugs does each of these transporters recognize and permeate? (3) Are there
rules that ensure a homeostatic system (patterns of metabolite:transporter specificity, tissue distribution,
function), and can these rules inform precision nutrition and precision medicine?
 This project is expected to generate a comprehensive atlas populated with precise knowledge of what
metabolites bind to which transporters to be able to move across organ/tissue compartments. MiMA will also
create a novel workflow to empirically validate specificity among interacting metabolite-transporter pairs,
combining metabolomics and molecular structural biology. The project will validate specificity among interacting
metabolite-transporter pairs and create advanced nanobody reagents to interrogate localization as perturb
function of transporters. MiMA will produce omics-validated model systems to have better contextual
understanding of transporters in normal and diseased human physiology. Taken together, MiMA is expected to
deliver an integrated map or mother-infant metabolite-transporter atlas to formulate the “rules” that govern
tissue/body homeostasis and serve as resource for many exciting research questions to be asked and solved."

Continuous molecular monitoring has advanced from sensors tested in benchtop beakers, into numerous
demonstrations of sensors inserted into animal jugulars for blood monitoring, and is now emerging into
monitoring in the skin’s interstitial fluid which is the clinically successful approach also used in wearable glucose
monitors. However, major knowledge gap for molecular monitoring centers on a simple yet impactful question:
while glucose monitors have found hypodermal sensor placement to be most accurate, for other analytes and
diseases what tissue layer in the skin, if any, will provide clinically valuable continuous monitoring? This question
must be addressed because the skin’s dermis and hypodermis are different in both diffusion resistance and
cellular density, which for the examples of insulin or IL-6 could respectively confound measurement due to
receptor uptake or generation. The objective of this R21 proposal is to fill this knowledge gap by creating and in-
vivo testing the first ever multi-depth sensor array that enables simultaneous monitoring of analytes in the largely
acellular dermis vs. the adipocyte-rich hypodermis. The central hypothesis is that a multi-depth aptamer bio-
sensor array will reveal that most analytes <10 kDa in the dermis will have <20% mean absolute relative
difference with capillary blood, while <20% mean absolute relative difference for analytes in the hypodermis will
be limited to analytes <1 kDa. The rationale for an R21 is that it will provide basic proof-of-concept in rats before
even more detailed R01 work can investigate in humans more advanced confounding factors of cellular analyte
uptake (receptors) and local analyte generation. The PI Heikenfeld and co-I Kasting are exceptionally prepared
given their deep expertise in biofluids for continuous monitoring, the PI’s recent demonstration of aptamer
biosensors with >10-day longevity, the PI’s first in-human results with aptamer sensors, and active relationships
with 2 of 3 glucose monitor companies. The team will achieve the R21’s overall objective and test the central
hypothesis through the following aims. Aim 1 – create a linear array of 5 redundant sensor electrodes on glucose
sensor needle dimensions and with electrical impedance validate simultaneous sensor insertion in the rat dermis
and hypodermis. Aim 2 – with an aptamer-functionalized 5-sensor array simultaneously monitor in rat blood,
dermis, and hypodermis infused concentrations of phenylalanine (165 Da), or vancomycin (1.5kDa), or NT-
proBNP (8.5 kDa). The proposed work is innovative, because: (1) due to the challenging proximity of the dermis
and hypodermis this will be a breakthrough tool to accurately enable their simultaneous measurement; (2) in
clinical practice the 5-sensor array could also be the most reliable way to achieve and maintain dermal sensor
placement. With respect to expected outcomes, R21 success will provide new fundamental insights for
continuous monitoring and enable R01 pursuit of human testing for challenging but impactful analytes of chronic
disease."

The accurate description of cellular states—be it on the genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic level—has been
a major driver in the disentanglement of nature’s mysteries. Mainly supported by technological advances such
as next-generation sequencing or single-cell technologies, we now can describe the distinct cellular populations
within a tissue or collection of cells in intricate detail. This allows us to understand health and disease, and it
often proves instrumental in our ability to develop effective treatments. However, our current technologies are
mostly geared toward an understanding of current cellular states. While various technologies can trace the
lineage of cells, even the combination with global cellular state readouts does not offer accurate insights into
past cellular history. Moreover, current approaches that aim to combine a past transcriptional event with such
tracing can only report the historic expression of one or few genes. However, this single moment in time may
have comprised many critical developmental or adaptive ‘decisions’ or ‘inputs’ that shape the current function or
even location of a cell.
 Thus, a global recording of a transcriptional state would support a more comprehensive picture of a cell’s
history. This proposal’s aim is to provide such a genome-wide record of transcription by building on recently
developed technological concepts. For this, we will develop the novel approach of transcriptional endpoint
marking (TEM); this technology will introduce a permanent genetic mark at the locus of actively transcribed
genes. Expressing the ‘marker’ construct transiently, will inscribe a ‘snapshot’ record of the transcriptomic profile
that can later be assessed by targeted genome-wide retrieval of the genomic ‘marks’. Our proposed work will
provide proof-of-concept and focus on the development of a genetic toolkit that enables this analysis. In addition,
it will provide a computational basis for both the data processing and snapshot analysis. We will initially employ
these methods to test cellular state differences that underlie adaptive responses, such as chemotherapy
resistance in cell culture methods.
 We expect that this method will have a broad impact across several fields, which include our laboratory’s
interests in vertebrate development. Moving this technology into in vivo systems, such as zebrafish or mouse,
will enable the establishment of early developmental markers of defined cellular populations that remained
elusive. Alternatively, it will also enable to understand lineage decisions for populations that share developmental
history but present with distinct phenotypes. Likewise, snapshot analysis will aid in our understanding of
metastasis and resistance in tumour models, resiliency in injury, or response to differentiation factors in vitro.
TEM represents a fundamentally distinct approach to dissect development and adaption that complements
current efforts in lineage tracing and state analysis. As such, it can serve as a technological driver of novel
biological insights."

 This K01 application aims to prepare Dr. Ali Gheidi for an independent faculty position by providing
specialized training in rodent models of drug self-administration (IVSA), chemogenic manipulation of neurons
and targeted deletion of neuronal ensembles. Therefore, Dr. Gheidi will work with a carefully selected Training
Team of mentors. Training for Dr. Gheidi will consist of courses, meeting with mentors, workshops, scientific
meetings, and performing experiments. Dr. Gheidi’s short term goal is to understand the role of norepinephrine
(NE) in regulating neuronal ensembles in cocaine seeking behavior. His long-term goal is to gain an independent
position as a researcher-educator, where he can study neuromodulators' role in regulating neuronal ensembles
to drug abuse.
 In addition to advancing the career of Dr. Gheidi, this proposal will increase understanding of substance
abuse, in general, and cocaine relapse, in particular. Over the past decade, a paradigm shift has occurred in
neurobiology, including within the field of drug addiction. In these studies, only a select, distributed, and a sparse
group of neurons, known as a neuronal ensemble, thought to code drug taking events is isolated and studied.
This selective approach offers new insights over traditional methods, where drug-induced perturbations are
usually studied in the whole brain area or cell type. Instrumental to this task is the use of Fos based approaches.
These techniques allow the direct manipulation of Fos positive neurons, and by extension neuronal ensembles,
without affecting adjacent areas or cell types not involved in the behavior. For example, using the Daun02
neuronal ablation method in this K01, scientists have identified neuronal ensembles in the prefrontal cortex and
nucleus accumbens critical to cocaine, heroin, nicotine, and alcohol taking and seeking behaviors. However,
missing from this understanding is the contribution of the brain's neuromodulators (e.g., NE) in sculpting neuronal
ensembles and inducing relapse to drug taking. Thus, this grant proposal aims to elucidate the role of NE on
prefrontal cortical neuronal ensembles involved in cocaine seeking behaviors in female and male rats.
 The proposed research will utilize state of the art techniques mentioned above. Aim 1 of this K01 proposal
will determine the role of NE in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ensembles control of cocaine seeking. Aim
2 will utilize DREADDs to inactivate the NE-containing locus coeruleus projections that specifically innervate the
mPFC to further explore the role of NE in cocaine seeking. A better understanding of how these processes
operate in cocaine seeking situations can inform both clinical and basic science as well as inform clinical care.
Results will also inform basic scientists on the neuronal underpinnings of learned motivated behaviors, and
researchers may also devise clinical strategies to target neuronal ensembles by controlling neuromodulators,
including NE, in the human brain that can ease conditions that lead to relapse of cocaine use."

Our long-term goal is to understand the pathologic mechanisms underlying insulin resistance-associated
metabolic disease, and in particular non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although NAFLD affects 1 in 4
Americans and significantly increases the risk of liver cancer and cardiovascular disease, no FDA-approved
NAFLD therapies currently exist. Although insulin resistance increases the incidence of NAFLD, the mechanisms
linking these pathologies are not completely understood and warrant further study.
To identify the key factors mediating insulin resistance-associated NAFLD, we screened diabetic individuals and
healthy controls for differences in plasma protein concentrations and hepatic gene expression We found that
ceruloplasmin (CP), a liver-secreted copper-binding protein, was increased in the liver and plasma of diabetic
patients. These data are consistent with previous findings of high plasma CP concentrations in individuals with
diabetes or obesity, and positive correlations of CP with the severity of diabetes, obesity, CVD risk, and mortality.
In addition, our preliminary data and data from others show that hepatic CP expression is high in humans and
rodents with NAFLD, while their hepatic copper levels are low11-16, consistent with the role of CP to reduce hepatic
copper content. However, the functional significance of the high hepatic CP and low hepatic copper associated
with insulin resistance and NAFLD is unclear.
To address this deficiency, we have characterized mouse models of insulin resistance and hepatocyte-specific
CP deletion. These preliminary studies have suggested a previously unrecognized role of hepatic CP and copper
in linking insulin resistance and NAFLD. While a HFD decreases hepatic copper content and promotes NAFLD,
liver-specific knockdown or knockout of CP (L-CP KO) increases hepatic copper content, alters the expression
of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, and ameliorates NAFLD in these insulin resistant mice. We
hypothesize that insulin resistance-induced hepatic CP promotes NAFLD by disrupting copper homeostasis and
lipid metabolism. In Aim 1, we will determine how insulin resistance induces hepatic CP gene transcription; in
Aim 2, we will determine how hepatic CP regulates copper homeostasis and the development of NAFLD; and in
Aim 3, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which dysregulation of hepatic copper homeostasis
promotes NAFLD.
We expect that the completion of the proposed studies will define the role of hepatic CP and copper in metabolic
regulation and the development of NAFLD in insulin resistant states, which may suggest new means of treating
NAFLD."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains one of the most unmet medical challenges in our society. In the AD,
neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, in addition
to extracellular amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau based neurofibrillary tangles. Although the role of
innate immunity especially represented by microglia is well-established in AD, it is far less understood and
established about whether and how the T or B cell-mediated adaptive immunity is involved in AD pathogenesis.
In particular, whether there are brain- and AD-specific antigens to activate adaptive immunity and how these
antigens travel to peripheral remain to be investigated. Exosomes (size 40-100 nm), a major type of secreted
extracellular vesicles (EVs), are derived from intraluminal vesicles (ILV) that are budded inwardly from the early
endosomal compartment and are released from multiple vesicular bodies (MVB) during the maturation of
endosomes. EVs and exosomes secreted from various CNS cell types have emerged as a novel and important
intercellular pathway in the. Exosome-mediated secretion has also been implicated in initiation and propagation
in AD. Although exosomes secreted from various peripheral cell types especially immune and tumor cells trigger
immune responses, whether and how CNS-derived exosomes are immunogenic remains unexplored.
 By employing cell-type specific ILV/exosome reporter (hCD63-GFPf/f) mice we recently generated, we
showed that astroglia-derived exosomes are associated with Aquaporin 4+ (Aqp4+) perivascular end feet/blood
vessel in the brain. hCD63-GFP+ astroglial exosomes can also be detected in blood serum of LPS-injected (but
not control) Glast-CreER+CD63-GFPf/+ mice. Excitingly, exosomes secreted from “reactive” astroglia (RAEs)
strongly activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on previous studies and our preliminary
results, we propose to investigate the following aims: 1) Determine pathological efflux of CNS cell-type specific
exosomes from brain and their entry into peripheral circulation in AD models; 2) Determine antigenicity of AD-
relevant astroglial exosomes in activating T cells in vitro and in vivo. We have generated a large amount of
preliminary data to support our rationales and to demonstrate feasibility for proposed aims. We will employ
mouse genetics, virus injections, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and in vivo two-photon imaging, primary
cultures, FACS, and biochemical approaches to investigate these two aims. Results from this project will
determine the efflux changes of neuron or astroglial exosomes from the brain and these exosomes’ entry into
peripheral circulation in AD models. In addition, our current study will investigate how T cells respond to “reactive”
astroglial exosomes. As reactive astroglia is commonly observed in neurodegenerative diseases including AD,
this will potentially unveil new mechanisms how T cells are involved in AD pathogenesis and help define specific
brain signals to activate T cells in AD, which subsequently facilitate the therapeutic development."

To advance our understanding of therapeutic resistance in Glioblastoma (GBM), it is essential to characterize
the individual cell during therapy those fuel tumor recurrence in GBM. However, it is challenging to study the
GBM during conventional radio- and chemotherapy due to limited accessibility to patient samples during this
time period. Our lab performed a single-cell RNA sequencing screen in the patient-derived xenograft model of
GBM during temozolomide (TMZ) therapy. Our analysis revealed that the Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory
Subunit 2 (RRM2) mediates deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) production necessary for proper DNA
replication stable cell growth, promotes metabolic adaptation to TMZ therapy, and initiate recurrence. We have
identified a novel mechanism where RRM2-mediated dCTP and dGTP can enhance the DNA repair in response
to TMZ and promotes resistance to therapy. Based on this, we hypothesize that RRM2-mediated RNR activity
is critical for chemoresistance in GBM. To investigate this hypothesis, we intend to elucidate the RNR-mediated
chemoresistance in GBM (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate a blood-brain permeable RRM2 inhibitor to prevent
RNR-mediated chemoresistance in GBM (Aim 2). We established collaboration with Nanopharmaceutic, which
holds the patent for producing clinical-grade 3-AP and will provide us with clinical-grade 3-AP to test its efficacy
further and advance our understanding of the mechanism of action by which it can be used to treat GBM patients.
Finally, we intend to investigate the mechanism of therapeutic resistance by specific nucleotides produced by
the RRM2-mediated de novo pathway (Aim 3). Collectively, our studies will provide novel insights regarding
changes in dNTP synthesis that are associated with GBM adaptation and resistance during chemotherapy. This
information, in turn, is expected to reveal novel approaches for delaying, if not preventing, tumor recurrence."

Opioids are the most commonly used and most effective analgesics, and are the first line of defense against
acute and severe pain. However, this dramatic ability to mitigate pain comes with many side effects. These
include constipation, nausea, sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, dependence, and addiction. Among
these, respiratory depression is the major driver of death by opioid overdose. According to the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), nearly 50,000 people died in 2019 by opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) in
the United States, and the death rate is rising rapidly due to increased misuse and addiction to both
prescription and illicit opioids. Thus, the US is currently experiencing a serious national public health crisis that
is also taking a toll on social economic welfare. Despite these dire numbers, research elucidating the neural
mechanisms of OIRD, which could identify therapeutic targets, has not been rigorously investigated. Animal
studies have shown that OIRD and opioid analgesia are both mediated by the µ-opioid receptor (MOR),
however the neural circuits and brain regions responsible for OIRD and opioid analgesia are not fully
understood. The proposed research aims to dissect the neural circuits that selectively mediate OIRD or opioid
analgesia using cutting-edge molecular, physiological, behavioral, and imaging techniques. Projection-specific
single-cell transcriptomic analysis will then be used to identify functional markers expressed in the MOR-
expressing neurons that specifically mediate OIRD, not opioid analgesia. Successful completion of the
proposed research will identify novel therapeutic targets that selectively rescue OIRD without altering analgesic
effects of opioids."

This research program focuses on uncovering the biological roles of glycoconjugates. Part of this effort is
devoted to the development of chemical biology tools for glycoscience research. In the past, we have developed
photocrosslinking sugar analogs that can be incorporated into cellular glycoconjugates and used to covalently
crosslink glycoconjugates to their binding partners in a native context. These reagents can be used to identify
glycan-dependent binding interactions, and to characterize where and under what conditions that these
interactions occur. Over the next five years, we will further expand the scope of experiments that can be
performed by preparing additional photocrosslinking sugars, developing new methods for their incorporation,
and evaluating their incorporation into additional glycoconjugates. Using one of these photocrosslinking
sugars, we made the unexpected observation that cholera toxin can bind fucosylated glycoconjugates in
addition to its canonical receptor, the ganglioside GM1. Over the next five years, we will determine the
molecular structure of fucosylated glycoconjugates recognized by cholera toxin and characterize their role in
host cell intoxication. These studies are supported by our long-term collaboration with the Yrlid group
(University of Gothenburg) and their expertise in studying cholera disease mechanisms. Our studies of cholera
toxin receptors led us to become interested in the diverse glycoconjugates that line the intestinal and
respiratory epithelia. A CRISPR screen designed to identify genes that modulate cholera toxin binding to cell
surfaces identified a number of candidate genes that may function in the regulation of glycosylation by diverse
mechanisms. Over the next five years, we will characterize novel regulators of glycosylation and determine how
they shape the glycome, modulating glycan features such as polyLacNAc chain length and the degree of
fucosylation. The long-term goal of these studies is to determine how glycan features vary among individuals,
their association with disease states, and their impact on host-microbe interactions."

The overall goal of Core 2 (Animal Model Core) is to support the development and use of the animal models
utilized within this Program Project Grant (PPG). The guiding principles for the animal model core are efficient
planning and utilization of animals, standardization of processing and diagnoses, reliability of service and
consistent evaluation of animal models. The fundamental expertise provided within the core is laboratory animal
medicine and clinical and anatomic pathology. The Core is housed and coordinated in the Department of
Veterinary Biosciences. Dr. Stefan Niewiesk, proposed Core Director has been Director of the Animal Core
since 2004 and is an active collaborator with all of the principal investigators for the PPG. Dr. Niewiesk is a
certified in Veterinary Microbiology and in Laboratory Animal Medicine (European College). Dr. Krista La Perle
(Co-Investigator), who is certified by the American College of Veterinary Pathology will provide pathological
evaluations for the Core. The overall theme of the PPG is to analyze how infection with HTLV-1 induces
proliferation of CD4 T cells, how viral latency and proteins influence and maintain transformation and how the
tumor cells interact with their microenvironment. After acute infection, HTLV-1 persists in the organism,
eventually leading to oligoclonal transformation and outgrowth of CD4 T cells. After establishment and
reactivation of viral latency (Project 3: Ratner), tumorigenesis is driven by the viral protein Hbz (Project 1:
Green). These leukemic cells spread throughout the organism and cause osteolysis (Project 2: Weilbaecher).
All projects will use rabbit and mouse models for adult T cell leukemia, which have been established and/or
utilized by Core 2 using a molecular clone of HTLV-1."
10842028,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Recent successes in structural and computational biology have led to an increasingly deep understanding of
the diversity of states in which molecular complexes can exist. In the cell, we know that molecular complexes
are constantly in motion, and that these dynamics are often crucial for function. In recent years, my group and
others have successfully used 3D animation tools to visualize diverse complex and dynamic molecular
processes. From this experience, we have seen that 3D animation software can be used to synthesize spatial
and dynamic information from a variety of experimental modalities, and that this process can provide important
scientific insights. Unfortunately, creating these molecular visualizations requires extensive training in 3D
animation techniques, and as a result, these techniques have not been widely adopted within the research
community. We propose to develop open-source tools and publish workflows to enable molecular biologists to
create and share dynamic molecular models. Using our tools, we envision that researchers will be able to
create animated models by completing two major tasks. As a first step, users will define a series of molecular
states in which the molecular complex (or single molecule) is proposed to exist. These states may be defined
by a change in conformation or association of one or more component molecules, for instance. Next, the user
defines a trajectory through these defined states in order to create an animated model. We will test and
validate these tools through a series of case studies of specific molecular systems that have relatively well-
defined structural and dynamic states. In parallel with developing animation tools, we will also develop
standards and methods for researchers to share, annotate, and archive dynamic molecular models. Overall,
our goal is to provide new methods and tools for researchers to visualize and model dynamic molecular
processes, and to make these completed models accessible, reusable, and transparent."

The objective of TRD 1 is to technologically advance and integrate interventional fluorescence lifetime imaging
(iFLIM) technology in clinical settings for real-time in-situ tissue diagnosis and guidance of surgical procedures.
While the basic principles of FLIM technology are well-established and FLIM-based techniques are used
extensively in cell culture microscopy and small-animal imaging, FLIM’s complex instrumentation and
engineering difficulties for compact clinical fiber probes, long data acquisition times, and complex data analysis
present significant barriers to its wide dissemination and limits its clinical adoption. TRD 1 joins the unique
expertise in iFLIM at UC Davis with expertise in detector technologies, photonic integration, micro-endoscopy,
and optical imaging to address current technological barriers, advance fundamental FLIM technology, and
achieve greater clinically utility. TRD 1 consists of four Specific Aims: Aim 1 will improve iFLIM performance
through the advancement of hyperspectral detector array built with monolithically integrated encoder patterns.
New iFLIM detector technology with significantly improved sensitivity (10-fold) and speed (5-to-10-fold
enhancement) compared to current technology and ability to perform fast multispectral measurements will be
created. Aim 2 will expand iFLIM clinical utility by building devices capable of real-time, highly specific,
quantitative imaging. Scalable miniaturized iFLIM systems that integrate planar imaging devices (spectrometer-
on-a-chip) with high-speed readout integrated electronics (ROIC) based on innovative packaging strategies will
be generated. Aim 3 will link iFLIM with other optical imaging devices. We will develop interfacing components
based on advanced fiber optic and micro-endoscopic technology to enable multimodal imaging and access to
internal organs. iFLIM compatible catheter technologies enabling coupling of iFLIM with other optical modalities
(e.g., OCT, iDOS) permit simultaneous evaluation of complementary tissue signatures and expansion of iFLIM
indications from open-field surgery to stereotactic biopsy, endovascular techniques and other minimally invasive
interventions. Aim 4 will incorporate iFLIM into surgical guidance. We will develop strategies to integrate iFLIM
into procedural workflow. Methodologies for standardization and effective integration of iFLIM devices in a
clinically viable workflow will be generated. Impact: This TRD will create innovative, scalable iFLIM technology
for intraprocedural use and generate prototypes and intraprocedural methodologies/protocols enabling wide
dissemination of iFLIM devices, including through CPs and SPs, to promote their broader adoption. The acquired
FLIm parameter database/cluster will enable subsequent multi-center clinical trials for automated tissue
classification and diagnostic prediction. Although the initial clinical focus of this TRD is surgical oncology,
advanced iFLIM should prove useful in other procedures (e.g., cardiovascular, neurologic disease, organ/tissue
transplantation)."

The field of diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) has long held the promise of non-invasive, deep tissue monitoring
with benign, near-infrared light. Yet clinical DOS instrumentation has been challenged by limited quantitative
accuracy, lack of depth specificity, and the inherent ambiguity of hemoglobin oxygenation measures. These
challenges have been only partially, and inadequately, addressed by existing technologies. Our team at UC
Davis recently invented interferometric diffuse optical spectroscopy (iDOS), which overcomes many of these
critical roadblocks. In this TRD, we will advance and disseminate two complementary iDOS technologies:
 1) Interferometric Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (iDWS) uses low-cost complementary metal–oxide–
 semiconductor (CMOS) sensors to create a new class of near-infrared optical devices that measure deep
 blood flow (BF) index continuously and non-invasively. Employing the optical “trick” of interferometry,
 iDWS transforms each CMOS pixel into a sensitive detector for coherent light fluctuations that encode
 deep BF dynamics. Since CMOS camera pixels are cheap and numerous, iDWS improves the
 performance and reduces the cost of optical BF measurements. Here, we will develop and validate a
 transformative, multi-exposure iDWS approach, to enable brain and other deep tissue measurements
 in adult humans with mass-produced, 2D megapixel sensors. While the interferometric approach is
 established, the multi-exposure approach is new and high impact, enabling a further two order-of-
 magnitude improvement in performance-to-cost over iDWS. These advances will democratize access
 to cerebral BF (CBF), leading to 1) better brain-computer interfaces 2) point-of-care assessments of CBF,
 and 3) wearable CBF monitors, analogous to blood pressure and heart rate monitors.
 2) Interferometric Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (iNIRS) enhances quantitative capabilities of iDOS through
 laser tuning. Critically, iNIRS measures the time-of-flight (TOF) of light with tens of picosecond resolution,
 enabling direct quantification of optical properties. Additionally, by measuring coherent light fluctuations,
 iNIRS quantifies blood flow index, with the additional ability to resolve dynamics in depth (e.g. scalp-skull-
 brain). In this proposal, besides using iNIRS as a quantitative adjunct to conventional continuous wave
 methods, we will further improve the TOF resolution of iNIRS by an order of magnitude, while
 achieving spectroscopic (multi-wavelength) capabilities. We will also provide detection of sub-diffuse
 light at null source-collector separation, enabling integration of iNIRS and fiber-based mesoscopic
 approaches such as iFLIM (TRD 1) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
Collaborative and service projects are selected to represent settings ranging from microsurgery to non-invasive
monitoring, and applications from clinical neuro-monitoring to surgical skill assessment to population screening.
These diverse collaborations will help to evaluate and demonstrate the unique capabilities of the iDOS approach."

Recent research has identified a strong association between Campylobacter and chronic malnutrition,
evidenced by linear growth faltering, in children in low-resource settings. However, the importance of individual
Campylobacter species and the mechanism underlying this association have not been defined. Meanwhile,
comprehensive water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have failed to improve linear growth or
even to reduce Campylobacter prevalence. A better understanding of the epidemiology and burden of
Campylobacter infections as well as the reservoirs and pathways for exposure to diverse Campylobacter
infections is needed to guide next-generation WASH studies and other interventions to reduce stunting, and
the specific pathways underlying the association between Campylobacter and poor linear growth need to be
identified. Our group has pioneered the application of quantitative molecular diagnostics for a broad range of
pathogens to studies of diarrhea etiology and the impact of enteric infections on growth. These studies have
revealed the limitations of bacterial culture, which has obscured characterization of the prevalence and
importance of diverse Campylobacter species. We have developed a high-throughput, culture-independent
diagnostic approach using targeted long-read next generation sequencing, which reveals a broad diversity of
Campylobacter species in children in these settings, including a strikingly high prevalence of C. hyointestinalis,
more than twice as prevalent as C. jeuni in our birth cohort in Tanzania. In Aim 1, we will apply this diagnostic
approach to describe the epidemiology and impact of Campylobacter species in children in three low-resource
settings, using previously archived DNA from stool samples collected from the multisite MAL-ED birth cohort
study in Loreto, Peru, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Haydom, Tanzania. This will establish the species-specific
prevalence, species-specific attributable incidence of diarrhea, risk factors, and association with poor linear
growth. In Aim 2, we will characterize Campylobacter species infections in a larger birth cohort in Haydom,
Tanzania to validate the associations with growth identified in Aim 1 and to define mechanisms underlying
these associations. We will specifically test the hypothesis that impaired gut motility driven by an immune
response to cytolethal distending toxin B and associated small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is associated
with poor linear growth. We will define the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other possible
pathways. In Aim 3, we will establish a transmission cohort in Haydom, Tanzania to understand the major
reservoirs of and pathways for Campylobacter infections in this rural African setting. In total, this work will

 TITIN (TTN) truncating variants (TTNtvs) have been found to be the most common genetic factor for
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, allelic heterogeneity (AH) of TTNtv DCM, i.e. TTNtvs are also found
in reference populations, significantly confound diagnosis and therapeutic development of these patients.
Pathogenic TTNtvs are mainly found in the C-terminal A-band region (TTNtv-As) but less in the N-terminal Z-
disc region (TTNtv-Zs). Moreover, pathological signaling pathways for TTNtv DCM remain largely unknown.
Here, we aim to leverage unique research opportunities enabled by zebrafish genetics to decipher underlying
mechanisms of AH, discover pathological signaling pathways, and develop effective therapeutic avenues. Our
preliminary studies showed that AH of TTNtv DCM can be recapitulated in both embryonic and adult zebrafish,
opening the door for mechanistic studies of AH in vivo. From our screen of known cardiomyopathy signaling
pathways, we identified mTOR, autophagy, MAPK and PDE1 as candidate signaling pathways that could be
leveraged for therapeutic benefits. We also established a F0-based genetic assay using the Microhomology-
mediated end joining (MMEJ) genome editing technology that enables us to rapidly discover new signaling
pathways. Based on these preliminary studies, we proposed to leverage unique genetic and chemical genetic
tools in zebrafish to prove that zebrafish is the first in vivo animal model for allelic heterogeneity of TTNtv DCM,
which can be used to decipher primary damages incurred by TTNtvs, to discover sequential pathological
signaling pathways, and to develop mechanism-based therapies. The proposal is organized into the 3 specific
aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will decipher allelic heterogeneity of ttntv DCM via studying a panel of ttntv mutants
and ttn null mutants. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to elucidate molecular basis of autophagy dysregulation in
ttntv DCM and develop an autophagy-based therapy. In Specific Aim 3, we will confirm MAPK and PDE1 as
candidate signalings and discover additional new genes and signaling pathways by carrying MMEJ-based F0
screens. Upon completion of the proposal, we anticipate the following deliverables: 1) provide in vivo evidence
to clarify why TTNtv-As are more likely to cause DCM phenotypes than TTNtv-Zs; 2) obtain insights on
autophagy, MAPK and PDE signaling pathways in ttntv DCM, and identify mechanism-based therapeutic
avenues for ttntv DCM; 3) establish a F0-based genetic screening approach that is capable of systematically
discovering new genes for ttntv DCM, opening an unprecedented opportunity for mechanistic studies of an
inherited cardiomyopathy."
10847379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain malignancy with a median survival of only
one year after diagnosis. Our current knowledge of the underlying basis of GBM centers mostly on several
recurrent mutations in specific genes. However, non-genetic factors contributing to GBM development and
progression are largely unknown. Due to our poor understanding of GBM biology, treatment options are limited
to chemotherapy (temozolomide, TMZ) combined with radiotherapy. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are
desperately needed to treat this deadly tumor. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that aberrant RNA
splicing due to splice site mutations and/or splicing factor mutations drives oncogenic gene expression in
multiple types of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In GBM, a few RNA splicing factors, including
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) and hnRNP A2B1 have been recently identified as driving
factors in oncogenic splicing, indicating that RNA splicing is a critical, yet to be explored, mechanism that
governs a broad range of oncogenic gene expression. Our extensive preliminary data demonstrated that SON,
a large nuclear speckle protein possessing DNA- and RNA-binding abilities, is highly upregulated in GBM
patient samples, and there is a strong correlation between SON upregulation and short patient survival. We
found that SON facilitates expression of PTBP1, thereby activating the PTBP1-meditated oncogenic splicing
program. In contrast, SON inhibits the expression of PTBP2, a splicing factor required for neural exon inclusion
and neural differentiation. We further revealed that SON regulates the intron removal process at the
constitutive splice site in the PTBP1 transcript and regulates cassette exon inclusion/skipping at the alternative
splice site in the PTBP2 transcript. We also demonstrated that SON knockdown markedly inhibits GBM cell
growth and neural stem cell gene expression, and SON depletion renders patient-derived glioma stem cells
(GSCs) sensitive to TMZ in vitro. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SON is a master RNA
splicing regulator positioned at the apex of the splicing factor hierarchy that affects both constitutive and
alternative RNA splicing, consequently turning on the oncogenic splicing program and blocking neural splicing.
Thus, SON could represent a promising novel therapeutic target for GBM. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to dissect the molecular mechanisms of SON functions in the regulation of constitutive and alternative RNA
splicing in GBM (Aim 1), and to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting SON in vivo (Aim 2).
Successful completion of this proposed study will significantly advance our knowledge of abnormal gene
expression in GBM and provide a fundamental rationale for future endeavors to develop SON inhibitors."

 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a deadly red blood cell (RBC) disorder estimated to affect over 300,000
newborns annually1. In SCD, mutated hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes2 and causes RBCs to become sickle-
shaped. SCD remains prevalent because heterozygous carriers (HbAS) are partially resistance to Plasmodium
falciparum malaria3,4, which causes 400,000 deaths annually5. I recently identified HbS polymerization in low
oxygen (O2) as the main driver in HbAS resistance to P. falciparum6. This should suggest homozygous HbSS
confers greater resistance to malaria, but paradoxically, infected SCD individuals (HbSS) have increased
malaria morbidity and mortality7-9. I propose a novel hypothetical model of SCD and malaria interaction in
which RBC factors, like fetal hemoglobin (HbF), that create a RBC reservoir in which little to no HbS
polymerization occurs, may enable severe malaria. Using a variety of SCD RBC cell types, I will map and
model the in vitro growth dynamics of P. falciparum in SCD erythrocytes and identify RBC factors that influence
malaria infectivity within this population. This work is foundational in elucidating the molecular mechanisms
underlying the interaction between SCD and malaria, and is a major first step in identifying novel treatment
targets for severe malaria, SCD, and its comorbidities.
 I am a pediatric hematologist co-mentored by Dr. Manoj Duraisingh and Dr. Caroline Buckee, both of
Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My long-term goal is to become an independent physician-
scientist investigating the effect of the RBC host on malaria growth and to target such factors therapeutically.
My prior research experiences have allowed me to acquire the cellular biology skills to investigate in vitro
malaria growth. Through the critical mentored K08 award, I am now well positioned to acquire new skills in
mathematical modeling and parasite genetics to better understand the epidemiology of hemoglobinopathies in
malaria endemic regions, assess the impact of the introduction of RBC polymorphisms within communities,
and find potential therapeutic targets for children with SCD that become infected with malaria. The Boston
Children's Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health are internationally recognized research
programs with a number of expert researchers in the areas of hemoglobinopathies, mathematical modeling,
and malaria. Boston Children's Hospital, my primary institution, has a distinguished record of training young
physician-scientists for leadership roles in pediatric hematology research. I have assembled an excellent
scientific advisory committee, consisting of Drs. Higgins, Goldberg, and Sankaran. Drs. Brugnara and Nathan,
will continue to serve as my career mentors and guide my research and training experiences. With the
structured mentoring, educational, and research plans detailed in this proposal, I will acquire the necessary
expertise to become a successful independent investigator with a focus on hemoglobinopathies and malaria."

BKV is a Polyomavirus that infects most of the human population. BKV typically establishes a lifelong,
asymptomatic, persistent infection. Occasionally healthy humans excrete a small number of BKV particles in
urine, and this, coupled with the fact that BKV grows productively in established kidney cell lines, has led to the
view that the virus persists in the urinary tract. While harmless in most cases, BKV can undergo productive
infection and induce an inflammatory response that results in serious diseases, including nephropathy and
hemorrhagic cystitis in immunosuppressed patients. There is little knowledge as to why BKV is tropic for the
kidney and whether its tropism is restricted to the urinary system. Furthermore, the factors governing the
equilibrium between BKV productive infection and persistent infection are unknown.
This application focuses on understanding the basis for cellular responses that lead to productive or persistent
infection. BKV undergoes a productive infection in primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTE),
characterized by extensive cell death and the release of about 40 infectious particles/cell. In contrast, BKV
establishes a low-level persistent infection in vascular endothelial cells (VEC), causing minimal cytopathic
effect with ~10% of the cells expressing viral proteins throughout two months of passaging. RNA-seq shows
that BKV induces many cell cycle genes regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors in both RPTE and
VEC. In addition, many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are upregulated in response to BKV infection of
VEC but not of RPTE.
This research will use human primary human VEC cultures to identify the factors that influence infection
outcomes: productive or persistent. Single cell transcriptomics will be applied to mock and BKV-infected VEC
to assess the response of cell subpopulations to infection and to identify genes that play a role in restricting
BKV replication. The activation of the interferon response by BKV infection in VEC will be assessed using both
molecular and functional (CRISPR knockout) approaches to identify components of the pathway that are
critical for limiting viral infection. Specific viral mutants will be used to determine what viral functions are
required for the induction of the interferon response, as well as at which stage of the viral infection ISGs are
induced. Click chemistry will be used to determine which cellular factors modulate the balance between
productive and persistent infection. A combination of approaches will be used to identify cellular genes that
distinguish restricted versus productively infected cells.
This work will significantly advance our knowledge of BKV pathogenesis by characterizing the viral interaction
with the innate immune system and by identifying cellular factors that promote or restrict BKV infection in a
cell-type specific manner and will provide insights useful for the design of antiviral agents."

The overarching goal of the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Coordinating Center has been to “break the
logjam” of fundamental knowledge gaps resulting in a 30+ year lack of progress on this lethal malignancy that
was designated a “recalcitrant cancer” by the US Congress and NCI. Our U24 Coordinating Center has done
this by promoting and facilitating information sharing, interaction, and collaborative research among NCI-
supported investigators studying SCLC. Over our initial five years of support, this Coordinating Center has
significantly increased research progress within the SCLC research community through efforts including, but not
limited to, the creation and ongoing expansion of comprehensive preclinical and clinical -omics databases,
centralized annotation and cataloging of available SCLC models, distribution and sharing of such models,
centralized data analytics, a centralized Consortium website, initiation and coordination of an interactive work-
in-progress (“WIPs”) forum as well as planning and oversight of annual meetings. Of all of this, the role of the
Coordinating Center in facilitating interactive WIPs (usually with ~100 attendees from dozens of institutions
including patient advocates) with unprecedented information and resource sharing, has made possible
tremendous progress in overcoming knowledge gaps, all of which are documented in a large number of peer
reviewed publications. This renewal application will continue the exceptional research momentum the SCLC
Consortium has generated, and build on this initial success through support of new initiatives. These include
centralized support for databasing and comparative analysis of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs),
and multi-parameter characterization of patient-derived xenograft models developed across the Consortium.
These additional resources will be of direct utility to the SCLC research community. As part of the U24 renewal,
given the remarkable growth in scope and diversity of SCLC research, we have developed a new multi-PI
structure including Charles Rudin (MSK), John Minna (UTSW), with addition of two exciting young SCLC
investigators who have contributed important new insights into SCLC molecular and cellular biology - Trudy
Oliver (University of Utah), and Lauren Byers (MDACC). All four have been personally very active both in the
U24 activities and in their own individual SCLC U01 and R01 research. The complementary strengths of this
leadership team cover all of the important areas of SCLC basic, translational, and clinical trials research. Dr.
Rudin will continue as contact PI, providing administrative leadership and coordination. We emphasize that the
products of the Consortium will ultimately benefit human health through fostering development of novel strategies
for disease prevention, early intervention, immune surveillance, metastasis suppression, and therapeutics."
10847486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All organisms must simultaneously balance multiple competing demands on their energetic and
physiological resources. This can result in conflict among traits, driving physiological and evolutionary
tradeoffs. Defense against infection and reproductive capacity are each under strong natural selection
as important contributors to evolutionary fitness, both are energetically demanding, and tradeoffs
between the two are nearly universal in plants and animals, including those with public health
importance. Yet despite their ubiquity and importance, surprisingly little is known about the mechanistic
basis for reproduction-immunity tradeoffs. This shortcoming in knowledge limits inference about the
evolutionary process and applies practical limitations on the capacity for interventions to control insect
pests in agricultural or public health contexts. The proposed project will use the tractable model insect
Drosophila melanogaster to determine mechanisms by which reproductive investment constrains
immune performance, exploring the evolutionary implications of the tradeoff and providing rare
understanding of how life history tradeoffs arise and are maintained. The project will test of the
hormonal theory of pleiotropy, which posits that endocrine signaling can act as a master regulator to
shape life history tradeoffs, with a focus on insect Juvenile Hormone (JH). Initial experiments will
determine the temporal kinetics of JH signaling in response to mating and the quantitative relationship
between JH signal intensity and degree of immune suppression. Subsequent experiments will
determine the mechanisms by which JH suppresses immunity, seeking to identify novel regulatory
processes, testing a hypothesis that the tradeoff can arise through strain on cellular infrastructure, and
determining whether immunosuppression can be decoupled from reproductive investment. Additional
experiments will test whether naturally occurring genetic variation in JH signaling determines natural
phenotypic variability in the magnitude of the reproduction-immunity tradeoff and whether energetic
investment required for reproductive output directly limits the quality of immune defense. The data
obtained will comprise an in-depth study of the focal system and will reveal principles that can be
generalized across diverse systems."

Dr. Razieh Khalifehzadeh for a career as an independent investigator. This program will build upon Dr.
Khalifehzadeh’s multidisciplinary background as a bioengineer scientist, trained in bioelectronics, biomaterials
and basic cancer research, by providing expertise in designing flexible and highly sensitive pressure sensors for
continuous wireless monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with brain tumors. The PI will be
mentored at Stanford Schools of Engineering and Medicine by Drs. Zhenan Bao (Main mentor, flexible and
wearable bioelectronics), Sanjiv S. Gambhir (co-mentor, cancer diagnosis, cancer bioengineering and cancer
nanotechnology), Heike Daldrup-Link (co-mentor, brain cancer imaging and therapy, and a leader in promoting
diversity), Ada Poon (collaborator, wireless bioelectronics), Melanie Hayden (collaborator, neurosurgery and

Brain tumors are usually associated with increased ICP. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of the elevated
ICP often results in irreversible neurological damage and even death. The overall goal of the proposed
research is to design highly sensitive and brain compatible pressure sensors that can wirelessly detect ICP
variations, as a generally neglected neurological marker in brain tumor patients. Recently, I developed ultrasmall
(3×3×0.1 mm3), flexible, and implantable pressure sensors that were effective for wireless monitoring of the ICP
variations in mice models of growing U87 brain tumor over their 30 day survival period. The key component of
these pressure sensors is an intermediate elastomer layer with a specific pressure-responsive micropattern that
defines the consistent sensitivity of these devices for long-term accurate measurements in the brain. In Aim 1 of
this project, I will study new designs for this elastomer layer, in order to further improve the sensitivity and long-
term electro-mechanical stability of my pressure sensors. Additionally, I will use experiments and simulations to
find alternative designs for more efficient wireless signal transfer (i.e., higher signal-to-noise ratios) from these
sensors. I will also develop a handheld wireless signal recording setup to enable recording and rapid analysis of
the wireless pressure data using a smartphone, for easier in vivo measurements and future point-of-care
applications. Aim 2 is focused on extending the post-implantation lifetime and brain compatibility of the sensors
by coating them with parylene (thickness ~ 1-4 µm). Parylene has been broadly used as a protective coating for
neuro-interface and cardiac assist devices to enhance their post-implantation lifetime. Finally, I will use these
sensors for continuous wireless monitoring of ICP variations in different mice models of brain tumors, with various
survival periods, depending on invasiveness of the tumor (Aim 3). MRI, simulations and histology will be used
to verify ICP measurements. These sensors are clinically needed for monitoring ICP in different brain diseases,
including tumors, and we envision that their versatile design will facilitate their clinical applications."

States. Individuals with ASD experience deficits in social communication along with restricted interests or
repetitive behavior. The severity and patterns of symptoms can vary greatly and be lifelong in duration. It is
unclear how the presentation of ASD changes from early childhood into adolescence or adulthood. The causes
of ASD are also unknown, though substantial evidence supports the contribution of both genetic and
environmental factors. Major gaps in knowledge exist because US studies to date have lacked the sample
size, depth of data collection, or appropriate life course timing to address important questions. The Study to
Explore Early Development (SEED) is now poised to overcome these limitations. SEED is a large case-control
study of children ages 2-5 years and their families, implemented across eight states over three phases. SEED
collected detailed data on children's core ASD symptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-occurring
conditions in early childhood, along with extensive risk factors related to maternal health and the perinatal
environment as well as genomics. The SEED sample includes ~2,044 children with ASD, 1,950 with non-ASD
developmental disabilities (DD), and 2,285 population control children (POP), making this the largest etiologic
study of ASD in the US. Recent ancillary studies - the SEED Teen Pilot and SEED COVID studies -- will soon
add data on adolescent health and the consequences of the pandemic, respectively, for some SEED
participants. The work proposed here, SEED Follow-up Studies (SEED FU), will maximize the impact of extant
SEED data through analyses that characterize ASD phenotypes and assess the potential interplay between
genetic and other risk factors. SEED FU will also facilitate new data collection in middle childhood,
adolescence and early adulthood to characterize changes in ASD phenotype across developmental stages,
and the associated health, educational, and service needs across the early life course. These data will further
enable prospective analyses of associations between early life factors and later childhood through early
adulthood outcomes. Studying risk factors in relation to life course phenotypic subgroups may also help
elucidate etiologies previously masked in ASD case-control studies. The WI SEED Team in combination with
the SEED Network's collaborative infrastructure and extensive extant data resources, will ensure the
successful implementation of the SEED FU Study in Wisconsin and contribute to success across the network.
SEED is well powered to make significant contributions to our understanding of the complex autism phenotype
and identifying factors associated with ASD risk in the population. The knowledge gained by SEED FU will
greatly advance our ability prevent adverse developmental outcomes and to support individuals with ASD and
their families to ensure optimal wellbeing through early adulthood."

Older adults experience a loss of mobility that leads to disability, which is a serious health care issue in an
aging US population. Furthermore, the incidence of mobility disability is greater in older African Americans
compared to Caucasians. The mechanisms behind these observations are not well understood.
We have shown that mitochondrial function is a key property of skeletal muscle that supports walking speed,
physical function, and cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reveal
lower levels of mitochondrial content and function, lower cardiorespiratory fitness and slowing walking speed
with aging. We recently demonstrated lower mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in African American
compared to Caucasian women that is associated with lower cardiovascular fitness and metabolic rate.
The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in age related changes in muscle oxidative capacity has not been
explored. Our novel preliminary data suggest that mtDNA haplotype is an important determinant of lower
mitochondrial function and cardiovascular fitness in African Americans. We have also shown that mtDNA
variants are associated with walking speed in older AA and C adults. Furthermore, recent studies have
revealed that change in peak VO2 in response to an exercise training program is associated with mtDNA
haplogroup. Based on these observations we hypothesize that mtDNA haplotype plays an important role in
cross sectional variation and more importantly, longitudinal declines in mitochondrial function, cardiovascular
fitness, and walking speed in older adults. Variations in mtDNA that have been shown to impact aging
phenotypes can be divided into 1) inherited variants, which are maternally inherited single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), many of which differentiate the mtDNA haplogroups, and many that do not, or 2)
acquired variation including heteroplasmy, or percentage of mutated vs normal mtDNA at any site across
genome and decreased mtDNA copy number that occurs with aging.
This ancillary study to The Study of Muscle, Mobility, and Aging will explore the role of inherited and acquired
variations in mtDNA in mitochondrial function from muscle biopsies in a large cohort of well phenotyped
humans. We will also explore the role of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMP) and crosstalk
between mitochondrial DNA and Nuclear DNA in the mitochondrial and physiological differences observed. We
will relate these findings to the clinically important endpoint of mobility in the entire cohort, as well as the role in
the greater mobility declines in mobility in African Americans.
Our study will be the first to show that mtDNA variation is predictive of greater declines in mitochondrial and
physiological function, which are associated with mobility disability. These findings could allow us to assess
mtDNA variation using a simple blood draw to identify those at risk for low function and to implement targeted
therapies, e.g., physical activity, which has been shown to improve mitochondrial function."

 Higher fatigability, the degree to which someone is physically or mentally limited due to fatigue, is common and
disabling in community-dwelling older adults. While fatigue associated with a disease can be ameliorated by
targeting the underlying condition, the causes and definitions of fatigability in older age are not well understood
and treatments are not available. Studies in older adults show associations with lower muscle mitochondrial
function and cardiopulmonary fitness; fitness and strength training can improve fatigability, but benefits are often
limited by poor motivation, reduced effort, and impaired locomotor factors (weight bearing pain, arthritis).
 Fatigability appears influenced by neuro-energetic processes, and specifically striatal dopamine (DA) signaling
and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Emerging pharmacologic and behavioral interventions promoting these
neuro-energetic processes also appear to reduce fatigability in young healthy adults. However, these findings
cannot be translated to older adults because the neuro-energetic contributions to fatigability have not been studied.
 We propose to address this gap in knowledge and examine the multi-systemic contribution (brain, muscle,
cardiopulmonary) to physical performance fatigability (PPF), defined as performance decline during a
standardized physical task. Our overarching hypothesis is that higher striatal DA, related networks’ activity, and
brain energy metabolism predict lower PPF in older adults; we also propose that these neural markers, individually
and in combination explain PPF beyond what is predicted by muscle energetic and cardiopulmonary function.
 Our recently optimized neuro-energetic imaging protocol uses a state-of-the-art MRI-PET scanner to
simultaneously measure striatal DA (PET), cerebral metabolic rate of O2 non-invasively (total brain MRI-based O2
extraction fraction, blood flow), resting state activity of striatal networks; and task-related activation (functional near-
infrared spectroscopy of prefrontal cortex during dual tasks). We are currently collecting this protocol at baseline in
150 participants of SOMMA (Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging),a 3 year longitudinal ongoing study. We propose
to relate these neuroimaging measures with objective PPF (slowing down during the fast paced 400m walk), cross-
sectionally and longitudinally over 3 years. We leverage the measures that SOMMA is already obtaining: a)
perceived fatigability (rating of perceived exertion at end of 5-min treadmill walk; Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale); b)
muscle mitochondrial function (biopsy, P31magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and mass; c) cardiopulmonary
function (VO2 peak, cardio-pulmonary exercise test); d) locomotor factors (sleep, pain, arthritis, BMI, comorbidities).
 This innovative research has high potential impact, because it will quantify energetic and metabolic processes in
brain, muscle, and cardiopulmonary systems, separately and in combination, in relation to fatigability. This study
offers an unprecedented opportunity for a cost-effective, longitudinal, multi-system assessment of determinants of
physical performance fatigability."
10848471,"Aging impairs both the responsiveness of bone cells to mechanical loading and the success of bone
healing following injury. Growing evidence indicates that these two phenomena are related: local
mechanical cues present in the cellular microenvironment (“mechanical microenvironment”) regulate
numerous aspects of bone healing, including recruitment and osteoblastic differentiation of marrow
stromal cells (MSCs). Importantly, studies by multiple groups of investigators have indicated that aged
cells remain mechanosensitive, but require higher stimulus magnitudes. Therefore, the focus of this
project is on directly manipulating the mechanical microenvironment during bone healing, via
customization of the architecture of additively manufactured (AM), osteoinductive, bioceramic
scaffolds, in order to identify how the cellular responses to local mechanical cues differ with age. The
hypothesis of this work is that tailoring of cellular mechanical microenvironments through advanced AM
scaffold design can rescue age-related impairments in bone regeneration. This work builds on
preliminary data demonstrating use of an innovative AM method to print mechanically robust ceramic
scaffolds of exceptionally tunable architectures with high porosity (>80%) and pore sizes large enough to
facilitate vascularization and osteogenesis in vivo. In Aim 1, we will compare the osteogenic responses
of young (12-week-old) vs. mature (77-week-old) vs. aged (104-week-old) murine MSCs to the
mechanical microenvironment within mechanically loaded scaffolds in vitro. The local mechanical cues
present in these scaffolds will be determined using finite element modeling and mechanical testing, and
the cellular responses evaluated using a novel combination of techniques including spatial assessment of
the progression of osteogenesis at the single-cell level. Aim 2 will leverage these analytical tools as well,
and will compare the bone regeneration responses to tailored mechanical microenvironments within
scaffolds implanted in young and aged mice. Together, these two aims address an area of high clinical
need and will fill critical gaps in knowledge regarding age-related changes in bone mechano-
responsiveness during healing. The outcomes of this work will lay the foundation for a new generation
of bone repair technologies that can accommodate alterations in cell behavior with aging and harness
cell mechano-sensitivity to promote osteogenic differentiation, bone tissue formation, and ultimately,
restoration of bone function following injury."

This is a new T32 application entitled “Supportive Multidisciplinary Addiction Research Training (SMART)”. The
broad goals of this program are to provide training in substance use disorder (SUD) research for postdoctoral
fellows engaged in translational research spanning very basic research programs to clinical trials. This T32 will
provide complementary training opportunities to ongoing large translational research efforts at the University of
Pittsburgh including the NIDA funded Center for Adolescent Reward, Rhythms and Sleep (CARRS), The
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD), Bridging Connections in Addiction Research (BCAR)
and the Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR). This T32 will allow postdoctoral
trainees to engage with both their primary mentor and a host of transdisciplinary faculty across the University of
Pittsburgh campus. Our university has a rich history in SUD research including multiple nationally and
internationally recognized experts in the field. Trainees will have the opportunity to learn from each other and a
multidisciplinary team through mentored laboratory training, journal clubs, didactic work and clinical experiences.
We will also provide support for trainees to present their research both here at university sponsored events such
as Pitt Psychiatry Research Day, and at national and international conferences such as the Society for
Neuroscience, The College on Problems of Drug Dependence and the Neurobiology of Addiction Gordon
Research Conference. We also provide unparalleled professional training through our weekly postdoctoral
Career & Research Development Seminars (CARDs) and associated writing blocks, giving trainees the
opportunity to gain valuable feedback on grant proposals from both faculty and their peers. This T32 will benefit
from both a University Advisory Board and an External Advisory Board which will provide yearly evaluations to
help strengthen our program. Trainees will regularly engage in training in the responsible conduct of research
provided here through the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). We are
highly committed to the training of underrepresented groups in biomedical research and plan not only targeted
recruitment but also enhanced mentor training and regular discussions of potential bias and obstacles to success
that trainees may encounter. In sum, our goal is to provide a diverse, inclusive, intellectual experience that will
provide the necessary skill set for a successful career in translational SUD research."

 The University of Michigan proposes the renewal of a predoctoral Chemistry-Biology Interface
(CBI) Training Program, whose overarching training mission is to implement effective approaches
to training and mentoring for students working across the chemistry-biology continuum. Our core
objectives remain to 1) recruit and retain high quality and diverse trainees, 2) provide a unique
interdisciplinary training experience that adds value to training from the home graduate program,
and 3) provide mentorship and training strongly supporting successful Ph.D. degrees and life-
long productive careers in a broad range of research related settings. The CBI Training Program
faculty includes chemical biologists, synthetic organic and inorganic chemists, bioorganic
chemists, bioanalytical chemists, mechanistic enzymologists, spectroscopists, and structural
biologists from eight departments. From these departments and one free-standing graduate
program a diverse cohort of talented and promising second-year PhD students will be selected
and appointed for two years. A total of 10 trainees per year for five years are requested.
 The CBI didactic component includes two core courses in Chemical Biology and a seminar.
This curriculum also includes a novel student sabbatical to be completed in an external, broadly
defined, research-related environment. Based on former trainee feedback on its outsized
influence on their careers, this experiential sabbatical program is one of the most unique and
impactful training opportunities available to University of Michigan CBI trainees. Additional CBI
career exploration and professional development occur via an annual symposium, invited career
and scientific speakers, and regular trainee meetings. Interactions at these latter monthly
meetings and close attention one-on-one mentoring promote a supportive and inclusive CBI
trainee community. Research opportunities for CBI trainees are widely varied across chemical
biology and include access to the most sophisticated techniques and cutting-edge instrumentation
in modern chemical biology research. Both research and classroom training emphasize
responsible conduct in research and strategies for conducting reproducible research with the
highest standards of scientific rigor. The ability to positively impact trainees is supported by an
emphasis on maintaining a diverse and inclusive training environment, expanding trainee
exposure to non-traditional careers, increasing mentor training, and extending career support
beyond the PhD period. Overall, the rationale for this integrated program is to provide the
supplemental interdisciplinary training, professional skills, and the career savvy for CBI trainees
to successfully advance chemical biology solutions to biomedical research problems."

Among the many causes of craniofacial disease are focal dystonias such as blepharospasm (BSP) and
oromandibular dystonia (OMD), affecting the eyes and jaw, respectively, as well as Meige Syndrome, which
combines features of both. Dystonia is the contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, that result in abnormal
postures and movement of the affected body parts. Craniofacial dystonias are poorly understood and have
limited treatment options. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the causes
of dystonia, that interferes with vision and communication, will help to point the way toward the development of
new treatment.
We hypothesize that craniofacial dystonia (CFD) may be caused by both rare and common genetic variants. To
identify monogenic variants, we will perform whole exome sequencing of multiplex families with CFD. To assess
the contribution of common variants to CFD, we will use genome-wide association data to compute polygenic
risk scores and then correlate these with disease-related imaging signatures derived from CFD patients to
identify gene networks that may be driving the altered brain connectivity. To probe the functional effects of
identified mutations, we will knock them into iPSC lines using genome editing tools and analyze their localizations
and protein:protein interactions in neural cells as initial readouts of their pathogenic potential. These analyses
will establish a cellular platform which we will also use for characterizing new craniofacial disease variants
identified by our combined genetics and imaging analyses."
10861737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a common, chronic, and debilitating condition in women.
The underlying cause of IC/BPS remains unknown. We recently published the first functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study comparing brain function in women with IC/BPS to healthy women. We found
that women with IC/BPS have altered resting activity in supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically, these
changes appear in a part of SMA that we have shown to control pelvic floor muscle activity (“pelvic-SMA”). Our
results provide the first explanation for extensive published reports of increased pelvic floor muscle activity in
women with IC/BPS. We hypothesize that we are observing evidence of an important theory of chronic pain:
motor cortical changes occur that are initially beneficial to increase protective muscle activity but are ultimately
maladaptive and perpetuate pain. Our goal is to reduce pain by improving brain activity and pelvic muscle
activity (making them more similar to healthy individuals). Using non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) directed at pelvic-SMA, we aim to determine if we can reduce pain (Aim 1), improve resting
brain activity (fMRI) and resting pelvic floor muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity in IC/BPS (Aim 2), and to
link the pain reductions to fMRI/EMG improvements to develop a causal mediation model of IC/BPS symptoms
(Aim 3). We will recruit 75 women with IC/BPS to participate in the study, and participants will be randomized
to 3 groups of 25 to test different rTMS paradigms: high-frequency (to increase excitability), low-frequency (to
decrease excitability), and sham (as a control). Our preliminary data suggest that high-frequency stimulation is
the best protocol since it improves resting pelvic-SMA activity while reducing pain and pelvic muscle activity.
These results are convergent with an independently-published preliminary study that suggests that 5
consecutive days of high-frequency stimulation can reduce IC/BPS pain relative to sham, even measured 3
weeks after the cessation of stimulation. We will extend these preliminary findings in the proposed work: in the
high-frequency and sham rTMS groups, we will study 5 consecutive days of stimulation with both shorter-term
outcome measures (associated with the first day of stimulation) and longer-term outcome measures (3 weeks
after the cessation of stimulation). In the low-frequency rTMS group, we will only examine shorter-term
outcome measures associated with a single session, since our preliminary data suggest that low-frequency
stimulation is active but perturbs pelvic-SMA and resting pelvic floor muscle activity away from values
associated with healthy controls and does not reduce pain. Our preliminary results agree with a large body of
literature suggesting that high-frequency rTMS applied to motor cortex is the best rTMS paradigm to reduce
pain. However, our proposed work has the potential to greatly innovate the field of brain stimulation for pain by
using sham and active comparison groups, as well as objective fMRI/EMG outcome measures, to define the
mechanism by which high-frequency stimulation can improve deficiencies in motor function in chronic pain."

Up to one million Americans undergo mechanical ventilation (MV) each year and are subject to high rates of
morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of high-quality evidence for therapies that improve outcomes,
adherence to best practices and patient outcomes remain variable. MV patients are nearly universally cared for
in intensive care units (ICUs), where interprofessional team-based care – involving physicians, respiratory
therapists, and nurses, among others – is the norm. Evidence for the benefits of team-based care has driven
recommendations from international societies to support this model; however, best practices for team
collaboration remain unknown. We have shown that physicians contribute to variability in outcomes of MV
patients, and other studies have demonstrated that specific nursing factors are associated with patient
outcomes. However, previous studies have not accounted for the entire team in assessment of individual
members. An improved understanding of the roles and contributions of different members of an ICU team
would inform practices and interventions that could improve patient outcomes in this high risk population. The
primary objective of this proposal, therefore, is to better understand the relative contributions of physicians,
nurses, and respiratory therapists individually and as teams to outcomes of patients who undergo MV. We will
use “value-added modeling” (VAM), an economic approach developed for empirical individual performance
measurement when multiple individuals work in a single process. VAM has been validated for measuring
performance of acute care nurses and is uniquely suited to this question, in that it accounts for the multiple
clinicians that influence outcomes of individual patients. We will achieve our objective through four aims. First,
we will apply VAM to model the relationship between clinicians and patient acuity in a broad population of MV
patients, in order to estimate relative clinician performance within each professional group. Second, we will
compare the contributions of physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist performance based on VAM across a
broad range of patient and economic outcomes. We will quantify the contributions of clinician performance
relative to patient factors using the omega statistic, a method for estimating the relative variance explained by
different variable groups in a multivariable model. Third, we will evaluate the performance of VAM in a second
patient population of MV patients admitted to a national sample of Veterans Administration acute care
hospitals, and in patients who do not undergo MV, to evaluate the generalizability of VAM methods to estimate
clinician performance. Fourth, we will identify clinician and team factors associated with higher performance
using a mixed-methods approach. This study will further our understanding of the relative clinician
contributions to patient outcomes using innovative modeling techniques, will contribute to the evidence base
for team-based care of critically ill patients, will advance the field of team effectiveness, and will directly lead to
future work to reduce care variability among the high-risk population of patients who undergo MV."

Hearing and voice are the principal instruments of human communication. Early auditory experience of speech
organizes perception around native language(s) sounds for life. This early specialization of auditory processing
facilitates language development and predicts adult proficiency. While the acoustic features of speech sounds
differ across languages, the temporal structure of speech is constrained and hierarchical in all languages. An
important goal in the pursuit to understand how we acquire and use speech and what goes wrong when we can’t
use speech is determining how auditory encoding on multiple time scales relates to vocal communication
structure, vocal learning and perception. We propose to integrate manipulations in vocal learning with precise
measures of cortical auditory encoding and perceptual skills to determine the encoding properties that promote
flexible learning of syllable structure and constrain the temporal organization of syllables (syntax), in songbirds.
The proposed experiments will identify neural mechanisms whereby vocal communication behavior is both
learned and genetically-determined. The significance of the proposed research to the NIH mission is three-fold.
First, this work will identify auditory encoding capacities that support vocal learning. Second, the work will test
the limits of vocal learning to identify neural and perceptual mechanisms that impose structure on the acoustic
features and temporal organization of vocal communication behavior. Third, our results will provide insights into
how manipulations of experience and training can improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of speech
deficits such as those observed in children with auditory spectrum disorders."
10836985,"Project Summary. CNTF mediates the increased SVZ neurogenesis that occurs in the mouse brain after
ischemic stroke. We will follow up on our finding that JNK in astrocytes represses CNTF expression and
neurogenesis in naïve mice, to test whether systemic treatment with JNK inhibitor can increase neurogenesis
after stroke. We will also block the highly related pro-inflammatory ligand IL-6, which we found reduces stroke-
induced neurogenesis, with a gp130 inhibitor. Secondly, we have discovered that blood levels of vitronectin
(VTN), produced by the liver, only increase in females after stroke, and leaks into the SVZ to induce IL-6 and
repress the neurogenic response. We will identify the mechanisms that regulate VTN, focusing on vagal nerve
stimulated muscarinic receptors and FAK. Thirdly, we discovered in males that castration caused an
unexpected and very robust effect by increasing basal levels of pro-neurogenic CNTF and decreasing
detrimental IL-6, and that this was retained after MCAO. We will define the differential signaling pathways
underlying this male-specific mechanism and test whether pharmacological blocking of testosterone would
increase neurogenesis in males. Aim 1 will determine whether a gp130 inhibitor promotes neurogenesis when
given at 6 h or 2 months after a stroke in adult and aged mice, and whether it acts by blocking IL-6. We will
also determine whether JNK inhibition would increase neurogenesis after stroke by increasing CNTF, and/or
whether JNK inhibitor would further enhance the neurogenic effects of SC144 after MCAO. Aim 2 will define
potentially female-specific mechanisms that regulate liver VTN, including FAK and muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors, testing pharmacological FAK inhibition and the role of the nervous system innervation of the liver
after MCAO. Aim 3 will define the signaling pathways that mediate testosterone’s effects on CNTF, LIF and IL-
6 expression in the SVZ after MCAO, and using intracerebral injection of testosterone after castration, with or
without FAK, JNK, ERK or p38 inhibitors, and whether a testosterone blocker can promote neurogenesis after
MCAO. These studies will build on our previous work to define novel fundamental intracellular signaling
mechanisms that repress and enhance the key cytokines CNTF and IL-6 involved in SVZ neurogenesis
following stroke."

Chronic (or persistent) postoperative pain (CPOP) is a potentially devastating outcome from an otherwise
successful surgical procedure. It affects millions of patients every year, with pain lasting for months to years,
resulting in patient suffering and resulting economic hardship. The surgeries with the highest incidence of chronic
postoperative pain are amputations, thoracotomies, cardiac, and breast surgery. Other risk factors include
preoperative pain, psychological factors, demographics, and the intensity of acute postoperative pain. Attempts
to prevent chronic postoperative pain have largely been unsuccessful, with no change in the incidence despite
increased use of regional and multimodal analgesia. Therefore, further research is needed to identify biomarkers
to accurately predict those at risk for developing chronic postoperative pain and treatments that reduce the
incidence. We hypothesize that Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) efficiency is predictive of who will
develop chronic postoperative pain. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for DNIC will
result in more efficacious treatments. We would expect that patients or animal models with less efficient DNIC
would be ‘at risk’ for developing chronic pain when exposed to the painful stimulus of surgery. Our overall
objectives in this application are to use a new model of persistent postoperative pain, the Dahl S rat, to investigate
the involvement of serotonin, catecholamine and dopamine systems on DNIC using pharmacologic,
chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches. We will also investigate which genetic polymorphism(s) are
responsible for the persistent postoperative pain experienced by the Dahl S rat. This will be accomplished in
three projects. Project 1: will determine the relationship between DNIC and CPOP. DNIC responses will be
abolished in Sprague Dawley rats and restored in Dahl S rats, and the resultant effects on postoperative pain
persistence ascertained. We will also test the hypothesis that the absent DNIC response in SS rats is a result
of increased nociceptive facilitation by serotonergic “on cells” in the rostral ventral medulla by optogenetically
inhibiting serotonergic neurons in the spinal cord. Project 2 will examine the role of periaqueductal gray
dopamine neurons on DNIC and postoperative pain using a Dahl S rat expressing a novel variant of the
Catecholamine-O-methyltransferase gene that increases dopaminergic tone. Project 3 will use a powerful
physiologic genomics approach, the use of consomic and congenic rats, to identify the gene polymorphism(s)
responsible for the absent DNIC response and persistent postoperative pain exhibited by Dahl S rats. We expect
our studies to provide genetic and phenotypic biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions in chronic
postoperative pain."

Musculoskeletal trauma is highly prevalent in both combat-wounded and civilian patients, and despite advances
in trauma care, mortality and complication rates remain remarkably high. Patients who do not respond to
treatment or suffer from complications, experience poor healing, longer hospital stays, increased treatment costs,
and prolonged disability. Recently, systemic immune dysregulation and immunosuppression has been implicated
in the limited success of current intervention strategies and poor outcomes in trauma patients. Systemic immune
dysregulation and immunosuppression results in decreased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and
a decrease in circulating immune effector cells, such as effector T cells. Another notable hallmark of systemic
immune dysregulation is elevated levels of immune suppressor cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs). Our overall objectives are to investigate (i) how the development of systemic immune dysregulation
and immunosuppression relates to functional bone regeneration and (ii) how systemic immunomodulation
impacts the immune system and regenerative outcomes following severe musculoskeletal trauma. We will meet
these objectives through the following specific aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Characterize the development of
systemic immune dysregulation and immunosuppression in a pre-clinical composite trauma model and
identify immunological markers predictive of poor healing. Using a composite bone/muscle trauma pre-
clinical model, we will longitudinally characterize systemic immune dysregulation biomarkers via flow cytometry
and multi-analyte serum proteomic profiling and then utilize nonlinear evolutionary multivariate analytics to
develop predictive models of functional bone regeneration. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Fabricate and optimize an
immunomodulatory therapeutic to target and deplete MDSCs. We will develop synthetic gold nanoparticles
functionalized with both Fc-mimicking and MDSC-targeting ligands that can mimic mAb function (SNAbs) and
optimize their multivalency, Janus orientation, and size for MDSC depletion. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Evaluate the
effect of systemic immunomodulation on the immune system status and bone regeneration in vivo
following severe musculoskeletal trauma. We will test the hypothesis that targeted depletion of MDSCs will
restore immune homeostasis and promote functional bone regeneration."

Aging is the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, the
underlying molecular mechanism that link mechanisms of aging to ADRDs are unknown. To develop
geroprotectors, drugs that target aging and could be used to treat ADRDs we developed a neuro-centric
geroscience platform to identify Gero-Neuro-Protectors (GNP), geroprotectors that extend lifespan and
simultaneously protect neurons from multiple age associated toxicities. GNPs should make ideal treatments
for ADRDs. Increasing lifespan alone, without treating dementia, will only delay disease onset or even prolong
disease duration, and thus worsen the ADRD problem, which is the consequence of ever increasing lifespans.
We present a proof of principle GNP, J147 and show that it extends lifespan, prevents memory loss, and even
restores memory when treatment is initiated in 20-24 month old wild type or symptomatic APPswe mice. We
propose a testable model in which J147 protects neurons from ongoing proteotoxic stress by lowering ATP
synthase activity, shifting energy metabolism towards glycolysis accompanied by accumulation of acetyl-CoA.
Accumulating acetyl-CoA leads to increased H3K9 histone acetylation and protects synapse related gene
expression from transcriptional drift -the age-associated deterioration of transcriptional programs- and
consequently from functional decline. In the following proposal we will test this model in detail by conducting
neuropathology, electrophysiology and behavioral assays in aged wild type mice and two mouse models of
ADRD. We show that these effects are evolutionarily conserved and that lowering ATP synthase activity
extends lifespan in M. musculus, D. melanogaster and C. elegans. As both, ATP synthase and the age-
associated transcriptional drift of synaptic genes are evolutionarily conserved from M. musculus to C. elegans
we will use C. elegans to identify the chromatin remodeling factor that controls synapse related gene
expression in aging and how it respond to mitochondrial insults. We will validate the role of the identified factor
in controlling chromatin on synaptic promoters in primary neurons, aged wild type mice and mouse models of
ADRD. Finally, we will expand our GNP concept to profile geroprotective compounds identified by the
intervention testing program (ITP) for their ability to protect neurons from different age-associated toxicities and
to identify combinations of geroprotectors that are complementary in their protective effects. Because ADRDs
are complex diseases with multiple pathological aspects that are unlikely to be addressable by a single drug,
we predict rationally designed combinations of geroprotectors to outperform individual geroprotectors.
Together these studies will provide deep insights into how aging and ADRDs compromise synapse function
and how this can be addressed by treatment with single GNPs or rational GNP combinations."
10837116,"The biggest biomedical challenge of this century is the restoration of diseased organs and tissues. Unlike
humans, salamanders have the extraordinary ability to rapidly regenerate organs, including limbs, spinal cords,
hearts and brains. Our goal is to discover how these animals rebuild functional adult tissues in a matter of weeks.
From development through degeneration – the health and function of our organs depends on production of
appropriate tissue-specific proteins. Yet, our current understanding of regeneration is largely based on studies
of mRNA and not on direct assessment of proteins that are ultimately required for repair. This is in part due to
technical limitations – microarray and RNA-Seq technologies revolutionized our understanding of transcription-
but until recently we lacked the tools to study translation of mRNA into protein at the same scale and resolution.
The Mexican axolotl is famous for its lifelong “youthfulness”. Axolotls share with other salamanders the surprising
and incompletely understood ability to regrow entire limbs after amputation. By combining cutting-edge methods
in translation research, we were able to demonstrate that, unlike in mammals, severe injury in the axolotl
surprisingly results in rapid activation of protein synthesis at a time when there is little cellular proliferation. This
unusual molecular response is a feature specific to regenerative vertebrates and relies on activation of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Moreover, we find that remarkably fewer than 20% of all
axolotl mRNAs are translated at any given time, the remainder exist in a ‘free’ state outside the translation
machinery. We will test the hypothesis that the ‘free’ transcripts in the axolotl may be spatially organized into
membrane-less compartments comprised of functionally-related and translationally co-regulated mRNAs and
that transcripts critical for cell survival and cell fate specification shuttle between these compartments and the
ribosome to facilitate wound healing and regeneration. We have further identified that control of protein synthesis
at the time of regeneration is highly dependent on the ability of the Axolotl to surpass a stress activating signal
and instead promote activation of the mTOR pathway. We will test the hypothesis that the structural/sequence
specific differences in Axolotl mTOR components can shed light on functional differences in upstream regulation
of protein synthesis between species and the remarkably ability to repurpose a ‘stress-response’ signal to a
‘growth and regeneration’ signal. These findings suggest the possibility that poor healing in mammals may be
due to a distinct cellular signaling response at the site of injury rather than to an inherent lack of regenerative
potential. Lastly, we have found that amputation of the limb in the axolotl triggers selective translation of some
ribosomal proteins but not others, coincident with the “burst” in protein synthesis. We will therefore test the bold
hypothesis that axolotls may assemble distinct subsets of specialized ribosomes to facilitate selective expression
of transcripts critical for wound healing and regeneration. Together, this proposal seeks to provide a novel
mechanistic understanding as to why some species can regenerate while others cannot."

We understand very little of how invasive fungal pathogens overcome host blocks to infection, yet such infections
are among the most challenging to diagnose and treat. Our focus is the most common cause of fungal meningitis,
Cryptococcus neoformans. Macrophages and other myeloid cells are critical for killing pathogens and promoting
immune responses. Within the initial site of Cryptococcal infection, the lung, multiple populations of myeloid
cells exist, including alveolar macrophages (AMs), interstitial macrophages (IMs), monocytes, and neutrophils.
Importantly, a type 2 immune response is triggered by C. neoformans infection and mediates increased
susceptibility to Cryptococcal infection. We observed that incubation of C. neoformans with murine bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMDMs) results in induction of arginase-1 (Arg1) a marker for type 2 responses. Through
forward genetics, we identified a C. neoformans secreted protein, CPL1, required for Arg1 induction and
virulence in vivo. Remarkably, recombinant CPL1 protein is sufficient to induce Arg1 expression in BMDMs in
vitro and to boost the bona fide M2 response to the type 2 cytokine IL-4. Correspondingly, CPL1 is critical for C.
neoformans to activate Arg1 in interstitial macrophages in vivo. TLR4, known best as an LPS receptor but which
is also a poorly-understood mediator of type 2 responses, is required for CPL1 to act on BMDMs. As TLR4 does
not directly couple to the key type 2 transcription factor STAT6, we sought indirect mechanisms of action.
Salmonella promotes M2 polarization via a secreted effector, steE, that activates STAT3 by mimicking cytokine
signaling. Indeed, we found STAT3 to also be required for Arg1 induction by CPL1. These data lead to the
following working model: 1) CPL1 promotes macrophage polarization indirectly by weakly activating TLR4 to
produce cytokines that activate STAT3, and 2) cooperation between STAT3 and the key type 2 regulator STAT6
leads to enhanced macrophage polarization to drive virulence. To test this model, we have assembled a
collaborative team with expertise in fungal pathogenesis and immunology. Through Aim 1, we will elucidate
mechanisms by which CPL1 promotes macrophage polarization in vitro. We will test the model that CPL1 boosts
the M2 response via STAT3-STAT6 cooperation, and we will investigate how CPL1 functions through TLR4.
Through Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CPL1 polarizes lung interstitial macrophages in vivo, thereby
producing a replicative niche. We will investigate the role of TLR4 in the macrophage/monocyte compartment,
and we will use thick section imaging and other modalities to test predictions of the model that CPL1 acts locally
to promote macrophage polarization to enable pathogen replication. These studies have the potential to
transform our understanding how an invasive fungal pathogen reprogram the innate immune system to its
advantage."
10837122,"Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought
to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory
role in neural circuitry and behaviors. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial
cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions
to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates
breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders.
All these results provide strong rationale for studying astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented
insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can
be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets.
Although there is a moderate understanding of functional significance of astrocytes, a mechanistic and
comprehensive understanding of the active functional roles of astrocytes in neural circuitry and behaviors is
largely lacking. One major challenge in deciphering the functional roles of astrocyte is its complex signaling
patterns resided in both spatial and temporal domains. Funded by last award, we have developed an event-
decomposition framework and the method AQuA (Astrocyte Quantification and Analysis) to model the complex
astrocyte signaling. AQuA was considered as a paradigm shift and turning point for astrocyte analysis by multiple
review papers and is now widely used by many labs in the world.
With the technical advances largely enabled by BRAIN Initiative, large-scale, multiplex imaging and manipulation
of multiple circuit components in astrocyte-neuron network are now feasible. The increased complexity and
amount of imaging dataset demand further development of powerful computational tools beyond AQuA. The
large volume whole-brain activity data and the new imaging capability of signals beyond Ca2+ require significant
improvements in speed, scalability, accuracy, and flexibility. The simultaneous recording of multiple intra/extra-
cellular signals calls for new modeling framework and computational methods. Thus, building on our previous
success, the overarching goal of this renewal project is to further develop novel computational methods and
analytical tools to decode the functional roles of astrocytes in neural circuits and behavior.
We will team up with experimental biologists to prototype, validate and integrate our computational tools with
wet-lab experiments across species and biological questions. We expect a team science of close collaborations
between computational and experimental scientists will enable new discoveries. Ultimately, a successful
outcome will significantly enhance our mechanistic and theoretical understanding of astrocyte function in neural
circuitry and behaviors. These understandings will be essential to development of new therapeutic drugs and
strategies, which haven’t been changed in the past 30 years for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Microorganisms residing in the intestinal lumen have a significant impact on brain function and behavior.
Perturbation of microbe-gut-brain communication is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of well-known
gut-brain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and related functional GI disorders. However, there
is lack of understanding of the precise microbial mechanisms and the cellular pathways that allow gut microbes
to communicate with the brain. To address this critical knowledge gap, the applicant has pioneered the zebrafish
system for the study of microbe-gut-brain communication. Using in vivo real-time measurements of cell activity
in zebrafish, the applicant’s recent research revealed that specific gut bacteria directly activate specialized
sensory cells in the intestine epithelium, enteroendocrine cells (EECs), through the receptor transient receptor
potential ankyrin A1 (Trpa1). Microbial, pharmacological, or optogenetic activation of Trpa1+EECs directly
activates enteric neurons and stimulates vagal sensory ganglia. Preliminary studies identified a distinct subset
of bacterial derived tryptophan catabolites as novel agonists that potently activate Trpa1. The objective of the
proposed research is to determine the precise molecular mechanism by which enteric bacteria activate the EEC-
vagal sensory pathway to modulate brain activity. The central hypothesis is that bacterial secreted tryptophan
catabolites stimulate Trpa1 in EECs to activate vagal sensory neurons through a novel EEC secreted signal
peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (Pacap). To test this, the applicant will first use
molecular microbiology and zebrafish gnotobiotic approaches to define the microbial pathway and mechanism
that activates EEC Trpa1 signaling. Second, the applicant will use in vivo vagal calcium imaging, optochemical
and genetic manipulation to identify the specific subtype of EECs that transmit enteric bacterial information to
the vagus. Finally, the applicant will use pharmaceutical, genetic and cell transplantation approaches to define
the EEC signaling peptide that transmits bacterial information from the gut lumen to the vagus. The proposed
research is expected to make a significant new contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
and cellular pathways by which enteric bacteria communicate with the brain. The interdisciplinary experimental
approach together with the comprehensive career development plan will extend the applicant’s training from
gastroenterology into vagal and brain physiology as well as molecular microbiology. A diverse team of
established investigators at Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill, with expertise ranging from host-microbe
interaction to gut-brain physiology to bacteriology, will oversee the applicant’s career development during the
award period by contributing intellectually to her research training, providing mentorship, and offering career
advice. This 5-year career development award will provide the applicant with the necessary professional and
scientific skills to be an independent and successful microbiota-gut-brain scientist."
10837144,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a significant challenge in treating myocardial infarction (MI), the leading
cause of death in the United States. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generated by electron
transport chain (ETC) Complex-I are the principal mediators of IR injury. Excess mtROS generated during
early IR triggers vicious cycles of free radical production promoting cardiomyocyte death. Therefore,
understanding the early molecular events of reperfusion will provide new targets for developing novel
interventions for limiting cardiac injury. Our published findings show that LonP1- a major mitochondrial stress
response protease mitigates oxidative stress-induced damage during early IR; therefore, LonP1 could be a
promising target for attenuating reperfusion injury. Our long-term goal is to leverage the mitochondrial protein
quality control mechanisms of LonP1 as a pivotal point to develop therapeutic strategies for mitigating IR injury
and post MI- heart failure. Our published findings show that increased LonP1 expression in the heart induced
by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or transgenic overexpression (LonTg) reduced IR injury and favors
cardioprotection. Whereas, LonP1 downregulation (LONP1+/-) abrogated IPC-mediated cardioprotection.
Importantly, LonTg hearts showed reduced levels of Complex-I subunits (but not Complex II-V subunit) and
oxidative damage during early IR (within 30 min reperfusion) compared to NTg controls. Conversely, our
additional findings show that LonP1 downregulation in cardiomyocytes upregulated Complex-I activity,
increased superoxide levels, and showed early reperfusion-induced cell death activation. In addition, we have
identified a small molecule activator of LonP1 that significantly reduced hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) induced
myocyte death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. With additional data on IR-induced acetylation of
Complex-I matrix subunits and LonP1 dependent Complex-I remodeling during IR, we hypothesize that LonP1
mitigates myocardial injury by suppressing excess mtROS generation through tight regulation of Complex-I
during early IR. We will test our hypothesis by the following specific aims: Aim 1 will delineate the
mechanism(s) by which LonP1 modulates Complex-I levels, activity and reduces oxidative stress during IR.
Aim 2 will test that LonP1 remodels Complex-I and its associated supercomplexes by degrading IR-induced
post-translationally modified (PTM) Complex-I matrix subunits, thereby reduce mtROS during early IR. Aim 3
will determine the therapeutic potential of LonP1 activators in treating myocardial IR injury in vivo. By
determining the molecular mechanisms of LonP1-mediated cardioprotection and the therapeutic potential of
LonP1 activators, we will define the role of LonP1 in cardioprotection and develop novel therapeutic tools and
strategies to mitigate IR injury."
10837149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hazardous drinking and chronic pain are both highly prevalent and frequently comorbid public health
conditions that exact a significant burden on patients, providers, and health care systems.1,2 Indeed, non-Latinx
Black adults with chronic pain are more likely to report greater pain intensity, increased avoidance of activities
due to pain, greater fearful thinking related to pain, and greater physical and psychological disability in the
context of their chronic pain experience when compared their non-Latinx White counterparts.3-6 Despite there
being lower rates of drinking among non-Latinx Black adults, they experience greater negative consequences
(e.g., alcohol dependence symptoms and social consequences) for drinking than non-Latinx White adults.7
Additionally, compared to their non-Latinx White counterparts, alcohol-dependent non-Latinx Black adults have
an increased likelihood of experiencing recurrent and persistent alcohol dependence.8 Minority stress-based
models of substance use and mental health outcomes posit that marginalized groups, such as non-Latinx
Black adults, are vulnerable to problematic substance use via common racial/ethnic microaggressions (MAs),
defined as verbal or non-verbal indignities that insult or put down people because of their race/ethnicity.9
Extant work among non-Latinx Black individuals has only initially documented the negative impact of MAs on
alcohol use.10 There is a need to understand the longitudinal nature of MAs and alcohol use motivation (i.e.,
greater alcohol craving, intention to drink, and coping-oriented motives for alcohol use) and drinking (i.e.,
greater alcohol consumption, greater frequency of drinking, and more negative consequences from drinking)
among non-Latinx Black adults who are hazardous drinkers with chronic pain. The proposed research project
supports the 2017-2021 strategic plan of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) by
advancing research in two of the key areas. First, the current proposal has the goal of improving strategies to
prevent alcohol misuse, alcohol use disorder, and alcohol-related consequences among an ‘at-risk’ population
for these conditions (goal 3). Second, it enhances the public health impact of NIAAA-supported research, by
focusing on one of the largest demographics in the US who demonstrate disparities in hazardous drinking (goal
5). Further, the proposal contributes to research on health disparities and comorbidities, which represent two of
the cross-cutting research themes of NIAAA.

 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that are crucial for host defense from viral infections
and tumor cells. The ability of NK cells to recognize and kill malignant cells provides a strong premise to advance
them as a cellular therapy in the clinical setting. While NK cell-based therapies are being explored in clinical
trials, issues with persistence and in vivo functionality have been identified as limitations to their clinical
application. Our lab pioneered cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) NK cells that are generated after brief
activation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. This overcomes many of the shortcomings of conventional NK cells as a
cellular therapy. ML NK cells exhibited enhanced functionality, cytotoxicity, and persistence in a phase I clinical
trial for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with many patients achieving complete remissions from this novel
intervention. Despite the translational advancement, there is little known about the underlying mechanisms of
ML reprogramming in NK cells. Clarifying the molecular programs that drive the ML phenotype will have broad
implications for optimizing NK cells as a cellular-based therapy for hematological malignancies.
 The proposed project aims to better understand the mechanisms of ML NK cell differentiation with a focus
on the role of EOMES. EOMES is a T-box transcription factor (TF) that is essential for NK cell development from
hematopoietic stem cells and has been implicated in generating memory in CD8+ T cells. Data from our lab
demonstrated that EOMES deletion prior to activation with cytokines abrogated ML NK cell differentiation,
suggesting that EOMES plays a key role in ML reprogramming. We hypothesize that activation with IL-12/15/18
triggers a molecular reprogramming of conventional NK cells to ML NK cells mediated by EOMES to induce a
unique transcriptional profile and poised epigenetic state, which facilitates the enhanced functionality of ML NK
cells upon restimulation by cytokines or a tumor cell. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on determining the memory
differentiation phase that requires EOMES. Specifically, we will assess the requirement of EOMES during
initiation (prior to IL-12/15/18 activation) and differentiation (after IL-12/15/18 activation) using CRISPR/Cas9
deletion. Aim 2 focuses on defining the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape induced by EOMES in the
different phases of ML reprogramming through CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown, single-cell RNAseq, and single-nuclei
ATACseq, as well as defining the genes regulated by EOMES in ML NK cells using Cut&Run. Together, these
results will reveal mechanisms of ML NK cell differentiation driven by EOMES, further advancing the potential of
ML NK cell therapies and enhancing our understanding of ML NK cell biology."

A portion of the genetic component of Alzheimer disease (AD) is explained by genes identified by positional
cloning, targeted gene analysis, GWAS and next generation sequencing approaches. With few notable
exceptions, the functional variants in these genes and precise pathogenic mechanisms by which these variants
lead to AD are unknown. We will continue to direct our efforts on persons of African ancestry (AA), a group
with a high incidence of dementia but studied much less than persons of European ancestry (EA). We will
leverage rich AD-related endophenotype and other risk factor data from the largest collection of AAs
assembled by us, the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and Alzheimer Disease Sequencing
Project (ADSP) for genetic studies of AD to promote further discovery of AD-related genes and variants as well
as their mechanisms of action leading to AD. Previously, we demonstrated significant association of AD with
SORL1, AKAP9, and other genes in AAs using standard and novel analytic approaches. In the next project
period, we will perform RNA sequencing on brain tissue obtained from more than 140 AA AD cases and
controls, and analyze these data using state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches to assess the influence of AD
risk variants on gene expression. We will construct AA-specific Bayesian elastic-net models of genetically-
mediated gene expression using the AA brain cohort genotype and RNAseq data. These models will be
applied to AA cohorts from the ADGC and ADSP (total n=9,200) using PrediXcan to construct AA-specific
expression predictions In addition, we will identify non-genetic mediators of genetic influences on AD risk by (1)
performing gene ˣ environment GWASs of AD in AAs using data for several established AD risk factors using
data from the ADGC/ADSP, UK Biobank and Million Veterans Program; (2) applying mendelian randomization
to assess the causal relationship between diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
obesity and AD in AAs using existing GWAS summary statistics for these traits in AAs; and (3) conducting a
phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify pleiotropy by deriving a polygenic risk score for AD in
AAs and testing its association with a range of phenotypes within the UK Biobank. We will also perform in vitro
experiments (including knockdown by siRNA, gene and protein over-expression, immunofluorescence, and
ELISA) in human neuronal cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons containing AA AD risk
variants inserted by CRISPR to understand how genetic variation in AKAP9 and other promising genes leads
to AD-related pathologic states as well as to provide models that can be used in small molecule drug screens
for potential AD treatments."
10854804,"We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local
field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain
stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some
clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a
target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor
disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is
to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols
that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication
signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out
of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP
oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with
changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional
LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in
another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and
phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device.
Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS-
like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application-
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks
with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking
capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec)
will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec
has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in-
human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5
years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining.
Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology
commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical
device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market.
Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both

10854805,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Although HIV infection is controllable with antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV cure continues to be
extremely elusive. Cure of HIV is desperately needed for many reasons. People with HIV (PWH) have persistent
increases in morbidity and mortality despite ART, and while newer ART agents have become better tolerated,
they are still associated with multiple side effects. Having to attend HIV clinics and take ART over the long term
still carries significant stigma for PWH. Additionally, many PWH have a preference for cure rather than a lifetime
of ART, and some would take significant risks to achieve a cure. For all of these reasons, finding a cure for HIV
is one of the ultimate goals of the field.
 There is a large and growing body of evidence that the central nervous system (CNS) is an HIV reservoir
site that represents another barrier to HIV eradication. HIV DNA is commonly found in brain tissue from PWH on
suppressive ART, and there are multiple published reports of CNS virologic escape. Multiple studies, including
from our group, have demonstrated that HIV RNA can be detected at very low levels in CSF during suppressive
ART and that anti-HIV antibodies are also present in the CSF among individuals on ART. New members of our
group recently presented findings with an innovative assay (Double-R) to reliably quantitate HIV RNA and DNA
from CSF.
 Our group has performed extensive pre-clinical and clinical work on the Janus Kinase (Jak 1/2) inhibitor
drug class to target HIV. This includes work on baricitinib, an FDA approved orally bioavailable Jak 1/2 inhibitor
for rheumatoid arthritis. We have demonstrated that baricitinb blocks HIV replication, HIV-induced activation and
infection in key CNS cells, and reservoir reseeding. In vivo, we have shown in our murine model that baricitinib
decreases CNS HIV and reverses behavioral abnormalities conferred by HIV. We have also demonstrated that
baricitinib achieves therapeutic CNS concentrations in the rhesus macaque model. We now propose to study
baricitinib as a therapy to decrease the HIV CNS reservoir in a study of PWH with durable virologic suppression
on ART. This will be a phase IIa randomized placebo controlled study. Our primary hypothesis is that individuals
randomized to baricitinib will be more likely to achieve a decrease in CSF cell associated HIV RNA and DNA by
Double-R assay. We also hypothesize that baricitinib treatment will be associated with a significant decrease in
other markers of HIV CNS persistence, including HIV-specific CSF antibodies, CSF cell associated DNA
including by Integrated Proviral DNA (IPDA), CSF RNA by single copy assay, CSF HIV Tat levels, and markers
of inflammation that have been linked to CNS HIV persistence, as well as magnetic resonance imaging and
spectroscopy markers. Additionally, we hypothesize that baricitinib treatment will be safe for the CNS as defined
by neuropsychological performance, depression symptoms, and neuronal damage. We are confident that this
study will provide a strong basis for baricitinib to be included in regimens that target eradication of HIV."

Behavioral and social sciences researchers continue to struggle to reach, sample, count, engage and retain
participants from socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups, or hard-to-reach populations. Hard-to-reach
populations are often those experiencing health disparities for many diseases and conditions. Such populations
include: persons experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity, chronic mental illness, out of school youth,
sex workers, trafficked adolescent girls, undocumented immigrants, gang members, street children, people who
use drugs, racial/ethnic minorities, and sexual and gender minorities such as transgender persons and men who
have sex with men. There are many reasons why these groups are not fully represented or included in behavioral,
social sciences, and clinical research. One reason is the lack of training on state-of-the-art methodologies to
sample hard-to-reach populations and the advance statistical skills to analyze complex survey data within formal
training programs. Moreover, the advanced methods needed to estimate their numbers are not taught in
conventional behavioral, public health, and social sciences degree programs. These fundamental skills are
needed to advance multiple lines of research to end health disparities, to be more inclusive of diverse populations
in research, and to efficiently obtain samples of hard-to-reach populations in large enough numbers necessary
for statistically powerful study designs. Many innovations for engaging, recruiting, and sampling hard-to-reach
populations originate from HIV research but remain underutilized in other areas of behavioral and social sciences
research. This H2R training grant will capitalize on our >15 years of research with hard-to-reach populations at
risk for HIV, and a recent successful initiative, the Sampling Knowledge Hub at UCSF, to establish a core of
short courses, strengthen mentorship, and initiate lines of research among hard-to-reach populations for trainees
and mentors among graduate students and junior researchers at universities and public health practitioners of
health departments in Northern California."

Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive, typically fatal subtype of B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
(NHL) characterized by t(11;14) leading to Cyclin D1 (CCND1) overexpression, a key diagnostic feature of this
disease. However, murine models over-expressing CCND1 do not develop B-cell lymphoproliferation
characteristically seen in human MCL. The SOX11 transcription factor is overexpressed in >90% of MCL tumor
samples and associated with poor prognosis, however understanding of SOX11 function in vivo has been
limited by a lack of animal models. We have therefore developed, extensively characterized and published our
Eμ-SOX11-EGFP mouse model in Blood 2018 May 17;131(20):2247-2255. Eμ-SOX11-EGFP mice develop
an increase in clonal B cells in the spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood, with an aberrant
immunophenotype (CD5+CD19+CD23-) and increased BCR signaling identical to human MCL.
To accurately model human MCL, where both CCND1 and SOX11 are overexpressed, we have now developed
an additional MCL mouse model by crossing Eμ-CCND1 mice with Eμ-SOX11-EGFP. The SOX11-induced
phenotype we observe in Eμ-SOX11-EGFP mice is dramatically enhanced in the double transgenic mice, leading
to a lethal phenotype with significantly reduced survival as compared to Eu-SOX11 mice. Our overall hypothesis
is that the overexpression of SOX11 increases BCR signaling and cooperates with CCND1 through its
transcriptional targets in MCL pathogenesis. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1, we define the mechanism by
which SOX11 increases BCR signaling in MCL. In Aim 2, we will determine efficacy of molecular probes inhibiting
SOX11-DNA binding in vitro and in vivo models of BTKi or BCL2i resistant MCL. In Aim 3, we determine the
mechanism by which SOX11 cooperates with CCND1 in vitro and in vivo to drive MCL.
The therapeutic advantages of inhibiting SOX11 may be substantial, as the majority of MCL patients still relapse
after immune-chemotherapy and die despite the advent of novel targeted therapeutics such as BTKi or BCL2i.
We have recently identified through structural modeling of SOX11, a family of novel small molecule probes that
inhibit the SOX11-DNA interaction with potent anti-MCL cytotoxicity in vitro. We have exciting preliminary data
consistent with our hypothesis to demonstrate that SOX11i can overcome BTKi and BCL2i resistance in vitro.
Prof. Michael Wang, a leading MCL researcher and a co-investigator in this proposal, has developed patient-
derived BTKi-resistant and BCL2i-resistant primary MCL cells and corresponding PDX murine models.
Our proposal brings together complementary elements including unique transgenic animal models, unique
molecular probes inhibiting SOX11, patient-derived primary MCL models resistant to current standard of care,
and functional studies for expanding our understanding of MCL pathogenesis to identify new targets and
therapeutic options for patients with this challenging disease."

The goal of this project is to understand how CD53 regulates B cell trafficking, and to determine the CD53-
partner network underlying this process. CD53 is a member of the tetraspanin family of transmembrane proteins
that organize multi-protein networks on the cell surface to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes such as
proliferation, homing and survival. Loss of CD53 is associated with impaired immune system function. CD53 is
highly expressed on both normal and malignant B cells, however its role in these cells is not clear. We previously
reported that CD53 is required for normal B cell development in the bone marrow. In preliminary data, we now
find that CD53 is essential to both normal and malignant B cell trafficking, with the loss of CD53 causing
significant impairment in B cell adhesion, migration, bone marrow homing and antibody production. To
understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have determined the crystal structure of CD53; in the
entire tetraspanin family, this the first structure captured in an active conformation. We reveal how conformational
changes influence CD53 partner interactions by mass spectrometry (MS) based footprinting. We have used
proximity labeling to identify several candidate CD53 partners, whose functions link chemokine signaling to cell
motility. These data support our hypothesis that CD53 coordinates a complex of adhesion, signaling and cell
motility proteins that facilitate B cell trafficking. Both normal and malignant B cells rely on accurate trafficking to
their niches in the bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs to optimize their maturation and function. Thus,
an understanding of the interactions that guide B cell trafficking are important not only for optimizing normal B
cell function, but will also reveal potential therapeutic targets of malignant B cells. Using a combination of in vitro
and vivo adhesion and migration studies in combination with proximity labeling, quantitative MS, live-cell MS-
based footprinting, biochemical and electron microscopic analyses, this dual-PI proposal presents a 5-year plan
to: 1) elucidate the CD53-partner interaction network regulating B cell trafficking, and 2) determine the functional
consequences of disrupting the CD53-partner interactions. Armed with our newly developed tools, we will reveal
a novel network of protein interactions coordinating cell signaling and motility to regulate B cell adhesion,
migration, chemokine signaling and niche localization. We will uncover how this CD53-mediated network
responds to chemokine signaling during B cell migration and how cross-cell interactions are established during
B cell homing. Thus, the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of how B cell trafficking
is coordinated and regulated. Given the conserved structure and functional redundancy of tetraspanin family
members, this will lead to our long-term goal of elucidating tetraspanin/partner relationships that apply to other
roles of CD53 in immune system function and malignancy as well as the functions of other tetraspanin family
members."
10857965,"Abstract
 Functional communication in a typical conversation involves complex adjustments by conversation
partners (interlocutors) at multiple levels of language structure. Current accounts of this center on typical
interlocutors and do not provide an adequate framework for understanding how functional communication
emerges in interactions involving those with communication disorders. The current proposal aims to expand
existing accounts through the systematic study of communicative interaction involving persons with ALS (PALS).
ALS is a degenerative neurological condition that negatively affects verbal communication. This decline in verbal
ability significantly diminishes quality of life of PALS and their family. Current interventions to enhance verbal
communication focus mainly on improving a speaker’s productions, but this approach is less effective in
degenerative conditions such as ALS in which speakers’ abilities continue to decline in spite of intervention.
 In the current proposal, we aim to (a) extend current theoretical accounts to involve those with communication
disorders by studying PALS and (b) explore the feasibility of clinical interventions that leverage interactions to
support verbal communication in degenerative diseases like ALS. We will do so through a set of three concordant,
independent aims. In Aim 1, we will study highly structured interactions involving PALS and unfamiliar
interlocutors that will focus on the phonetic level. In Aim 2, we will study more naturalistic interactions to study
the flexibility PALS have at other levels of language structure (e.g., syntax and pragmatics). In Aim 3, we will
incorporate caregivers into structured interactions with PALS and assess the clinical feasibility of interventions
based on interactions. Upon the successful completion of this project, we will obtain an improved understanding
of communicative interactions involving interlocutors with communication disorders. Specifically, our findings will
elucidate patterns of change that support communication success for PALS and their interlocutors. These
findings will also provide an evidence base for novel interventions to support verbal communication for people
with degenerative conditions."

million children suffer from Long COVID. Neutrophils have been shown to be hyperactivated in Long COVID,
which is concerning because they can be quite inflammatory, causing vascular and tissue damage and
contributing to disease. We aim is to define the neutrophil profiles driving Long COVID in order to ultimately offer
novel strategies for diagnosing and treating this new disease. To achieve this goal, we will use both single-cell
RNA sequencing technology to define neutrophil activation profiles and microfluidics to test neutrophil
functionality Long COVID, compared to healthy controls. Our central hypothesis is that neutrophil activation in
Long COVID carries a distinct neutrophilic gene expression and functional profile, which contributes to
pathogenicity. Importantly, we aim to partner with an existing clinical trial of larazotide for Long COVID
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05747534) to test reversibility of neutrophil activation by targeting sources of
Spike antigenemia. Ultimately, mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of this newly emerged post-COVID-19-

10854014,"This is a shared instrumentation grant application to acquire a BD FACSymphony S6 flow
cytometer to replace a 16-year-old BD FACS Aria™ IIu for the University of Toledo
(UToledo) Flow Cytometry Core (FCC). The FCC services both the UToledo Health
Science and Main Campus research communities. Our BD FACSAria™ IIu is the only cell
sorter available at UToledo for research and graduate student research training. The
FACSAria™ IIu is three generations removed from current flow-based technology. The
benefit of replacing the current end-of-life flow cytometer in the UToledo FCC is multifold.
First, replacing the existing cell sorter will allow current and new users with NIH funding
to continue to access this important technology for their experimental design. Failure to
replace the current instrument in the near future will result in the loss of this extremely
valuable tool for experimental applications in molecular biology, pathology, virology,
immunology and cell biology due to end-of-life notice from the manufacturer. Second,
replacing the current instrumentation with a new state of the art flow sorter will enhance
the ongoing research of our established core. Our users will have access to experts in
flow cytometry who will facilitate consultation, training and analysis with long-term benefits
for sustaining the research enterprise with cutting edge instrumentation and a track record
of long-term institutional support including a greater than $129,000 cost share. Faculty,
staff and students will be able to move forward with innovative experiments with ease and
efficiency due to the expertise that the established core facility provides to the UToledo
research community. Lastly, state of the art instrumentation plays an integral role in the
intellectual environment, recruitment and retention of talented faculty, staff and students.
We continue to advance the research activity within UToledo’s COMLS and have recently
been recognized as a nationally ranked medical school for research, have received
funding of a new T-32 G-RISE award to support training of students underrepresented in
translational and biomedical research. This new instrument represents a unique resource
that is in high demand within our research community. This instrument will help to
advance the scientific goals of nine major NIH-sponsored projects and promote the
development of new projects by existing minor and new users. Importantly, this fits well
in our overall strategy to improve the significance and impact of our research within the
college and for the benefit of our nation and world."
10854091,"Distributive Conjugal Transfer (DCT) is a unique conjugation process, first described in Mycobacterium
smegmatis, which is so robust that it emulates the genome mixing capacity of sexual reproduction:
transconjugant genomes are mosaic blends of each parent. Thus, DCT is a new paradigm of conjugation,
evolution, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated gene flow within a bacterial gene pool. Our long-
term goals are to elucidate the mechanism of DCT and understand its role in driving mycobacterial
evolution.
We recently defined a three-gene mating identity locus (mid) as critical for donor-recipient compatibility.
Remarkably, one gene within the locus, midA, confers mycobacterial self-identity (kin). If the identical
midA gene is expressed in both donor and recipient, DCT is prevented as the cells sense kin. The focus
of this proposal is to characterize this novel form of kin recognition in mycobacteria, and to determine
how it triggers/blocks DCT. Sequence comparisons of the three mid proteins in other mycobacteria shows
that they are highly polymorphic. We hypothesize that this sequence diversity is driven by the need to
express self-identity. MidA is predicted to have a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a large
extracellular C-terminal domain. We propose a model in which direct cell contact between donor and
recipient would allow the interaction of the surface exposed MidA proteins to sense kin. The N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain would trigger a transcriptional response in the recipient that either activates (non-
kin) or prevents (kin) progression to conjugation.
The two Aims are designed to characterize the mycobacterial kin recognition protein(s), determine how
mid discriminates between contacting mycobacteria, and elucidate the molecular genetic pathways
triggered by mid.
Aim1. Define and characterize the mid locus and the encoded kin functions.
Aim 2. Identify and characterize the genes responsible for kin recognition in donor and recipient strains
by transcriptional profiling wild-type and mutant strains in co-culture.
These objectives will be achieved by employing a combination of molecular genetic, genomic, and
biochemical approaches to dissect the mid locus, and transcriptional profiling of donor and recipient
strains in coculture to determine the transcriptional responses to kin recognition and DCT. Together,
these studies will elucidate the molecular basis of kin recognition in mycobacteria and provide further
mechanistic insights on this novel mechanism of HGT."

ERC-CFAR: DEVELOPMENTAL CORE
The Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY CFAR (ERC-CFAR) Developmental Core will strive to provide wide-ranging
support to nurture and advance the HIV/AIDS research careers of tomorrow’s HIV/AIDS researchers. Our
coordinated strategy for this renewal application will be implemented via three specific aims that are centered
around early stage investigators (ESIs). In Aim 1, we will employ a multi-faceted mentoring process, which
combines individually tailored mentoring plans developed for each ESI and multiple forums to enable ESIs to
present their HIV/AIDS research progress to the ERC-CFAR community to garner feedback and develop new
collaborations. In Aim 2, we will provide ESIs with opportunities to compete in the peer-reviewed ERC-CFAR
catalytic pilot grants and microgrants programs or NIH CFAR administrative supplements opportunities. Aim 3
includes dual goals of enhancing trans- and intra-institutional collaborations and scientific communication.
Collaborations will be increased by: (i) recruiting non-AIDS researchers to collaborate with CFAR investigators
and by removing obstacles to succeed – both by providing microgrants up to $10K and access to HIV cohorts;
(ii) organizing bi-annual virtual K-clubs that are attended by ESIs from Einstein, Rockefeller and CUNY and that
include both presentations by successful ESIs and by the ERC-CFAR Developmental and Operational Core
leaders about all available CFAR services that can assist ESIs in their research projects and planned grant
submissions; and (iii) organizing bi-annual New York City-wide research symposia attended by all NYC HIV/AIDS
researchers where individuals from the different major NYC institutions will be selected to present their cutting
edge research. We will enhance scientific communication among the investigators of ERC-CFAR via (i) bi-weekly
Trans-institutional ERC-CFAR virtual research seminars and biweekly Clinical AIDS Center/ERC-CFAR Grand
Rounds; (ii) ERC-CFAR Invited Speaker Seminars; (iii) Monthly Virus Hub meetings consisting of 13 Einstein
virologists, which includes 9 faculty members that are focused on research on HIV, HSV or HCV. This provides
a special one-stop-shop for all ERC-CFAR ESIs to learn about the latest virological research going on at Einstein.
The impressive impact of these highly coordinated and proactive mentoring services by the ERC-CFAR
Developmental Core over the past 4 years of funding is demonstrated by accomplishments of our mentored ESIs
that include $20.5 million of external grants and 250 publications. The high impact of the ERC-CFAR
Developmental Core’s catalytic pilot grant program, which has awarded 14 pilot grants to ESIs so far (0.46
million) from all three participant institutions, is reflected in the fact that they have already garnered up to ~$8.1
million in NIH grants (a return on investment of 17.6) and that they have published over 70 papers."

theory and methods. During the past four years, the BISC has had a major impact on advancing the research
accomplishments of ERC-CFAR investigators as evidenced by its support of 52 investigators who received 39
grants, 9 supplements, and published 56 papers. In response to ERC-CFAR investigators’ requests, we have
added implementation science (IS) services to better address the biggest challenge to ending the epidemic in
the next 5 years, equitable implementation, scale-up and sustainment of evidence-based strategies to
prevent HIV transmission and reduce health, social and emotional consequences of HIV infection. The Specific
Aims of the BISC are to:
Aim 1: Provide ERC-CFAR investigators with access to comprehensive technical assistance and expertise in
behavioral and social science research, including: (a) quantitative research and trial design; (b) qualitative and
mixed methods; (c) cognitive interviewing; and (d) the application of behavioral theories, especially for behavior
change at the patient, provider, organization, and systems levels.
Aim 2: Enable ERC-CFAR investigators to leverage IS approaches, methods, and frameworks to expand and
strengthen EHE research and its impact across the ERC-CFAR, while focusing on strategies that mitigate health
disparities and increase equity.
Aim 3: Bring a whole-of-society lens to the ERC-CFAR through the Community Participatory Partnership (CPP)
to shape the CFAR research agenda, address equity in prevention and care, and provide guidance on how to
achieve integrated, coordinated responses to the HIV epidemic among all partners and stakeholders.
Aim 4: With the Developmental Core, mentor ESIs and junior faculty in behavioral, social science and IS
 research methods and community collaboration, and support proposal development.
The BISC will accomplish these aims through its Core infrastructure: The BISC Consultation Service, The
Qualitative Research Resource, and The Cognitive Interview Lab. In addition, we will initiate the ERC-CFAR

ERC-CFAR: CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CORE (CTSC)
To help meet the vision of Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE), the Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS
Research (ERC-CFAR) has formed strong collaborations both within and beyond our partner institutions,
including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, to catalyze and support research that
best serves the public’s health: to eradicate HIV infection, prevent new HIV infections, and improve the health
of people living with HIV (PWH). The overarching goal of the ERC-CFAR and the Clinical and Translational
Science Core (CTSC) is to support the EHE mission by creating a broad and robust resource available to
researchers within our walls as well as nationally and globally. Our synergistic partnership provides a broad
range of support for clinical, translational, health services, and implementation science investigations. By
leveraging the resources of the Einstein CTSA-funded Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, the
CTSC provides access to a robust clinical database and multiple biorepositories. The Clinical Cohort Database
(CCDB), derived from the Montefiore/Einstein clinical services, has ~20,000 PWH and 475,000 HIV-negative
patients; >6200 PWH are in active care; 43% are women, 48% Hispanic/Latinx and 41% African American. This
comprehensive, longitudinal database accesses Montefiore’s extensive clinical infrastructure and has fostered
an explosion of clinical prevention and treatment, epidemiologic, translational, health services and
implementation science research. We facilitate enrollment of well-characterized patients (including HIV-negative
controls) into new research protocols. Through CTSC resources the clinical population at Montefiore/Einstein
enables research at Rockefeller, which lacks access to defined cohorts of PWH, recruiting new participants for
Rockefeller’s cutting-edge research in HIV eradication. The City University of New York (CUNY) is a leader in
implementation science assessing the factors that influence our ability to impact favorably on the public’s health
with interventions of proven efficacy. The CTSC is integrated into the Scientific Working Group, a driver of the
ERC-CFAR’s scientific direction, to provide optimal support to the emerging research activities, and foster cross-
fertilization among cores and the SWG. We will leverage Einstein’s Center for Health Data Innovations and use
of state-of-the-art informatics methods, including natural language processing and machine learning, to catalyze

ERC-CFAR: HIV AND MENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP 
The newly formed HIV and Mental Health Scientific Working Group (SWG) aims to facilitate multi-disciplinary 
investigations in the field of HIV and mental health comorbidity, a major public health concern, contributing to 
increased HIV transmission, and an undeveloped area of research in our ERC-CFAR. While dramatic survival 
gains have been achieved for people with HIV (PWH) with the widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy 
(ART), high comorbidity with mental health conditions such as depression has posed a major barrier to achieving 
the 90-90-90 goal and “bending the curve.” National data estimate that comorbid mental health conditions impact 
the majority of PWH, leading to increased HIV transmission risk, reduced retention in care, and poorer HIV 
outcomes. Alarmingly, by 2030, the top two leading causes of disease burden globally are projected to be HIV 
and depressive disorders. Despite these data, there has been sparse research into the mechanisms underlying 
this comorbidity. This SWG addresses this major gap in HIV research with the overall mission of seeding and 
catalyzing research that impacts mental health in PWH to reduce HIV transmission and acquisition, and to 
improve retention in care and overall outcomes. Toward this goal, this SWG brings together with community 
members >30 non-HIV and HIV researchers with diverse expertise in immunology, neuroimaging, neurology, 
cognitive neuroscience, epidemiology, health disparities, and addiction, recruited from multiple New York City 
academic institutions. Specific Aims: 1) To bring together outstanding HIV and non-HIV investigators from 
multidisciplinary research areas and multiple NYC Institutions to foster collaborations in the field of mental health 
in PWH, focusing on psychiatric neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, and implementation science. 2) To generate 
new interdisciplinary collaborations among established investigators (EI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) 
who work on HIV research but have not previously collaborated, as well as with investigators who are new to 
HIV research. 3) To identify and seek funding for research projects developed through collaborations and ideas 
formed in the SWG to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the high burden 
of mental health conditions among PWH, including depression, anxiety, cognition, and pain. Comorbid mental 
health conditions in PWH are a major public health concern and an obstacle to stopping the HIV epidemic partly 
due to increased transmission risk and decreased retention in care. To date, this topic has attracted limited 
research. This SWG aims to fill this research gap and facilitate research into the mechanisms underlying this 
comorbidity and how best to treat it. Such research is essential for ending the HIV epidemic."
10864050,"Depression is associated with an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in coronary heart disease
(CHD). Although safe and modestly effective treatments for major depression exist, only about 30% of patients
ever achieve full remission. CHD patients with depression symptoms that do not respond to treatment are at
high risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to those whose depression symptoms respond to
treatment. Anhedonia and fatigue are among the most common symptoms to remain following treatment in
both depressed CHD patients and in medically well psychiatric patients. In a recent study, we found that
several risk markers of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including a high normal level of the thyroid
hormone free thyroxine (FT4), low nocturnal heart rate variability, blunted circadian heart rate, and poor sleep
quality predict depression treatment response and post-treatment symptoms of fatigue and anhedonia. It is
unclear why these risk markers are associated with residual anhedonia and fatigue. Elevated cortisol levels,
chronic sympathetic nervous system activation, reduced vagal modulation of HR, high levels of perceived
stress, low level of physical activity, disordered sleep, and occult subclinical thyroid diseases are among the
most plausible explanations. Any or all of these factors may explain the relationship between the risk markers
and residual fatigue and anhedonia, and all are potentially modifiable and thus possible targets for future
clinical trials. The purpose of the proposed research is to identify modifiable correlates of these risk markers
and of fatigue and anhedonia in depressed patients with CHD. Study participants will be recruited from
cardiology practices at Washington University School of Medicine. Potentially eligible patients will be
scheduled for a structured clinical interview. Those who score >14 on the BDI-II and meet the DSM-5 criteria
for major depression and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Participants will be evaluated at the Behavioral
Medicine Center at Washington University School of Medicine. The evaluation will be performed in the
morning after a 12-hour fast, and will start with a blood draw to obtain a thyroid panel, lipid profile, plasma
cortisol, C-reactive protein, and other biomarkers. Participants will be fitted with an ambulatory ECG monitor
and a wrist actigraph, complete a battery of self-report inventories, and be given instructions for collecting
saliva samples at home for cortisol measurement. The ECG monitor and actigraph will be worn for 48 hours
on two consecutive weekdays to measure the ECG markers, activity levels, and sleep parameters. Saliva
samples will be obtained three times per day for two days: upon awakening, mid-afternoon, and before
bedtime. Participants will be compensated for their time upon return of the samples and equipment. This study
will identify potential targets for adjunctive interventions to augment traditional depression treatments and
thereby help to lay the groundwork for a randomized clinical trial to determine whether treating depression in
patients with CHD can improve both depression and event-free survival."
10864053,"ABSTRACT
Aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains the only definitive and efficacious treatment for patients with severe
aortic stenosis (AS), a common valvular abnormality associated with high mortality, frequent hospitalizations,
and over $1 billion annual cost to the healthcare system. However, a large number of patients are not suitable
candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged
as an alternative non-surgical treatment option for symptomatic AS, and has been recently FDA approved for
patients with intermediate or higher surgical risk. Despite advances in transcatheter valve technology,
thromboembolic and bleeding issues continue to be major complications following TAVR which impact both
short and long-term survival. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to optimize outcomes following
TAVR by understanding the basis of the thromboinflammatory response, which has been shown to affect
survival. Our strong preliminary data suggests that TAVR is associated with an increase in platelet derived
inflammatory mediators and a pronounced acute inflammatory response, the degree of which correlates with
baseline platelet reactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that survival following TAVR is predicted by
development of persistent thrombocytopenia and lower baseline platelet aggregation. Accordingly, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of coagulation, particularly via contact activation, and resultant
platelet dysfunction are critically important for development of a pathologic thromboinflammatory response in a
subset of patients following TAVR and is directly tied to adverse outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested by

TAVR promotes an acute inflammatory response, 2) determine the impact of hemostatic factors on the
inflammatory response, and 3) define the role of platelet derived inflammatory mediators (specifically protein
disulfide isomerase) on 30 day survival. The mechanism of thrombotic and bleeding events following TAVR
remains largely unknown as well as the impact of baseline primary hemostatic abnormalities and optimum post
procedure antithrombotic therapy. The proposed studies are significant and innovative in that they will provide
a mechanistic understanding of the cross-talk between the hemostatic factors, platelets and inflammatory
systems in patients undergoing TAVR. The resulting findings from this study may provide a foundation for
newer generation antithrombotic strategies, such as targeting contact factors or thrombin receptors, to optimize
outcomes following transcatheter heart valve procedures."

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains the only definitive and efficacious treatment for patients with severe
aortic stenosis (AS), a common valvular abnormality associated with high mortality, frequent hospitalizations,
and over $1 billion annual cost to the healthcare system. However, a large number of patients are not suitable
candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged
as an alternative non-surgical treatment option for symptomatic AS, and has been recently FDA approved for
patients with intermediate or higher surgical risk. Despite advances in transcatheter valve technology,
thromboembolic and bleeding issues continue to be major complications following TAVR which impact both
short and long-term survival. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to optimize outcomes following
TAVR by understanding the basis of the thromboinflammatory response, which has been shown to affect
survival. Our strong preliminary data suggests that TAVR is associated with an increase in platelet derived
inflammatory mediators and a pronounced acute inflammatory response, the degree of which correlates with
baseline platelet reactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that survival following TAVR is predicted by
development of persistent thrombocytopenia and lower baseline platelet aggregation. Accordingly, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of coagulation, particularly via contact activation, and resultant
platelet dysfunction are critically important for development of a pathologic thromboinflammatory response in a
subset of patients following TAVR and is directly tied to adverse outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which an increase in platelet reactivity following
TAVR promotes an acute inflammatory response, 2) determine the impact of hemostatic factors on the
inflammatory response, and 3) define the role of platelet derived inflammatory mediators (specifically protein
disulfide isomerase) on 30 day survival. The mechanism of thrombotic and bleeding events following TAVR
remains largely unknown as well as the impact of baseline primary hemostatic abnormalities and optimum post
procedure antithrombotic therapy. The proposed studies are significant and innovative in that they will provide
a mechanistic understanding of the cross-talk between the hemostatic factors, platelets and inflammatory
systems in patients undergoing TAVR. The resulting findings from this study may provide a foundation for
newer generation antithrombotic strategies, such as targeting contact factors or thrombin receptors, to optimize
outcomes following transcatheter heart valve procedures."

Viruses that successfully evade clearance without killing the host establish chronic infection.
However, unresolved low-grade inflammation causes morbidity over time, including development
of cancers. How to appropriately modulate immune responses to chronic infection without further
damaging the host represents a major clinical challenge. Type-17 immunity is invoked by
extracellular bacteria and fungi to control resident microbiota and invading pathogens at barrier
surfaces, and to promote tissue repair. Th17 cells have received much attention as drivers of
inflammation in chronic autoimmune diseases. However, there are sparse data regarding the role
of type-17 responses in response to viral infection. Here we have employed the well-characterized
model infection, LCMV clone 13, to test the role of IL-17 during chronic viral infection. IL-17 was
increased systemically during the switch to the chronic phase of infection. Using genetic and
antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17, our data unexpectedly reveal that IL-17 regulates Th1 and
CD8+ T cell activation, exhaustion and immunopathology during LCMV infection. We have
identified lymphoid stromal cells known as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) as key intermediaries
of IL-17 effects in secondary lymphoid tissues. Gene expression analysis and antibody-mediated
blockade support a role for excess IFNg in driving T cell exhaustion and immunopathology. These
unexpected findings lead to our central hypothesis that IL-17 has an immunoregulatory role during
chronic infection by limiting antiviral T cell IFNg-mediated exhaustion and immunopathology. This
project is designed to dissect the key elements that we have identified to be required in this
unexplored immunoregulatory pathway in chronic infection by probing the source of critical IL-17
(aim 1), LN stromal cells as targets of IL-17 (aim 2) and IFNg-mediated effects on exhaustion and
immunopathology in absence of IL-17 signaling (aim 3). Together these data will define a novel

In 2016, faculty from Johns Hopkins medicine invited all academic medical centers in the US to collaborate in
creating the High Value Practice Academic Alliance (HVPAA), a multi-institutional, multispecialty organization
designed to efficiently and effectively advance value-based quality improvement initiatives on a national scale.
As of January 2022, more than 200 faculty leaders from 100 academic centers in the US and Canada serve as
institutional or departmental representatives. Members convene on monthly conference calls for information
sharing, organize the annual conference, collaborate on multicenter publications, and direct two free year-long
high-value care professional development programs (Future Leader Program for trainees and VITAL for early-
career faculty).
This proposal requests support for the 5-7th annual Architecture of High Value Health Care national
conferences. Since its inception, the annual conference has advanced more than 600 value-based quality
improvements initiatives and fostered broad collaboration across academic centers. Presentations from the 1st
four conferences contributed to a blueprint encompassing five key areas health systems must address to
become genuinely high-value medical centers: (1) Diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency and effectiveness, (2)
quality-driven care pathways to reduce unwarranted practice variability, (3) Care transitions and in particular
hospital discharge, (4) Optimizing patient care setting and improving the caliber of ambulatory care, to reduce
avoidable use of the emergency department and hospital, and (5) Preventative medicine to prevent disease
and evidence-based screening from reducing late-stage diagnoses. For the following three conferences, we
will prioritize equitable delivery of high-value care and interdisciplinary teamwork in addition.
Presentations by medical students and trainees are prioritized, as their engagement ensures that value-based
care will become the standard for future generations. Our Future Leaders Program bolsters this mission for
trainees and the Value Innovation Teaching and Leadership Program (VITAL) for junior faculty. The
conference is a critical component of these two programs by fostering a network of high-value care champions
and building a foundation for their future success."

For clinical decision support to be effective it must provide the right information, to the right persons, at the
right times, in the right formats, and via the right channels (aka ‘“The 5 Rights of CDS”). The “5 Rights of CDS”
framework also applies to shared decision-making support. Shared decision-making is a patient-centered form
of clinical decision-making. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools to
support shared decision making, and several are mandated by CMS for coverage determinations. To facilitate
successful PDA implementation a PDA containing the right information must be provided to the right patient at
the right time, in the right format, and be delivered in the right channel. Despite the proven clinical benefits of
PDAs, informatics systems to reduce the barriers health systems, physicians, and patients face in using PDAs
are lacking. Known limitations of PDA use include having to locate the right PDA, knowing the quality of the
PDA, having to leave the electronic health record (EHR) environment to find and use the PDA, having to
manually enter data into the PDA, and documenting the process of shared decision-making that was
undertaken. The objective of this proposal is to create an informatics system that addresses know PDA
implementation barriers, supports the “5 Rights” framework, and is built to be reusable, interoperable, and
scalable. The proposed Shared Decision Aid Navigator System (SDANS) will address PDA implementation
limitations by (1) creating a repository of the PDAs metadata needed to support “5 Rights” implementation, (2)
creating a SMARonFHIR (SoF) EHR-embedded PDA navigator that relies on PDA metadata, patient data, and
organizational data to implement the “5 Rights” and to support documentation (3) using the Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to retrieve patient data that can be used to support the “5 Rights” of
implementation and to provide data to data-enabled PDA tools, (4) using CQL and creating a Clinical Quality
Rules (CQL) rules repository to maintain PDA implementation rules, and (5) creating an administrative
application for health systems and practices to modify and maintain their PDA repository and CQL
implementation rules. In Aim 1 we will employ co-design principles and qualitative methods with patients,
clinicians, and health information technology (HIT) experts to design and build the SDANS to ensure it meets
the needs of those who will use the system. We will also convert three current high-quality, evidence-based
CMS-mandated PDAs into SMARTonFHIR applications to allow us to test the full functionality of the SDANS.
In Aim 2, four medical centers will deploy the SDANS and the three SOF-converted PDAs into a proof-of-
concept environment and we will evaluate the feasibility, functionality and satisfaction with the system. In the
long-term, the SDANS will lead to improved implementation of PDAs and meet AHRQ’s mission to improve the
use of CDS, including PDAs, and to improved patient-centered outcomes."

challenges due to EVs' nanometer-sizes and presence in a vast biological background. While new
technologies for EV analysis have been developed, fundamental limitations still remain, including i) low
sensitivity limited to bulk analyses; ii) necessities of EV lysis for detecting markers inside of EVs; iii) lack of
multiplexed analysis on protein and RNA markers; and iv) a separate EV isolation process required prior to the
assay. The overall goal of this application is to overcome these technical challenges and develop a new
platform that enables multiplexed analyses of EV protein and RNA markers in individual EVs. We previously
developed a nanoplasmonic EV sensing platform based on transmission surface plasmon resonance through
periodic nanohole gratings. We showed that the nanoplasmonic sensors could rapidly and sensitively detect
disease-specific EVs directly from clinical samples. In this project, we will further advance the technology for
robust multiplexed EV analysis and implement on-chip EV isolation to achieve simple assay procedures and
good reproducibility. We will validate the system using well-established preclinical and clinical samples to
demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the new technology for clinical applications. Successful completion
of the project will produce a highly sensitive sensing platform for multiplexed EV analysis. The development of
such a technology could offer additional insight into understanding subtypes, heterogeneity, and production
dynamics of EVs during disease development and progression. The gained insights will pave the way for
expanding EV studies to various diseases, further broadening the scope of EV applications in clinical settings."
10864938,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 4 – A permanent off-switch for AAV transgenes) 
Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressed antibody-like entry inhibitors provide very robust protection from 
HIV-1 model viruses in rhesus macaques. AAV-mediated expression of broadly neutralizing antibodies or 
antibody-like molecules can also largely or wholly suppress an established infection in macaques. We thus 
have an effective vaccine and a pathway to drug-free virologic remission if this same approach could be 
safely applied to humans. However, there is currently no effective way to inactivate an AAV transgene in 
case of adverse events, and thus this approach is still considered too risky for most individuals. An effective 
‘off-switch’ would have two important uses. First, it would increase the safety of AAV-based vaccines and 
therapies. Second, it would facilitate eradication studies by allowing sustained expression of a potent 
antibody or entry inhibitor, and then allowing it to be inactivated so that the rate of viral rebound can be 
measured. In preliminary data, we show that a morpholino can be used together with a highly efficient 
ribozyme to induce expression of an AAV transgene. We also show that the Cre recombinase can 
permanently inactivate an AAV transgene flanked by LoxP sites. Here we proposed to combine these 
observations to generate a permanent off-switch for an AAV-expressed transgene. We will then 
demonstrate in mice that this off-switch can halt otherwise efficient expression of two potent HIV-1 entry 
inhibitors. Finally, we will use the same principles to develop a morpholino-regulated on-switch. We will 
then use this switch to test whether a 4-month delay in transgene expression from the time of AAV 
inoculation can limit immune clearance of the transgene. These studies will therefore make AAV-based 
therapeutics safer, and facilitate study of the impact of long-term antibody expression on the reservoir of 
latently infected cells."
10864986,"The goal of this project is to prevent and reduce deaths and injuries due to opioids in the United States by
determining the best combination of state and local harm reduction and drug paraphernalia laws needed to
reduce overdose rates and other opioid-related harms. To do this, we will: 1) conduct original review of laws on
relevant harm reduction and drug paraphernalia laws in the 836 municipalities with >50,000 people and
associated counties; 2) conduct biannual surveys on implementation of harm reduction laws and drug
paraphernalia laws by law enforcement; 3) create an extensive national dataset by merging data on state and
local harm reduction and drug paraphernalia laws; implementation of laws by law enforcement; EMS and fatality
data; and information on local harm reduction resources, and socioeconomic indicators; 4) use the merged
dataset to determine which combinations of state and local laws have resulted in the biggest decreases in
overdoses and related harms; and (5) determine which local characteristics enhanced those effective
combinations of policies. Overdose deaths in the United States increased more than six-fold since 2001, and
now account for more loss of life than high blood pressure, AIDS, and pneumonia. States, cities, and counties
are combating this epidemic by passing laws to reduce overdoses, and by investing in access to harm reduction
services. But these efforts are often undertaken in isolation and without considering how the different state and
local laws interact or how local factors like enforcement of laws and access to harm reduction services influence
their effectiveness. This project will help answer those questions by using large data and powerful analytics to
bring together all the evidence on this complicated topic. At the end of the project, we will be able to anwer the
following questions: What combinations of state and local harm reduction and drug paraphernalia laws most
effectively prevent and reduce opioid deaths and injuries in the United States? And how can we best support
local efforts to ensure that those effective combinations have the greatest impact?"
10865030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My group seeks to understand, in molecular detail, the steps taken by each of the major classes of membrane
proteins to achieve their ﬁnal assembled state. About one-quarter of all genes code for membrane proteins
that are ﬁrst inserted into the plasma membrane of prokaryotes or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
eukaryotes. These proteins perform many essential functions as receptors, channels, enzymes, anchors and
transporters. Biosynthesis of membrane proteins is an inherently ineﬃcient process, and numerous human
diseases are linked to defective folding of membrane proteins. Thus, understanding how membrane proteins
are made is a fundamental question in cell biology with important implications for the treatment of human
diseases.
 Of the ~5,000 membrane proteins coded in the human genome, the majority have more than one
transmembrane domain. Yet our understanding of how these “multi-pass” proteins are inserted, folded and
assembled into functional entities is at an early stage. Work in my group over the past several years led us to
discover a novel ~390 kDa translocon in the ER that is involved in the biogenesis of most multi-pass
membrane proteins in human cells. We are now focused on deﬁning the molecular mechanisms underlying
this process, using an interdisciplinary set of biochemical, structural, cell biological, genetic and bioinformatic
approaches. These studies promise new insight into the fundamental biological challenge of membrane
protein biogenesis."
10866366,"Tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs) line the blood vessels that promote the growth and support the
dissemination and survival of cancer cells. The tumor vasculature is also a gatekeeper that controls the
passage of immune cells both into and out of the tumor microenvironment. We recently used single cell RNA
sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to characterize EC heterogeneity in a mammary tumor model; from these studies, we
turned our attention to DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) which has well-defined roles in stem/progenitor cell
self-renewal via it's ability to re-establish patterns of methylation in dividing cells, but no known role in
regulating EC function in tumors. Using mice with conditional deletion of DNMT1 in ECs (DNMT1iECKO mice),
we show inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic seeding and reduced vessel complexity/branching. We
propose these effects are due to a loss of methylation-dependent EC specification required for
neovascularization and are due to de-repression of Th1 chemokines (e.g. Cxcl9/Cxcl10, and Cxcl11) and cell
adhesion molecules (e.g. Vcam1, Icam1/2, and E-selectin) in ECs that recruit and retain cytotoxic T-
lymphocytes to impair tumor growth. In aim 1 we will use DNMT1iECKO mice and vascular-tropic nanoparticles
to determine how targeting DNMT1 regulates EC morphogenesis, perfusion, and permeability during cancer
cell survival. In aim 2 we will use metastasis models to assess how vascular DNMT1 shapes the tumor
immune microenvironment via its ability to regulate cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and CTL-mobilizing
chemokines in ECs. In aim 3 we will examine mechanisms of immune suppression by a FGF2/DNMT1 axis
that triggers methylation-induced silencing of CAMs and chemokines in tumor-associated ECs. To complete
our goals, we have assembled a team of investigators with expertise in DNA methylation (S. Bhatnager), tumor
immune micro environments (V. Engelhard), and the development of microfluidics devices to study EC-to-T-cell
interactions (R. Kamm). Together, our study characterizes a completely unexplored area; namely, identifying
how methylation-dependent pathways regulate the complex functional diversity, specification, and
immunosuppressive features of tumor-associated ECs."

 The clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia occur downstream of pathological deposition
of Aβ peptides in extracellular cored-neuritic plaques and aggregated tau protein in intracellular neurofibrillary
tangles (NFT) in the brain. Since deposition of Aβ precedes tauopathy in early-onset familial AD (fAD), it is
accepted that Aβ can trigger tau misfolding into NFT, initiating a cascade of cumulative pathology that
progressively leads to dementia. In sporadic AD, the coincident deposition of Aβ appears to correlate with tau
misfolding and the severity of NFT pathology. Collectively, these findings suggest that Aβ deposition can
exacerbate tau misfolding and NFT formation leading to cognitive deficits and dementia. However, the underlying
mechanisms and characteristics of Aβ and tau that synergize resulting in NFT pathology and pathological
sequelae is still unclear. Our proposal is designed to provide experimental insights into the individual contribution
of tau (Aim 1) and Aβ (Aim 2) in driving Aβ-tau synergy in mouse models of AD.
 Evidence suggests that a major mechanism by which Aβ synergizes with tau misfolding involves the
hyper-phosphorylation of tau. A recent study of AD patients that quantitatively mapped the progressive
emergence of phosphorylated epitopes in tau identified 19 Ser/Thr residues that are most frequently
phosphorylated in individuals that exhibit concurrent Aβ pathology. The main objective in Aim 1 is to dissect the
contribution of these phosphorylation events in the misfolding and aggregation of tau that occurs in the presence
of concurrent Aβ pathology. Using AAV technology, we have the capability to generate and express a large
number of tau phospho-mimetic variants in APP TgCRND8 mice. Using this mouse model, in Aim 1 we propose
a broad study to systematically dissect the phosphorylation events that drive tau misfolding and NFT formation
in the presence of Aβ.
 Over many years of research, our laboratories have created mouse models that exhibit a spectrum of Aβ
pathologies, including mice that develop primarily diffuse Aβ pathology and mice that primarily develop cored-
neuritic pathology. Given that there are questions regarding the type of Aβ pathology that underlie Aβ-tau
synergy, in Aim 2, we propose to use our AAV approach to examine Aβ-tau interactions in this diverse collection
of APP transgenic models that exhibit different types of Aβ pathology. Additionally, in Aim 2, we will use
pharmacologics and inducible APP models to examine the role of newly-made soluble Aβ vs long-lived insoluble
Aβ in tau phosphorylation/aggregation process. Phospho-proteomic analysis will help us determine the
relationship of different types of Aβ to the resulting tau phosphorylation profile.
 Collectively, this work will improve our understanding of the Aβ-driven phosphorylation cascade that
appears to promote tau misfolding and aggregation into NFT."

bacteria and virus, commonly used medications are small molecule drugs. However, bacteria and virus often 
mutate and makes it challenging to develop a standard of care medications. Hence, vaccines, which are 
immunotherapy regimens to inject live or attenuated antigens to develop immunity against the pathogens are 
used for prophylactic and therapeutic applications. However, vaccines are less effective against gastrointestinal 
(GI) infectious diseases as generating mucosal immunity requires extensive activation of GI immune cells. In this 
study, we aim to develop a vaccine adjuvant system which can be delivered by oral route, and selectively 
activate GI immune cells to elicit strong mucosal immunity which will be pursued by following specific aims. 
Aim1. We will identify a novel small molecule which can specifically activate GI immune cells without 
triggering chronic GI inflammation. To do so, we will develop in vitro assays which allow high throughput screen 
(HTS) of drug libraries. Using HTS assay, we will discover a hit compound that induces pro-inflammatory 
cytokine, TNF-alpha from primary dendritic cells but does not induce TNF-alpha from GI endothelial cell line 
Caco-2. Then, we will develop a nanoparticle drug delivery carrier suitable for oral delivery. We will develop 
polymeric nanoparticles that can provide protection of the hit compound from degradation in the GI tract, and 
enhance uptake by GI immune cells in the intestine, all of which are important for inducing mucosal immunity in 
GI tract. 
Aim 2. Hit compound encapsulating nanoparticles (refer to as Nano-Adjuvant) will be examined for in vivo 
safety and efficacy in rodent animal models. Biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile of nanoparticles will be 
measured using IVIS fluorescence imaging and LC/MS analysis and histological analysis of organs will be 
performed to investigate the potential toxicity of Nano-adjuvant. Next, we will examine the immunostimulatory 
efficacy of Nano-adjuvant by measuring the T cell and B cell activation (small intestinal cells, mesenteric lymph 
nodes) using flow cytometry, and mucosal immunity (Intestinal wash IgA, fecal IgA). 
In this proposal, we will focus our efforts to examine whether oral nanoparticulate delivery of small molecule 
can elicit strong mucosal immunity without inducing GI inflammation by HTS screening and in vivo safety and 
efficacy validations. Long term goal of the project is to develop a universal oral immunostimulatory adjuvant 
which can be used as a vaccine when combined with antigen sources, or as a complementary immunotherapy 
agent when combined with anti-biotics or anti-virus drugs to treat GI infectious diseases."

the cellular composition of multi-synaptic circuits. As a consequence, this technique is providing fundamental
new insights into the functional architecture of sensory, motor, cognitive and affective circuits in the central
nervous system. The Center for Neuroanatomy with Neurotropic Viruses (CNNV) was created in 2004 to
provide the neuroscience community with access to the highly specialized reagents, training and facilities that
are necessary to use neurotropic viruses as transneuronal tracers.
We document in this application that the CNNV has become an essential national and international resource for
an important segment of the neuroscience community. Users of the Center are funded by 15 different institutes
of the NIH, by NSF and by private foundations and international research organizations. The Center has
established a strong history of providing well-characterized reagents, training and guidance in the use of the
method, and specialized biohazard facilities for performing experiments using neurotropic viruses. The Center
has served as an essential technical and intellectual resource for those interested in using this novel method.
The goal of the Resource Component of this competitive renewal is to continue these essential functions of the
Center."
10848845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The underlying mechanisms that account for initial sensitivity to of SCLC to chemotherapy followed by
profound therapeutic resistance are just beginning to be elucidated. These mechanisms appear to converge on
the ways in which SCLC copes with the replication stress and DNA damage induced by chemotherapy-induced
lesions on DNA. One such mechanism is the epigenetic silencing of SLFN11, a gene implicated as a broad-
spectrum sensitizer to replication stress and DNA damage. Interestingly, mutations in hallmark DNA damage
response and repair genes are infrequent in SCLC which instead appears to be sensitized to chemotherapy by
SLFN11 expression. The precise cellular responses to replication stress altered by SLFN11 expression are not
well-understood and are remarkably understudied, despite SLFN11 expression having been more strongly
associated with chemotherapy sensitivity than mutations in DNA repair genes pan-cancer.
 This study proposes three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 focuses on clarifying the functional
requirements of SLFN11 on the early stages of the replication stress response. To do this, we will express
mutant SLFN11 proteins in cell lines. With these cell lines in hand, we will be able to separate the chronic
effects of SLFN11 expression, which may include altering the steady state levels of many proteins in the cell,
from the acute effects that have been reported to occur at stalled replications forks. In a complementary series
of experiments, Specific Aim 2 will focus on specific downstream signaling cascades impinged upon by
SLFN11. Specific Aim 3 will specifically interrogate downstream targets of SLFN11 to assess their suitability
as candidate drug targets in cell line and animal models of SCLC. These experiments will be important to
determine whether it is possible to develop new strategies to sensitize SCLC to existing therapies that work
through DNA damage.
 These Specific Aims will resolve long-standing questions in the field vis-à-vis to what extent the
translation inhibition or fork poisoning effects of SLFN11 are important in sensitization to replication stress.
They will also make it possible to benchmark new therapeutic strategies for their ability to mimic SLFN11
expression and chemosensitize SCLC that lose SLFN11 expression. Together, these studies will significantly
enhance our understanding of SLFN11 as a candidate biomarker of response while also enabling the
development of new therapeutic strategies to restore and sustain its expression in SCLC."
10848356,"Summary
The production of different types of neurons in the appropriate proportions, called neuronal scaling, is critical
for the formation of functional neural circuits and proper excitatory/inhibitory balance. Disruption of neuronal
scaling contributes to the pathogenesis of developmental brain disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia and
autism. Although significant progress has been made toward understanding the differentiation of specific
neurons, little is known regarding the mechanisms that scale the number of functionally related neurons in the
brain. The cerebellum contains only few neuronal cell types, the developmental origins of which are well-
established. Thus, the cerebellum is an ideal system to study the mechanisms of neuronal scaling. In the
cerebellum, both rhombic lip-derived excitatory granule neurons and ventricular zone-derived inhibitory
interneurons are scaled relative to Purkinje cells, the only output neurons from the cerebellar cortex. Purkinje
cells control the number of granule cells by secreting the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, which promotes the
proliferation of granule cell precursors and the expansion of progenitors in the prospective white matter (pWM)
that give rise to inhibitory interneurons. Before migrating to the pWM, neural progenitors proliferate in the
cerebellar ventricular zone (cVZ), which also gives rise to Purkinje cell layer progenitors (PCLPs), which during
normal development produce exclusively glia. While Shh production by Purkinje cells and Shh transduction in
granule cell precursors has been studied intensively, the neuronal scaling mechanisms that act intrinsically in
cVZ-derived cells are poorly understood. In our preliminary studies, we found that loss of the
Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2) gene results in a unique phenotype with disrupted scaling of both granule cells and
inhibitory interneurons relative to Purkinje cells. Excitingly, our conditional knockout analysis in mice revealed
that Nf2 controls neuronal scaling in the cerebellum acting intrinsically in cVZ-derived cells to regulate several
distinct, poorly understood developmental steps. This proposal will characterize the molecular mechanisms
that regulate neuronal scaling in the cerebellum, using Nf2 as an entry point, in three complementary Aims. In
Aim 1, we will investigate how Nf2 coordinates the proliferation and migration of progenitors in the cVZ,
identifying novel Nf2 downstream targets that regulate each of these processes. In Aim 2, we will define an
Nf2-dependent pathway that regulates the expansion and proliferative response to Shh of pWM progenitors. In
Aim 3, we will identify Nf2-dependent mechanisms that inhibit the misspecification of PCLPs into granule cells,
preventing the production of excessive granule cells during normal development. Our studies will identify basic
mechanisms that regulate development of the cerebellum, a major center of motor coordination and cognitive
functions, will provide novel insights into human cerebellar developmental disorders, and help the development
of brain regeneration therapies."
10848357,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Periprosthetic infections (PPIs) occur in 1-4% of primary total joint replacement and up to 30% of revision
arthroplasty and are difficult to prevent or treat due to the tendency of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus
aureus (S. aureus), to colonize and form biofilms on implant surfaces and to invade the surrounding bone
matrices. Conventional antibiotic prophylaxis and treatments do not adequately address this challenge. We
recently showed that anti-fouling zwitterionic polymers grafted from Ti6Al4V intramedullary (IM) implants, when
combined with a single systemic injection of vancomycin, effectively inhibited S. aureus colonization on implant
surfaces and PPI in murine femoral canals, significantly outperforming either treatment alone. Here, we aim to
facilitate the clinical translation of this promising synergistic anti-PPI strategy by engineering a robust anti-
fouling block copolymer dip-coating as an off-the-shelf product for metallic implants, and an effective and safe
synergistic antibiotic prophylaxis regimen for sustained protection during primary implant insertion and implant
revision, respectively, against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus PPIs. In Aim 1,
high-molecular weight polymethacrylate block copolymers with anti-fouling zwitterionic sidechains and metal
surface-binding sidechains are prepared by sequential Reverse Addition Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT)
polymerization and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Taking advantage of the excellent
control over the degree of polymerization by RAFT and the high-fidelity CuAAC modification of sidechains, the
respective block lengths and chemical nature and spatial density of metal alloy surface-binding residues are
modularly altered to identify an optimal copolymer composition and dip-coating protocol to achieve consistent
and stable anti-fouling coating on Ti6Al4V that can sustain flow wash, sterilization and over-the-shelf storage.
Coated surfaces are characterized by water contact angels, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and resistance
to non-specific protein adsorption and bacterial colonizations in vitro. In Aims 2 and 3, the top anti-fouling dip-
coating chosen in Aim 1 is applied to Ti6Al4V IM pins and examined, along with synergistic antibiotic
prophylaxis, for the efficacy and safety in achieving long-term inhibition of PPI and recurrent PPI caused by
methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or MRSA following the insertion of primary and revision implants in rats,
respectively. The degree of PPI or recurrent PPI as a function of pin coating and the timing/frequency of
synergistic antibiotic prophylaxis are longitudinally monitored by complete blood counts and µCT quantification
of cortical bone thickening, and by endpoint quantification of bacteria on the retrieved pin, torsion test and
histology/electron microscopy characterizations of explanted femurs over the course of 6 months. Long-term
safety of the coating is examined by both femoral histology and systemic organ pathology in the uninfected
control. Success of this study will identify an optimal dip-coating composition and synergistic antibiotic
prophylaxis regimens to effectively combat PPI and recurring PPI, respectively, thereby establishing their
clinical relevance as a new anti-PPI strategy and advancing them to the next stage of their clinical translations."
10848447,"Project Summary/Abstract. Fragile X syndrome (FX) is a widespread type of inherited intellectual disability.
Effective treatments that target mechanisms underlying FX are currently lacking. FX is the foremost monogenic
cause of autism spectrum disorders, and thus many individuals with FX exhibit abnormal social behaviors.
Individuals with FX also often engage in aberrant spatial behaviors such as “elopement”, wandering off and
getting lost. The hippocampus is a brain structure that is particularly vulnerable to FX. Much evidence suggests
that hippocampal areas CA2 and CA1 are important for social behaviors and spatial memory, respectively. Yet,
few studies have investigated whether disturbances in neurophysiological mechanisms in CA2 and CA1 could
underlie impaired social and spatial cognitive functioning in FX. This project’s goal is to address this gap in
knowledge by investigating the extent to which subcellular, cellular, circuit, and neuronal population mechanisms
of social and spatial memory operations in the hippocampus are impaired in rodent models of FX. The studies
will employ state-of-the-art in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological techniques. In vivo approaches will be used
to assess whether impairments in cellular responses in CA2 and coordinated neuronal population activity in CA1
could explain deficits in social and spatial cognition in FX. In vitro experiments will be conducted to uncover
cellular mechanisms underlying altered intrinsic properties of and plasticity in CA2 neurons and aberrant
inhibitory circuits in CA1. Models of FX in two species, specifically Fmr1 knockout (KO) rats and mice, will be
used, allowing comparison of FX pathophysiology across species. Specific Aim 1 will assess whether correlated
neuronal spiking activity between CA2 and one of its major inputs, CA3, is weaker in Fmr1 KO rats than wildtype
rats during exploration of social stimuli. Specific Aim 2 will employ whole cell and patch clamp recordings,
including recordings directly from dendrites, in hippocampal slices to test whether CA2 neurons in Fmr1 KO rats
and mice show impaired synaptic plasticity and deficient responses to the social neuropeptide, oxytocin. Specific
Aim 3 will test whether reactivation, or “replay”, of spike sequences from populations of CA1 neurons that code
for previously learned spatial trajectories is disrupted in Fmr1 KO rats. Replay is critical for spatial memory
operations, and thus disrupted replay could contribute to impaired spatial cognition and behavior in FX. Replay
of CA1 neuronal spike sequences is temporally coordinated by properly timed activation of specific CA1 inhibitory
interneurons. Thus, disrupted replay of CA1 spike sequences in FX may reflect disturbances in CA1 inhibitory
circuits. Specific Aim 4 will employ whole cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons, specific classes of CA1
interneurons, and connected CA1 interneuron-pyramidal cell pairs to test the hypothesis that inhibitory circuits
are disrupted in FX. Successful completion of these Aims will provide novel insights about specific mechanisms
underlying aberrant social and spatial cognition and behaviors in FX. Gaining a deeper understanding of FX
mechanisms is expected to suggest novel targets for intervention in FX."

Apathy, defined as the absence or lack of motivation and emotional detachment, is a clinical feature of
depression. Depressive symptoms and insulin resistance are conditions that are interdependent. Apathy, being
a common depressive symptom in the elderly (> 70 years of age) and among individuals with diabetes, is a
particularly attractive therapeutic target in interventions designed to improve glucose metabolism. The
presence of apathy predicts chronicity of depression and poor response of depressive symptoms to treatment.
Current interventions lack the precision needed to address apathy and its underlying mechanisms. We
hypothesize that increasing insulin sensitivity in apathetic insulin resistant individuals will reduce apathy. Our
preliminary studies show that a low glycemic index (GI) diet and exercise (D+E) intervention for seven days
and 12 weeks increases insulin sensitivity in older adults with obesity. The key feature of a low GI diet is its
high dietary fiber (DF) content. However, to maintain the benefits of a low GI diet in an elderly population, the
fiber must be delivered in DF-dense portions of soft foods. Further, the exercise dose must be sustainable in a
real-world setting. We will compare the traditional low GI diet with a low GI diet containing a novel dietary
intervention using whole soybean pods (soy). To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a dose escalation trial in the
elderly with obesity and determine the maximum tolerated dose of DF delivered in soft foods including 10g,
20g, and 30g of soy and containing 4g, 8g, and 12g of DF respectively. At each dose, eight subjects will
incorporate the foods into their usual diet for one week. We will evaluate tolerability to each dose and measure
fecal short chain fatty acids as a biomarker of compliance. The results from Aim 1 will guide the design and
implementation of Aim 2 that will determine the effect of a low GI D+E program on insulin sensitivity in elderly
subjects with obesity and insulin resistance. To complete this aim we will conduct a 12-week randomized
controlled trial of a low GI D+E program (controlled feeding and supervised exercise) with and without soy in
40 insulin resistant subjects with obesity and depressive symptoms including apathy. Aim 3 will determine the
effect of the D+E intervention on apathy and whether the effect was mediated by changes in insulin sensitivity.
The impact of social, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, and the acceptability of the intervention will
also be evaluated. This research and training will: 1) provide the advanced transdisciplinary training needed to
advance the delivery of D+E interventions in the elderly; 2) position the applicant to emerge as a leader in the
development of efficacious D+E regimens for healthy aging; 3) facilitate the exploration of the effect of insulin
resistance on apathy in age-related neurodegenerative disorders and; 4) precipitate exploration of the
interaction between nutrition and behaviors that drive other depressive symptoms. The additional research will
be funded through future grant programs (R01’s). Understanding the relationship between insulin resistance
and apathy offers unique insights into the biology of aging, congruent with NIA strategic directions for research."
10848449,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebrovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Cerebral
revascularization, especially surgical revascularization, has evolved as an effective surgical therapy for the
management of chronic cerebrovascular diseases such as moyamoya disease, complex aneurysms, and
selected carotid steno-occlusive disease to improve the cerebral hemodynamics and reduce the risk of stroke.
Nonetheless, optimal surgical planning is still unclear as a variety of revascularization techniques can be
considered. To date, the choice of revascularization strategy is primarily based on the subjective interpretation
of flow demands in the at-risk territory. This results in a variable, subjective clinical practice that places patients
at risk for hemodynamics-related postoperative complications, significantly impacting the clinical outcomes. A
segmented and quantitative characterization of cerebral hemodynamics pre- and post-revascularization is
necessary to objectify flow requirements, standardize and improve patient care. However, none of the existing
clinical imaging modalities are able to provide high spatiotemporal resolution angiographic images with
quantitative hemodynamic information from individual arterial segments without contrast agents. Arterial spin
labeling (ASL) possesses appealing features that allow for the assessment of both perfusion and angiography
quantitatively. Building upon our successful track record on the development of ASL 4D MRA as well as ASL
perfusion imaging, the goal of the present project is to develop and evaluate an easily-carry-out noninvasive ASL
suite consisting of advanced 4D MRA and perfusion territorial mapping to quantitively assess cerebral
hemodynamics from individual arteries and downstream tissue pre and post-cerebral revascularization. In Aim
1, we will develop and optimize a novel rapid high spatiotemporal resolution 4D MRA technique (<5minutes). In
Aim2, we will develop and validate post-processing algorithms for cerebral hemodynamic quantification and
vascular territories with 4D MRA and random vessel-encoded ASL. By leveraging the rich clinical resource from
the USC Revascularization Center, in Aim 3, we will quantitively evaluate perioperative hemodynamics on
patients who undergo cerebral revascularization and study the association of revascularization-related
hemodynamic change with clinical outcomes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a robust,
noninvasive, flexible, and quantitative ASL MRI suite within 10 min scan time that is ready to be incorporated
into clinical MRI settings. The proposed technique can be highly valuable as a potential imaging tool for the
quantitative evaluation of flow demands in cerebral revascularization."
10866423,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
All genetic variation—including that underlying heritable disease, cancer, and human evolution—originate from
mutation. Recent large-scale genome sequencing efforts and innovative statistical analysis have uncovered
substantial variation in mutation rate along the human genome, revealing strong impacts of the mutation type
and flanking sequence. However, the molecular mechanisms of this context-dependency of mutation rate are
poorly understood. In addition, mutation rate variation across genomic sites may bias inferences of selection
signals from genomic data, which in turn hinders the identification and functional study of genes that drive
disease. The goal of our research program is to develop computational methods to draw insights into the
molecular mechanisms as well as functional and evolutionary consequences of context-dependent mutation
rate variation. We will first focus on the hypermutability of CpG sites and take a multifaceted approach to
investigate the lesion formation and repair at methylated cytosines in different regions of the genome, by
utilizing existing genomic and epigenomic data from human populations and other species. Successful
completion of this research will contribute to a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the mutational
processes at methylated cytosines. Next, we will improve computational methods for inferring selection on
human genes by leveraging the inherent mutation rate variation across genomic sites. We propose to combine
population genetics models and machine learning techniques to integrate the allele frequency, site-specific
mutation rate, and functional information of variants. The application of these newly developed methods to the
ever-growing genomic data will identify genes crucial to human health and reproduction, and improve
estimates of the burden of deleterious variants introduced by new mutations in each generation. Finally, we will
expand our research scope to somatic mutations and leverage the context-dependency of mutation rates to
better understand cancer driver genes. We will evaluate the relative mutability of cancer driver genes under
different mutational processes, and investigate how tissue-specific relative mutability and selective effect
interact during somatic evolution of tumor. By taking an evolutionary perspective of tumorigenesis, this
research promises to shed new light on the tissue-specificity of cancer driver genes. Together, the proposed
research will develop novel computational approaches that translate the rich genomic and epigenomic data
available into insights into mutational mechanisms, as well as selective forces acting on genes and genetic
variants in human populations and somatic cells."
10863293,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is projected to become the third leading cause of
death globally by 2030. While smoking is a primary risk factor, a growing body of epidemiological
research points to the role of nutrition in modulating the risk for COPD and COPD-related
manifestations, including acute COPD exacerbations (AE-COPD). However, the mechanisms
underlying the impact of dietary components on COPD and AE-COPD are not well understood.
The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and implement a new set of machine learning
and network science-based methods specifically designed to explore the impact of dietary
xenobiotics (DXs) on AE-COPD. DXs are small molecules directly derived from food digestion,
absorption, and related metabolism, captured by untargeted metabolomics. This study ultimately
aims to gain a precise molecular understanding of the mechanisms driving the systemic effects
of diet on AE-COPD. The research design involves developing new methods that leverage the
multi-omics data from COPDGene and SPIROMICS, including longitudinal clinical and molecular
profiling of smokers with and without COPD. First, we will develop ensemble learning techniques
using plasma metabolomic data to identify a DX signature predictive of AE-COPD. Multiple
statistical strategies will be integrated to rank and group DXs based on their ability to predict AE-
COPD frequency and severity (Aim 1). Second, we will combine metric learning algorithms and
spectral theory to quantify the coordinated effect of DXs and circulating proteins on AE-COPD.
The goal is to capture the interplay between proteins and DXs in discerning exacerbation-prone
phenotypes (Aim 2). Third, we will utilize pre-trained deep learning models and network science
to implicate potential mechanisms of action of DXs on AE-COPD. A pipeline will be designed to
annotate and predict DXs’ protein targets and assess their proximity on the interactome to
different subregions of the COPD disease module, to key inflammatory proteins and epigenetic
modifiers (Aim 3). This K25 award will facilitate Dr. Menichetti’s comprehensive training in
longitudinal analysis, pulmonology, inflammatory processes, and integrative omics methods.
Addressing these training gaps will enhance her ability to develop reliable and translationally
relevant methods establishing the foundation for personalized dietary interventions based on
distinct COPD endotypes. Dr. Menichetti has crafted a detailed training plan and assembled a
mentoring team with complementary expertise, ensuring she will receive the necessary guidance
and support to successfully complete her proposal. This K25 will ultimately enable Dr. Menichetti’s
independent career in the methodological foundation of Precision Nutrition for lung disease."
10866427,"Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause
of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently
have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and
corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when
appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that
eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.
 The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to
the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to
corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular)
responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN
should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN
and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.
 Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9
subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type
2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these
data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in
promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation
of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will
use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health
centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative
analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous,
spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library
of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and
accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.
 We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN
(SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN
cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN
controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants
of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to
identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN."
10866511,"SSc is characterized by autoimmunity, small blood vessel vasculopathy, and fibrosis causing damage in
multiple organ systems. Current evidence posits that SSc originates from the endothelial injury, and if vascular
neoangiogenic response fails to repair the damage, downstream pathological fibrosis ensues. Analogous to the
blood vascular system, rarefaction of lymphatic vessels has also been documented in SSc patients. In contrast
to the blood endothelium, the molecular mechanisms governing the lymphatic system defects remain largely
unexplored. Our overarching goal is to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive impairment
of blood and lymphatic systems in SSc. To improve treatment options for SSc vascular disease, there is an
urgent need in uncovering new molecular targets. The signaling molecules that selectively regulate deficiency of
both blood and lymphatic endothelial cells would be desirable targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore,
although there is increased evidence of impaired lymphatic circulation, there have been no studies that
addressed the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of the lymphatic system in SSc. Based on published
and our new preliminary data, we hypothesize that transcription factors ERG is required for regeneration of
lymphatic vasculature and its deficiency leads to impaired wound healing and fibrosis. Furthermore, we
hypothesize that deficiency of ERG is a shared pathological feature, yet with critical variations, between blood
and lymphatic endothelial cells in SSc patients, which may contribute to impaired angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis in these patients. We propose to use a comprehensive strategy, including analysis of gene
expression in freshly isolated BEC and LEC from SSc and control skin biopsies, together with our newly
developed mouse models of SSc vasculopathy based on the postnatal deletion of Erg in blood and lymphatic
cells, and mechanistic in vitro studies to molecularly and functionally characterize the role of ERG deficiency in
blood and lymphatic systems. We propose the following three aims: In Aim 1 we will investigate the role and
functional significance of ERG deficiency in LEC focusing on the signaling pathways controlling proliferation; In
Aim 2 we will use lineage tracing to determine the functional consequences of Erg endothelial deficiency during
physiological neo-angiogenesis and neo-lymphangiogenesis; In Aim 3 we will determine if Erg lymphatic
deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to fibrosis. If successful, the proposed study has the potential to
establish new basic knowledge pertinent to lymphatic cell function and dissect novel mechanism(s) driving SSc
lymphangiopathy."
10866514,"Skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancer, is by far the most common malignancy in the US.
Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a main factor causing skin cancer, via inducing DNA damage,
inflammation, and immunosuppression. The β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonist (β-blocker) carvedilol, a
commonly used drug for cardiovascular disorders, has shown promising activity in preventing UV-induced skin
cancer in vitro and in vivo. However, as a highly potent β-blocker, systemic absorbtion of carvedilol may cause
unwanted cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia and hypotention. To overcome this obstacle, two strategies
are applied: (1) development of a skin targeting nanodelivery system, and (2) examination of the effects of the
non-β-blocking R-carvedilol enantiomer, because carvedilol is a racemic mixture consisting of the β-blocking S-
carvedilol and non-β-blocking R-carvedilol in 1:1 ratio. Preliminary data indicate that topical delivery of
carvedilol loaded nano-transfersome was able to effectively prevent skin cancer without systemic absorption.
Additional data indicate that β-blockade is dispensable for carvedilol's cancer preventive activity. Further
preliminary studies indicate that R-carvedilol, although not a β-blocker, is effective in preventing UV-induced
immunosuppression and skin carcinogenesis without affecting blood pressure. Importantly, both R- and S-
carvedilol inhibit ryanodine receptors (RyRs) by reducing the opening time of this intracellular calcium channel,
and further preliminary data suggest that reducing RyR opening activity represents a previously unexplored
mechanism for skin cancer prevention. Thus, the overall objective of this application is to determine the
molecular target for carvedilol-mediated chemoprevention and examine a novel nanodelivery system of R-
carvedilol as an effective and safe approach for skin cancer prevention. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that
carvedilol prevents cancer independently of β-blockade. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that reducing RyR activity
mediates carvedilol's cancer preventative activity. Aim 3 is test the hypothesis that R-carvedilol can be
formulated in nano-transfersome gel which can be safely and repeatedly applied to the skin without significant
systemic absorption. Since carvedilol is an FDA-approved agent, we anticipate the outcomes from this project
will be readily translated into a cancer preventive regimen for healthy human subjects or individuals with
weakened immune system. Importantly, R-carvedilol, lacking β-blocking activity, is expected to prevent cancer
without cardiovascular disturbance, and therefore should be an excellent drug for skin cancer chemoprevention."
10866517,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which an inability to produce
insulin results in glucose dysregulation. Patients with T1DM experience significant disease burden, making
disease prevention a priority. Environmental exposures are implicated in immune activation and progressive
destruction of insulin-producing β-cells that lead to overt T1DM. Despite several studies investigating the role
of environmental exposures in T1DM etiology, no causative exposures have been identified. One reason is
limited understanding of the timing and combination, i.e., temporal sequences, of exposures that contribute to
T1DM etiology. Modifying these exposures may offer safe and cost-effective approaches to prevent or delay
T1DM disease onset. Therefore, a clearer understanding of the temporal sequences of exposures that drive
T1DM etiology is needed to inform prevention strategies and reduce disease burden.
 Current prevention strategies focus on altering early disease timepoints in the natural history of T1DM,
including immune activation and progressive β-cell destruction. Immune activation is monitored using islet
autoantibodies, and β-cell destruction is approximated using presymptomatic T1DM staging. The temporal
sequences of exposures underlying these early disease timepoints are poorly understood. Therefore, this
proposal seeks to identify temporal sequences of exposures that increase risk for T1DM by modulating islet
autoantibody trajectories and progression through presymptomatic staging. The specific aims of this proposal
are to 1.) determine if temporal sequences of exposures that jointly alter islet autoantibody trajectories increase
risk for T1DM, and 2.) determine if temporal sequences of exposures that are associated with stages of T1DM
can predict presymptomatic progression of T1DM. This work will be investigated using state-of-the-art temporal
machine learning and data mining methods with data from the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the
Young (TEDDY) study. Successful completion of this project will improve the clinical translatability of exposure
modification in T1DM prevention by providing further insight into the timings and combinations of exposures
that are implicated in early T1DM disease timepoints. The analytical pipelines developed in this proposal will
also serve as a framework for elucidating complex temporal interactions in other exposure-driven diseases.
 This application outlines a rigorous scientific and clinical training plan at the University of Utah.
Computational training in temporal machine learning, joint trajectory modeling, and sequential pattern mining in
the Department of Biomedical Informatics will be combined with longitudinal clinical experiences in the Division
of Pediatrics and Endocrinology. These activities, augmented with mentorship from scientific and clinical
experts, will enable the applicant to become a successful physician-scientist in pediatric endocrinology."

prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. This goal will be accomplished by establishing a
stimulating, interdisciplinary environment for collaborative, equitable, and generalizable research that provides
invaluable clinical data, ante-mortem biospecimens, and autopsy brain tissue. Funded by NIA in 2009, the
Wisconsin ADRC will oversee eight well-integrated Cores and the Research Education Component that will
support timely, innovative research, which will: 1) characterize preclinical biomarkers of AD and their role in
predicting transition from preclinical to clinical stages of the disease; 2) investigate the neurobiology of AD; 3)
identify novel vascular and genetic risk factors, linking them to the disease pathology and clinical phenotype; 4)
incorporate contemporary biochemical and molecular techniques into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, including
multidimensional omics and next generation sequencing; and 5) participate and facilitate the missions of other
federal, state, and local agency-supported aging and dementia research programs. The overall goals of the
Center will be accomplished through coordinated activities of its eight Cores and the REC. The Administrative
Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADRC. The Clinical Core will perform standardized evaluations and
collect UDS and additional data on all research participants. It will work closely with the Outreach, Recruitment
and Engagement (ORE) and the Inclusion of Underrepresented Groups (IURG) Cores to enhance enrollment of
participants from underrepresented groups. The Data Management and Statistical (DMS) Core will continue to
meet all data management, informatics, and statistical needs and support all the PC- and web-based services
and processes. The Neuropathology Core will continue to provide neuropathologic diagnoses and process, store,
and distribute antemortem biospecimens and postmortem brain tissue to support novel research in AD. The ORE
Core will provide a broad-range of educational and community outreach programs about AD and support the
Wisconsin ADRC’ goal to recruit research volunteers, especially those from URGs into the Clinical Core and
other NIA-funded initiatives, such as ACTC, ADCS, ADNI, NCRAD and GWAS studies. The IURG Core will work
closely with the ORE and Clinical Cores to enhance recruitment and retention of URG participants into the ADRC.
The Biomarker Core will support and provide access to resources in preclinical neuroimaging and fluid
biomarkers of AD. The REC will coordinate closely with the Clinical, ORE, IURG, Neuropathology, and DMS
Cores to provide state-of-the-art, competency-based training to learners of varied backgrounds and levels of
training, including high school students, undergraduates, doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-stage
faculty in all aspects of aging & dementia research. The Care Research Core will provide novel expertise and
resources to conduct innovative studies that will enhance patient care and change clinical practice."
10857886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep is a crucial, modifiable determinant of energy balance and body weight regulation but is rarely
considered in treatment strategies for obesity. The current standard of care for obesity treatment is lifestyle-
behavior therapy (LBT) to promote improvements in diet and physical activity; however, changes in these
behaviors are difficult to sustain. Anti-obesity medications (AOM) have emerged as a promising modality to
augment LBT. Phentermine is a low-cost sympathomimetic agent accounting for 75% of all AOM prescription
fills. While phentermine can inhibit food intake by increasing norepinephrine levels in hypothalamic nuclei, this
activation of the sympathetic nervous system also promotes arousal and disrupts sleep. Insomnia is a reported
side effect of phentermine monotherapy; however, empirical data are limited. Systematic investigation of the
impact of phentermine on sleep is needed given the key role of sleep in determining energy balance and body
weight: suboptimal sleep leads to obesogenic eating behaviors and predicts poorer weight loss outcomes in
response to treatment. Given the stimulant properties of phentermine and robust relationship between sleep
and energy balance behaviors, we postulate that sleep will influence the treatment response to phentermine
monotherapy and that the magnitude of phentermine’s effect on sleep will vary with the timing of
administration. To address these knowledge gaps and test our working model, we plan to leverage the “Long-
term Effectiveness of the Anti-obesity medication Phentermine” (LEAP) trial, a placebo-controlled randomized
trial funded by the NHLBI to test the impact on body weight of phentermine monotherapy as an adjunct to an
LBT program over 24 mo in 1,000 adults with overweight and obesity. The proposed ancillary study plans to
assess free-living sleep at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 mo visits via objective measures (actigraphy and home
sleep testing) in up to 580 participants (290/arm). Our aims are 3-fold: (1) to test the impact of phentermine vs.
placebo on objective measures of sleep during the treatment period; (2) to assess the influence of timing of
treatment administration during the day on nocturnal sleep; (3) to evaluate whether differences in sleep during
the intervention period influence treatment effects on change in body weight, diet, and physical activity at 24
mo. We anticipate that phentermine will adversely affect sleep relative to placebo, but that adverse effects will
be attenuated among those completing their dosing earlier, relative to later, in the day. Further, given the role
of sleep in weight management, we hypothesize that differences in sleep in response to treatment will
moderate the efficacy of phentermine in producing long-term improvements in body weight and energy balance
behaviors. Results of this ancillary will provide novel insight into the role of sleep in the effect of phentermine
on weight loss and help to identify individuals who might benefit most from this low-cost AOM. Consequently,
findings will guide obesity treatment recommendations to optimize sleep for maximal efficacy."

Poor dietary quality and high rates of diet-related chronic diseases such as type-2 diabetes are urgent national
public health priorities. Shifting dietary patterns in the United States (US) toward more environmentally
sustainable ‘planetary health’ diets has the potential to improve dietary quality and prevent diet-related chronic
diseases while also addressing climate change. Red meat consumption in the US is high and contributes to
both diet-related chronic diseases and climate change. Fast-food restaurants are a key environment to
promote ‘planetary health’-aligned food choices given the frequency of fast-food consumption, the poor dietary
quality of fast foods, and their adverse health effects. Numerous restaurants and food companies have recently
implemented climate-impact labels that inform consumers of each menu item’s carbon footprint (i.e., climate
impact). Climate-impact menu labels are also garnering interest among policymakers. Existing research shows
that nutrition labels can change behavior, but we lack evidence on whether climate labels can promote
healthier as well as more climate friendly food choices. Climate labels could improve dietary quality via lower
red and processed meat intake, but could also promote undeserved perceptions that unhealthy food items are
healthy (i.e., a ‘health-halo’ effect). Given the rapid development and growing food industry and policy interest
in climate-impact labels, there is a critical need for timely, rigorous evaluation of the real-world effects of
climate labels and the optimal design to maximize behavior change. The primary objective of this application is
to conduct two sequential randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the degree to which climate-impact
menu labels influence the healthfulness of purchases at fast-food restaurants and overall dietary intake. The
first study aim is to conduct an RCT to compare the effects of different climate-impact menu label designs on
the healthfulness of hypothetical fast-food meal orders in a nationally representative sample of 6,000 US
adults. We will randomly assign 6,000 adults to view menus from two fast-food restaurants (one burger, one
sandwich) that display one of five types of label designs: 1) control (QR code), 2) green ‘low climate impact’
label; 3) red ‘high climate impact’ label; 4) ‘climate-score’ label; and 5) traffic-light label. The second aim is to
conduct an RCT to evaluate the effect of repeated exposure to climate-impact menu labels on the
healthfulness of real fast-food meal orders, delivered to the participant, over an eight-week period. We will
randomly assign 450 adults to one of two label conditions: control label vs. the label from Aim 1 that led to the
largest improvements in the healthfulness of menu items ordered. In the third aim, we will evaluate the
longitudinal effect of climate-impact menu labels on overall dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index scores)
assessed via multiple 24-hour dietary recalls. Results will provide policy relevant evidence to identify how
menu labels, a proven public health policy approach to change consumer behavior, can be used to improve
diet quality and diet-related health of Americans while also helping address the urgent threat of climate change."

The long-term goal of our research program is to assess the natural disease state of age-related changes in the
vestibular system and improve clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation efforts in adult patients with balance disor-
ders. The overall objective of this application is to use novel electrophysiological methods to identify, for the first
time in humans, nonlinearity in cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) – these re-
sponses reflect activation of the otolith balance organs that detect linear acceleration and are important for bal-
ance function. Nonlinearities of the vestibular system are crucial to its normal function, but these nonlinearities
remain unstudied in humans. The purpose of Aim 1 is to characterize nonlinear response properties and effects
of aging on cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs), reflecting stimulation of the saccule. The purpose of Aim 2 is to charac-
terize nonlinear response properties and effects of aging on ocular VEMPs (oVEMPs), reflecting stimulation of
the utricle. Parallel experiments for each aim will use novel stimulation approaches that allow responses to
sustained vestibular stimulation to be examined. It is hypothesized that stronger nonlinearities will be associated
with better balance function and that a lack of nonlinearities will be associated with poorer balance function. It is
further expected that nonlinear distortion products in these responses will be poorer in both middle age and older
adults – earlier than what is observed with conventional, clinical VEMP measures - as reflected in measures of
total harmonic distortion, consistent with a loss of nonlinear processing. Significant impacts of this research will
include 1) the creation of an early-detection model of vestibular degradation in aging adults, and 2) the develop-
ment of phenotypes, or profiles, of vestibular aging. To date, the largest barrier to clinical phenotyping vestibular
dysfunction is lack of sensitive clinical tools, a barrier the results of this study will overcome. Once it is known
how measurements of nonlinearity in the vestibular system change with age and affect functional balance, more
sensitive measures of vestibular disease and interventions for risk of falls can be developed. From a basic
science perspective, the proposed research will help define the biological process of aging on the processing of
otolith organs and vestibular muscle reflexes – even in the case of unexpected findings with no age-related
decrements observed, we will discover new knowledge regarding human vestibular function. From a clinical
perspective, information gained from the proposed research plan will help to improve approaches to assessing
the human balance system by using the data to identify aging phenotypes, thereby improving our understanding
of both heterogeneity in the aging vestibular function and early detection of adults at risk of falls."

An estimated 2-8 million people in the United States struggle with primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD)—
a functional voice disorder that adversely impacts daily living, occupational productivity, and quality of life and
results in $2 billion in lost annual productivity costs due to absenteeism. Although pMTD results in the same
emotional, social, financial, and occupational hardships as organic, structural, and neurological voice disorders,
its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Excessive paralaryngeal muscle activity and altered phonatory breath-
ing patterns have long been associated with vocal dysfunction in patients with pMTD. However, there is conflict-
ing evidence for the role of paralaryngeal and respiratory movement patterns during phonation and the relation-
ships between the paralaryngeal-respiratory vocal subsystems in patients with pMTD are largely hypothetical.
Two key gaps make it challenging to study these vocal subsystem relationships. The first is physiological: any
number of combinations of paralaryngeal and thoracoabdominal respiratory movements can result in similar
vocal output profiles. The second is methodological: tools to quantify movement patterns on spatial and temporal
scales across multiple degrees of freedom within and across the paralaryngeal-respiratory vocal subsystems are
lacking. These gaps make it difficult to identify aberrant kinematic patterns that could cause symptom complaints
of dysphonia, vocal effort and fatigue, and difficulties with increased vocal demands in patients with pMTD.
Recent work from the PI’s lab found patients with pMTD had significantly increased movement variability in the
paralaryngeal region closest to the larynx using motion capture (MoCap) technology compared to vocally healthy
controls, especially with increased acute vocal demands. Spatiotemporal paralaryngeal variability in this region
significantly correlated with standard clinical acoustic metrics of aberrant vocal quality. Using this MoCap tech-
nology, we test the central hypothesis that an unstable paralaryngeal-respiratory vocal system is responsible for
the symptoms of dysphonia, increased vocal effort, and vocal strain in pMTD across three aims. In Aim 1, we
compare paralaryngeal-respiratory spatiotemporal coordination in patients with pMTD and vocally healthy con-
trols. In Aim 2, we compare paralaryngeal-respiratory spatiotemporal coordination to standard voice metrics in
patients with pMTD. In Aim 3, we characterize the effects of increased vocal demands with a vocal load challenge
on pre-post load laryngeal-respiratory spatiotemporal pattern changes in patients with pMTD.
The outcomes of this proposal will lead to improved physiological knowledge and methodological tools to under-
stand the elusive voice disorder that is pMTD and can be applied to other common types of voice disorders in
future investigations. These approaches are also critical for the development of interventions designed to en-
hance and optimize vocal productions essential for communication and vocation."

Identifying novel therapeutics to delay, and potentially reverse, age-related cognitive decline is critical in light of
the increased incidence of dementia-related disorders forecasted in the growing elderly population. Exercise has
been shown to rejuvenate regenerative capacity and cognition in the aged brain in animal models. Moreover,
exercise has been shown to improve learning and memory in Alzheimer’s disease patients. Excitingly, our lab
recently demonstrated that systemic administration of blood plasma derived from exercised mice reverses age-
related impairments in adult neurogenesis and cognition in aged mice. We identify glycosylphosphatidylinositol
specific phospholipase D1 (Gpld1) as a liver-derived exercise blood factor – the plasma levels of which correlate
with improved cognitive function in aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in active healthy elderly
humans. Functionally, we show that increasing liver-derived systemic Gpld1 in aged mice ameliorates age-
related regenerative and cognitive impairments. These data raise fundamental questions as to the function of
liver-derived systemic Gpld1: How long lasting are the rejuvenating effects of systemic Gpld1 on the aged brain?
What is the role of systemic Gpld1 in mediating the rejuvenating effects of exercise on the aged brain? 3. What
molecular mechanisms underly the rejuvenating effects of systemic Gpld1 in the aged brain? The purpose of the
proposed study is to investigate the rejuvenating effects of systemic Gpld1 on the aged brain. Specifically, our
hypothesis is that exercise-induced liver-derived systemic Gpld1 elicits long lasting rejuvenation of regenerative
and cognitive functions in the aged hippocampus. We will test this theory with Three Specific Aims: 1:
Characterize the kinetics of brain rejuvenation following increased liver-derived systemic Gpld1. 2: Investigate
the necessity of exercise-induced systemic Gpld1 in mediating the rejuvenating effects of exercise on the aged
brain. 3: Determine molecular mechanisms underlying the rejuvenating effects of liver-derived systemic Gpld1 in
the aged brain. Successful completion of these studies will have significant translational potential, revealing
pathways that could be targeted for novel therapies to ameliorate age-related neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer’s disease."

This application describes my research on cell signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to be performed within
the context of a 5-year mentored career development plan. My ultimate goal is to become an independent
physician-scientist in the area of laboratory-based academic Hematology/Oncology. Under the guidance of my
primary research mentor, Dr. Martin Carroll, at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), I have developed a
structured training plan consisting of intensive laboratory research, didactics, and oversight by an experienced
faculty advisory committee. The proposed research will focus on mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 targeted
therapy in AML based on key insights from the clinical trials of these agents conducted at UPENN. Early
generation FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) were met with lukewarm enthusiasm due to poor target specificity and limited
bioavailability. Newer agents have recently been developed with improved activity against FLT3 and clinical
efficacy as evidenced by clearance of leukemic blast cells. However, these agents are not curative and many
patients respond with differentiation rather than eradication of the leukemic clone. This raises important
questions about how FLT3 regulates the differentiation state of leukemia cells. In preliminary studies, I identified
a novel pathway downstream of FLT3 inhibition that leads to rapid downregulation of the histone
methyltransferase, EZH2. EZH2 is the catalytic component of the PRC2 transcriptional repressor. This research
represents the first demonstration of FLT3 regulation of an epigenetic modifier. Loss of EZH2 activity has been
linked to increased myeloid differentiation and decreased leukemogenicity, making it an attractive target to study
as a potential mechanism for FLT3i-induced differentiation. This proposal aims to demonstrate that PRC2 is
necessary for FLT3-ITD leukemogenesis (Aim 1), demonstrate that FLT3i functionally inhibit PRC2 activity (Aim
2), and determine the mechanism of EZH2 downregulation after FLT3 inhibition (Aim 3). These findings will
provide insight into the biology of FLT3 signaling and identify improved approaches to induce terminal
differentiation of FLT3-ITD leukemia cells. In undertaking the proposed studies and training plan, I will develop
the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent career in translational research."

The use of genomic sequencing at birth to inform the ongoing care of children has generated great
enthusiasm. Genomic sequencing can act as a screening tool for identifying newborns with existing genetic
disorders; additionally, results can identify newborns with genetic predispositions for future disease that could
be prevented or mitigated through early intervention. In addition, genomic sequencing can help health care
providers manage their patients’ medications by characterizing genes associated with drug metabolism and
modifying medication choices accordingly. These applications and more have raised hopes that genomic
sequencing could complement traditional newborn screening and provide lifelong benefits to individuals and
families. However, great uncertainties exist on how genomic sequencing should be implemented by health
systems and how state newborn screening programs can help genomic sequencing achieve its potential. The
long-term impact of genomic sequencing results on the family are unclear, and projections about how
genomics screening findings will be managed over time are predicated on unverified assumptions that families
and health care providers will be able to access results over time and will continue to follow best practice
recommendations for surveillance of high-risk findings as individuals age. Moreover, the evolving evidence
about gene-disease and gene-drug interactions raises questions about whether, when, and how frequently
molecular laboratories should reanalyze genomic information.
This proposal addresses these key questions about how to ensure newborn genomic sequencing provides
lifelong benefits and value. We will conduct key-informant interviews to understand the needs and concerns of
clinicians, health system leaders, and coordinators of newborn screening programs regarding how newborn
genomic sequencing should be implemented to complement traditional newborn screening, and what systems
need to be designed to maximize their utility over time for children and their families. We will also conduct
follow-up studies of individuals who participated in prior clinical trials of newborn genomic sequencing to
document how health care providers and families utilized genomic information as children aged, and to provide
insight about the benefits and harms that may have accrued. In addition, we will develop a mathematical model
to project the lifelong benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for reanalyzing existing
genomic information over time. The goal of this study is to provide critically-needed evidence about how to
implement newborn genomic sequencing, manage findings, and reanalyze data to ensure newborn genomic
sequencing fulfills its promise as a tool that provides lifelong benefits to individuals and advances public health."

Respiratory viral infections represent a major risk factor for the development of asthma.
Moreover, severe influenza injury can result in ineffective repair and persistent loss of
pulmonary function. The enduring changes caused by viral-induced lung injury that
might explain chronic disease are not understood. We recently identified ectopic tuft /
solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) arising in the distal lung after H1N1 influenza
infection. Since SCCs are increasingly recognized as critical orchestrators of both
inflammation and epithelial tissue regeneration and remodeling, we posit that they are a
likely driver of chronic lung pathology. This proposal will address the central
hypothesis that inactivation / ablation of ectopic SCCs will promote the resolution
of dysplastic remodeling and reduce chronic Th2-biased inflammatory disease,
but may also increase susceptibility to pathogens controlled by Th2 responses
following influenza infection. The major aims to address this hypothesis are to 1)
ascertain the effects of SCC presence and specific SCC-derived signals on epithelial
progenitor cells (fate and proliferation) during repair, and 2) determine whether the
development of SCCs impacts Th2-mediated inflammatory disease (asthma) or
parasitic protection. Completion of this project will validate SCCs as important drivers of
pulmonary disease and will also facilitate identification of specific SCC effector
pathways that could allow for preservation of host-protective benefits while attenuating
their contribution to pathology."
10859193,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) result from inherited deficiencies in any of the eight proteins that function in the
essential biochemical pathway that converts neurotoxic ammonia into urea. Infants with neonatal onset UCDs
often appear healthy at birth, but the rapid accumulation of ammonia in their blood and brain can lead to coma
and death. Although timely diagnosis and treatment is key to improving patient outcome, the sensitivity,
specificity, and variability of the biochemical assays for several UCDs have limited their use in newborn
screening. Genome sequencing has the potential to simultaneously screen for most inherited diseases that arise
in the newborn period, including many high priority conditions for which reliable newborn screening assays do
not currently exist. While UCD screening by newborn genome sequencing (NBSeq) has broad support, variant
interpretation is a major obstacle. Specifically, it is not currently possible to make a prognosis when a sequencing
report contains one or more uncharacterized variants (variants of uncertain significance, VUS) in a known
disease gene. Because each person’s genome contains thousands of rare variants of uncertain significance,
NBSeq will frequently return them.
We will advance NBSeq for five UCDs (OTC, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, and SLC25A15 deficiencies) through a project
that addresses three aspects of this critical unmet need. The first is the paucity of functional data from validated
assays that are available for use in variant interpretation. For each of the five genes that underlie these UCDs,
we will measure the functional impact of all amino acid substitutions that are likely to occur in the human
population. The second is the inability to estimate a patient’s genetic risk of UCDs for alleles of uncertain
significance. We will provide clinicians with a tool that allows them to estimate the genetic component of disease
severity using functional data. The third is the limited amount of clinical data available for these rare diseases.
We will leverage a powerful set of clinical resources, including a large longitudinal study of UCD patients, and a
close collaboration between clinicians, technologists, and experts in the biological pathways. Clinical data will
inform functional assay design, enable cross-validation of the results with patient phenotypes, and allow us to
answer important clinical questions about these rare diseases. Thus, by expanding the early identification of
newborns with UCDs, this project will ultimately improve care of infants with these devastating diseases."
10859260,"Project Summary / Abstract
Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and disparities nationwide and limited provider adoption of
and patient adherence to the prevailing evidence-based recommendations for chronic management represent
tractable areas for implementation focus. In their 2020 Focused Updates, the NHLBI codified a new paradigm
of asthma management - single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) - as the preferred management
strategy for moderate/severe asthma management. In addition to its efficacy and safety, SMART has
demonstrated real-world effectiveness in international settings, likely due in part to better adherence to daily
therapy and less inhaler confusion. However, SMART has not been widely implemented in practice in the US
and there are no prior studies of its real-world effectiveness in US pediatric populations. In preliminary work,
investigators identified several critical barriers to SMART implementation, including insufficient: (1) decision
support/training for providers to identify and educate eligible patients at the point of care, (2) ongoing patient
education on key components of SMART once prescribed, and (3) systems-level issues, such as negative
reinforcement by providers unfamiliar with SMART and insurance denials. The proposed study is a type II
hybrid effectiveness-implementation study that uses a cluster-randomized design within 18 pediatric primary
care clinics in a large US pediatric health system whose demographics mirror US asthma morbidity statistics.
Enrolled clinics will be randomized to one of two study conditions, to iteratively compare a real-world control
condition and two successive implementation strategies: (Phase 1) electronic health record-based Clinical
Decision Support integrated with clinician workflows plus provider and patient education outreach (referred to
as CDS+), and (Phase 2) CDS+ combined with Population Health Management (PHM), which adds
longitudinal caregiver/patient SMART education, social support, and health system/insurance navigation
provided by an evidence-based asthma community health worker program and nurse care manager. Using this
approach, the project’s specific aims are to (1) conduct a cluster RCT that sequentially compares the effects of
first CDS+ alone and then CDS+ with PHM to usual care on visit-level SMART adoption (primary outcome),
patient-level sustained adoption, and clinic-level penetration of SMART (secondary outcomes); (2) determine
the real-world effectiveness of SMART in reducing severe asthma exacerbations in a predominantly Black
cohort of children with poorly controlled asthma; and (3) assess mechanisms of successful SMART
implementation and effectiveness using mixed methods. The findings of this study will inform broader national
implementation and dissemination strategies for SMART by establishing an evidence base for SMART
effectiveness in a racially diverse US pediatric population and through sharing of potentially effective clinical
decision support enhancements or implementation manuals through existing national networks."
10864048,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stimuli presented too briefly to be noticed can nonetheless facilitate the perceptual processing of the same
stimuli many minutes later. Whereas the phenomenon of subliminal priming has been known for decades,
whether and how sensory information is encoded in the brain in the absence of awareness in a way that
influences subsequent sensory processing across neuronal circuits remains a mystery. We will answer these
questions for the first time by examining, at single cell resolution, whether exposure to subliminal stimuli
influences perceptual performance and the coding of information across visual cortical populations. To
accomplish this goal, we will use multiple-electrode recording of single-unit activity in macaque early and mid-
level visual cortical areas (V1 and V4) and behavioral techniques to examine the dynamics and coding in
neuronal populations during and after subliminal exposure, and their impact on perceptual performance. Aim 1
will investigate whether exposure to subliminal stimuli increases subsequent perceptual performance and the
amount of information encoded in population activity. Our hypothesis is that subliminal exposure improves
perceptual discrimination performance when stimuli are subsequently presented above the detectability
threshold, and increases the amount of information extracted from the population response. Aim 2 will examine
the mechanism of the improvement in neuronal and behavioral performance after subliminal exposure. We will
first focus on causal experiments involving optogenetic inactivation which will test whether suppressing
neuronal activity in visual cortex during the presentation of subliminal stimuli reduces the strength of subliminal
priming. Cross-correlation analysis will subsequently test whether improved network and perceptual
performance after subliminal exposure is consistent with a Hebbian mechanism underlying the increase in
functional connectivity specifically for the neurons activated by subthreshold stimuli. Aim 3 will examine the
impact of attention on the relationship between subliminal priming and neuronal and perceptual performance.
We will test the novel hypothesis that spatial attention reduces the efficacy of subliminal priming – exposure to
unattended subliminal stimulation will be associated with a larger improvement in network coding and
perceptual performance compared to exposure to attended information. In contrast, we expect that attention
will increase the strength of supraliminal priming, i.e., exposure to attended subliminal stimulation will be
associated with a larger improvement in network coding and perceptual performance compared to exposure to
unattended information. Taken together, our proposed experiments can potentially advance our understanding
of information coding in visual cortex by testing the limits of sensory experience and its relationship with
perception, which will help develop effective therapies to treat the brain-based aspects of low vision conditions,
such as amblyopia, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or stroke."
10936540,"In response to highly publicized concerns regarding Veteran deaths and Veterans’ access to care in the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Congress enacted the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act
(VACAA) in 2014 to establish the Veterans Choice Program (VCP) and expand the availability of community
care for eligible Veterans. Since its inception, VCP has grown considerably, comprising nearly half a million
providers, and Veterans using VCP now account for represents 17% of all users of VHA care. Due to the
recency of VCP implementation, research on its impacts is limited but highlights issues with inadequacies of
community provider networks to meet Veterans’ healthcare needs. Simultaneously, Veterans have also not
been given access to information regarding VCP provider networks and can be uncertain of which providers
are available to them. As a result, further investigation is needed to better understand how Veterans receive
information regarding community care and how this information informs their decision to seek VA-purchased
community care. This is required in conjunction with a concerted effort define, measure, and evaluate network
adequacy for non-VA community care networks. Taken together, these steps will ensure that the needs of
Veterans carefully assessed and appropriate standards are developed to meet the healthcare needs among
Veterans seeking and requiring non-VA community care.
This project will use a mixed methods design to identify healthcare market, medical center, Third Party
Administrator, and Veteran characteristics and preferences that support or impede network adequacy and
therefore, Veterans’ access to care. We will use quantitative methods to leverage standardized national data
and processes combined with qualitative methods to account for individual VA medical center contexts and
Veteran preferences. Using this design, the project will complete three main objectives. The first objective of
this study is to develop and validate measures of network adequacy for non-VA community care and evaluate
regional variations in network adequacy across VAMCs and VA’s 98 markets. Relatedly, the project seeks to
examine the process by which Community Care decisions are made at individual VA facilities, and to identify
existing and potential opportunities to expand community partnerships to deliver Community Care. The project
will also interview Veterans regarding Community Care, including preferences for a network directory of
providers and quality ratings of providers to more completely understand their perspectives on Community
Care. These objectives have important implications for VHA healthcare and the development of strong
community networks and connections between VHA and surrounding community providers to provide quality
healthcare to Veterans. As a result, this study team and project will address an important priority with VHA and,
in the long-term, improve community services for Veterans who receive care in the VHA."

 Our project will address a major gap in existing neuroscience research tools, through the development of
intersectional genetic tools for drug-controlled manipulation of specific synaptic connections between two
genetically- or anatomically-defined neuronal populations. The tools we have engineered build from established cell
manipulation tools – DREADDs, PSAMs, and tetanus toxin – but critically, introduce trans-synaptic gating. Thus,
the tools become activatable only at user-selected, genetically-defined cell-cell contact sites. We propose to develop
three tool platforms in Aims 1-3, which enable drug-controlled synapse manipulation by three different mechanisms
and on three different timescales – ranging from seconds to minutes for antigen-gated PSAM ion channels to hours
for antigen-gated trans-tetanus toxin. We have designed the antigen-gating of our tools to be both modular and
programmable, so that either exogenous (e.g., surface GFP) or endogenous (e.g., tumor marker GD2) trans-synaptic
triggers can be used. To develop and optimize these tools, we will rely on the extensive protein engineering and
directed evolution expertise of PI Alice Ting, who has previously developed proximity labeling enzymes and calcium
integrators that are widely used in the neuroscience community.
 We will carefully validate the tools in two distinct mouse brain regions in the labs of PIs Xiaoke Chen and
Ivan Soltesz. Chen will evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the proposed tools by assessing their ability to
thoroughly and selectively silence connections from the paraventricular thalamus and prefrontal cortex onto two types
of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons. We will use a combination of electrophysiological recording and
optogenetic pathway stimulation and calcium imaging on ex vivo brain slices to read out drug-gated inhibition of
these circuits. We will then utilize these tools in vivo to study the circuit mechanisms of opioid withdrawal and
cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. In the Soltesz lab, we plan to apply the tools to answer previously untestable
questions about the roles of cell-type specific projections in regulating hippocampal function across scales from local
microcircuits to long-range inputs. Our hippocampal experiments will use single cell electrophysiology, optogenetics,
in vivo imaging of behavior-associated neuronal activity, local field potential recordings and behavioral memory tests.
Constant feedback between these ex vivo and in vivo studies and the tool engineering efforts in Aims 1-3 will ensure
that our tools are optimized for maximal efficacy, specificity, and robustness.
 Our team is highly interdisciplinary and diverse, combining the chemical biology and protein engineering
expertise of Alice Ting with the systems and molecular neuroscience expertise of Xiaoke Chen and Ivan Soltesz.
Soltesz is a pioneer in exploring the roles of hippocampal neuronal subpopulations in normal and pathological circuit
function, while Chen has uncovered novel circuit mchanisms underlying pain and addiction. Though our proposed
aims are highly ambitious, they are feasible given the track record, expertise, and synergy of the team, as well as the
strong preliminary data presented."
10864808,"Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk
of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death from asthma. Despite well established guidelines,
under-treatment for asthma is common, particularly for poor urban teens. Our prior work has demonstrated that
school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for
young, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can
effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for
DOT and for follow-up care. We recently conducted a study for teens with persistent asthma which included a
trial of DOT of preventive medications at school paired with motivational interviewing (MI) counseling to
promote independent adherence. While this program successfully improved medication adherence, it had a
limited effect on asthma symptoms, and in particular many of the teens with moderate to severe persistent
asthma at baseline continued to experience poor control despite the intervention. This was at least in part
because for many of these teens, the medications initially prescribed for DOT were not optimally adjusted by
PCPs and their asthma was undertreated. We realize that this program may be insufficient for these teens (>½
of the overall sample), since access to recommended specialist consultation for medication step-up or
management of co-morbidities was not included. Further, while education and self-management support are
critical for this age group, the MI counseling in this program required resources for several in-person visits. We
now aim to test a novel, developmentally appropriate and scalable model of care to ensure optimal guideline-
based treatment for urban teens with difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma
Management-Uniting Providers for Teens (TEAM-UP Teens) program includes 3 core components: 1) An
optimized asthma management plan developed at the start of the school year via a real-time, synchronous
school-based telemedicine visit that directly connects the teen to an asthma specialist, 2) School-based DOT
to implement the medication plan and allow for teens to experience the benefits of consistent therapy, 3)
Follow-up telehealth visits with a nurse asthma educator to facilitate ongoing care and provide developmentally
appropriate self-management support. In response to PA-18-722; Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment
and Prevention Regimens, we propose a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP for Teens vs an enhanced
care (EC) control group (n=360, 12-16yrs). We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by
implementing both telemedicine visits and DOT in schools. We will assess the effectiveness of TEAM-UP for
Teens in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6,
9, and 12 months) versus EC. At the study's completion, the program will be better defined as a sustainable
means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk teens with moderate to severe persistent asthma."
10864810,"Project Summary/Abstract
Educational attainment is a health disparities issue. School dropout is one of the strongest predictors of health
disparities across the lifespan, and improving educational outcomes has the potential to save eight times more
lives than medical advances. Dropping out of school is the culmination of a longer process of school
disengagement that starts much earlier in development. Fortunately, school disengagement is a modifiable
health determinant. However, a clearer understanding of the complex interactions among multiple, upstream
risk factors for school disengagement is needed to guide the development and evaluation of school-based
programming aimed at reducing distal health disparities. Exclusionary disciplinary practices (EDPs) in schools,
such as detentions and suspensions, are consistently associated with school disengagement. They are also
disproportionately used against students of color, which may lead to perceived discrimination and further
school disengagement, underscoring the notion that EDPs can be a form of race-based trauma. Due to
structural and institutional inequities, minority youth are also at increased risk for experiencing childhood
adversity, and mounting evidence suggests that experiencing childhood adversity lowers tolerance to coping
with later stressors. Thus, experiencing an EDP may be particularly harmful among minority youth previously
exposed to childhood adversity. Neurobiological functioning associated with childhood adversity may partially
explain this process. Guided by theories of neurobiological and minority stress, the specific research aims of
the proposed project include: 1) Determining whether discrimination mediates the associations between EDPs
and school disengagement; 2) Examining whether childhood adversity moderates the associations between
EDPs, discrimination, and school disengagement; 3) Examining whether neurobiological factors associated
with childhood adversity moderate the associations between EDPs, discrimination, and school disengagement;
and 4) Exploring how COVID-19 and remote-learning environments influenced the associations between
EDPs, discrimination, and school disengagement. This K01 proposal will be achieved by leveraging data from
the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a ten-year longitudinal study examining
brain development and child health among 11,878 youth within the United States. To build upon my expertise
in developmental psychopathology, I require advanced training in (1) neurobiological sciences applied to
childhood adversity; (2) quantitative analyses related to longitudinal, finite mixture modeling; (3) school-based
determinants of health and their associations with minority health and health disparities; (4) addressing social
and structural inequities within clinical, research, and academic settings; and (5) achieving scientific
independence as a health-disparities researcher. This project complements my previous training as a clinical
psychologist and will enable me to pursue a future line of independent, health disparities research using a
neurobiological, trauma-informed, school-based framework."
10861490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hallucinations are prevalent in the context of a wide variety of mental disorders but also occur in approximately
10% of the general population. Hallucinatory experiences are readily identifiable by those experiencing them,
but they are not always indicators of conditions that lead to serious negative outcomes such as
hospitalizations, use of emergency services, and suicide attempt. Our risk evaluation capabilities are
hampered, in part, by the limitations of our assessment strategies which typically involve resource intensive
clinical interviews, administered by trained clinicians, in clinic settings. Ubiquitous smartphone technologies
offer us novel opportunities to administer behavioral measures that can capture the experience and impact of
hallucinations at a scope, scale, and ecological validity that far exceed clinic-based assessment capabilities.
Applying powerful computational methods to the rich data collected using mobile behavioral tasks has the
potential to yield tools for identification of those at heightened risk for major clinical and functional impairments.
In response to RFA-MH-23-105, we propose to recruit a large sample of people experiencing hallucinations to
install a smartphone behavioral measurement package that will prompt them to complete targeted brief self-
report measures, audio diaries describing their hallucinatory experiences, and validated audio-administered
verbal memory tasks in their own environments. Participants will also complete clinical outcome measures
prospectively. Our team will derive data-driven clinical signatures from the mobile behavioral tasks to predict
individual differences in severe negative outcomes among people experiencing hallucinations; identify and
mitigate bias in modelling across groups defined by race, sex, and age; examine whether adding smartphone-
captured behavioral data to information that is typically available in the clinical record improves model clinical
utility; and produce machine learning-ready data structures that adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) principles, and can be shared with the broader scientific community for ongoing
iterative testing and refinement. If successful, the project will produce data-driven tools that will advance our
ability to allocate the right clinical resources, at the right time, to the right people."

of our program to a rapidly changing scientific environment yet tailored to the needs of each trainee. We provide
a strong informatics foundation and a mission that builds on four focus areas: Health Care/Clinical Informatics,
Clinical Research Informatics, Public Health Informatics, and Translational Bioinformatics. Woven through these
focus areas are strong methodology tracks and focus research threads.
UofU Department of Biomedical Informatics and our partners, Intermountain Healthcare and the regional
Veterans Administration Medical Center, are national leaders in Informatics as well as supported by relationships
with the Utah Department of Health, twelve partner clinics in underserved communities, and a statewide nonprofit
health information exchange (UHIN). These environments, together with the instruction of the responsible
conduct of research and methods for enhancing reproducibility, provide ample opportunities to practice team
science through hands-on integrated learning activities, applications, and practicum-based courses in the
curriculum that greatly enhances the impact and rigor of the program. This ensures our trainees will be fully
equipped with the requisite command of theory, mastery of skills, and deep knowledge base required to
drive interdisciplinary projects forward. The aims of our training program are:
1. Provide a rigorous and customizable curriculum, giving each trainee both the necessary foundation and the
 specialized education under the guidance of exceptional mentors to enable an innovative and productive
 research career in biomedical informatics;
2. Recruit trainees nationally and internationally with a special emphasis on attracting women and
 underrepresented minorities to enrich diversity in the field of biomedical informatics in Utah and beyond;
3. Ensure a solid grounding in the responsible conduct of research and a dedication to scientific rigor;
4. Provide a comprehensive research environment and culture of inclusivity, with the broadest possible variety
 of resources for faculty and students, to encourage creativity and rigor in their research; and perform

The requested trainees (8 pre-, 4 post- doctoral) will participate in a 4-year program of research, didactic
coursework, and professional development. The 22 mentors represent a range of interdisciplinary informaticians

10863960,"Accumulating data from human and mouse support the hypothesis that system level lipid disregulation is an
early and critical factor in etiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The explosion of 'omics
methods in the past decade has resulted in a proliferation of various studies and data sets that interrogate
specific regions of the brain. Using Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS), our preliminary studies have found
regionally differential lipid composition in coronal sections from wild type mouse brain and a mouse model of
Alzheimer's disease over expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene. This regional lipid
disregulation requires system-wide interrogation of lipid homeostasis which can singularly be accomplished
with lididomics. A candidate based screen of lipid modifying enzymes in mouse embryonic stem cells for
resistance to Aβ-triggered synapse loss, identified multiple metabolic enzymes which may be responsible for
exit of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from an acyl chain
remodeling pathway, the Land's cycle. The Land's cycle has recently been identified to be dysfunctional in two
animal models of AD. In the human context, DHA transport into the brain is aberrant by age 30, in carriers of a
variant of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) strongly associated with AD risk. Synthesis of these results with multiple
hits from GWAS implicating lipid metabolism and transport, strongly support system-wide dyshomeostatis of
acyl chain composition in the brain. However, the reports of regionally defined lipid composition are currently
limited. We propose to test the hypothesis that acyl chain composition among multiple lipid classes is severely
disregulated in brain regions known to be susceptible in AD including hippocampus and entorhynal cortex.
Using IMS we will interrogate the lipid composition of mouse models of AD, Tg2576 and targeted replacement
APOE mice as well as human brain tissue. We will then test the hypothesis that DHA accretion is a critical
modifier of AD associated behavioral deficits and pathology in mouse models using knock-out lines of acyl-
CoA synthetase 6 (Acsl6), a key mediator of DHA enrichment in the brain. We will generate new strains of
Tg2576 and TRAPOE4 lacking Acsl6 and overexpressing Acsl6 to determine both necessity and sufficiency of
DHA brain accretion for AD associated deficits. Finally, we will integrate and assemble our data into a
publically available lipid brain atlas. These studies have potential to synthesize accumulating lipidomics data in
aging and neurodegenerative disease. The use of spatial lipidomics at scale in the brain has not been yet be
comprehensively accomplished, and is required for clear understanding of the basic metabolic pathways thus
uncovering connectivity and functionality in the brain. Completion of these studies will represent compelling
evidence for the critical nature of lipid composition in basic biology of AD and lead to new strategies for
biomarker discovery as well as therapeutic targets."
10863961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and affects millions
of people worldwide. The population burden of AD is rapidly growing due to increases in human life expectancy,
and is now presenting an urgent public health issue. Unfortunately, the biological mechanisms that cause AD
are not well understood, and therapies that have targeted pathological hallmarks of the disease have not been
effective to date. One reason it is difficult to design and test therapies for AD is that the translational aspects of
animal models on which preclinical studies are performed are not well defined. Another reason is that we
currently lack good disease biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic target engagement. This
research proposal aims to further our understanding of the translational aspects of AD animal models with a goal
of improving the models, and seeks to further our understanding of the pathological changes that occur in AD
brain with a goal of developing better biomarkers for the disease.
 Proteomic network analysis of AD brain has led to insights about the complicated biological changes that
occur at the protein level in Alzheimer’s disease. In the research component of this career development proposal,
I aim to use mass spectrometry-based proteomic network analysis to compare an AD transgenic mouse model
to the human disease in order to assess the translational aspects of this model (Aim 1). I will also compare
autosomal dominant, sporadic early-onset, and sporadic late-onset AD to one another at the proteomic network
level to determine the similarities and differences between these forms of AD (Aim 2). Results from these studies
in brain will be used to develop a list of proteins that I will measure in cerebrospinal fluid to assess their utility as
AD biomarkers (Aim 3). These experiments will further our understanding of the relationship between AD mouse
models and human disease, our understanding of early-onset AD, and our goal of developing AD molecular
biomarkers beyond the amyloid-β and tau proteins.
 I am a physician-scientist with a strong commitment to becoming a leader in the field of Alzheimer’s disease
research who uses new approaches to advance our understanding of this devastating disease of the aging
central nervous system. I have received multidisciplinary training through previous research and clinical
activities, including a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and an M.D. with specialty training in
neurology and subspecialty training in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. This mentored career
development proposal seeks to extend this training to develop expertise in new cutting-edge techniques,
including powerful proteomic and network biology approaches, so that I may become a leader in this new area
of AD research."
10862041,"This project will address the HSR&D Long-Term Care and Aging priority by investigating Medical Foster
Homes (MFHs) as a community-based long-term care (LTC) alternative, and in particular compared to
Community Nursing Home (CNH) care, the primary program serving LTC needs in institutions. MFH care is
provided in private residences with trained and licensed caregivers, who live on the premises, that serve up to
three Veterans who receive VA Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) services. The need for 24 hour per day
care is increasing as the Veteran population ages. The GAO has projected that, by the year 2037, Veterans’
use of CNHs will increase 80%, and corresponding expenditures will increase approximately 150%, from a
2017 benchmark. Medical Foster Homes care is potentially less expensive for the VA. However, as the VA
considers expanding coverage of direct room & board cost of the MFH to more Veterans, the cost advantage is
unclear and understanding the implications of the MFH environment on Veteran cost and utilization becomes
more important. Across the VA, MFH programs vary in the effort and experience of the coordinators that
manage them. Although there is evidence that MFH programs cost less than CNH in the past, current
estimates are lacking, and the extent to which such cost savings is related to MFH program coordinator effort
and experience has not been established, nor is it understood whether saving is facilitated by VA patient safety
culture. To provide a cost saving alternative to institutional care, it is important to understand coordinator
impact on efficiency of operations. This project will determine the impact of dedicated coordinator effort and
experience, on overall MFH Veteran direct healthcare costs. Additionally, to be a high reliability organization,
the VA emphasizes the development of a patient safety culture among its facilities. This project will determine
whether a patient safety culture moderates the impact of coordinators on program efficiency and will inform
decisions regarding program coordinator coverage and training as impacted by patient safety culture.
 Research on MFHs (see HSR&D CRE 12-029, PI Cari Levy, and subsequent publications) have shown
that VA costs and were lower among Veterans after MFH and costs were lower than Community Nursing
Homes using FY2011 data. Moreover, qualitative work has explored the role of more experienced programs.
However, there has not been quantitative research explicitly on MFH program coordinator effort and
experience in relation to cost or utilization. This project will address this gap. This project includes, in addition
to standard evaluation of expected outcomes, the evaluation of reliability of outcomes, which is expected to
improve with dedicated coordinator effort and experience guided by goals established by a patient safety
culture. The project is therefore also methodologically innovative, as it will evaluate the scale function
(representing the mean-independent variation of outcomes) in addition to the regression function. The project
has 3 aims: (1) To evaluate the VA cost and utilization of MFH Veterans and compare to (a) similar non-MFH
community-dwelling Veterans and (b) similar Veterans in CNH. (2) To evaluate the effect of coordinator effort
and experience on the VA costs and utilization for MFH Veterans and compare to similar non-MFH community-
dwelling Veterans and similar Veterans in CNH. (3) To evaluate whether the effect of coordinator effort and
experience on the VA costs and utilization for MFH Veterans is moderated by patient safety culture.
 Each aim will be analyzed using fiscal years 2021 through 2023 data from the CDW, SAIL, and GECDAC
core files data sets. Data will also incorporate the monthly MFH coordinator survey, and the Patient Safety
Culture Survey. Data will include all MFH Veterans and similar non-MFH Veterans who use VA healthcare
resources. Parametric and non-parametric methods will be used for evaluation of regression and scale
functions. The primary outcome will be total VA direct costs. Secondary outcomes will include Emergency
Department visit rates and hospitalization rates."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs) are the leading causes of dementia and afflict millions
of people every year, and projected cases are expected to rise exponentially due to the aging population.
Clarification of disease mechanisms and target identification are critical unmet needs in the field. While the
canonical amyloid-beta (Aß) and tau pathologies are implicated in AD cases, recent evidence revealed that non-
canonical pathologies, including TDP-43 pathology, occur in the majority of cases. TDP-43 pathology is observed
in up to 40% of all AD cases and about 50% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Importantly, AD cases
with TDP-43 pathology, compared to those without, exhibit steeper cognitive decline and more extensive brain
atrophy. The underlying molecular mechanism of TDP-43 that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive
impairments, however, remains elusive. Previous work in our lab, as well as other human studies, showed that
loss of TDP-43 nuclear function, as opposed to its cytoplasmic aggregation, as a splicing repressor of cryptic
exons underlies its pathology. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which loss of TDP-43 contributes to
neuron loss, it is necessary to develop models of mixed etiology dementias (MEDs), which exhibit Aß and tau
pathologies in combination with TDP-43 pathology, to mimic the human pathological context. Our lab previously
showed that, in the presence of Aß plaque, expression of a human tau four-repeat fragment (Tau4R) can seed
pathological conversion of endogenous tau, but additional risk factors are required to drive tauopathy. Due to
the requirement of additional factors to promote tauopathy and our finding that loss of TDP-43 leads to worsened
neurodegeneration, we hypothesize that loss of TDP-43 exacerbates tauopathy-driven neuron loss. Aim 1 will
focus on characterizing an FTD and corticobasal degeneration (CBD)-like mouse model involving
intraparenchymal injection of AAV.PhP.eB encoding Tau4R or Tau4R with an aggregation prone mutation in the
hippocampus of mice conditionally lacking TDP-43 in forebrain neurons. I will use this same AAV-mediated
approach in Aim 2 to characterize a model of AD with TDP-43 pathology, which involves Aß, tau, and TDP-43
pathologies. Both of these aims will involve evaluating the extent of tauopathy and neuron loss, examining
microglia signatures, and correlating my findings in human tissue. Successful completion of the proposed
research will help elucidate causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration and identify novel therapeutic targets for
AD/ADRDs. Additionally, this project has immense training potential as I will gain new expertise across multiple
techniques including biochemical tau protein extraction, Gallyus silver staining, single-cell RNA-Sequencing,
bioinformatics and analysis of post-mortem human tissue. This research will be performed in a highly
collaborative environment, where I will have numerous opportunities to receive quality mentorship and training,
to develop my written and presentation skills, and to grow as a mentor to junior scientists."
10823624,"The current assays for assessing HER2 were “fit-for-purpose” (over 25 years ago) to identify HER2
overexpression/gene amplification and are not built to subclassify unamplified HER2 expression in cancer.
Applying these legacy assays results in high inter-rater disagreement rates for HER2-negative vs. HER2-low
cases (up to 75% discordance for 0 vs. 1+/2+). With the emergence of new therapy options for HER2-low cancer
– namely trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) – a reliable companion diagnostic is needed for patients. The
incorrect application of these HER2 legacy assays has led to controversial findings in the field, including the
paradoxical 30% objective response rate seen in IHC=0 breast cancer in the DAISY trial. This proposal aims to
accurately stratify patients with HER2-low/negative breast cancer using our analytic, high-sensitivity HER2 (HS-
HER2) assay to develop algorithms for the selection of the most appropriate therapy for breast cancer patients.
Specifically, the proposal has two aims:
 Aim 1 will offer insight on clinically measurable pathologic & spatial parameters that influence the “bystander
effect” associated with these newer, linker cleavable antibody drug conjugates like T-DXd. Specifically, this aim
focuses on quantifying the spatial heterogeneity and HER2 expression patterns alongside HER2 tumor
concentration to ultimately predict T-DXd response. I hypothesize that subclassifying HER2 expression in breast
cancer with quantitative spatial heterogeneity metrics for “cluster”-type and single-cell “mosaic”-type patterns will
further explain why only ~30% of IHC=0 benefit from T-DXd in the DAISY trial (although ~70% of IHC=0 cases
have detectable attomole/mm2 HER2 concentrations by our HS-HER2 assay). I propose to investigate large
retrospective and prospective breast cancer cohorts with our HS-HER2 assay, as well as cohorts of HER2-low
breast cancer from ongoing T-DXd clinical trials.
 Aim 2 seeks to explore if an H&E-based ""virtual HER2 stain"" can predict low HER2 expression status. Our
lab and others have illustrated that HER2 gene amplification is associated with detectable morphological
changes from the H&E image alone. I hypothesize that HER2-low breast cancer will also have distinct
morphologic associations that can be discovered. The study proposes to build a dataset of HS-HER2 and H&E
aligned, adjacent serial section whole slide images. Then, train state-of-the-art computer vision architectures on
H&E images with a multi-task, multi-image pre-training and mixed-supervision multiple instance learning strategy
to predict low HER2 expression status (defined by the HS-HER2 assay in attomole/mm2). This aim will reveal
H&E morphologic features of breast cancer associated with low HER2 expression and T-DXd response.
 Overall, this proposal addresses the critical unmet clinical need for accurately assessing HER2 expression
in breast cancer patients and proposes two innovative aims to develop algorithms for T-DXd patient selection."

ADAM17 loss of function (LOF) is the cause of a pediatric enteropathy termed Neonatal Inflammatory Skin and
Bowel Disease 1 (NISBD1), which is associated with intestinal inflammation and diarrhea. While little is known
about NISBD1, two patient biopsies revealed abnormal intestinal crypt/villus morphology. The crypt/villus
structure is the fundamental repeating intestinal unit lined by an epithelium that contains crypt restricted intestinal
stem cells (ISCs). ISCs give rise to differentiated cells and are integral to maintaining epithelial function. ISCs
are supported by specialized epithelial cells and underlying mesenchymal cells that provide ISC niche signals,
including EGF-like ligands. ADAM17 is a ubiquitously expressed protease that cleaves and sheds proteins from
the cell membrane. Its substrates include EGF-like ligands, suggesting a role for ADAM17 in the ISC niche.
Recent work has revealed that ErbB3 ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) promotes human ISC maturation and
differentiation. Human fetal intestinal tissue sections reveal mesenchyme restricted expression of NRG1 and
epithelium restricted expression of its receptor ErbB3. This suggests a pattern of ADAM17 mediated
mesenchyme to epithelium signaling crosstalk. I will test the hypothesis that ADAM17 mediates cellular
crosstalk, regulating human intestinal epithelial development. First, I am establishing a matched isogenic
set of NISBD1 patient iPSC lines with one CRISPR corrected to be ADAM17 proficient. I will differentiate both
lines into human intestinal organoids containing organized epithelium and mesenchyme. Then, I will interrogate
the ADAM17 LOF phenotype using cellular, transcriptomic, and functional analyses. Next, I will investigate
ADAM17 mediated cellular crosstalk in a targeted approach by studying NRG1-ErbB3 signaling. To identify
additional candidate ADAM17 substrates, I will take an unbiased mass spectrometry and proteomics approach
to determine all human intestinal ADAM17 substrates, i.e. the sheddome. This analysis will establish datasets
for future targeted investigation of ADAM17 substrates in the human ISC niche. In summary, I will perform an
innovative patient specific disease modeling study using iPSC-derived organoids to characterize NISBD1 and
study the role of ADAM17 in the developing human intestine."

The pathological changes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) develop long before the onset of symptoms, with the
gradual accumulation of amyloid and tau in the brain followed by neuronal loss. While macroscopic brain changes
such as hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning are well-established as markers of symptomatic AD, the
predictive value of such structural imaging measures is limited prior to the onset of dementia. High-gradient
diffusion MRI has emerged as a sensitive tool for probing microstructural alterations throughout the whole brain
and holds great promise for capturing the earliest microscopic gray matter abnormalities present in AD, before
their overt manifestation on conventional MRI. With the recent introduction of commercially available high-
performance gradient systems for clinical research, further elucidation of these imaging findings across the AD
spectrum and systematic comparison against histopathology is timely and critical for gaining a better
understanding of neuronal degeneration and the pathogenic factors influencing disease progression. The goal
of this project is to leverage the sensitivity of high-gradient diffusion MRI to map alterations in gray matter
microstructure in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD and individuals at risk of developing AD. This
work will build on the hardware and acquisition advances that our group has worked on for over a decade as
part of the Human Connectome Project and BRAIN Initiative to push the limits of diffusion MRI for mapping brain
tissue microstructure in the living human brain. We propose to acquire advanced diffusion MRI measures on the
next-generation Connectome scanner to map cortical and white matter microstructure in MCI/AD patients from
the Massachusetts General Hospital Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) and individuals from the
Human Connectome Project-Lifespan/Aging (HCP-Aging) cohort. Aim 1 will assess the relationship between
cortical microstructural metrics obtained from high-gradient diffusion MRI and amyloid and tau PET uptake in
MCI/AD and cognitively healthy older adults. Aim 2 will validate diffusion MRI measures of cellular morphology
against histopathology performed in vulnerable regions of postmortem brain specimens obtained from patients
with pathology-proven AD. At the end of this project, we anticipate the development of a validated, multi-scale
advanced diffusion MRI protocol targeted for evaluating alterations in cortical microstructure in older adults of
differing AD pathology status, with clear measures that can be translated to large-scale AD studies. Such
information will inform the interpretation of diffusion imaging metrics acquired using commercially available MRI
scanner hardware and provide key information regarding the underlying disease evolution to aid in the
development of future neuroprotective therapies for AD."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) maintain both a self-renewal capacity to persist throughout life and an ability to
differentiate to downstream progenitors to generate blood cell lineages. Stem cells balance these fates through
symmetric and asymmetric divisions, respectively. HSC self-renewal and symmetric division are necessary for
rapid expansion of HSCs in fetal development as well as repopulation of bone marrow following stem cell
transplantation. Recently, the transcriptional regulator Bclaf1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) was shown
to support both fetal and adult HSC function. Bclaf1 is ubiquitously expressed in hematopoietic cells but its
function in normal hematopoiesis has not been elucidated. We recently characterized BCLAF1 as a modulator
of ETS-family transcription factor activity in developing B cells. Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs, which also
rely on ETS-family transcription factors for development and function, consistent with a potential role for BCLAF1
in HSC activities. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used murine
models with germline loss of function and with selective deletion of BCLAF1 in hematopoietic cells. We find that
Vav-cre:Bclaf1fl/fl mice have significantly reduced numbers of HSCs at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) that persists
into adulthood, but does not exaggerate over time. To further characterize the function of BCLAF1 in HSCs in
adult mice, we treated 8-week old Mx-cre:Bclaf1fl/fl mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIpC) to delete Bclaf1
in established adult HSCs. Loss of BCLAF1 did not alter HSC numbers in the adult bone marrow as compared
to pIpC-treated Bclaf1fl/fl control mice. These findings demonstrate that BCLAF1 supports HSC development
beginning in fetal populations but is not required for homeostasis of adult bone marrow HSCs. We performed
competitive reconstitution assays with limited numbers of HSCs to investigate if BCLAF1 is required for HSC
repopulation function. HSCs were sorted from fetal livers of BCLAF1-sufficient or -deficient mice and
transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally-irradiated recipient mice. Mice
transplanted with Vav-cre:Bclaf1fl/fl HSCs had significantly reduced hematopoietic repopulation with lower
percentage of donor-derived leukocytes and reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant
than mice with Bclaf1fl/fl donor HSCs. This phenotype is consistent between fetal and adult donor HSCs from
Vav-Cre:Bclaf1fl/fl mice. Additionally, single cell CITEseq reveals that BCLAF1-deficient HSCs have significantly
upregulated AP-1 factors JUN and FOS. Collectively, our findings reveal that BCLAF1 is a novel regulator of
fetal HSC development and HSC repopulation activity. On-going studies are investigating the mechanism of
BCLAF1 function in HSCs and the activity of BCLAF1 as a transcription factor to regulate AP-1."
10823919,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal aims to characterize how breast milk IgA shapes the ecological development of the preterm
gut microbiome and promotes resistance to pathobionts. Aberrant gut bacterial colonization places the preterm
infant at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a deadly inflammatory intestinal disease that uniquely
affects preterm infants and lacks curative treatments. Our laboratory has found that protection against NEC is
associated with preterm gut microbiota that are bound by maternal milk-derived IgA (mIgA). Enterobacteriaceae
that do not bind to mIgA predominate the gut microbiome of preterm infants who develop NEC. In contrast,
infants who do not develop NEC establish a mature or ‘term-like’ microbiome comprising obligate anaerobes.
We reasoned reduced mIgA binding to Enterobacteriaceae prior to NEC development is due to either: 1) variation
in the mIgA repertoire over time in breast milk, or 2) genetic changes that enable specific bacterial strains to
evade mIgA recognition. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that anti-bacterial mIgA reactivity remains stable
over time within an individual mother. Thus, our central hypothesis is that Enterobacteriaceae escape from
mIgA binding delays the maturation of the preterm infant gut microbiome.
 Understanding how the preterm gut microbial ecosystem resists Enterobacteriaceae colonization first
requires defining how the microbiome forms, matures, and functions. To address this gap in knowledge, we will
utilize novel technology developed by our laboratory that combines RNA hybridization chain reaction, flow
cytometry, and direct quantitative analyses to determine whether mIgA binds to Enterobacteriaceae to restrict
their colonization (Aim 1.1) and how mIgA promotes the establishment of obligate anaerobes (Aim 1.2) in
longitudinally collected preterm infant stool from a prospective cohort study. In doing so, we may be able to
identify signature patterns of microbiota development that differentiates patients by NEC status. To delineate the
genetic mechanisms underlying how Enterobacteriaceae lose mIgA binding and potentially induce NEC, we will
perform single cell microbial sequencing that incorporates anti-IgA barcoding, allowing us to link changes in
genetic features with or without IgA binding to distinct strains (Aim 2). This novel approach will enable us to study
ex vivo bacterial evolution as a response to mIgA binding in preterm infant stool, which has significant
translational value for preterm infants with microbiome-related disease. By defining genes involved in bacterial
evasion of antibody binding, this work may open new avenues for targeted therapy against NEC.
 This project provides a unique opportunity for me to: 1) gain computational expertise to analyze large
genomic and patient-centered datasets, and 2) form clinical and research collaborations tailored to my career
goal of becoming an OB/GYN physician scientist. The proposed research will enable me to create an early
research niche that will be fundamental for my long-term objectives in advancing maternal-fetal health."

 Peroxisomes are ubiquitous membrane bound organelles that play a major role in the regulation of lipid
metabolism. In the liver, peroxisomes contain enzymes involved in essential processes such as the
detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the oxidization of fatty acids, and synthesis of bile acids, the
body’s natural detergents and potent signaling molecules. The generation of peroxisomes is driven by the
peroxin (herein PEX) protein family. However, the role of PEX proteins in coordinating inter-organelle crosstalk
has not been explored. Together, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and peroxisomes maintain
lipid homeostasis and regulate lipid metabolism within hepatocytes. How organelles involved in lipid
metabolism, such as the mitochondria and the ER, respond to changes in peroxisomal function is not well
understood. Here, we describe the role of two PEX family proteins, PEX6 and PEX14, in hepatic lipid
metabolism. Using a panel of over 100 inbred strains of genetically diverse mice, we found that PEX6 and
PEX14 protein levels positively correlated with lipid levels in the liver. We therefore hypothesized that PEX6
and PEX14 may have specific roles in regulating lipid and bile acid metabolism through the import of critical
components into peroxisomes. To test this, we generated AAV-CRISPR to disrupt Pex6 and Pex14 in the liver
of adult mice. Mice injected with Pex6- or Pex14-CRISPR did not put on/gain body weight when fed a standard
rodent chow diet, however there was no difference in their lean mass, plasma ALT/AST, or liver histology,
compared to control mice, suggesting they were not sick. In addition, we observed a significant increase of
hepatic bile acids in both Pex14-CRISPR and Pex6-CRISPR animals indicating dysregulation of BA synthesis
within peroxisomes. Further, lack of either PEX6 or PEX14 resulted in specific increases in ROS metabolism
and fatty acid oxidation. Together, these data suggest that loss of hepatic PEX14 or PEX6 augment
peroxisome activity. Here, we aim to investigate how these peroxisomal changes may impact the morphology
and function of other organelles involved in lipid metabolism, specifically the mitochondria and the ER.
Preliminary results suggest that in mice lacking PEX14 or PEX6, mitochondrial respiration is significantly
increased, and the ER is expanded. Further, we aim to investigate whether lipid accumulation, mimicking
metabolic disease states, impact these observations. The proposed studies will describe one example of how
the loss of two PEX proteins affects lipid homeostasis and inter-organelle crosstalk, thus advancing our
understanding of lipid metabolism in healthy and disease states."

Biological Novelty through Adaptive Protein Synthesis in the Octopus
 Dysregulation of proteostasis coincides with the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins,
leading to neurodegeneration and pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and
Spinocerebellar ataxia. As the machinery responsible for synthesis of correctly decoded, functional proteins,
ribosomes play a major role in determining proteostasis. Biochemical or genetic disruptions to ribosome accuracy
are known to disrupt cellular proteostasis, causing neuronal death and severe cognitive or aging related defects.
However, there has been minimal exploration of how to increase translation accuracy, and how this impacts
proteostasis. Octopus bimaculoides presents an ideal model to study adaptation of the ribosome to improve
proteostasis in a multicellular organism. Octopuses rely heavily on proteostasis, as they develop rapidly and
possess extremely complex nervous systems consisting of approximately 500 million neurons, the most of any
invertebrate animal. I recently made the serendipitous discovery that the large 28S rRNA of the octopus contains
a unique rRNA break in the highly conserved catalytic center of the ribosome. This rRNA break is conserved
among octopuses but not other cephalopods or mollusks. Importantly, my preliminary findings reveal that the
octopus rRNA break increases accuracy of protein synthesis. By obtaining a cryo-EM structure of the O.
bimaculoides ribosome, I find the octopus-specific break is found in the E-site near the site of deacylated tRNA
binding. I propose to determine how this modification affects the ribosome and manifests in larger phenotypes
through a combination of biochemical, structural, and cellular approaches. I will compare the direct functional
consequences of this modification to the ribosomal active site by utilizing ribosome-dependent in vitro
reconstitution assays. This will be complemented by performing cryo-EM on the octopus ribosome in different
states of protein synthesis to determine how these functional changes manifest on a molecular level on the
ribosome. Lastly, I will investigate differences in protein aggregation and resistance to neurotoxicity mediated by
this novel ribosomal modification. This will be investigated in vitro using my reconstitution system, and in vivo
through a comparative biology approach with animal neuron primary culture. I will also utilize a yeast genetics
model to demonstrate targeting of the ribosomal RNA to mimic the break with the goal of improving translation
accuracy and proteostasis. The proposed experiments will elucidate a novel mechanism underlying the ribosome
regulation of protein synthesis which can lead to greater cellular functions and resistances."

Research targeting substance use and its comorbidities in Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI)
communities often focuses on youth participants or aggregates small samples of NHPIs with the data of Asian
Americans. This has created a significant gap in the field’s understanding of substance use and suicidal
ideation in this underserved population. Further, NHPI advocacy groups cite both substance use and historical
trauma as primary targets for research. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to (1) conduct qualitative
focus groups to understand the relationships between substance use, suicidal ideation, and historical trauma in
NHPI adults and (2) conduct a subsequent quantitative analysis to develop a model of these associations. This
project is significant because we will be building the first model of substance use and suicidal ideation in
NHPI adults, a community that has been largely underserved by academic research. This project is innovative
because it will utilize a mixed-methods research design with community based participatory research
principles, including the formation of a NHPI community advisory board, to inform this model. The proposed
study will be completed over the course of two years and two studies; the first is qualitative, the second
quantitative. Study 1 will conduct 3–5 focus groups with 4–8 NHPI adults per group (n = 20–30) who will
explore the impact of historical trauma on substance use and suicidal ideation using semi-structured interviews
that will mirror traditional NHPI talking circles. Study 2 will translate the themes revealed in the qualitative
analysis from Study 1 to inform measure selection in a quantitative analysis, with the goal of testing a model of
the relationships between historical trauma, substance use, and suicidal ideation in NHPI adults (n = 120–168).
Findings will be among the first to conceptualize these relationships in NHPI adults, where research is
desperately needed. This project is aligned with NIDA’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan as it explores the social and
contextual factors that manifest and maintain substance use behavior by exploring comorbidities and improving
the implementation of evidence-based practice for clinicians who seek to reduce substance use in NHPI
communities through the development of the model. Further, this project will provide the Principal Investigator
with the grantsmanship, networking, and methodological tools to establish a career serving the needs of NHPI
communities. The research environment at University of Rhode Island including office space, technology, and
grant support, along with excellent sponsors and consultants with expertise in relevant content areas and
mixed methodology research, provide the ideal setting and mentorship to successfully conduct the proposed
project. This project will create vital research training opportunities for the applicant’s future career as an
independent researcher working within NHPI communities to alleviate health disparities, a role which is
necessary for improved health among this population."

 Many Parkinson’s patients develop cognitive impairment during an early, motor-asymptomatic pro-
dromal period, before clinical diagnosis and motor symptoms. Cognitive impairment causes a significant
disruption in quality-of-life for patients and caregivers. The onset of early cognitive impairment greatly
increases risk for conversion to dementia, but such progression differs from that of other neurodegenerative
diseases (like Alzheimer’s) and differs between males and females for reasons that are not clear. Cognitive
abnormalities include impaired attention, slower information processing speed, and others, yet the underlying
neurobiology of such early cognitive symptoms is not known, thwarting targeted therapeutic strategies which
are necessary to halt or slow cognitive decline and dementia. Cognitive impairment is present in both idiopathic
and hereditary forms of Parkinson’s, including that resulting from several mutations in LRRK2 that increase
kinase activity. The focus of this project is on characterizing the underlying neurobiology of early cognitive
deficits in a mouse model carrying a knockin G2019S gene mutation in LRRK2 that in humans increases risk of
Parkinson’s-associated cognitive decline and dementia. The premise is built on our observations that young
adult, male Lrrk2G2019S mice display significant deficits in attention (tested in a 5-CSRT task), slower information
processing speed, and in fronto-striatal dependent instrumental learning. Such deficits could not be attributed
to sensory perceptual deficits, differences in motivation or motor effects. Further, these deficits were
normalized by systemic injection of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, implicating deficient
cholinergic signaling. Anatomical analysis showed that the cholinergic innervation of mPFC was significantly
sparser in male G2019S mice than in male wildtype controls. In contrast, young adult female G2019S mice
showed normal instrumental learning, and an enhanced density of cholinergic innervation in mPFC compared
to female wildtype controls, suggesting a compensatory response and demonstrating early sexually-dimorphic
behavioral and anatomical outcomes driven by the mutation. We propose to examine cholinergic innervation of
mPFC in male and female G2019S mutants across the lifespan and in the context of cognitive behavioral
performance; we will interrogate projection-identified mPFC neurons by whole-cell electrophysiology to
characterize cholinergic nicotinic and muscarinic receptor responses; and we will probe behaviorally-evoked
ACh transients in mPFC using a genetically-encoded fluorescent ACh biosensor and will use this information to
modulate cognitive function by optogenetically controling ACh signaling in mPFC during an attention task.
Successful completion of these experiments will provide new insight into the earliest Parkinson’s-associated
pathophysiology of mPFC cholinergic circuits and cognition, with the long-term goal to improve diagnostics,
predict sex-specific clinical trajectories, and identify pathways for early precision therapeutic intervention."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that imposes a tremendous socioeconomic cost
in the United States. Although the diagnostic criteria for AUD have been established, the underlying molecular
pathogenesis is largely unknown. Prior AUD studies have demonstrated a critical role for dysregulation of
glucocorticoid signaling throughout multiple brain-regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
Specific alterations in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity are important for the progression of alcohol
dependence, a critical facet of AUD that contributes to escalation of alcohol consumption, withdrawal, and
anxiety-like phenotypes. The overwhelming majority of GR studies for understanding AUD have focused on
protein-coding genes despite less than 2% of the genome being protein-coding. Non-coding RNAs play vital
roles in basic cellular functions in physiology and disease. This proposal will test a novel hypothesis that the long
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest specific 5 (Gas5) is a sex-dependent and [neuron]-specific modulator
of alcohol responsive GR-dependent gene expression and behavior. Gas5 is a known repressor of GR activity
and has previously been linked to AUD phenotypes in mice and humans. Our previous studies have shown that
changes in the expression of Gas5, particularly in mPFC neurons, are related to chronic alcohol-induced
withdrawal and escalated ethanol consumption in male mice. However, the biological mechanism(s) for these
Gas5-associated changes in male animals are unknown. Additionally, no concurrent studies have been
conducted in female animals to determine potential sex-dependent effects of Gas5 for chronic alcohol-induced
behaviors. This project will directly study the role of mPFC neuronal Gas5 in the alcohol dependent transcriptome
and behavioral phenotypes related to GR in both sexes. To accomplish this, the chronic intermittent ethanol
vapor exposure (CIEV) model will be used in tandem with stereotaxic injections of an adeno-associated virus
(AAV) to induce CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown (KD) of Gas5 in mPFC neurons. The three aims of this
study will determine the molecular and behavioral outcomes of mPFC neuron-specific Gas5 KD and CIEV. The
first aim of this study uses RNA immunoprecipitation followed by real time, quantitative PCR (RIP-qPCR) to
define changes in mPFC Gas5-GR binding. The second aim uses [next-generation RNA Sequencing (3’Tag-
Seq) to determine neuron-specific] alterations in the GR-dependent transcriptome. The third aim employs a
comprehensive battery to assay chronic ethanol exposure-related behavioral phenotypes. This project is a vital
step in the functional characterization of Gas5 in AUD and how GR-dependent phenotypes emerge. The
proposed studies may aid in rational development of more effective GR-mediated pharmacotherapies for AUD
and co-morbid disorders (e.g., chronic stress and anxiety)."

Glaucoma is a vision-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and current
treatment options are limited in their efficacy. While reducing intraocular pressure is the most
commonly used approach, it does not address neurodegeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) that ultimately lead to blindness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
that utilizes reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) nanoparticles, which have been shown to
target specific cell types mediated by their binding to the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1) to
deliver lipophilic drugs to RGCs. Our laboratory has extensive experience with developing strategies
for neuroprotection in glaucoma, particularly, targeting the endothelin system in the retina. Our
published work demonstrates that the FDA-approved drug macitentan, a pan-endothelin receptor
antagonist elicits neuroprotective effects on RGCs by inhibiting pro-apoptotic JNK signaling when
dosed orally in rat Morrison's model of ocular hypertension. Our approach involves the encapsulation
of macitentan in rHDL nanoparticles for delivery to RGCs via their interaction with the SR-B1
receptors. To further increase specificity of delivery to RGCs, our rHDL nanoparticles will be linked to
a cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) through conjugation with a fatty acid residue, generating a custom-
made molecule that will bind to enriched gangliosides present on RGCs. Our three specific aims are
to: (1) create and optimize the rHDL-ApoAI-CTB (rHAC) nanoparticles loaded with macitentan, (2)
optimize the delivery and release of macitentan from the nanoparticles, and (3) investigate the
neuroprotective mechanisms of macitentan when delivered intracellularly into RGCs. By targeting
both the SR-B1 receptor and gangliosides, we can ensure that the neuroprotective drug will deliver
specifically to RGCs. rHDL-CTB nanoparticles have the ability to cross biological barriers and
selectively target RGCs. In addition, we believe that use of macitentan as a neuroprotective agent
has the potential to slow the neurodegenerative processes in glaucoma. Our approach has the
potential to significantly improve the specificity and efficacy of glaucoma treatments and could
ultimately reduce vision loss resulting from this condition. Ultimately, our strategy has the potential to
significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs associated with glaucoma
treatments."
10826142,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Virtually all organisms experience osmotic imbalances from their environment, which can cause rapid changes
in cell volume. Hypertonic exposure causes cell shrinkage and is thought to induce protein misfolding and
aggregation in vivo. Despite these proteotoxic effects, the main paradigm for osmotic stress adaptation is still
focused on osmolyte production and cell volume recovery. Little is known about the mechanisms that maintain
proteome integrity during osmotic stress, and no studies have investigated the identity of proteins
compromised by hypertonicity. Therefore, the goal of this project is to characterize the protein quality
consequences (Aim 1) and responses (Aim 2) to hypertonic exposure. The research strategy leverages
targeted and systems-level technologies, including aggregation assays, genome-editing, and mass
spectrometry, to examine the molecular and systems-level aspects of proteostasis during osmotic stress. In
Aim 1, the applicant Kathy Le will test the hypothesis that subsets of the proteome, including nascent proteins
and peroxisomal proteins, are particularly susceptible to osmotically induced aggregation. Using targeted
biochemical approaches, Kathy will quantify aggregation of pulse-labeled nascent chains and the effects of
translation inhibition. She will also receive individualized training in mass spectrometry techniques to profile
aggregation propensity across the yeast proteome, including peroxisomal proteins. In Aim 2, Kathy will test the
hypothesis that chaperone-mediated refolding and proteasomal degradation contribute to osmotic stress
resistance by acting on different sets of misfolded substrates. Leveraging yeast genetics, Kathy will measure
the individual stress tolerance contributions of the chaperone system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
She will also use a combination of biochemical aggregate assays and proteomics to analyze the protein
substrate pools of each system and determine the extent of their overlap. The proposed project and training
plan is tailored to enable Kathy to gain new experimental skills and concepts in proteostasis, a diverse
research field led by multiple experts at Stanford. Dr. Brandman (sponsor) has extensive experience studying
the heat shock response and the adaptability of chaperones using cell biological tools and CRISPR libraries in
yeast. Dr. Kopito (co-sponsor) is a renowned expert in studying mammalian ER-associated degradation
(ERAD) and misfolded protein substrate selection, offering a complementary perspective. In summary, the
strong mentoring and training opportunities at Stanford will fully prepare Kathy for an independent research
career. The proposed Aims will challenge the current paradigm of osmotic stress adaptation by investigating
the protein quality aspects of hypertonicity. Understanding of the mechanisms that drive protein aggregate
formation, refolding, and degradation in a variety of physiological contexts is needed to elucidate general
principles for protein quality control and therapeutic strategies for protein-misfolding diseases."
10825897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health crisis. As the second leading cause of death due to infectious disease, it
claims roughly 1.5 million lives a year. Although TB can be treated, the curative regimen is complicated and
takes several months. Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), including totally drug-resistant strains,
is steadily increasing in prevalence. Therefore, novel therapeutics with the potential to decrease treatment
duration and increase barriers to resistance are essential for disease eradication. Most TB drug discovery
programs have taken target-based approaches and largely ignored intrabacterial metabolism. However, several
first- and second- line antituberculars penetrate Mtb as prodrugs and are intrabacterially metabolized into their
active form. When faced with the markedly lipid-rich, hydrophobic environment of the Mtb cell envelope, prodrugs
have the ability to enter the cell and subsequently release more polar, Mtb-active moieties within the bacterium.
Most Mtb prodrugs are activated by non-essential enzymes, and, as a consequence, resistance develops
quickly. For example, pyrazinamide (PZA), a key first-line antitubercular that enables a shortened TB drug
regimen, is activated to pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the non-essential amidase PncA, and the vast majority of PZA
resistance is caused by mutations in this activating gene. Notably, several other Mtb amidases have also been
shown to metabolize amide antituberculars, thereby activating prodrugs and inactivating active drug compounds.
We hypothesize that we can harness Mtb amidases to design and activate amide prodrugs within Mtb that are
active in drug-resistant disease and that have increased barriers to resistance. Our proposal aims to 1) study
the amide-amidase interactions to identify amide prodrugs that are activated by more than one amidase and 2)
link POA to amine metabolites from parent compounds that demonstrate amide hydrolysis within Mtb to generate
potential POA-releasing conjugates that are activated by non-PncA amidases. The majority of amidases are
non-essential and likely have overlapping functions, enabling the discovery of amide-containing antituberculars
that are activated by multiple amidases. Furthermore, the release of POA by amidases other than PncA would
retain PZA-like activity in PZA-resistant strains, restoring the activity of a first-line antitubercular critical for shorter
TB regimens. This approach will introduce a novel framework for TB prodrug discovery that can be applied to
other classes of small molecules and their activating enzymes. In all, the proposed project and training plan will
greatly further my development as a researcher and independent scientific thinker by introducing me to new
scientific concepts and techniques and providing ample opportunity for me the integrate my research and clinical
experiences. Together, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, the Public Health Research Institute, and the
Global TB Institute create a highly collaborative and highly translational environment that uniquely benefit my
training as an infectious disease physician-scientist."

 The early onset of tobacco use among Latinx adolescents in the United States is a growing public
health concern as it increases adolescents’ risk of developing a dependency on tobacco products and related
chronic health diseases in adulthood. The expected growth and prevalence of substance use in the
Mexican-origin population underscores the importance of improving our understanding of the familial and
cultural factors that may prevent the early onset of tobacco use among Latinx adolescents. Some
well-established cultural factors of relevance to substance use prevention and intervention efforts among the
Latinx community include adherence to Latinx cultural values such as familismo (the value of family loyalty)
and respeto (respect for authority figures). However, literature has largely ignored the role of Latinx
caregiver-adolescent dynamics (e.g., caregiver-youth cultural value differences, family conflict, and parental
monitoring) on aggravating adolescent tobacco use. Thus, the present study takes a culturally-sensitive
approach to understanding Latinx adolescent tobacco use and its influences via consideration of the
system-level influences of family, culture, and their interactions over time. This project’s overarching goal will
be achieved via three specific aims: (1) examine the association between cultural values and adolescent
tobacco use over time; (2) examine the association between parental monitoring, family conflict, and
adolescent tobacco use over time; and (3) examine the relation between caregiver-adolescent cultural value
discrepancies, family conflict, and adolescent tobacco use over time using a mixed methods approach. The
aims will be addressed by leveraging data collected as part of the California Families Project (CFP), an
ongoing longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin caregiver-adolescent dyads from the Sacramento and
Woodland, CA, school districts. CFP survey measures include questions regarding caregiver- and
adolescent-reported cultural values (i.e., familismo and respeto), parental monitoring practices, family conflict,
and tobacco use. The second phase of the proposed mixed methods study will involve four focus groups (two
caregiver and two youth groups) of six participants each (N = 24) from the Richmond and Greater Richmond,
VA, area and will explore perceived cultural value differences, other tobacco use influences, family
communication about tobacco use, and ATP use. Findings from this study will contribute to NIDA’s goal of
identifying and developing approaches to reduce health disparities by elucidating the ecological factors that
promote or impede prevention, treatment and recovery of substance use among Latinxs. Moreover, the
research and training outlined in this NRSA F31 predoctoral fellowship application will equip me with the skills
and mentoring needed to pursue a career as an independent researcher, including knowledge of substance
use research, advanced statistical methods, the responsible conduct of research, grant and manuscript writing
proficiencies, and translating research into culturally tailored community interventions."
10826684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Targeted cancer therapeutics have traditionally focused on inhibiting activated oncogenic signaling
pathways. While such pathway inhibitors have resulted in clinical successes with improved patient response
rates and progression free survival, in most cases, they have yet to yield curative responses due to eventual
drug resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that context-dependent lethality induced by pathway activation
represents a promising unexplored approach for cancer therapeutics with the potential to overcome resistance.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate cancers developing resistance to targeted therapy will gain
increased sensitivity to non-cross-resistant, pathway-hyperactivation.
 Specifically, this project will focus on melanoma, where oncogenic ERK MAPK pathway activation
motivated the development of MAPK pathway inhibitors. BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are
used in combination as the standard of care for targeted therapy in BRAFV600E melanoma patients. However,
current treatment options, including these targeted therapies and immunotherapies, rarely achieve complete
responses due to intrinsic and acquired resistance. Although resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition is
predominantly mediated by MAPK reactivation, the intratumoral heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms
complicate and curtail efforts to combat resistance. Increased susceptibility to MAPK hyperactivation occurs
through the same mechanisms that make cells resistant to BRAFi/MEKi, suggesting cycling treatment for MAPK
inhibition followed by MAPK activation would induce collateral sensitivity and avoid resistance development. This
proposal will employ high complexity cellular barcode tracing as well as BRAFi/MEKi resistant xenograft models
to investigate the efficacy of driving tumor clonal evolution toward BRAFi/MEKi resistance for maximal sensitivity
to lethal MAPK hyperactivation resulting in tumor eradication. Furthermore, dual-knockout CRISPR screening
strategies will be employed to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating MAPK hyperactivation lethality. The
proposed therapeutic approach is based on 1) preliminary work observing selective sensitivity of MAPKi resistant
melanoma to lethal MAPK hyperactivation and 2) non-cross resistance mechanisms for MAPK inhibition and
hyperactivation.
 By exploring the synergy between established targeted therapy strategies and previously unappreciated
pathway activation cancer dependencies, these studies aim to establish a new therapeutic paradigm for cancer
treatment. This approach is likely broadly applicable to other key oncogenic signaling pathways and cancer types
and addresses one of the fundamental limitations of targeted therapies."

The development of complex organisms requires diversification of cell types and tissues. Cells such as stem
cells and embryos must polarize in order to segregate cell fate determinants, and then divide asymmetrically to
generate functionally distinct cells. Failure to establish cell polarity is a hallmark of many cancers and
developmental defects. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand how cell polarity network is coupled
with the cell cycle, to get insights into how specific cell types are formed during development.
PAR proteins are specialized proteins that govern proper establishment of cell polarity in many organisms. For
example, mouse embryonic stem cells establish apical-basal polarity by localizing PAR proteins to the apical or
basal domains to allow the segregation of cell fate determinants. Another example is the Caenorhabditis elegans
zygote, which establishes antero-posterior polarity by forming mutually exclusive PAR cortical domains. However
how PAR proteins are regulated is not fully understood.
Recent studies have revealed that a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A, is required to initiate polarization in a C. elegans
zygote. These studies showed evidence that Aurora A exhibits dynamic localization and acts at different stages
of the cell cycle to control cortical recruitment of PAR proteins in a timely and precise manner. However, the
exact mechanisms by which Aurora A modulates PAR protein asymmetries remain obscure.
The overreaching objectives of this proposal are to dissect how different pools of Aurora A transmit signals that
promote timely and precise cell polarization, and to determine if the role of Aurora A during polarization is
conserved in other polarizing cells. The central hypothesis is that Aurora A works at different times and places
to modulate polarity proteins organizations, thereby coordinating polarity with the cell cycle. This hypothesis will
be tested using a unique biochemical approach for quantifying protein-protein interactions at a single cell, single
molecule level, in combination with high-resolution microscopy and targeted genome editing. Experiments in Aim
1 will identify Aurora A substrates in C. elegans and test how loss of Aurora A activity impacts PAR proteins
localization and complex assembly. Aim 2 will determine where and when Aurora A activity is required to
coordinate PAR proteins, using optogenetics to manipulate Aurora A spatial regulation and commercially
available Aurora A inhibitors to control the Aurora A activity. Aim 3 will assess whether Aurora A activity is
required during apical-basal polarity establishment of mouse embryonic stem cells. Collectively, these data will
reveal how Aurora A is positioned to orchestrate polarity proteins dynamics and complex assembly and provide
fundamental knowledge of how polarity is established and synchronized with the cell cycle."

Two existential threats to female fertility include the premature loss of the ovarian reserve and early
implantation/placentation failure. We recently discovered that Irx3 and Irx5, two of six members of the
Iroquois homeobox (Irx) transcription factor family, show remarkable conservation of molecular and
cellular actions associated with cognate cell-cell transitions critical for germline nest breakdown and
primordial follicle formation (ovarian reserve) during ovary development and embryo-endometrial
interactions leading to vasculogenesis during implantation and establishment of pregnancy. Previously,
we employed a series of Irx3/5 mutant mouse models, including an Sf1-Cre/Flox strategy to highlight
autonomous roles for Irx3 vs Irx5, especially in somatic cells. The fertility profiles for these mice also
indicated that developmental expression of Irx3 contributes to the adult follicle’s response to external
growth and ovulation signals and suggested that Irx3 has a critical role in oocyte integrity. AIM 1 is
designed to discover the roles for Irx3 in the oocyte and uncover downstream targets and regulation
profiles over time in ovary development. Ovarian histology and follicle counts identified oocyte deficits,
but reproductive data suggested that other factors were also contributing to the subfertility phenotype in
Irx3 knockout mice (Irx3 KO). Indeed, ablation of Irx3 in female mice resulted in a subfertile phenotype
with fewer pups born in each litter. Our studies indicated a marked induction of Irx3 at the onset of
decidualization and we observed a progressive loss of embryos starting at the decidual phase and
extending through the end of pregnancy indicating a disrupted uterine response to the embryo that
caused deficits in placentation. AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that Irx3 integrates stromal-endothelium
and stromal-trophoblast interactions to ensure successful establishment of pregnancy. Finally, we
observed punctate staining for IRX3 within cytoplasm of oocytes and uterine decidual cells. Based on our
observations that IRX3 plays an important role in mediating cell-cell interactions, AIM 3 is designed to
examine cytoplasmic signaling and localization of cytoskeletal machinery with respect to IRX3 presence.
Altogether, our studies are designed to discover how Iroquois homeobox proteins mediate germline nest
breakdown and primordial follicle formation to establish responsive follicles with healthy oocytes and
decidualization that promotes a successful implantation and placentation program. Successful outcomes
will increase our understanding of the biology that results in a healthy ovarian reserve and optimal
uterine conditions for early embryo survival."

Chromatin is a key determinant of cell phenotype and function. Therefore, chromatin stability over the lifespan
is presumably a pre-requisite for maintenance of cell and tissue phenotype and function, and hence healthy
aging and longevity. However, chromatin is not a static fixed structure, but is a dynamic and plastic “breathing”
assembly. As a dynamic and plastic entity, chromatin is prone to change or drift, a process likely exacerbated
by intrinsic cellular processes and extrinsic/environmental influences. Therefore, this dynamic chromatin likely
represents a challenge for a cell to achieve phenotypic stability, healthy aging and longevity, especially for long-
lived cells. In other words, given their dynamic chromatin, how do healthy human neurons and cardiomyocytes
remain as such for decades? To explain this, we have proposed that cells possess mechanisms of chromatin
homeostasis, or chromostasis, that preserve chromatin integrity, suppress phenotypic instability or “plasticity”,
and so slow the pace of aging and promote healthy aging. We will test this hypothesis as follows:
Specific Aim 1. Test whether altered nucleosome stability affects features of chromostasis and cell phenotypic
plasticity.
Specific Aim 2. Identify candidate chromostasis genes and small molecule modulators and test their impact on
cell phenotypic plasticity.
Specific Aim 3. Test whether enhanced chromostasis promotes healthy aging and longevity.
This proposal is broadly significant because it will reveal basic mechanisms of physiological chromatin/epigenetic
control and how this impinges on healthy aging and longevity, pathological states such as cell transformation,
and therapeutic applications such as cell reprogramming. Accordingly, this proposal can have a major impact on
scientific understanding and human health by revealing: 1) mechanisms that underlie stable cell phenotype; 2)
biomarkers of age-associated degeneration and predisposition to disease; 3) targets for interventions to promote
healthy aging, prevent degenerative disease and cancer, and facilitate therapeutic cell reprogramming."
10865109,"ABSTRACT
The major growth factor signaling pathways in normal cells (e.g., PI3K and RAS) are also the ones that are
most frequently genetically activated in cancer cells, leading to cell autonomous growth and proliferation.
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a shared downstream effector of these pathways and a central driver of cell
growth and is aberrantly activated in the majority of human cancers. This activation occurs through a network
of upstream oncogenes and tumor suppressors that converge on a small G protein switch directly upstream of
mTORC1. This switch involves the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors, which form a protein
complex (the TSC complex) that regulates a member of the Ras family of GTPases, called Rheb, an essential
direct activator of mTORC1. Our previous studies have found that the TSC complex and Rheb serve as the
key molecular link between the PI3K pathway and mTORC1 signaling and that this regulation promotes
changes in key metabolic pathways underlying cell growth in both normal and cancer cells. Supported by the
last 6 years of funding from this R35, we have greatly advanced and expanded this area of research, opening
up several previously unforeseen new avenues of investigation through both published and ongoing work.
Taking advantage of the long-term, stable funding afforded by this mechanism, we have also developed
innovative new genetic mouse models and methodologies that set us up for new breakthrough discoveries
over the next cycle of this grant, especially related to PI3K-mTOR signaling within the poorly understood
nutrient and metabolic niche of the tumor microenvironment, which is a major focus of this renewal. Four
major areas of research will include defining A) the biochemical and pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying the regulation and function of the TSC complex, B) the capacity of mTORC1 to properly integrate
oncogenic and nutrient signals within the tumor microenvironment, C) the metabolic consequences of PI3K-
mTOR activation and inhibition in tumors of different origins, stages, and niches, and D) targetable metabolic
vulnerabilities accompanying its aberrant regulation in tumors. While key mechanistic questions regarding this
ubiquitous signaling network will continue to be answered through rigorous biochemical and cell biological
studies, much of our efforts will combine novel genetic models with state-of-the-art analytical tools to define
the salient in vivo features of the PI3K-mTOR network as they apply to tumor metabolism, growth, and
progression. The overarching goals of our research are to define the precise roles of this signaling network in
cancer and how best to therapeutically target the high percentage of tumors with uncontrolled mTORC1
signaling, beyond the single-agent use of mTOR inhibitors. I am confident that, if given the resources, we will
continue to gain a deeper understanding of cancer cell biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic
vulnerabilities, while also making leaps into new, currently unpredictable domains of cancer research."
10865135,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease and is typically caused
by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins that regulate cardiac contractility. HCM manifestations include
left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, arrythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The mechanotransduction
mechanism by which dysregulated sarcomeric force production is sensed and leads to pathological remodeling
remains poorly understood in HCM, thereby inhibiting the efficient development of new therapeutics. Our discovery
was based on insights from a severe phenotype of an individual with HCM and a second genetic alteration in a
sarcomeric mechano-sensing protein. We effectively derived cardiomyocytes from patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs) and developed robust engineered heart tissues (EHTs) by seeding iPSC-CMs into
a laser-cut scaffold possessing native cardiac fiber alignment, for studying human cardiac mechanobiology at both
cellular and tissue levels. Coupled with computational modeling for muscle contraction and rescue of disease
phenotype via gene editing and pharmacological interventions, we have identified a new mechanotransduction
pathway in HCM. Enhanced actomyosin crossbridge formation caused by sarcomeric mutations in cardiac myosin
heavy chain (MYH7) led to increased force generation, which when coupled with slower twitch relaxation,
destabilized the muscle LIM protein (MLP) stretch-sensing complex at the Z-disc. Subsequent reduction in the
sarcomeric MLP level caused disinhibition of calcineurin–nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling,
which promoted cardiac hypertrophy. By mitigating enhanced actomyosin crossbridge formation through either
genetic or pharmacological means, we alleviated stress at the Z-disc, preventing the development of hypertrophy
associated with sarcomeric mutations. This proposal will dissect the roles of systolic and diastolic Z-disc stress
in modulating the MLP mechanosensory complex and elucidate the molecular mechanisms that mediate the
repression of calcineurin/NFAT by MLP as well as MLP protein degradation by stretch-sensing. We have recently
developed a new bioreactor that can expose EHTs to precisely prescribed afterloads, so we can test the
hypothesis that higher systolic forces produced by crossbridges under higher afterloads destabilize MLP at the
Z-disc and activate hypertrophic signaling during systole. Additionally, EHTs will be subjected to culture under
conditions of either constant length or diastolic stretch to mimic ventricular filling. After repeated stretching, EHTs
will be examined for hypertrophic signaling. We will unravel mechanistic insights into how saromeric MLP is
degraded in response to Z-disc stress. In addition, we will dissect molecular mechanisms by which MLP inhibits
calcineurin/NFAT hypertrophic responses in systole and diastole. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of a
common sarcomeric contraction/MLP/calcineurin mechanotransduction pathway will help to design novel
strategies for a wide spectrum of heart failure patients potentially through stabilizing the Z-disk MLP mechanosensory
complex."
10865136,"SUMMARY
 MDA5 is a conserved innate immune receptor that detects viral RNAs during infection and activates
antiviral immune response. Recent studies have shown that MDA5 can be activated not only during infection,
but also under various physiological conditions in the absence of infection. Such “sterile” inflammation can
cause pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, but at the same time, can be therapeutically beneficial, for
example during cancer immunotherapies. Over the last few years, my lab has defined the molecular framework
for understanding how MDA5 recognizes viral dsRNA and activates downstream signaling. We discovered that
MDA5 assembles into filaments upon binding to dsRNA and that the filament formation is required for efficient
dsRNA binding and downstream signal activation. Despite the progress, however, there are key gaps in our
understanding of how MDA5 is activated and how its activity is regulated. That is, what is the exact identity of
dsRNA that stimulates MDA5 both in the virus-infected and sterile inflammatory conditions, and what are the
molecular events following MDA5 filament formation leading up to antiviral signal activation. The goal of this
proposal is to address these two poorly understood aspects of MDA5 function by focusing on TRIM65, a
ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligase essential for MDA5 signaling.
 Previous studies from us and others showed that K63-linked polyUb chains (K63-Ubn) plays an important
role in MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling. TRIM65 has been speculated to be the E3 ligase responsible for the
K63-Ubn conjugation of MDA5. However, whether this is in fact the case, and if so, exactly how and when
TRIM65 acts on MDA5 have been unclear. In our preliminary analysis, we found that TRIM65 directly binds
MDA5, and this binding is strictly dependent on MDA5 filament formation. This observation suggests that
TRIM65 plays a central role as a check-point for ligand discrimination and signal activation. Furthermore, we
found that TRIM65 pull-down can be used for specific isolation of MDA5 filament assembled on agonist
dsRNA, away from the inactive complexes of MDA5 bound to abundant ssRNAs. This finding promises a novel
method for identifying MDA5 ligands, the long-sought-after milestone in the field. Building upon these
progresses, we here propose to address two central questions on MDA5 functions, i.e. signaling mechanism
(Aim 1) and RNA ligand selectivity (Aim 2), from the new perspective of TRIM65. More specifically, we will
determine the structural and biochemical mechanisms by which TRIM65 activates and regulates MDA5 (Aim 1)
and develop a novel TRIM65 pull-down strategy to identify the RNA ligands for MDA5.
 We believe that the proposed work would demonstrate how an E3 ligase can directly participate in the self
vs. non-self discrimination and immune signaling processes, and would provide a model for investigating other
E3 ligases in immune functions and beyond. Furthermore, our research may also guide new therapeutic
strategies to target MDA5 functions and its antiviral signaling pathway."

Vision problems are prevalent among older adults, with about 92% of Medicare enrollees ages 65 and older
using vision correction, and 39% of Medicare enrollees who use vision correction reporting trouble seeing even
with eyeglasses. Visual impairment is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including an
increased risk of falls and hip fractures. While most fee-for-service Medicare enrollees do not have coverage
for routine eye exams and glasses, some low-income Medicare enrollees have comprehensive vision coverage
if they qualify for full Medicaid benefits (“dual eligibles”) and reside in a state with a Medicaid program that
covers vision services. The objective of this proposal is to use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the
effect of Medicaid coverage of routine eye exams and glasses on eye care access and fall-related outcomes
among dual eligibles during 2000-2019. The central hypothesis is that coverage of vision services will increase
eye care visits and reduce the risk of falling by improving vision. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) to examine the effects of Medicaid vision benefits on measures of access to
eye care and vision including eye care visits, unmet needs for glasses, out-of-pocket spending on routine eye
care, self-reported trouble seeing, functional limitations due to vision, and Medicare claims-based measures of
past-year treatment for glaucoma, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration; 2) to examine the effects
of Medicaid vision benefits on fall-related outcomes including self-reported falls, fall-related injuries, and activity
limitations due to fear of falling and administrative measures of treatment for falls; and 3) to evaluate the
effects of Medicaid vision benefits by sex, race and ethnicity, diabetes diagnosis, and by Alzheimer’s disease,
related dementias, and memory loss. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will
use several complementary data sources including linked survey and administrative claims data to examine
measures of eye care access and fall-related outcomes, compile a comprehensive database of Medicaid vision
benefit policies over a more than 20 year period to be shared with researchers, combine a quasi-experimental
approach with a 9 year panel of individual longitudinal data, and apply newly developed methods to address
variation in the timing of state policy changes. The proposed research is significant because the number of
adults ages 65 and older is projected to more than double over the next 40 years. Correspondingly, the
prevalence of vision problems and injurious falls is likely to increase significantly over this period. The
proposed aims will produce the first estimates of the effects of Medicaid vision benefits on eye care access and
fall-related outcomes among dual eligibles. The public health impact of this research will be to provide critical,
timely, and policy relevant evidence on the effects of increased access to vision care among older adults and
the role of public health insurance."

 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a major metabolic cancer, and several well-known renal cancer genes are
involved in pathways that respond to metabolic stress. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the metabolic
stress pathways involved in RCC development and to develop treatments that target the fundamental metabolic
vulnerabilities in RCC. BAP1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in RCC, with inactivating mutations in up to 15%
of cases and frequent deletion in clear cell RCCs (ccRCCs), and patients with BAP1-mutant ccRCC exhibit
particularly poor clinical outcomes. However, how BAP1 functions as a tumor suppressor in renal cancer remains
unclear, and currently there is no effective therapy to treat RCC patients with BAP1 mutations. BAP1 and its
associated proteins form the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, which reduces histone 2A
ubiquitination (H2Aub) on chromatin and regulates gene transcription. SLC7A11 is a cystine transporter. Our
recent publications and preliminary data link BAP1 to SLC7A11 and support the central hypotheses of our
proposal that (i) the BAP1-containing PR-DUB complex mediates H2Aub de-ubiquitination and transcriptional
repression of SLC7A11, and BAP1 deficiency or alteration of other components in the PR-DUB complex de-
represses SLC7A11 expression, rendering renal cancer cells more resistant to ferroptosis (a non-apoptotic cell
death induced by metabolic stress) and contributing to RCC development; and (ii) BAP1-deficient/mutant renal
tumors are more dependent on glucose for survival, partly due to high SLC7A11 expression in these tumors,
thus exposing a metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting. In this proposal, we will employ multi-disciplinary
approaches to test our hypotheses. The rationale for the proposed research is that studying the roles of the
BAP1-SLC7A11 signaling axis in ferroptosis and glucose dependency will not only advance our understanding
of how renal cancer cells bypass ferroptotic cell death to survive and grow but also provide important insights
into the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target accompanying metabolic vulnerabilities in RCC.
With respect to expected outcomes, our proposed studies will identify novel regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis
pathways, clarify the tumor suppression function of BAP1, and identify new effective therapies to target metabolic
vulnerabilities in renal cancer. Our proposal is highly innovative because it focuses on a previously unexplored
pathway to link metabolic stress signaling to tumor development and treatment. Our proposed studies will have
significant impact on both our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of metabolic stress response and
our ability to target nutrient dependency in renal cancer treatment."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the first cause of dementia. Many
lines of genetic and biochemical evidence strongly highlight a pathological role of beta-amyloid (Aβ) where
extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques contributes to the loss of synapses and neurons, resulting in cognitive
deficits and eventually dementia. As such, the search for disease-modifying therapies for AD has been focused
on targeting the hallmark of the disease. Currently, there is no proven pharmacological treatment for preventing
the plaques once Aβ forms a larger aggregate and thus there is an urgent need to develop an innovative and
alternative strategy to clear Aβ plaques in the AD brain for the treatment of AD. Our long-term goal is to develop
a minimally invasive, non-pharmacological intervention to remove toxic Aβ plaques towards the treatment of AD.
To this end, herein we propose to apply magnetothermal brain stimulation as a non-pharmacological strategy to
target and remove toxic Aβ plaques towards the rescue of Aβ pathology. The principal of this approach is to
translate the energy of the high frequency alternating magnetic field (AMF) into thermal energy using
superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as a transducer that can trigger thermo-mechanical and biological
signal with high temporal and spatial specificity. Our central hypothesis is that magnetothermal brain stimulation
facilitates Aβ clearance and improves cognitive function via heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) signaling in the AD
brain. This hypothesis is based on our published data demonstrating the feasibility of this approach in targeting
Aβ plaques where we showed that MNP/AMF-induced thermo-mechanical energy, applied within a safe
threshold for brain tissue, was sufficient to direct the disruption of Aβ fibrils into smaller fragments, which were
then readily phagocytosed and cleared by microglia. In our preliminary study, we also found that the remotely
stimulated thermal energy directed to human microglia could trigger biological signal that shifts microglial
activation towards improved Aβ clearance via HSP70-dependent manner. To prove our hypothesis, we propose
to (1) establish the threshold safe thermal dose of magnetothermal brain stimulation for brain functioning in mice,
(2) develop strategies for targeted magnetothermal brain stimulation towards the improved clearance of Aβ
plaques, and (3) investigate the cellular mechanism by which magnetothermal brain stimulation influences Aβ
pathology. The successful completion of the proposed study will provide detailed knowledge of how to apply
magnetothermal brain stimulation as an innovative therapeutic strategy against Aβ-mediated pathology in AD."

Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a genetically heterogenous syndrome that results from
mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins. It is characterized by scapulohumeral-peroneal
myopathy, early joint contractures and a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. Mutations in
EMD, which encodes an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane called emerin, cause X-linked EDMD.
Mutations in LMNA, which encodes A-type lamins, cause autosomal EDMD. Lamins are intermediate filament
proteins lining the inner nuclear membrane. Extremely rare cases of EDMD-like disorders have been linked to
mutations in genes encoding other nuclear envelope proteins, including TOR1AIP1 that encodes lamina-
associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane. Emerin, A-type lamins
and LAP1 all interact with each other and indirectly with muscle cytoskeletal structural proteins. Our research
during previous cycles of this continuing project has provided new insights into the pathobiology of EDMD.
However, there are still challenges to deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the heart and
skeletal muscle pathology in EDMD and in translating fundamental discoveries towards the treatment of
patients. One is the lack of small animal or adequate cellular models of X-linked EDMD caused by emerin
deficiency. Another is developing approaches to determine if skeletal muscle pathology occurs primarily as a
result of defects in differentiated myofiber structural integrity, in regeneration of damaged fibers or both. This
proposal addresses these challenges. Our first hypothesis is that similar pathogenic cell signaling and gene
expression abnormalities are responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy in both X-linked and autosomal EDMD.
Our second hypothesis is that alterations in EDMD-associated proteins affect both the structural integrity of
differentiated skeletal muscle fibers and the ability of injured muscle to regenerate. Specific Aim 1 will address
the first of these hypotheses. We will generate a mouse model of cardiomyopathy in X-linked EDMD as well as
isogenic cultured cardiomyocytes with EMD, LMNA and TOR1AIP1 mutations. This will allow us to determine if
the same cell signaling and gene alterations occur in the heart in X-linked and autosomal EDMD. Specific Aim
2 will investigate the effects of EDMD-causing gene mutations on differentiated skeletal muscle. To do so, we
will generate mice in which the encoded proteins can be depleted from differentiated adult myofibers and
examine the pathological, physiological and gene expression abnormalities that occur. Specific Aim 3 will
examine the role of EDMD-associated proteins in skeletal muscle regeneration. This will be accomplished by
depleting the proteins specifically from skeletal muscle satellite cells and assessing regeneration after injury.
Successful completion of these Aims will advance our understanding of the cardiac and skeletal muscle
pathobiology in X-linked and autosomal EDMD and provide novel model systems to test therapies."
10866487,"Our published data show that genetic ablation and pharmacologic inhibition of NFATc3 in macrophages is
beneficial in maintaining alveolar-capillary barrier function, prevents inflammatory cytokine release and
neutrophilic inflammation, improved arterial oxygenation and survival in the LPS and cecal ligation puncture
mouse models of ARDS. Here, we propose to determine the granular details of the downstream molecular targets
of NFATc3 using a 2-hit mouse model, human lung macrophages, and BALF from patients with ARDS. Our team
has developed a novel non-toxic cell permeable calcineurin inhibitory (CNI) peptide (CNI103) that blocks
activation of NFATc3 in macrophages and mitigates ARDS in mice. We propose to determine the molecular
targets of NFATc3 using a pre-clinical 2-hit mouse model, human lung macrophages, and BALF from patients
meeting the Berlin criterion for ARDS. Our central hypothesis is that activation of calcineurin-dependent NFAT
in macrophages regulates the development of ALI/ARDS, and inhibition of NFAT activation by a novel
peptide calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) lessens disease severity. We propose two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To delineate the downstream molecular targets of NFATc3-Calcineurin activation pathway in
pulmonary macrophages during ALI/ARDS. Novel preliminary data show that the lipid content of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) in BALF are NFATc3 dependent and mediate disruption of barrier function in lung microvascular
endothelial cells (MVEC). In SA1, we will 1) determine the spectrum of NFAT regulated lipids mediators and
enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, 2) determine whether these mediators are packaged in extracellular
vesicles, 3) assess whether EVs mediate the the cell-to-cell communication that results in permeability
pulmonary edema and 4) determine whether blocking NFAT activation prevents lung injury and inflammation in
clinically relevant mouse and cellular models of ARDS.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an optimized cell permeable calcineurin inhibitor,
which prevents NFAT activation, in clinically relevant infectious and non-infectious mouse models of
ALI/ARDS. We will test whether cell permeable calcineurin peptide inhibitors prevent and reverse lung injury
and inflammation in mouse models of ARDS. We will also assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
(PK/PD) properties, cellular selectivity, safety, efficacy, and potency in preventing and reversing lung injury in
preclinical mouse models of ARDS.
These studies will advance knowledge about the essential role of NFATc3 activation in macrophages
and other lung cell types in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. We anticipate that knowledge gained from
these studies will establish NFATc3 as a novel therapeutic target that regulates EV-mediated cell-cell
interactions by governing the composition of biologically active lipid and protein mediators."
10863271,"Many Veterans with spinal cord injury or dysfunction (SCI/D) will require ongoing assistance with transfers after
rehabilitation. Informal caregivers, defined as those who provide unpaid support, are often responsible for
providing this assistance, however, repeated performance of this task over time has been associated with
increased risk of injuries to both caregivers and care recipients. Major improvements are needed in the way we
train and educate caregivers who need to assist Veterans in performing transfers. There is currently no
objective way to evaluate caregiver-assisted transfers, making the assessment of the techniques difficult. My
team has recently drafted a new instrument, called the Caregiver Assisted Transfer Technique Instrument
(CATT) which has been developed to provide clinicians and informal caregivers with an objective measure to
evaluate assisted transfer techniques. The CATT is designed to evaluate transfer set up, lift quality, and
results and was designed through expert input and extensive literature review. The goals of a recently funded
VA Merit Review grant will be to establish the tool’s reliability and validation against gold standard
biomechanical measures. The CATT not only provides an objective indicator for the level of risk associated
with caregiver assisted transfers but will also allow for identifying specific deficits associated with technique
and areas to target education and/or interventions.
Physical activity levels among Veterans who use wheelchairs is very low despite the importance in improving
overall physical and mental health. Wheelchair users have few exercise options particularly if they lack
volitional function of their lower extremities. They also face many barriers to exercise with the two most cited
being lack of transportation and time. In recent work my team explored the feasibility of an at home high-
intensity interval handcycling training program for persons with spinal cord injury and upper limb vibration
exercise via a medical grade dumbbell (Galileo). While the programs showed promising results, a common
theme in carrying out the research was that the participants lacked motivation to continue exercising outside of
the study and many noted that they wish they could use a Peloton bike which is not accessible to most
wheelchair users. This led me to pursue VA Merit Grant funding to build a socially connected exercise system
(ParaCycle) that is accessible to wheelchair users and provides access to commercial fitness apps with
motivating features (e.g. immersive technology, social supports, etc.) similar to the Peloton. We aim to
iteratively design and develop the device engaging input from end-users and will conduct usability testing of
the device both in the lab and at home."

All biodiversity on earth is generated through the process of speciation. While speciation research is focused
on the origins of reproductive barriers between species, the results of this work will inform the study of
infertility, an important reproductive health concern. Though gametogenesis is a logical developmental process
to study in regard to reproductive isolation, nearly all research focuses on male gametogenesis, with little to no
work on oogenesis. The proposed research hypothesizes that environmental stress hastens the accumulation
of genetic divergence through its impact on oogenesis, drawing connections between reproductive and
environmental health. For example, environmental stress has been shown to cause recurrent spontaneous
abortion, making this work relevant to public health. There are four key outcomes of environmental stress on
oogenesis – transposable elements, structural variants, meiotic recombination rates, and gene regulation –
that have been shown to be important to the study of speciation. By increasing genetic differences, oogenesis
facilitates speciation between species that are differentially exposed. This proposal focuses primarily on
recombination, while taking an important step towards integrating other outcomes. Previous research has
shown that recombination rates evolve more rapidly than nucleotide divergence. This coupled with evidence
that recombination rates are environmentally sensitive, suggests that the environment could be a major driver
of local adaptation through recombination. This proposal leverages the ease of experimental manipulation in
fruit flies to study the link between environmental sensitivity of oogenesis, the accumulation of novel genetic
variation, and subsequent species divergence. First, within species oogenesis will be compared to hybrids
under control and stress conditions investigating gene expression, chromatin conformation, organismal
measures of stress response, and recombination. By targeting molecular pathways associated with
transposable element silencing and DNA repair, this work can indirectly inform the accumulation of these novel
genetic variants, answering a key question in evolutionary biology regarding sources of intra- and inter-
species variation. Second, because differences in hybrid oogenesis could be attributed to reproductive
incompatibilities impacting fitness, this work will investigate the relationship between fitness and recombination
plasticity directly with three unique experimental stress treatments. Mutant markers will be used to compare
recombination, with the aid of a novel high-throughput phenotyping robot. Wild type stocks known to be either
sensitive or tolerant to selected stressors will be targeted. A major innovation of this work will be to investigate
organismal stress response directly to compare fitness across treatments. The data collected from these two
questions will be critical in the broader investigation of mechanisms of recombination rate plasticity, which
remains a mystery even after a century of research in this area. In five years, the proposed work will answer
crucial questions in speciation, while also filling a major gap of the importance of oogenesis in speciation."

Malaria remains a significant public health challenge that has resisted worldwide control efforts. Some individuals
who become infected with Plasmodium falciparum develop cerebral malaria (CM), which presents as a coma
and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The etiology of CM coma, which is reversible in survivors,
remains unknown. We have identified high blood levels of pipecolic acid (PA) in children with CM compared to
mild malaria. PA has been shown to induce coma in animal models, and we will test the hypothesis that high
blood levels in CM result in abnormally elevated PA central nervous system (CNS) concentrations to result coma
in CM. We will determine if PA cerebral spinal fluids are elevated in CM compared with defined non-CM cases
of encephalopathy. We will determine if PA is enriched in the brain of mice in infected with P. berghei ANKA in
the experimental cerebral malaria model and not in the brains of mice infected with strains P. yoelii and P.
chabaudi, which are infection models where mice maintain wakefulness. We will investigate the hypothesis that
PA reduces consciousness through γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, which has been suggested by prior
studies using a rat model. PA has been shown by multiple groups including ours to be produced by Plasmodium,
and its role in parasite biology is unknown. We will define the metabolic pathway that produces PA and test
whether PA protects the malaria parasite from oxidative stress, similar to its protective role observed in
mammalian cells. Overall, our goals are to define the role of PA in coma induction and parasite biology to
characterize a novel mechanism of coma in humans, potentially identify a biomarker of CM etiology of coma,
and characterize a potential novel target for improving the health outcomes of CM."
10848353,"Abstract:
The neuronal circuitry underlying respiration has been investigated thoroughly within the brainstem. In recent
years, mounting evidence in animals and humans has revealed that ‘higher-level’ brain structures above the
brainstem modulate key aspects of respiration, a finding that has important implications to design effective
treatments for patients suffering from certain types of respiratory disease. This is especially relevant for cases
where lung disease is not reversible and where neural or psychogenic influences are suspected, as in some
forms of COPD, asthma, interstitial lung disease, cardiac and neuromuscular diseases, as well as palliative care
and COVID-19. The overall aim of this proposal is to determine how higher-level brain regions interfere
with automatic brainstem respiratory circuits to give rise to the complex pathology underlying
respiratory disease in humans. To answer this question, we use a model of dyspnea (breathing discomfort)
which is one of the leading symptoms (rivaling chronic pain) that cause approximately 10% of the general
population to seek medical care. Patients suffering from persistent dyspnea choose descriptors such as “feeling
suffocated” and “feeling like air is more precious than water”. Dyspnea is the result of an imbalance between the
neural drive to breathe and the corresponding respiratory-related afferents. Current treatments that target the
brain (rather than the lungs) to alleviate dyspnea are limited to opioids and/or benzodiazepines, but these drugs
can suppress ventilatory drive, produce dependence and contribute to hypercapnic respiratory failure. We work
towards meeting the clinical need of finding a treatment that reduces dyspnea without reducing
ventilatory drive, by providing a better understanding of the cortical mechanisms that modulate
respiratory-related afferents and ultimately shape the subjective sensations of dyspnea.
 Available evidence on the neural substrates of dyspnea in humans comes from noninvasive EEG and
fMRI studies which do not afford the level of resolution required to access the deep sources involved in dyspnea
nor disentangle the temporal dynamics of its different components (sensory and affective). We will utilize
intracranial recordings (iEEG) from multiple cortical and subcortical regions in patients with chronically
implanted electrodes for reasons unrelated to the present study (undergoing epilepsy treatment) and leverage
on our recent finding that neural oscillations in these regions, recorded using iEEG, track the respiratory cycle,
the so called Respiratory-Related Brain Oscillations (RRBO). The proposed experiments aim to:
Aim 1: Further characterize RRBO: Determining causality between brain oscillations and the breathing cycle.
Aim 2: Validate RRBO as neural marker of dyspnea: Detecting neural features of dyspnea in RRBO recorded
in the primary (sensory dyspnea dimension) and secondary (affective dyspnea dimension) interoceptive cortex.
Aim 3: Using direct electrical stimulation (DES) to probe cortical sites involved in dyspnea: Reducing dyspnea
induced by the respiratory constrains by applying DES to key regions in the secondary interoceptive cortex."

Our discovery that the NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation enzyme mediates the protein editing of N-
glycosylated asparagines to aspartic acid of the SKN-1A transcription factor to increase proteasomal
capacity is highly relevant to protein aggregation diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and ADRD.
NGLY1 N to D editing of SKN-1A also mediates the up-regulation of proteasome biogenesis in face of
protein aggregation challenges including to human Ab, a key trigger of AD and ADRD. Precisely the
same PNG-1/NGLY1, DDI-1, SKN-1A pathway acts in human tumor cells to mediate responses to the
protein assembly and degradation challenges of aneuploidy. Our informatic analysis shows a strong
signature of NGLY1-mediated protein editing in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, motivating our genetic
analysis of anti-viral response defects in C. elegans png-1, ddi-1, and skn-1a mutants. We also explore
how decreased mitochondrial function increases longevity and antiviral defense in C. elegans. C.
elegans uses a system homologous to the mammalian mitochondrial MAVS to RNA helicase system that
is coupled to NF-kB antiviral cascades in mammals and to RNA interference in C. elegans to activate
antiviral defense. Mutations in C. elegans drh-1,the orthologue of mammalian MDA5 RNA helicase, a
key player in mammalian mitochondrial to interferon antiviral defense, suppress the enhanced RNAi and
suppress the lifespan extension of mitochondrial mutants, supporting the model that enhanced antiviral
defense as a key anti-aging output from mitochondrial mutations. The dramatic increases in C. elegans
longevity that are observed in C. elegans insulin-signaling mutants also induce enhanced RNAi, an
antiviral response. This intersects with the dramatically increased vulnerability to viruses in the elderly,
especially for Sars-Cov2, where the vast majority of deaths were over 75 years old. We hypothesize that
the striking increase in AD and ADRD during aging may be caused by the sum of late onset viral
infections that challenge proteasomal capacity. Our genetic analysis discovered that the activation of the
CMTR-1 RNA methylase suppresses the hyperoxia lethality of complex I mutants. The phylogenetic
profile of CMTR-1 shows that it is very similar to the C. elegans cat-2 tyrosine dioxygenase that mediates
dopamine synthesis. We will test if CMTR-1 RNA methylates the cat-2 and other mRNAs that encode
dopamine production and whether this RNA methylation is responsive to oxygen. The mitochondrion is
implicated in Parkinson’s disease by the human mitochondrial Parkin ubiquitin ligase and PINK1 kinase,
and we will test whether C. elegans mutations in the orthologues of these mitochondrial Parkinson’s
genetic risk genes pdr-1 (Parkin) or pink-1 interact with the CMTR-1 RNA methylase to cat-2 mRNA
regulatory interaction."

Radiotherapy has become an increasingly effective technique to treat patients affected by primary and metastatic
liver cancers, especially after the advent of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT delivers a large and
focused radiation dose to liver tumors and achieves superior local control and survival. However, for current liver
SBRT, a volume usually much larger than the actual tumor (with treatment margins up to 15 mm beyond the
tumor boundary) is treated, to account for tumor localization uncertainties under the cone-beam computed
tomography (CBCT) image guidance. Such a large treatment volume incurs more radiation to normal liver tissues
and organs-at-risks and raises the concern of normal tissue toxicity, especially for patients with liver cirrhosis
and a limited healthy liver tissue reserve. It also prevents further dose escalation to maximize the effectiveness
of SBRT. Currently, there lacks a reliable technique to accurately localize liver tumors by CBCT, mostly due to
the respiration-induced liver motion and the low contrast of liver tumors against the normal liver tissues. In
response to PAR-19-158, we propose to develop a biomechanical modeling-guided 4DCBCT technique (Bio-
4DCBCT), which generates 4DCBCT images to capture the liver tumor motion for accurate 4D localization. The
Bio-4DCBCT incorporates liver biomechanical modeling into the 4DCBCT generation process, which can
substantially improve the localization accuracy of CBCT at low-contrast regions. The goal of this study is to
develop, optimize and validate the Bio-4DCBCT technique to achieve ~ 2 mm tumor localization accuracy. In
this study we will pursue three specific aims: SA1. Optimize Bio-4DCBCT through a retrospective patient study.
SA2. Evaluate Bio-4DCBCT by developing a motion-enabled, deformable, physical liver phantom. SA3. Evaluate
Bio-4DCBCT through a prospective clinical study by comparing Bio-4DCBCT with the current clinically-applied
techniques. The innovation of the project is the Bio-4DCBCT technique and its application for accurate 4D liver
tumor localization, which leads to substantial treatment volume/margin reduction to achieve safer, more viable
and more effective liver SBRT. The Bio-4DCBCT technique is developed on the conventional CBCT system
under standard image acquisition protocols, which will be readily applicable in radiotherapy clinics worldwide
without hardware upgrade or image acquisition protocol change. The successful clinical translation of this
technology is expected to create a favorable shift in current tumor localization paradigms, not only for liver but
also for other tumor sites where low tissue contrast adversely affects the radiotherapy treatment accuracy."

The World Trade Center Environmental Health Center (WTC EHC) is a NIOSH-designated treatment and
monitoring program for community members (“WTC Survivors”) with acute and/or chronic WTC exposures.
Physical exposures include acute exposures to the massive dust clouds from the collapsing WTC buildings as
well as chronic exposures to the resuspended dust and fumes in the subsequent months. Many also had
traumatic psychological exposures as they witnessed death and dismemberment, worried about their own
safety, lost their livelihood, or were displaced. There is a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), chronic pulmonary disorder, and many types of cancers among WTC Survivors. Enrollees of WTC
EHC include about 50% women and have diverse social-economic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. The WTC
dust and fume exposures have been shown to be associated with mental-physical disorders, including PTSD,
respiratory disorders, and cancers. Importantly, increased cognitive impairments have recently been
extensively studied and widely reported for WTC responders; however, little is known for WTC Survivors. We
hypothesize that the oxidative stress from the WTC exposures and affiliated systemic inflammation are part of
the biological mechanism underlying the comorbid mental and physical disorders and contributing to
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairments in many WTC Survivors. To date, the
biological mechanism underlying the WTC exposures, prevalent comorbid mental and physical disorders, and
cognitive impairments and decline over time have not been investigated in WTC Survivors, leading to
knowledge gaps and considerable uncertainty in both diagnosis and assessment of health disorders for
Survivors. To improve diagnosis and treatment and to identify the biological underpinning of these health
disorders, we propose a longitudinal study to assess cognitive functions and rate of changes over time among
WTC Survivors enrolled at WTC EHC and also measure blood-based biomarkers of systemic inflammation,
neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. We will conduct causal inference to analyze existing patient-level
WTC exposures and comorbid mental-physical disorders data together with newly obtained cognitive scores
and blood-based biomarker data to assess the effect of comorbid conditions and inflammation and
neurodegeneration biomarkers in blood as mediators of the WTC exposures for cognitive impairments and
cognitive decline over time both in the whole study population and in vulnerable subpopulations. The study
aims to understand the biological mechanisms of how complex WTC exposures affect comorbid mental and
physical disorders and impact cognitive dysfunctions in WTC Survivors. Completing this project may lead to
the identification of novel blood-based biomarkers for non-invasive accurate disease diagnosis and cost-
effective monitoring as well as potential targets for effective intervention."

Pregnant women and children who lived, worked or attended school near the World Trade Center (WTC) on
September 11, 2001 experienced a variety of psychological and chemical exposures with potential adverse
consequences for later health and development. In contrast to psychological effects, physical health effects of
early life exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster remain poorly understood. This is particularly
important as the well-known developmental origins of health and disease (DoHAD) concept indicates that
exposures occurring during sensitive developmental windows may lead to adverse health outcomes in later
life. We have recently demonstrated that neonates and children exposed to chemicals (e.g., dioxins,
perfluoroalkylsubstances (PFAS)) known to be associated with WTC experience adverse health outcomes
including adverse birth outcomes, altered lipid levels, and asthma. However, characterizing the totality of WTC
exposure—including both psychologicial and chemical exposures—has been challenging, limiting our ability to
identify WTC-related health effects, which are likely to emerge as exposed children age. Here, we employ
advances in molecular laboratory technology, which have enabled high-resolution methods to measure
thousands of exogenous chemicals and their endogenous biological responses to these exposures. These
powerful exposomic and metabolomic approaches have been used to enhance disease prognosis and diagnosis
as well as provide insight into disease pathogenesis in neonates, children and adults. Using two cohorts of WTC-
exposed neonates and youth, we can 1) identify an exogenous chemical signature that is associated with
conventional WTC exposure measures including proximity-based exposure metrics and targeted biomarkers
associated WTC exposure indices (Aim 1); 2) identify a metabolomic signature that reflects the biological
response to both conventional WTC exposure measures and psychological stressors associated with WTC
exposure (Aim 2); and 3) determine if WTC-exposure related exogenous chemical signatures (Aim 3a) and
metabolomic signatures (Aim 3b) are associated with adverse health outcomes in children. If confirmed, the
exogenous chemical and metabolomic signatures we identify in blood stored from these two vulnerable WTC-
exposed populations will provide unique fingerprints that can be used to predict adverse WTC-related outcomes
that may emerge as exposed children age into adulthood."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and disability worldwide, and there are currently no disease
modifying treatments available. While obesity-induced OA involves both metabolic and biomechanical factors, a
key link is excess fat, or adipose tissue – a source of inflammatory mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of
OA. The mechanistic influence of adiposity, biomechanical alterations, and metabolic syndrome have been
difficult to determine and disentangle. To separate these factors, we used a mouse model of lipodystrophy (LD),
in which the animals completely lack fat but maintain normal body mass. The LD mouse demonstrates many
clinical signs observed in individuals with obesity-induced OA (sclerotic subchondral bone, systemic
inflammation, insulin resistance, metabolic disturbance, and muscle weakness). Unexpectedly, we observed that
LD knee joints are protected from OA. When fat was transplanted into LD mice protection from OA was reversed,
implicating that adipose tissue, and factors secreted by adipose tissue called adipokines – but not body weight
– are critical mediators of joint degeneration. These results suggest that adipose tissue and the mediators
(adipokines) secreted by adipose tissue adversely affect cartilage health.
In the mentored K99 portion of this grant, we will generate bioengineered designer adipose implants using murine
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to provide a platform to deconstruct adipokine signaling and investigate
the mechanisms linking adipose tissue and joint health. This approach, which was not possible previously without
creating complex and expensive transgenic mice, addresses a gap fundamental in our understanding of obesity
and OA. In the independent R00 portion of this grant, we will leverage recent advances in regenerative medicine
to develop and test a self-regulating cell-based implant that can provide biologic drugs to combat OA, laying the
platform for Dr. Collins’ independent research career, and the groundwork for a first R01. The value of this
platform is the flexibility to interchangeably deliver a wide range of potential therapeutics. Using this novel and
flexible platform, we will hijack adipokine signaling to deliver anti-inflammatory mediators in a tunable and well-
controlled manner as a novel regenerative therapy for OA. Since this iPSC platform could readily accommodate
edits and alterations of targets of interest in a variety of cell types, the potential for this therapy is far-reaching,
as many chronic diseases (cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc.) have links to pathologic inflammatory
signaling."

 Access to health care including clinical trials leading to paradigm-changing cancer treatments is critical for
high quality cancer care and equity in society. Differences in risks and cancer biology may contribute to disparities
in cancer outcome particularly if minority/underserved groups are underrepresented in clinical trials as impact of
newer cancer therapies may not be adequately evaluated in these populations. Compared to later phase clinical
trials, early phase trials are more complicated but are pivotal in the development of novel and more effective
therapies. Participation into early phase clinical trials is often the only way a patient can access potentially
effective novel therapies not yet available commercially. There is evidence of direct medical benefit, improvement
of quality of life, and achievement of psychological benefit in early phase trials. The challenge of engaging
minority/underserved populations is more profound in early phase clinical trials as they are generally more
complex and often accessible only in larger centers in the metropolitan areas.
 In this project, Dr. Baranda will continue to lead in the development of sustainable and intentional strategies
to extend access and increase participation to early phase Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network
(ETCTN) clinical trials to underrepresented populations including the veterans using a roadmap built from
lessons learned from the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) CATCH-UP.2020 (Create Access to Targeted Cancer
Therapy for Underserved Populations) program. Implementation of more rigorous analysis of areas of unmet
needs, efficiency in ETCTN clinical trial for timely activation, trial selection and prioritization, and engagement of
physicians throughout our catchment area will continue to be adopted in this project. A project for efficient
workflow in genomic characterization of patient tumors will allow identification of patients appropriate for
biomarker-driven ETCTN precision medicine clinical trials. KUCC will lead the Equity-Focused Clinical
Investigators Team within the ETCTN UM1 consortium through exchange of novel approaches among ETCTN
sites and ensuring the use of pragmatic approach in clinical trial design to prevent unnecessary burden to pts
and minimize load to the clinical trials operations in ETCTN."

Patients accumulate large volumes of information in their electronic health record (EHR), and finding this
information often proves difficult, especially given the usability issues associated with EHRs. One of the most
intuitive means of encoding information needs is with natural language questions thus automatic question
answering (QA) methods provide an intuitive interface for quickly accessing patient information.
An emerging and promising solution to this QA problem is the use of large language models (LLMs), which are
natural language processing (NLP) models trained on significant amounts of natural language text. LLMs
provide an excellent building block for training high-performance QA systems and have been shown to be
excellent at answering medical questions However, LLM-based models have also been shown to provide
completely false information (“hallucinations”). When applied to EHR QA, this could result in clinicians making
diagnosis and treatment decisions based on invalid information about their patient, easily leading to harms. The
naïve use of such systems in a clinical environment is thus seen as unacceptable to some. Further, LLMs are not
well-suited to the structured data found in EHRs as the language models are trained only on unstructured text.
On the other hand, there are systems designed from the ground up to be trustworthy and well-suited to the
clinical environment. As part of our preliminary work, we developed the quEHRy system that understands when
a question is outside its capabilities and thus rarely returns a wrong answer. There is still much room for
improvement for quEHRy, however, as it currently only answers questions for structured data and its
understanding of medical concepts requires improvement. In other words, the strengths and weaknesses of
quEHRy are well-complemented by LLM-based QA systems (and vice versa). The key question this proposal tries
to answer, then, is how to combine such systems to achieve a single EHR QA system that is both trustworthy and
high-performance.
To this end, we hypothesize it is possible to create hybrid methods leveraging the power of LLMs while
maintaining the trustworthiness of carefully-designed systems like quEHRy. Further, this both requires and
enables QA over both structured and unstructured EHR data, so we will investigate ways to better understand
the alignment between structured and unstructured data, and how this can be leveraged for EHR QA."

 This project aims to determine whether a media-based intervention targeting low- socioeconomic status
(SES) preschoolers and their caregivers can improve children's early literacy skills relative to a caregiver-led
shared-reading intervention, in line with two NICHD priority areas: (1) effects of technology and media on child
development and (2) school readiness in children from low-SES homes. The current proposal is situated in an
implementation science framework, aiming to identify barriers to implementing evidence-based practices and
adopting strategies to address these barriers and improve outcomes. In prior work, we found that a storybook
intervention with explicit print referencing improves children's early literacy skills; however, caregiver adherence
is often low. Here, we hypothesize that using educational media may circumvent or diminish barriers and promote
adherence, as media may be more readily incorporated into household routines and thus increase child exposure
to print references, a key mechanism for learning. This study addresses four specific aims: (1) To determine the
extent to which a media-based, caregiver-led early literacy intervention leads to higher adherence among low-
SES families relative to an aligned shared reading intervention (and the extent to which the media intervention
reduces barriers, which then leads to higher adherence), (2) To determine the extent to which a media-based,
caregiver-led early literacy intervention leads to greater improvement in literacy skills of children from low-SES
homes, relative to an aligned shared reading intervention, (3) To determine the extent to which effects are
mediated by higher adherence (i.e., intervention dose and intensity), and (4) To determine the extent to which
two potential moderators (child sex and caregiver self-efficacy beliefs) influence effects of intervention medium.
We also explore potential child-, caregiver-, and dyad-level moderators of intervention medium on early literacy
skills. This study uses a randomized controlled trial with three conditions: a caregiver-led media-based early
literacy intervention, a caregiver-led shared reading early literacy intervention, and a business-usual control.
Participants are 450 caregivers and 3.5 to 4-year-olds. Early literacy skills are assessed at pretest and posttest.
Social validity of the intervention is measured to test whether the media intervention circumvents barriers. Fidelity
of implementation is measured during the intervention. Follow-up visits at three, six, and twelve months tests
long-term effects. Aim 1 uses regression models to compare adherence and social validity across conditions,
and to predict adherence from social validity. Aims 2, 3, and 4 are addressed via regression models comparing
gains from pre- to post-test and two-level growth models examining growth in skills across follow-up time points.
This project is innovative as it seeks to understand mechanisms by which using media to address barriers to a
caregiver-led literacy intervention may be effective, capitalizing on the benefits of both educational media and
caregiver-led interventions and testing mechanisms underlying effects on literacy skills."
10862855,"Each year, millions of Americans face vision loss related to diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, more than 30 million Americans have diabetes, and a third of diabetics aged 40 or
over in the U.S. have diabetic retinopathy (DR) and related diabetic eye diseases. While the pathogenic
mechanisms underpinning the development of DR appear multifactorial and remain incompletely understood,
abnormal neovascularization is a key contributing factor, supported by the fact that therapy with anti-VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor) drugs has become the gold standard treatment for DR and its
complications among other interventions. Whilst anti-VEGFs demonstrate modest clinical benefits, these
drugs fail to fully attenuate clinical progression or reverse damage to the retina and have to be administered
frequently via invasive intravitreal injections over many years. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new
therapeutic strategies to improve the treatment of this devastating disease. A better understanding of the
etiology and the molecular mechanism of DR, as well as the development of novel mechanism-based
therapeutics, will address a major unmet medical need. This study combines genetic and pharmacological
approaches to determine the functions and mechanisms of Epac1-mediated pathogenic neovascularization and
vascular dysfunction during DR development. Successful completion of our proposed studies will not only
provide new mechanistic insights into understanding cAMP/Epac1-mediated vascular remodeling but also will
lead to the discovery of a new class of in vivo pharmacological agents that can be used as lead compounds for
developing medications targeting DR and other vascular proliferative diseases."

Even with successful viral control, HIV-infected individuals exhibit co-morbidities associated with older age,
including osteoporosis, stroke, dementia, and cancer. In aviremic HIV+ individuals and the general geriatric
population, age-associated diseases and mortality correlate with plasma markers of inflammation and intestinal
permeability. The gut is a major reservoir of latently HIV-infected cells, and HIV enteropathy, defined as
pathologic processes in the small intestine and colon, is a hallmark of HIV infection. Our preliminary data
implicate gamma delta T cells as an inflammatory driver in ART-suppressed HIV infection and with normal
aging. gamma delta T cells are a non-conventional T cell lineage that comprise ≤10% of circulating T cells yet are found in
considerably higher proportions in the epithelium of the intestine. Also, there is evidence that this unique T cell
population regulates intestinal barrier function during normal conditions, and that gamma delta T pro-inflammatory activity
causes damage at epithelial sites and to epithelial barriers. Therefore, we hypothesize that with virally
suppressed HIV infection and with normal aging, gastrointestinal gamma delta T cells are stimulated via directly harboring
HIV and/or exposure to inflammatory factors and this aberrant activation leads to breakdown of tight junctions of
the intestinal epithelial barrier, causing increased release of microbial products and inflammatory gamma delta T cells into
the circulation. Further, we predict that aged gamma delta T cells exhibit functional profiles skewed towards inflammatory
cytokines/cytotoxicity in response to either direct HIV infection and/or stimulatory factors. In this application, we
propose to test these hypotheses using advanced and innovative approaches, including 25-color flow cytometry,
31-color imaging mass cytometry of recto-sigmoid biopsies, 19- and 33-plex analyses of plasma and cell culture
supernatants, respectively, and multiple algorithms for multivariate analysis of collected datasets. Our
bioinformatic data analysis plan will enable identifying novel gamma delta T cell subsets and parsing the differential impacts
of age with and without HIV infection. In Aim 1 we will perform a cross-sectional study of our HIV and Aging
cohort to determine the links between circulating gamma delta T cell subsets, plasma inflammatory and intestinal
permeability markers, and intestinal architecture and cellular composition. In Aim 2 we will determine the
temporal links between gamma delta T cell subsets, plasma markers, and the onset and/or progression of geriatric
outcomes via a longitudinal study of older subjects with and without ART-suppressed HIV. In Aim 3, we will
perform in vitro assays to determine how age and HIV infection impact gamma delta T cell functions, including the capacity
to breakdown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers. We predict that our proposed experiments will identify the
biological mechanisms that drive the increased systemic inflammation and age-associated comorbidities in both
aviremic HIV+ individuals and the general geriatric population; such insight could lead to the development of
novel therapeutics to reduce ‘inflamm-aging’-associated diseases and deaths."

We propose a national infrastructure center entitled “Center for Smart Use of Technologies to Assess Real-
World Outcomes (C-STAR)” that directly addresses priority area #6 from RFA HD-20-04: “Technology to Track
Real-World Outcomes.” Leveraging the collective experience of our clinicians, scientists, engineers, and
patients, our program will provide the expertise, instruction, and mentoring to support the smart (i.e., appropriate,
accurate, and clinically meaningful) use of technology to assess performance in the laboratory (e.g., by
providing design insight for a new sensor), in the clinic (e.g., by teaching proper selection and placement of
sensors on a patient's body) and in the community (e.g., by guiding investigators on appropriate, validated
patient reported outcome measures to evaluate technology). By measuring performance across these domains,
rehabilitation researchers and clinicians will be able to both track real-world outcomes and investigate
mechanisms underlying response to therapy or disease progression. A compelling need for rehabilitation
research infrastructure exists in this area because of: (1) the huge proliferation of sensors and other technologies
that make it easy to “acquire data” without the necessary expertise to validate, interpret, and establish the clinical
relevance of these data, (2) the need to quantify and standardize outcomes—to not just understand clinical
outcomes but to provide important economic and societal perspectives, and (3) the need to customize, validate,
standardize, and calibrate technologies in the context of specific patients' needs and abilities, which often
requires access to particular patient cohorts. Our four cores—engineering, clinical, outcomes, and
implementation Science/community engagement—will provide the necessary expertise to allow C-STAR clients
to develop, test, validate, and standardize the use of new and existing technologies to track real-world outcomes
across many disabling conditions. C-STAR clients will be individuals or teams who would like to use technology
to measure performance of individuals with physical disabilities. We will provide numerous didactic, hands-on,
visitation, pilot funding, and advisory resources to support C-STAR clients. We will connect with our clients
through our C-STAR website and our proprietary Rehabilitation Measures Database (RMD) website
(www.rehabmeasures.org) that currently averages 11,000 unique page visits per day from likely C-STAR clients.
The resources C-STAR offers to the rehabilitation community include its leaders, who have 20 years of
cumulative experience with the R24 national infrastructure network, and other senior scientists who experienced
in the application of technology to help medical rehabilitation patients and mentorship of junior researchers. C-
STAR exploits the extraordinary environment and resources of our new translational research hospital, the
Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab, formerly the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, RIC) as well as the collegial
and fruitful collaborations developed over the past 30 years between the RIC/SRAlab and Northwestern
University."

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR) is a prevalent, yet underappreciated and underdiagnosed condition
that gives rise to a particularly lethal form of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). An unusual
aspect of ATTR is its strong male bias (94% male in wild-type ATTR and 72% in mutant ATTR). We hypothesize
that the mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in the hematopoietic system plays a role in the etiology of
ATTR. mLOY is the most prevalent postzygotic mutation in males. mLOY describes the clonal loss of the Y
chromosome in cells that frequently arises in the hematopoietic system. Recent work by the Walsh lab has
associated mLOY with incident cardiovascular disease in humans and demonstrated that experimental LOY in
the hematopoietic system can lead to spontaneous heart failure in mice (Sano et al. Science 2022). More
recently, we have found association between mLOY and TTR cardiac amyloidosis in the patient population,
providing a compelling rationale for the strong sex bias that is common to this condition. Thus, the causal and
mechanistic relationships between mLOY and cardiac amyloidosis will be explored."
10862078,"ABSTRACT
A hallmark of the oral bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans’ biology and infectivity are its ability to
form tenacious biofilms. Biofilm formation in the organism is attributed to attachment via surface proteins and
exopolysaccharides (EPS). The EPS of A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), also referred to as PNAG, is often
overlooked as a virulence factor of bacterial pathogenesis and only considered for its role in biofilm formation.
PNAG plays a critical role in the evasion from macrophages, oral colonization, and bone loss. However, very
little information is available for the regulation of PNAG production in Aa. In other PNAG-producing bacteria,
such as E. coli, the synthesis of PNAG is regulated by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP or the post-
translational carbon storage regulator CsrA. Aa does not produce cyclic-di-GMP due to the absence of the genes
responsible for its synthesis in the Aa genome and the role of CsrA is unknown in Aa. In the absence of such
regulation, in anaerobic environment, Aa could produce excessive amount of PNAG which is a highly energy
consuming process and can potentially reduce fitness. A quorum sensing two-component system, QseBC,
functions as a global regulator of virulence in Aa but does not regulate PNAG genes AapgaABCD. Thus, there
is a knowledge gap regarding regulation of PNAG in Aa. In search of novel mechanisms of regulation, we have
identified two proteins, AaFlp-1 (a unique Aa pili protein) and AaDcuB (an ABC succinate transporter involved in
fumarate respiration), both of which impacted PNAG production. Succinate in an anaerobic environment
contributes to dysbiosis of the oral microbiota and chemotaxis. Further, exogenous addition of succinate has
been shown to accelerate periodontal disease and Aa’s ability to expel succinate through fumarate respiration
and AaDcuB might be critical in disease initiation.
 These two proteins, apparently unrelated, appear to control PNAG production either independently or in a
coordinated manner. Our overarching hypothesis is that AaFlp-1 and AaDcuB proteins regulate the PNAG
production in Aa either directly or indirectly. Such impact by AaFlp-1 and AaDcuB has not been reported in other
PNAG-producing bacteria such as E. coli or S. epidermidis and these two proteins offer a unique opportunity to
study the novel regulatory mechanism(s) operational in Aa. Our immediate goal is to test the overarching
hypotheses that AaFlp-1 and AaDcuB proteins regulate the PNAG production in Aa and that the production of
PNAG is unique in Aa. The following aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1. Decipher the unique crosstalk mechanism between AaFlp-1 and PNAG production in Aa.
Hypothesis: AaFlp-1 is a signal for the induction of PNAG production in Aa.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the mechanism by which AaDcuB regulates the production of PNAG in Aa.
Hypothesis: AaDcuB protein impacts the production of PNAG through the fumarate respiration."
10861674,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and cancer impose a heavy burden on patients and their
caregivers and are major contributors to US healthcare expenditures. Given the rapidly growing aging
population at risk for both conditions, there is a critical need to understand how to improve care for those with
comorbid cancer and cognitive impairment. Patients with dual diagnoses of cancer and cognitive impairment
including ADRD have worse outcomes and unique care needs that require more person-centered care. The
unique care needs of patients with comorbid cancer and cognitive impairment cannot be met with current
oncology clinic workflow and staffing and time constraints. Oncology care must address the unique care needs
of these patients through multi-dimensional interventions for the clinic environment, providers, patients, and
caregivers that can be customized to different degrees of cognitive dysfunction and available supports.
Increased telehealth use within VA hospitals has helped relieve some of the burdens on patients and
caregivers, and telehealth oncology care is expected to be an integral, growing part of VA oncology care in the
foreseeable future. However, there is limited evidence and guidance on telehealth use for complex patients like
those with cancer and cognitive impairment including ADRD. In fact, the rapid telehealth expansion may
unintentionally exacerbate the already complex care needs of high-need Veterans. There is a critical need to
proactively design care processes to address the needs of these vulnerable patients. The goal of this project is
to improve the telehealth delivery of cancer care for older, cognitively impaired Veterans on active cancer
treatment by 1) understanding the telehealth oncology experiences of patients with cognitive impairment, their
caregivers, and clinicians, and 2) developing and testing a multi-dimensional intervention that can be
customized to different degrees of cognitive dysfunction and available supports. Eligible participants are
clinicians providing telehealth oncology care and patients who meet the following inclusion criteria: age 65 or
older, on active cancer treatment, has received any part of their care through telehealth (phone or video),
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score <26, able to speak English and provide consent. We will start
with a convergent parallel mixed-methods study to interview and survey clinicians, older Veterans with cancer
and cognitive impairment undergoing active treatment via telehealth, and their caregivers (Aims 1-2). We will
use these data to develop an intervention guided by principles of the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research and Capability-Opportunity-Motivation model of Behavior change (Aims 1-2). We will
then pilot test this multi-dimensional intervention using adaptive design principles (Aim 3). Cognitive
impairment will be stratified by milder (MoCA 18<26) versus more severe cognitive impairment (MoCA <18) as
care needs are expected to vary by severity of cognitive impairment. The primary endpoint is acceptability as
assessed by System Usability Scale score ≥70, and the secondary endpoint is feasibility as assessed by
recruitment rate ≥70%. We will also examine potential targetable outcomes such as subjective cognitive
function, functional status, distress, treatment adherence, and caregiver burden. The proposed research is
significant because it addresses a critical unmet need and helps advance scientific knowledge in how to
improve care delivery for patients with two of the most common and morbid age-related diseases—cancer and
ADRD. This project will be a high impact way to improve care for Veterans that is aligned with multiple VA
Health Services Research and Development priorities. This work has many potential future applications,
including conducting a larger efficacy trial to test the telehealth-focused intervention across other VA sites,
expanding the intervention to include in-person oncology care, or adapting our telehealth-focused intervention
for other complex chronic diseases that are often comorbid with ADRD."

Overview: The goal of this project is to assess the efficacy of a tailored phone-delivered positive psychological
intervention (PATH) for improving anxiety and depression symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors.
Background: Allogeneic HSCT survivors experience high rates of treatment-related toxicities, a prolonged
recovery, substantial risk of life-threatening complications, and long-term morbidity and mortality. Hence, HSCT
survivors experience tremendous psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) and low levels of positive
psychological well-being (e.g., flourishing, gratitude), which undermines various health-related outcomes such
as quality of life (QOL). However, most existing psychosocial interventions are not accessible to the majority of
HSCT survivors because they are 1) delivered in-person, 2) entail long 60-90-minute sessions, 3) require delivery
by palliative care clinicians or psychologists with extensive and costly training, and 4) not focused on positive
psychological well-being. To address these gaps, we developed PATH, an accessible, phone-delivered positive
psychological intervention with deliberate and systematic activities to cultivate gratitude, strengths, and meaning.
Interventions like PATH can buffer against distress to improve anxiety and depression symptoms, and QOL in
HSCT survivors and entails 15–20-minute sessions delivered by interventionists from diverse backgrounds,
including nursing, social work, or psychology. With a single site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PATH, we
showed it was feasible and preliminarily led to clinically significant improvement in patients’ anxiety symptoms.
As the first RCT to show the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored HSCT positive psychology
intervention, the next step is to assess the efficacy of PATH on anxiety and depression symptoms, and QOL.
Research Plan: We will conduct an RCT in 400 HSCT survivors to test the efficacy of PATH for improving
anxiety and depression symptoms, and QOL (Aim #1). We will also assess the impact of PATH on positive well-
being (e.g., gratitude, flourishing) and self-management targets (e.g., coping, physical activity) (Aim #2). Finally,
we will assess mediators and moderators of the effect of PATH on anxiety symptoms and QOL (Aim #3).
Environment: This project will be conducted at the Mass General Brigham/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(MGB/DFCI), Duke Cancer Institute, and Moffitt Cancer Center, which individually conduct 200-250
allogeneic HSCTs per year. Dr. Amonoo and the research team at MGB/DFCI, Duke, and Moffitt have extensive
proficiency in developing and conducting multi-site psychosocial interventions for patients with hematologic
malignancies who are HSCT survivors to ensure the successful execution of the proposed RCT across study
sites. Relevance of Research: If efficacious at improving anxiety and depression symptoms and QOL,
PATH can potentially change the paradigm of psychosocial care for HSCT survivors and vulnerable cancer
populations."

Skeletal muscle has recently arisen as a novel regulators of Central Nervous System (CNS) function and
aging, secreting bioactive molecules known as myokines with proteostasis and metabolism-modifying functions
in targeted tissues, including the CNS. Myokine secretion is heavily modified by exercise, suggesting that
myokine signaling in the periphery may underlie the well documented geroprotective benefits of exercise on
the brain. The following studies address muscle proteostasis, a pathway highly activated during exercise, as a
potential new regulator of the neurocognitive benefits of exercise. We have recently generated a novel
transgenic mouse with enhanced muscle proteostasis via moderate overexpression of Transcription Factor E-B
(TFEB), a powerful master regulator of cellular clearance and proteostasis. We have discovered that the
resulting enhanced skeletal muscle proteostasis function can significantly ameliorate proteotoxicity in the aging
CNS and also improve cognition and memory in aging mice. Enhancing muscle proteostasis also reduced
neuroinflammation and accumulation of AD-associated pathological hallmarks in plaque based and a tau-
based models of AD. We have also identified previously unreported alterations in the transcriptome of skeletal
muscle from patients with AD, as well as potential unique populations of skeletal muscle factors that may be
driving these CNS benefits. In this project, we will determine if enhanced skeletal muscle proteostasis
promotes neuroprotection against AD-associated phenotypes, and using powerful transfer learning and
computational modeling approaches, identify exercise-associated circulating factors as new therapeutic
interventions for the preservation of CNS function during AD."

 Objective. Our objective is to build on our preliminary work that demonstrates a modified dietary
approaches to stop hypertension (modDASH) eating plan combined with a standard exercise program will be a
better overall treatment for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to improve walking, local microvascular
function, and vascular inflammation.
 Specific Aims. We propose to test the efficacy of a modDASH dietary program combined with an
exercise program (modDASH+Ex) to improve exercise and vascular outcome measures in patients with PAD
and claudication beyond that of the standard treatment of an exercise program (Ex). Our central hypothesis is
that the modDASH+Ex program improves the efficacy to rehabilitate PAD patients by improving exercise
outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), local microvascular function, and vascular inflammation more
than the standard Ex program. This clinically relevant hypothesis will be tested through the following aims:
 Aim 1 (Exercise Outcomes). To compare the changes in ambulation and HRQoL in PAD patients
following the combined modDASH+Ex program, and following the Ex program which represents standard of care
treatment.
 Aim 2 (Local and Systemic Vascular Outcomes). To compare the changes in local microvascular
function of the lower extremities and inflammation in patients following the combined modDASH+Ex program, and
following the Ex program.
 Aim 3. To explore the causal mechanism that changes in local microvascular function and vascular
inflammation are physiologic mechanisms that precede changes in ambulation following the modDASH+Ex
and Ex programs, and whether changes are more predictive following modDASH+Ex program.
 Methods. This is a 3-month, patient-oriented, translational, comparative effectiveness randomized
controlled trial. A total of 184 patients will be randomized into either the modDASH+Ex program (N=92) or the Ex
program (N=92). All patients will perform home-based walking for 3 months, and patients randomized to the
modDASH+Ex program will progressively increase their daily servings of fruits and vegetables by up to 3-4
servings above baseline during the program.
 Clinical Significance. If successful, combining the modDASH eating plan with a home-based exercise
program will be a novel and innovative behavioral paradigm to optimally improve peak walking time, HRQoL, local
microvascular function and vascular inflammation in PAD patients. These improvements could impact the clinical
course of PAD by reducing long-term risks of major adverse cardiovascular and lower extremity events."

Puberty is among the most complex developmental transitions over the human lifetime. The timing (age of onset)
and tempo (rate of change) of puberty can significantly and negatively impact physical, psychosocial and
physiological functioning, especially in females. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired
reciprocal social communication and poor adaptation to change; thus, the onset and course of puberty marks a
pivotal transition. In a series of cross-sectional studies, findings from the study team have shown: 1) advanced
pubertal timing for female youth with ASD compared to typically developing females (i.e., breast development,
menses) using rigorous assessment of pubertal staging; 2) distinct camouflaging behaviors in females with ASD
when socially interacting with peers; 3) higher depressive symptoms in early adolescents with ASD, especially
females; 4) sex-based differences in neural socioemotional processing in youth with ASD; and 5) elevated stress
and arousal in youth with ASD compared to same-age TD peers that increases with age and pubertal
development. Consistent across these studies is the unique profile of females with ASD and the potential
deleterious impact of early puberty in this vulnerable, understudied population and developmental window. While
the previous and ongoing pubertal development research is compelling, at the start of enrollment, 80% of the
10-year old females with ASD had already entered puberty compared to 29% of the TD group; therefore, the
true onset of puberty could not be determined. Moreover, it was based on a relatively small sample of females
with ASD 10-13 years (N = 35). Thus, a comprehensive exploration of pubertal maturation in a large sample of
younger girls with ASD is needed. The overarching goal is to systematically examine the precise onset, tempo
and course of pubertal, psychosocial and physiological development in females with ASD using a multimodal,
multimethod, accelerated longitudinal design. A large sample of females with ASD (n=120) and TD (n=120)
spanning 6 to 15 years will be followed over four years: Cohort 1 enrolled at 6-years (follow 6-9), Cohort 2
enrolled at 8-years (follow 8-11), Cohort 3 enrolled at 10-years (follow 10-13) and Cohort 4 enrolled at 12-years
(follow 12-15). The aims will address three key areas. Aim 1: Pubertal development - will examine the timing,
tempo and course of puberty based on physical development (Tanner stage (TS), body mass index (BMI), height,
linear growth velocity (LGV)), hormones (Estradiol, Luteinizing Hormone (LH)), and menstrual cycle. Aim 2:
Psychosocial profiles - will examine reciprocal social communication (CASS) and internalizing symptoms
(anxiety and depression) at the onset and over the course of pubertal development. Aim 3. Physiological
characterization - will simultaneously examine social functioning at the level of the central nervous system (EEG
hyperscanning), HPA axis (cortisol) and peripheral nervous system (RSA) during naturalistic social interactions
between same-sex peers. The findings will reveal the impact of the onset, tempo and course of puberty

Cachexia is a significant contributor to increased mortality in various chronic diseases, including cancer. Patients
with cancer cachexia experience unintentional body weight loss, which can involve muscle loss, with or without
fat mass. The decline in muscle mass not only impairs muscle function, but also diminishes quality of life and
raises mortality risk. Our preliminary research has revealed an upregulation of transforming growth factor 2
(TGFβ2) preceding the recruitment of M2 macrophages to the skeletal muscle in cachectic mice. Additionally,
we observed that depleting M2 macrophages inhibited the transition from cachexia to severe cachexia by
preserving muscle mass and reducing fibrosis. These data highlight the involvement of M2 macrophage
activation in cachexia progression with the assistance of TGFβ2. In this proposal, we will investigate the role of
TGFβ2 in initiating fibrosis and activating M2 macrophages in the skeletal muscle of cancer cachectic mice.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that M2 macrophages act as a pivotal transition point driving the advancement of
severe cancer cachexia. The outcomes of this study may uncover a novel mechanism and innovative strategies
for the treatment of cancer cachexia."
10862130,"Adoptive transfer T cell-based immunotherapies and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy have shown
significant promise in the treatment of cancers. However, checkpoint inhibitor therapy still fails in a majority of
patients and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells are ineffective against most solid tumors. In large part,
these failures are due to the fact that frequently tumors are mostly devoid of T cells or that T cells are present
only in the tumor-surrounding stroma but largely excluded from the tumor mass. Tumors are often surrounded
by extensive collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, which impede the entry of T cells into the
tumor mass. T cell paucity or exclusion from the tumor site correlate with poor prognosis, limited efficacy of
checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, and ineffectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors. Most
cellular tumor immunotherapy approaches to date have focused on reversing T cell exhaustion and increasing
persistence of tumor-specific T cells and CAR-T cells. However, these approaches generally do not solve the
issue of recruitment and infiltration of therapeutic T cells into the tumor. The overall goal of this proposal is to
engineer T cells to enhance their migration into tumors to increase their anti-tumor activity in ‘cold’ tumors and
tumors that exclude T cells from the tumor mass. Our exploratory R21 proposal specifically addresses the
unmet need to improve migration of T cells into tumors by creating T cells with increased capacity to migrate
through restrictive environments. We have found that Formin-like-1 (FMNL1) promotes efficient T cell
extravasation, motility through confined environments, and interstitial migration in vivo. Furthermore, our
preliminary data using a melanoma model show that overexpression of FMNL1 significantly increases the
number of tumor-specific T cells present at the tumor site. Thus, we hypothesize that T cells engineered to
overexpress FMNL1, or its active mutants, will have increased trafficking to the tumor site, deeper infiltration
into the tumor mass, and enhanced anti-tumor activity. We will test our hypothesis with the following Aims:
Aim 1. Determine if overexpression of FMNL1 or its active mutants enhances tumor-specific T cell migration
and accumulation within tumors. Aim 2. Determine if T cells engineered to overexpress FMNL1 have increased
anti-tumor activity and improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Overall, we will establish and
validate a platform for T cell bioengineering to improve T cell migration into tumor sites that can be applied to
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) transfer therapy and CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors. Our novel
approach can both improve the ability of T cells to extravasate at the tumor site, and enhance the capacity of T
cells to migrate through restrictive tissue barriers to infiltrate the tumor mass. From a future translational
standpoint, an additional advantage of this system is that the T cell infiltration enhancement provided by
FMNL1 is not limited to a particular tumor antigen and is not MHC restricted. Overall, our work has the
potential to significantly improve the treatment of solid tumors using adoptive T cell transfer therapies."

Surgical complications are common, costly, and deadly. Older patients are at high risk of adverse surgical
outcomes, especially when they exhibit frailty. Frailty is a state of decreased physiologic reserve and loss of
capacity to adapt to stressors. Over the past decade, while frailty has been increasingly recognized as an
important risk factor for poor surgical outcomes, integration of a standardized frailty metric into clinical care has
not been achieved. A key barrier is that existing frailty assessments are not standardized, objective, or widely
available, limiting their routine application in surgical decision-making. With the long-term goal of improving
surgical care for older adults, we will evaluate two “e-frailty” metrics that can be automatically derived from
electronic or digital data that are already collected as part of routine clinical care. These e-frailty metrics
include, first, granular patient profiles of electronic health record (EHR) data (risk scores based on claims data
or on physiologic and laboratory values), and second, muscle loss assessed from pre-surgical computed
tomography (CT) scans (low skeletal muscle mass, known as sarcopenia, and fatty infiltration into muscle
indicative of reduced physical function, known as myosteatosis). In Aim 1, we will calculate these two e-frailty
metrics among a diverse population of over 41,000 abdominal surgical patients; characterize the overlap
between patients designated as frail by the two e-frailty metrics; and evaluate their associations with 30-day
readmission and other adverse surgical outcomes (30-day and 1-year mortality, complications, non-home
discharge, and length of stay >7 days). In Aim 2, we will compare the performance of e-frailty metrics for
predicting 30-day readmission and other adverse surgical outcomes to that of standard risk stratification tools
(acute and chronic illness severity metrics) already embedded in EHRs today using cross-validation and an
independent validation dataset of over 14,000 more recent abdominal surgeries. In Aim 3, we will examine
whether e-frailty metrics modify the benefits that patients derive from achieving postoperative targets -including
early and sustained mobilization- in one of the largest Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs in
the nation. We will examine e-frailty metrics as salient indicators of biologic age for predicting morbidity and
mortality. In sum, e-frailty metrics show great promise for identifying high-risk patients in the surgical domain,
but they need to be integrated within clinical workflows to be scalable and sustainable. This proposal will
compute standardized e-frailty metrics automatically derived from EHR data and provide new information
regarding the potential value of these e-frailty metrics for improving surgical care for older adults. This study
will also lay the groundwork for future prospective interventions integrating e-frailty metrics into clinical care to
improve risk stratification and counseling of patients considering surgery and enhance perioperative care for
frail surgical patients."

Over 100 million US adults have hypertension, the number one chronic disease risk factor in the world. The
United States Preventive Services Task Force and the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association blood pressure (BP) guidelines recommends measuring BP outside of the clinic for the diagnosis
and management of hypertension. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) involves self-measurement of BP
by the patient and is the most common method for assessing out-of-office BP in the US. The guideline
recommendations are based on high-quality observational studies in which out-of-office BP was typically
obtained at a single point and individuals with high out-of-office BP were observed to have higher rates of
cardiovascular outcomes and increased rates of all-cause mortality, regardless of office BP levels. Additionally,
clinical trials have demonstrated that HBPM reduces clinic BP over short 6-12 month time frames, especially
when combined with disease management programs. There are no studies evaluating the effectiveness of
HBPM in routine clinical practice in a diverse population from across the country. Additionally, there are a lack
of data on: a) whether use of HBPM reduces risk for clinical outcomes; b) the impact of HBPM on both short-
and long-term clinic BP, clinical inertia, and medication adherence in routine clinical practice; and c) how
clinicians and patients utilize HBPM. Over the last ~10 years, approximately 400,000 Veterans have measured
home BPs as part of the VA’s telehealth program. We propose to identify Veterans age 18-90 years with
uncontrolled clinic BP enrolled in HBPM programs and a cohort of Veterans not enrolled in HBPM programs.
We will link telehealth data to clinical and outcome data. The proposal will make use of the large number of
patients enrolled in the VA’s HBPM program and the variation in how the HBPM program is implemented
across VA sites. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of HBPM on major adverse cardiovascular events, non-
cancer mortality, and adverse events. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of HBPM on clinic BP, BP
medication intensification, and medication adherence. In Aim 3, we will determine facility-, provider-, and
patient-level factors associated with use of HBPM in routine practice. Results will establish a) the long-term
benefits of HBPM, b) the association between HBPM and clinical events, and c) the effects in important
subgroups. These findings will inform selection of patients for and the design of a much-needed randomized
controlled trial evaluating the effect of HBPM on clinical outcomes compared to office-based hypertension
management. Additionally, identifying factors associated with greater reductions in BP and greater number of
home BP values transmitted, such as case management programs, may identify barriers to adherence that can
be addressed and inform implementation strategies and the use of HBPM in clinical practice. The proposed
study will answer questions critically important to implementation of HBPM in routine clinical practice with the
ultimate goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension."

Alkylating agents in our environment from tobacco, pesticides, and produced during drinking water purification
cause DNA lesions. These DNA lesions can cause replication fork stalling and lead to DNA double-strand
breaks that are canonically repaired by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. The RAD51 protein
plays essential functions in the HR pathway and is regulated by proteins including the Shu complex (SWSAP1-
SWS1-PDS5B-SPIDR), BRCA2, RAD52, and CSB. Misregulation of RAD51 regulators leads to genome
instability and cancer. Recent studies from our lab and others identified novel additional roles of these proteins
in non-canonical repair during DNA lesion recognition, response to replication stress, and transcription coupled
repair of replication structures containing R-loops. Mechanistic insight from the yeast Shu complex determined
a role during abasic lesion recognition and RAD51-mediated bypass mechanisms during replication. Our work
shows that like the yeast Shu complex, the human Shu complex is sensitive to the prototype alkylating agent
MMS and depletion of Shu complex components SWSAP1 and SWS1 cause reduced RAD51 foci. Whether
the human Shu complex functions by a similar mechanism is unknown. Both RAD52 and Shu components
SWSAP1 and SWS1 function during replication restart by an unknown mechanism. RAD52 may use its
annealing functions during replication restart and R-loop resolution. The overall goal of this proposed research
is to determine how the human Shu complex functions at stalled replication forks to recognize abasic lesions
thus enabling either RAD51-dependent strand exchange or RAD52-dependent annealing repair activities. The
experiments proposed in this research program will be conducted in two phases. During the mentored K99
phase, I will determine how the Shu complex functions to recognize alkylation-induced lesions like abasic
lesions and modulate RAD51-dependent repair using training in cell biology, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and correlative optical tweezers-fluorescence microscopy (CTFM) techniques (Aim 1). During the mentored
phase the candidate will take advantage of co-mentoring, resources available at the University of Pittsburgh
and the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center for professional development to utilize these skills through research,
mentoring, data presentation, and writing opportunities. During the independent R00 phase of the research
program, technical skills obtained during the K99 phase will be applied to elucidate the role of Shu complex in
RAD52-mediated replication fork restart (Aim 2). Also, during the R00 phase I will extend these approaches
into a new area involving resolution of RNA-DNA hybrids by RAD52 protein complexes. These experiments will
provide me with the data required for an early independent publication and preliminary data for R-series grants.
Importantly, during the R00 phase the candidate will develop independence from their mentor and co-mentors
by focusing on the dynamic interplay between the Shu complex and RAD52 in response to replication stress."
10823601,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adipose dysfunction is a defining characteristic of metabolically unhealthy obesity. During obesity, excess
calories are stored in preexisting adipocytes. This cellular growth, otherwise known as adipocyte hypertrophy,
results in a pathological form of fat expansion that leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance. In
contrast, there is growing evidence indicating that fat expansion driven by an increase in adipocyte number
(hyperplastic growth) promotes metabolically healthy obesity. Our lab and others have recently shown that tilting
the balance in favor of hyperplastic fat expansion protects against maladaptive adipocyte hypertrophy and
obesity-induced metabolic disease. However, the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate
hyperplastic fat expansion remain unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, our lab has pioneered the
combined use of stable isotope tracing and quantitative mass spectrometry to precisely measure in vivo
adipogenesis, the process that drives hyperplasia through the differentiation of adipocyte progenitors into new
adipocytes, during various stages of development. Using this novel technique, we have characterized a
“hyperplastic-to-hypertrophic” adipose growth switch in humans and mice during which adipogenesis
precipitously declines. Differential expression analysis shows that this growth switch is accompanied by a stark
downregulation in the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2, IGF2) in both subcutaneous adipose tissue
and adipocyte progenitors (APs). Follow-up studies in ex vivo primary APs revealed that IGF2 promoted
adipogenesis and cell cycle gene expression, leading us to hypothesize that IGF2 stimulates AP proliferation,
enhances adipogenesis, and is capable of promoting hyperplastic fat expansion. This proposal will test this
hypothesis through the following Aims: (1) Determine whether IGF2 regulates adipocyte progenitor (AP)
proliferation ex vivo. We will use stable isotope tracing, EdU flow cytometry assays, and MTT cellular
proliferation assays to assess whether recombinant IGF2 treatment enhances proliferation of ex vivo primary
APs in basal conditions and during adipogenic differentiation, while also testing the modifying effect of cell cycle
inhibition. (2) Determine whether IGF2 regulates adipogenesis and fat expansion in vivo. We will use mouse
models of AP-specific IGF2 loss-of-function (AP-IGF2LOF) and gain-of-function (AP-IGF2GOF) to test whether IGF2
regulates hyperplastic fat expansion in vivo during both early postnatal development and in the context of high
fat diet-induced obesity. The results of this proposal will provide a better understanding of whether restoring
IGF2 action in adipocyte progenitors is a viable strategy for reprogramming hyperplastic fat growth and treating
obesity-induced metabolic disease. Completion of this proposal’s aims will also provide excellent training that is
consistent with my goal of a career as a cardiologist and physician scientist whose work focuses on the metabolic
underpinnings of cardiovascular disease with an eye towards therapeutic intervention."

The Sixteenth and Seventeenth International Symposia on Neurobiology & Neuroendocrinology
Aging will be held in Bregenz, Austria July 12-16, 2024, and in July 2026. The purpose of these
meetings is to bring together a group of investigators who made recent advances in the study of
mechanisms of aging, with particular emphasis on CNS aging, neuroprotection, and
neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, the endocrine system and metabolic dysfunction tie many
additional aging research areas together (genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction,
senescence, stem cell exhaustion, epigenetic changes, deregulated nutrient sensing,
inflammation). We are directly addressing several of these topics in this Symposium, many in
the context of neurobiology and endocrinology. Prominent among the scheduled lectures are the
continued search for mechanisms of age-related disease, increasing appreciation of concomitant
involvement of multiple interacting mechanisms, and attempts to evaluate their relative
importance. Recent studies increased appreciation of mediators of potential aging delay, and
modulation of health and disease including dietary interventions, drug interventions and
hormone deficiency. As the field continues to search for and study regenerative mechanisms,
talks devoted to reprogramming of aged tissue and rejuvenation are included. Several lectures
will integrate information in neurobiology with aging, redox state, plasticity, and mitochondrial
dynamics. Progressive changes in the age profile of human populations underlies enormous
significance of age-related neurodegenerative disease and cognitive impairment. The latest
breakthroughs in our understanding of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Down's, and ALS disease will
be covered in several lectures, further strengthening this link. Each of these topics will be
covered by investigators that recently made major advances in the corresponding areas of
investigation. We purposely include a wide range of topics and assemble a group of scientists
that may not normally attend the same meeting. The format of the meeting is modeled after
Gordon Research Conferences and encourages formal and informal discussions of the science
presented. Proceedings will be published as a special issue of Geroscience. We have always
strongly encouraged the participation of early-stage investigators, including graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows, and promoted diversity amongst our participants. This proposal seeks
funds for providing support to 16 US participants who are in training or are in new faculty
positions and who are planning to present their findings in either an oral or poster session. We
are also seeking partial support for the expenses of 7 invited speakers from the United States."
10823694,"Project Summary:
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that leads to selective destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic b
cells and lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin supplementation. In the United States, type 1 diabetes
affects 1.84 million people, increased 21% in diagnosis between 2001 and 2009, and is projected to affect 5
million people by 2050. Allogeneic b cell replacement through intrahepatic islet transplantation leads to improved
metabolic control, quality of life, and decreased levels of long-term complications in patients with type 1 diabetes
compared to exogenous insulin supplementation. This is largely due to the capability of transplanted islets to re-
establish physiological glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Recent clinical advances in islet transplantation
have increased the hope of the millions of patients with type 1 diabetes for a widely available cure. However, all
this progress notwithstanding, the need for chronic systemic immunosuppression to prevent allorejection and
recurrence of autoimmunity is still restricting the applicability of b cell replacement procedures only to the most
severe cases of type 1 diabetes due to the multitude of unavoidable side effects.
Islet immunoisolation through encapsulation with permselective biomaterials is a viable option to allow safer and
more widely applicable b cell replacement for patients with type 1 diabetes. The main challenges associated with
transplantation of encapsulated islets are (1) their large capsule size, which delays glucose sensing and insulin
release and results in an inability to achieve the same level of metabolic control as that provided by
unencapsulated islets, and (2) their large graft volumes, which prevent transplantation in retrievable, confined,
and well-vascularized sites. We developed an innovative microencapsulation platform that achieves conformal
coating of islets, including ones derived from stem cells, within biocompatible, stable, and clinically applicable
hydrogels that are only 10-20 µm thick. This conformal coating addresses limitations of traditional islet
encapsulation platforms and safety as demonstrated in non-human primate models of type 1 diabetes. However,
conformally coated grafts are still hindered by alloreactive T cell activation by alloantigen shedding through
permeable hydrogel capsules and can benefit from localized immunomodulatory therapies to improve their
performance for clinical translation. Thus, we propose to co-transplant them with our innovative nanomaterial
platform to achieve targeted and sustained release of drugs that decrease alloreactive T cell activation in the
site of transplantation (aim 1). As an alternative and innovative approach, we also propose to integrate islet
conformal coating with co-delivery of tolerogenic stromal cells that can present shed alloantigens to specific T
cells, thereby inducing anergy and deletion in the transplant site (aim 2). We will test these combination therapies
in murine and rat islet allograft models of type 1 diabetes in clinically applicable confined sites, uniquely enabled
by the small volumes of conformal coated grafts in aims 1 and 2. In aim 3, we will test the most promising
immunomodulatory approach in non-human primate islet allograft models and with human islets in a humanized
mouse model."
10823842,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
 Bacterial cancer therapy has existed since Dr. William Coley employed deliberate
bacterial infection of tumors over a century ago in the first known example of cancer
immunotherapy. Bacteria are genetically tractable self-replicating therapeutics which can be
tuned to deliver various payloads, modify specificity, and decrease side effects. Additionally,
intravenously administered bacteria (particularly Escherichia and Salmonella) are intrinsically
capable of selectively colonizing tumor tissue in mouse models, showing reduced colonization
with rapid clearance from other organs. These properties make bacteria attractive potential
vehicles for delivering cancer therapy. However, early clinical trials have been stymied by low
colonization rates in human patients. Though much work has been done to develop therapeutic
payloads for bacterial delivery, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms by which
bacteria colonize tumors and thereby deliver these payloads. At present, there is little pre-
existing literature using comprehensive and unbiased screens to identify pathways for tumor-
specific bacteria colonization. These screens are urgently needed to not only identify essential
pathways for tumor colonization by bacteria, but also to identify pathways which may be
manipulated to increase tumor-specific colonization by bacteria. This information can be
leveraged both to identify pathways essential for tumor colonization and to develop strains with
increased tumor specificity. By identifying these genes, this project aims to understand the
mechanisms by which E. coli specifically migrate to and grow within tumors and identify targets
which can be manipulated to tune colonization efficiency and specificity. Ultimately, this work
will advance the production of living medicines as cancer therapy. The strong community of
immunologists, synthetic biologists, and bioinformaticians supervising the trainee's work will
support this fellowship. Throughout the award, the trainee will benefit from the outstanding
training environment at Columbia in both research and clinical components, as well as the
integration of the two distinct disciplines in training physician scientists, to develop fundamental
skills for becoming an independent physician investigator."
10936529,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic relapsing disease that leads to neuroadaptations in energy homeostasis
after repeated drug exposure. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment that lowers the risk of relapse in
CUD. Reported annual deaths involving cocaine have nearly quintupled in the United States from 4,939 in 2013
to 24,538 in 2021, making this a major public health concern. Despite recent scientific advances elucidating
critical neuronal circuitry and biological conditions that drive cocaine-seeking behaviors, the development of
interventions to disrupt the repeating cycle of addiction has proved more difficult. The operant behavioral model
of drug self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement emulates cue priming and drug craving in
patients in recovery experiencing settings, cues, or memories associated with past drug use. Craving and relapse
of cocaine seeking is driven by glutamatergic (Glu) neurotransmission in the NAcC, observed in both humans
and animal models. Clinically, susceptibility to cocaine relapse is notably higher in female patients with reports
of stronger craving to cocaine-paired cues. This significant sex difference, also reflected in animal models of
CUD, represents an obstacle in treatment development that yields therapeutic benefit across sexes. Our lab has
demonstrated that metformin (MET), an FDA-approved Type II Diabetes (T2D) treatment, has pre-clinical
promise in reducing cue-induced cocaine reinstatement after a period of withdrawal when administered
intracranially in both female and male rats. My own preliminary data shows that systemic metformin reduces the
conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine in male rats. In T2D, MET improves glucose management in part
through activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), which when phosphorylated,
restores the intracellular ratio of AMP to ATP in response to environmental stressors. AMPK is decreased in the
nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) after chronic exposure to cocaine, with MET-induced increases in AMPK
activity thus providing a promising putative mechanism of action. Still, it remains unknown how oral MET is
biodistributed to the NAcC and how it may impact critical Glu circuitry underlying cocaine relapse events. This
study will explore the therapeutic potential of MET by defining central pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
of oral MET in the NAcC. This proposal tests the hypotheses that oral administration of MET will: 1) have a more
robust effect in reducing cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior after self-administration in male rats as
compared to female rats, 2) reduce cue-induced reinstatement via activation of AMPK, and 3) augment Glu
neurotransmission in the NAcC reducing the signal to noise of cue-associated glutamate transmission as
measured by in vivo fiber photometry. The goal of the proposed work is to provide significant evidence that
supports the potential repurposing of MET as a treatment for CUD."
11016929,"This NRSA F31 diversity proposal for Ms. Deborah Onakomaiya aims to provide mentorship, training, and
advance research experiences to prepare Ms. Onakomaiya for an independent research career in
implementation science and health disparities research. The research portion of this proposal aims to conduct a
mixed-methods study, informed by the theoretical framework of acceptability (TFA), to develop a
multidimensional understanding of the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs
Screening (AHC-HRSN) screening tool among Black patients who receive care at NYU Langone Health
(NYULH). Recent studies suggest major gaps in how best to identify patients’ health-related social needs
(HRSNs) and offer assistance in a respectful way that upholds patient trust. The few studies that explored the
acceptability of HRSN tools largely focused on physician and caregiver perspectives and do not define
acceptability of HRSN or the drivers for acceptability of HRSN. To date, no study has utilized a theory-driven
approach to systematically assess the acceptability of HRSN screening tools among Black patients, who are
most likely to experience a high burden of HRSN. An essential first step or precursor in successfully addressing
HRSN is to examine the acceptability of screening tools among those who will be screened (e.g. patients).
Additionally, with the 2024 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations mandates to increase HRSN screening, there is a need for studies that demonstrate
the acceptability of HRSN tools. TFA is well positioned to capture nuanced factors that drive patient acceptability.
If an intervention, practice, or treatment is considered acceptable, patients are more likely to adhere to the
recommendations and benefit from improved clinical outcomes. Also the training plan for this proposal is
composed of mentored research, didactic and informal training, experiential learning and professional
development activities. The applicant will be supported by several resources at NYULH and by a strong
mentorship team with expertise in health services research, implementation science, health disparities research
and mixed-methods research. The research-training plan will allow Ms. Onakomaiya to prepare for a research
career by a) Learning and applying rigorous implementation and psychometric methods; b) developing expertise
in health services and health disparities research; and c) generating and disseminating scientific knowledge to
inform public health practice. This study covers a high priority area for NIMHD and will be one of the first in the
U.S. to examine the proposed project in an integrated health system like NYULH . As this project will leverage
NYULH’s infrastructure which is primed to implement system-wide screening for HSRNs among its patient
population. This project will support NIMHDs goals to promote research to understand and to improve the health
of racial/ethnic minorities (NIMHD- goal 1) and second, create and improve scientific methods, metrics,
measures, and tools that support health disparities research (NIMHD-goal 4)."
10826263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social stability for many species is maintained via social hierarchies, wherein displaying subordinate behavior to
higher ranking individuals is key. A subordinate social rank influences the brain and behavior by altering neural
circuitry and the production and signaling of neuromodulators, such as steroid hormones and neurotransmitters.
For example, androgens tend to be negatively correlated with a subordinate social rank, while the neural
expression of the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor is positively associated with subordinate behavior. Although
clear relationships have been established between a subordinate social status, the brain, and behavior, the
molecular and neural mechanisms regulating these changes are not known. A major challenge in elucidating
these mechanisms is that social rank is often tied to both physiological and behavioral traits, making it difficult to
distinguish the effects of neuromodulators (e.g., androgens and serotonin) on individual traits associated with
social subordination. Thus, the use of novel model organisms, in which distinct traits of subordinate social status
can be studied in isolation, is necessary to enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of
subordination. The proposed work will use state-of-the-art sequencing and genome editing technologies to
identify genes and cell types in the brain that govern subordinate social status in the African cichlid fish
Astatotilapia burtoni. A. burtoni is a highly social species in which males display subordinate or dominant
behavior based on social status. Recent work showed that androgen receptor (AR) mutant males generated via
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing do not exhibit distinct traits of dominant social rank. For example, ARα mutants do
not perform dominant behaviors (mating or aggression), whereas ARβ mutants lack bright coloration and show
reduced testes growth, making these fish an excellent tool for taxing the molecular and neural systems controlling
distinct aspects of subordinate social status. In Specific Aim 1, I will identify cell types and their genetic signatures
in the hypothalamus of dominant WT males and subordinate WT and AR mutant males using single-nucleus
RNA sequencing. In Specific Aim 2, I will determine the role of androgens in regulating subordinate social status
by measuring physiological and behavioral traits of social rank in subordinate AR mutants. Finally, in Specific
Aim 3, I will generate novel mutant A. burtoni lacking the 5-HT1Aβ receptor using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to
assess the role of serotoninergic signaling in governing social subordination. Based on preliminary data showing
that AR and AR mutants display distinct physiological responses to social suppression, I predict these mutants
will have cell type-specific gene expression patterns that mirror different aspects of subordination. Moreover,
given the known relationship between androgen and serotoninergic signaling, I expect to observe contrasting
deficits in physiological and behavioral traits of subordination in AR and 5-HT1Aβ mutants that reveal the roles of
these systems in controlling subordinate social status. Collectively, these studies will yield important insights into
the basic neural and molecular mechanisms that regulate subordination in social animals, including humans."
10826264,"Minoritized communities have the highest rates of violence exposure. However, those affected remain
underdiagnosed and untreated for resulting trauma symptoms as severe as suicidal thoughts and behaviors
(STBs) and as consequential as reactive aggression and violence perpetration. 1,2 Importantly, Black and
minoritized youth are more likely to experience traumatic events and be diagnosed with disruptive behavior
disorders,3-5 which perpetuates past criminal stereotypes that persist in the public psyche such as the
Superpredator myth 6,7 and leads to further violence exposure through over-surveillance and incarceration.8,9
Rather than effective mental healthcare access, minoritized youth are being exposed and re-exposed to cycles
of violence.
 The leading intervention for aggression and violence perpetration among youth in the US has been
incarceration. 8 There persists a perverse logic that incapacitation, which removes “would-be offenders” from
classrooms and neighborhoods, leads to safer communities; yet increased incarceration rates have not
lowered crime rates nationwide as violent crimes have actually increased. 7,8 Related, the past 50 years of
randomized control trials (RCTs) testing interventions for STBs revealed that efficacy has not improved,
treatment effect sizes are small, and there is no difference in efficacy among interventions.12 In short,
interventions aimed at suicide prevention and violence reduction have fallen short. A major factor for why these
interventions don’t show widespread success may be that violence reduction efforts have largely been limited
to the study of aggression and STBs as phenomena present in discrete groups, yet these behaviors often
co-occur to yield more severe clinical presentations. Although critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, little
is known about potential cognitive mechanisms that can help describe the function of self/other-directed
violence. The current proposal is focused on systematically describing the function of self-directed
suicidal and other-direct violent aggression using behavioral models of choice behavior and qualitative
interviews. An understanding of the constraints and preferences of individuals directly impacts treatment
engagement and effectiveness—clinical decision-making is therefore critical.14 Focus on people from
minoritized communities and their developmental risk factors may help mitigate race-based stress disparities in
healthcare and help identify systemic needs for social services that reduce barriers to accessing treatment.22-25
 This study has three main objectives: (1) to test the link between violence exposure and decision
making (2) to test the link between decision-making and self/other-directed violence among violence-exposed
youth; (3) to conduct a detailed diagnostic assessment with qualitative interviews exploring beliefs about the
function of STBs and violence perpetration among youth identified through algorithms applied to electronic
health records."

Certain viruses in the picornaviridae family, specifically enterovirus-D68 (EV68), have emerged as global health
concerns over the last decade with severe symptomatic infections with EV68 able to result in long lasting
neurological deficits and death. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved drugs for any
non-polio enterovirus, highlighting the need to develop strategies against these lethal enteroviral strains. One
particularly attractive class of potential drugs are small molecules inhibitors, which can act as direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) inhibitors towards the conserved active site of EV68 3C protease. This main viral protease is a
cysteine protease conserved in the 3C family, responsible for cleaving eight sites along the viral polyprotein,
which is essential for viral propagation. DAAs designed to target 3C proteases can potentially achieve robust
inhibition across enterovirus species. However, as drug resistance in viruses can be prevalent, it is paramount
to design inhibitors less susceptible to resistance mutations. It was demonstrated previously in the Schiffer Lab
that when bound to protease, viral substrates occupy a conserved three-dimensional volume called the substrate
envelope. It was also demonstrated that inhibitors that extend beyond the substrate envelope are more
susceptible to drug resistance mutations. By utilizing the substrate envelope and cocrystal structures of the
proteases, DAAs designed to fit within the three-dimensional consensus volume as naturally occurring substrates
will interact primarily with functionally important residues and be less susceptible to drug resistance mutations.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cocrystallization of EV68 3C protease with its natural substrates
will enable the calculation of the substrate envelope to inform on substrate specificity, which will also aid in the
design of robust pan-3C-protease inhibitors. In Aim 1, I will determine the cocrystal structures of EV68 3C
protease bound to viral substrates. I will then use these structures to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
substrate specificity for EV68 3C protease and calculate the substrate envelope. These data will aid in small-
molecule design to create DAAs with improved resilience to mutations that can confer drug resistance. In Aim 2,
I will design and test novel DAAs that target EV68 3C protease. I will first characterize previously designed
inhibitors for other 3C and 3C-like proteases with the substrate envelope to establish a starting compound based
on potency. Inhibitors based on the scaffold will be designed, synthesized, and tested in a FRET-based enzyme
inhibition assay. Crystallization of novel potent compounds with EV68 3C and their characterization within the
substrate envelope will assess inhibitors’ susceptibility to drug resistance mutations. Overall, this study aims to
develop a robust, novel compounds with resistance-thwarting protease inhibition against the emerging pathogen
that is EV68."

Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacterium and opportunistic
pathogen. C. difficile infection (CDI) is associated with hospital antibiotic use and can cause severe diarrhea,
pseudomembranous colitis, and death. The primary causative agents of CDI symptoms are the secreted toxins
TcdA and TcdB, which are regulated by the flgB operon through sigma factor sigma-D. The bacterial
transcription termination factor Rho regulates the flgB operon by repressing transcription only when an
invertible genetic “switch” mapping to the flgB transcript 5’ UTR is in the “off” orientation. Genetic deletion of
Rho functionality restores flgB expression when the switch is oriented off. Loss of Rho functionality in C.
difficile results in growth, sporulation, and virulence defects independent of loss of regulation at the flgB
operon, indicating additional Rho-dependent regulation of C. difficile virulence factors. Efforts to identify a Rho
recognition sequence in C. difficile, including at the flagellar switch, based on a multi-organism consensus
have been unsuccessful, possibly due to the unusually GC-poor C. difficile genome (~29%). Rho-dependent
regulation is also likely to be highly influenced by interactions with termination/antitermination factors NusA and
NusG. Nus factors are essential for C. difficile growth but their influence on Rho-dependent termination and
effect on the virulence factors expression is unknown. I hypothesize that Rho is a key factor in C. difficile
pathogenesis through direct regulation of critical virulence genes in addition to the flagellar operon, and that
this regulation is dependent on, or attenuated by, Nus factors on a gene-by-gene basis. The objective of this
proposal is to identify and annotate Rho, NusA, and NusG dependent terminators in C. difficile to identify key
Rho and Nus factor regulated growth, sporulation, and virulence genes for further study, and determine a
predictive rut site sequence in C. difficile. I will compare RNA-seq and Term-seq data between the Rho-null
and control C. difficile strains to identify Rho dependent terminators and verify these sites in vitro. I will use
CRISPRi to generate NusA and NusG dependent transcript-depleted strains for Term-seq analysis. Completion
of this study will improve our understanding of C. difficile virulence regulation, provide further annotation of the
C. difficile transcriptome, and may reveal new potential targets for developing therapeutics to combat CDI. Dr.
Tamayo is a leader in the field of C. difficile biology and her expertise in genetic approaches complements my
graduate training in biochemical techniques. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the
Department of Microbiology and Immunology both contribute to a productive, collegial research environment
with numerous opportunities for career development."
10825797,"Project Summary and Abstract:
The United States currently faces an epidemic of diseases related to an inability to maintain a healthy body
weight (weight homeostasis, WH). The influence of chronic stress on dysregulated WH is becoming
increasingly appreciated. Dysregulated WH and chronic stress are correlated to both poorer quality of life and
increased annual health care costs. Consequently, there is a need to understand the basis for which stress
modulates WH. While both processes are controlled by the central nervous system (CNS), investigations are
challenged by both the difficulty of modeling stress in a human-relevant context, and a heavy focus on the
hypothalamic control of WH. Therefore, this proposal will focus on the interaction between the 1) CNS
“signals” of stress, namely Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF) and its receptors, and 2) Bed Nucleus of the
Stria Terminalis (BNST), a structure both responsible for stress processing, and recently shown to control WH.
Intriguingly, my preliminary loss-of-function studies have strongly suggested that neurons expressing CRF
Receptor 1 (CRFR1) in the BNST (BNSTCRFR1) are necessary for maintenance of WH. The main objective of this
proposal is to examine the role of BNSTCRFR1in the control of WH. My central hypothesis is that CRF input and
signaling into BNSTCRFR1 is necessary to maintain WH via control of animal metabolism and behavior. Using
viral, genetic, molecular and metabolic methodologies, I will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In
Aim 1, I will determine the peripheral mechanism of weight loss in BNSTCRFR1 loss of function. Then, in Aim
2, I will determine if CRF-specific signaling is the central mechanism by which BNSTCRFR1 control WH. Lastly,
in Aim 3, I will explore BNSTCRFR1 inputs, especially those from CRF neurons.
These studies are novel and innovative. They 1) elaborate on the circuitry, signaling, and functionality of a
poorly characterized population within the BNST and 2) model stress using evolutionarily conserved peptides
(e.g., CRF, CRFR1), facilitating the translation of findings into humans. Further, given the millions of
Americans with both dysregulation of weight homeostasis and stress, these studies are significant. 1) elaborate
on our mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of weight homeostasis control, and 2) provide avenues
for the generation of novel therapeutics that may be helpful in curbing weight dysregulation and stress. These
investigations will develop my skillset as an independent physician-scientist interested in studying the neural
mechanisms of homeostatic control, using stress and WH as framework. With the mentorship of my sponsor
and co-sponsor, Drs. Ben Arenkiel and Qingchun Tong, I will become exemplary in the use of mouse models,
viruses, and imaging to interrogate the nervous system. Further, within the resource rich Baylor College of
Medicine and Jan and Dan Duncan Neurologic Research Institute, I will have the ability to build rich networks
of collaborations and perform sophisticated and significant experiments."
10825795,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The sensory thalamus serves as a hub for incoming information encoding different features of the
outside world. This information is parsed and modified as it is transmitted to the cortex. In the visual
thalamus (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus), retinal ganglion cell axons converge onto proximal
dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, forming clusters of boutons that stud the dendrites. Many of
these bouton clusters are ensheathed by astrocytes along with synaptic terminals from
neuromodulatory projections and inhibitory dendrodendritic presynaptic terminals. Collectively, this
synaptic motif is called the glomerulus, described beautifully by electron microscopy in many thalamic
nuclei and across many species. While the glomerulus is quite striking, the functional relevance of
this structural motif is still debated.
To address this critical question, here, we propose to establish and characterize mice in which the
glomerular astrocytic sheath is disrupted by genetic deletion of a member of the family of fibroblast
growth factor receptors. Our preliminary data shows that deletion of this receptor from astrocytes
results in reduced astrocytic sheaths around clusters of retinal ganglion cell boutons and aberrant
retinogeniculate functional refinement. We will extend these findings to elucidate the role of this
receptor in the development of astrocytic morphology, glomerular structure and the elimination and
strengthening of retinogeniculate synapses in the visual thalamus. We will also examine whether and
how defects in astrocytic ensheathment of the glomerulus may contribute to aberrant retinogeniculate
synapse refinement. Finally, we will take advantage of the disrupted glomerular ensheathment in
mutant mice to test the hypothesis that the glomerular structure enhances crosstalk between
synapses within the astrocytic sheath that is mediated by glutamate and GABA spillover.
If these proposed experiments are successful, results from these studies will advance our
understanding of how information is organized in the thalamus and the functional sequela of
disruption of this organization."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is categorized as a progressive weakening and dilation of the aortic wall
resulting in chronic failure of the aortic wall and catastrophic rupture with mortality rates >80% resulting in the
death of ~30,000 Americans and ~500,000 people worldwide. Known risk factors for AAA include tobacco use,
hypertension, male gender, and cardiovascular disease, however, the underlying mechanisms of this disease
are still poorly understood. Moreover, little progress has been made in identification of druggable targets to
reduce AAA burden creating a void in patient care. Pharmaceuticals (statins, ACE inhibitors) against CVDs have
had limited success in AAA patients and the only treatment option is invasive surgical intervention, pursued only
when the risk of aneurysm rupture outweighs the risk of surgery. Recent evidence has emerged demonstrating
that resident gut microbes in the human intestine can promote several cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, the
meta-organismal produced metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has repeatedly been linked to numerous
cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies. Our previous work demonstrates that TMAO is associated with AAA
status in two case/control cohorts. Furthermore, dietary choline increases circulating TMAO in a gut microbiome
dependent manner to enhance AAA pathogenesis in murine models. The putative receptor for TMAO is the
endoplasmic protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), known as an initiator of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. PERK signaling temporally regulates
autophagy, apoptosis, mitochondrial-ER contact points (MERCs), and mitochondrial function, processes that are
all affiliated with AAA pathogenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrates that both in vivo choline-induced TMAO
and ex vivo application of TMAO result in PERK-dependent ER-stress. Additionally, TMAO treatment induces
loss of VSMC phenotype, increases apoptosis, and blunts autophagy in a PERK-dependent manner. Yet, the
contribution of TMAO-mediated PERK activation in VSMCs to AAA initiation and progression remains uncertain.
Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to determine how the gut microbiome-derived metabolite TMAO
contributes to the initiation and progression of AAA through its putative binding target PERK. Our two specific
aims will (1) define the role of VSMC-specific PERK in TMAO-augmented AAA; and (2) determine the PERK-
dependent detrimental mechanisms in VSMCs. Successful completion of this F32 research proposal will
increase our understanding of the of the mechanisms by which TMAO-mediated PERK signaling exacerbates
AAA initiation and progression in order to identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of
AAA in patients. The experience gained from this proposal under the mentorship of Dr. Owens and my advisory
committee at the University of Cincinnati will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator."
10826907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer-associated cachexia is a debilitated syndrome that has a dramatic impact on the quality of life and
outcome of patients. Cancer cachexia occurs with a remarkably high incidence in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Cancer cachexia is characterized by the progressive depletion of muscle
skeletal mass, which often culminates in general organ dysfunction and patient death. Therefore, a deeper
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer cachexia would ultimately lead to the identification of
innovative therapeutics to improve the management of muscle wasting in cancer patients.
 Our recent studies have shown that pancreas-specific ablation of the Tgif1 gene in a KrasG12D background
led to a dramatic acceleration of PDAC in mice. Quite intriguingly, despite having this severe PDAC phenotype,
these mice do not display any prominent sign of cancer cachexia, such as progressive weight loss and decreased
muscle mass and function. This contrasts with our previous study using two different mouse models of human
PDAC, KPC (KrasG12D and heterozygous deletion of Trp53) and KICLuc (KrasG12D and homozygous deletion of
p16Ink4a), which consistently manifest severe cancer cachexia during PDAC progression. These findings hint
at the possibility that TGIF1 might function in PDAC cells to initiate events that culminate in muscle cachexia. In
efforts to probe this possibility, we generated a new mouse model that allows for conditional overexpression of
Tgif1, and found that enforcing TGIF1 expression in the pancreatic epithelium was sufficient to induce muscle
cachexia. Subsequent mechanistic experiments revealed an ability of TGIF1 to induce expression of FN14,
which functions as a transmembrane receptor in cancer cells to drive inflammation leading to muscle cachexia.
Enforced TGIF1 expression also induced the expression of the membrane-bound form of transforming growth
factor alpha (TGFa), whose overexpression in the pancreas also drives an inflammatory phenotype similar to
what we observed in mice with conditional overexpression of TGIF1. Inspired by these intriguing findings, we
created a new bispecific antibody (Bis-14a) to simultaneously neutralize the pro-cachectic activities of FN14 and
TGFa. This tremendous progress prompted us to design a variety of innovative genetic and antibody-based
pharmacological approaches to provide irrefutable proof-of-principle that targeting FN14 and TGFa downstream
of TGIF1 could offer innovative therapeutic strategies to curb cancer cachexia. Overarching specific aims are:
 Specific Aim 1: Expand role and translational potential of TGIF1 in PDAC-driven muscle cachexia
 Specific Aim 2) Explore the mechanisms by which TGIF1 facilitates PDAC-driven muscle cachexia
 Specific Aim 3) Test the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal and bispecific antibodies targeting
 FN14 and TGFa signaling in PDAC-mediated muscle cachexia
 As such, completion of this highly innovative proposal will likely culminate in a paradigm shift in our
understanding and treatment of this lethal wasting syndrome."

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability globally. Despite
lowering in mortality rates, residual risk of events caused by atherosclerosis are high. High
Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] Levels contribute to residual risk as they increase cardiovascular risk,
despite optimal lipid lowering therapy. Lp(a) is an atherogenic, proinflammatory, and
prothrombotic lipoprotein particle. There are ethnic differences that differentiate levels, with
Blacks and Hispanics having higher Lp(a) levels when compared to Whites. These ethnic
differences are supported by the fact that Lp(a) levels are mostly genetically regulated, with
90% of its variance controlled by the LPA gene. A comprehensive map of single-base
polymorphisms (SNP) in the hypervariable LPA Kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) copy number variation
region was published in 2019. Some of these SNP are unique to specific ethnic populations and
are linked to high and low Lp(a) levels. The latter provides a tool to interrogate the effect of SNP
on Lp(a) particle levels, particle composition and function. The current proposal utilizes a multi-
ethnic cohort at Columbia University Medical Center, where unique LPA KIV-2 variants are
identified. Using advanced lipidomic, proteomic and fluxomic technologies, we will characterize
the circulating Lp(a) particle of high frequency SNP expressed in Blacks which may be link to
their higher levels of Lp(a) compared to Hispanics and Whites. Lp(a) levels have been difficult
to alter, but newly approved and developing treatments targeting the apo(a) component of Lp(a)
lower its plasma concentrations significantly. Therefore, additional knowledge of the disease
causing “Lp(a)” particle is a need in the field as not everyone with high Lp(a) levels develops
disease."

 Riboswitches are regulatory RNA structures that control gene expression by binding to a small
molecule and changing conformation, allowing organisms to rapidly respond to changes in their metabolic
environments. They are prevalent in bacteria, but in over 20 years of study, only one eukaryotic riboswitch has
been found. It has long been postulated that there are more, but the lack of high-throughput screening assays
and in silico detection algorithms has limited discovery. To address these challenges, the Rutter lab has
developed a high-throughput approach combining dimethyl sulfate (DMS) structure probing and MIDAS (mass
spectrometry integrated with equilibrium dialysis for the discovery of allostery systematically) to screen for
novel eukaryotic riboswitches. A preliminary screen of HEK293 mRNA resulted in eight novel interactions in
the 5’UTR regions of various transcripts. The overarching objective of this proposal is to investigate the
regulatory abilities of these interactions and their downstream metabolic consequences in vivo. One of these,
COX7B, is a subunit of complex IV (CIV) in the electron transport chain (ETC) and bound to cyclic AMP
(cAMP) as a putative ligand. cAMP is known to stimulate respiration, but an obvious regulatory connection
between cAMP and COX7B is unknown. Other subunits of CIV are known to regulate respiration through
phosphorylation and substrate sensing, but COX7B’s function is yet to be defined. However, recent literature
places it at the interface of complex I (CI) and CIV in supercomplex formation. We propose that COX7B’s
5’UTR is a novel riboswitch that impacts respiration through regulating supercomplex formation. Aim 1
will investigate the binding event using isothermal titration calorimetry, DMS structure probing, and reporter
assays. Aim 2 will characterize COX7B’s role in CIV, testing for supercomplex formation, respiration, and CI
and CIII activity via blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE), seahorse assays, and enzymatic assays in wild-type,
COX7B knock out (KO) and overexpression (OE) cell lines. Aim 3 will then define the metabolic impact of
COX7B mRNA interactions with cAMP in vivo. Mutations in the 5’UTR of COX7B will be introduced and
supercomplex formation, respiration, and complex activity in response to elevated cAMP levels will be
assessed as described. These data will highlight novel regulatory pathways for respiration and introduce a new
field of gene regulation to be explored. The Rutter Lab is the first to develop a high-throughput platform for
studying novel RNA-metabolite interactions and has a dedicated team devoted to studying novel riboswitches.
In addition, the University of Utah hosts a community of renowned scientists studying metabolism and RNA
biochemistry such as my sponsor, Dr. Jared Rutter, and co-sponsor, Dr. Ming Hammond. Finally, this project
contains a detailed training plan for developing multidisciplinary research and professional skills that will enable
me to become a successful, independent academic scientist."

Payment to providers and plans in Medicare has far-reaching implications for the health of the elderly and
disabled. The fee-for-service basis for payment has been rightly criticized for incentivizing excessive and
potentially harmful provision of care and for interfering with the production of health by linking reimbursement
to specific inputs. To establish greater flexibility and accountability, Medicare has increasingly transferred
financial risk to entities that can manage care—first to private plans in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program
and more recently to providers directly in alternative payment models (APMs) in traditional Medicare (TM). In
both models, additional payment adjustments are tied to performance on quality measures. These approaches
to integrating the financing and delivery of care create opportunities to improve patient care, but empirical
study has been challenging. Evidence on the merits of the MA program and the relative performance of MA
and APMs has been largely observational and limited in analysis of patient experiences and health outcomes.
In addition, risk contracting relies heavily on risk adjustment to profile plan or provider performance and to align
resources with the needs of patient populations, but the adequacy of risk adjustment has not been well
described. This project will make substantial contributions by leveraging natural experiments and new data to
understand plan and provider responses to payment incentives and their implications for patients and payment
system design. The project includes three aims. First, we will use natural experiments to compare performance
between MA and TM and different variants of each system. Sources of quasi-randomization to MA vs. TM will
include differences across state and county borders in MA exposure and transitions from Medicaid to dual
eligibility at age 65 in areas of high or low MA exposure. We will explore effect heterogeneity based on
geographic variation in the configuration of MA (e.g., by plan type) and TM (e.g., by APM activity). Second, we
will assess the marginal value of post-acute care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and effects of incentives to
alter post-acute length of stay on patient outcomes in different payment models, including TM, MA, and APMs.
Post-acute care is an area of intense activity in MA and APMs that offers insights into provider agency.
Approaches will make use of discontinuities in SNF reimbursement and coinsurance related to length of stay
and natural randomization of patients to physical therapists in hospitals. Third, we will determine the extent to
which risk-adjusted MA-TM differences in outcomes reflect performance differences vs. residual risk selection
and assess the adequacy of risk-adjustment methods. We will use strategies from our first aim to compare MA-
TM performance differences in self-sorted vs. quasi-randomized populations. Findings will characterize the
prospects for value-enhancing competition or unintended consequences from prospective payment systems
and will have important implications for the validity of quality scores. Thus, the project will provide foundational
evidence and insights for improving health through payment systems and performance monitoring."
10832528,"Project Summary/Abstract
Compared to traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans have more flexibility in benefit
structure, network contracting, and ability to deliver coordinated and integrated care. In addition to these
opportunities for potentially improving patient care, the MA program has established a rebate mechanism for
passing through efficiencies to enrollees in the form of enhanced benefits. MA may therefore offer greater
value to Medicare and its beneficiaries than TM. However, MA plans also engage in costly “gaming” of the risk-
adjustment system without improving performance that adds to government expense. The proposed project will
leverage two new sources of data. The first are encounter data submitted by MA plans, which recently became
available and will be released for subsequent years on a regular basis. The second is the Risk Adjustment
Payment System (RAPS) database, which contains information on clinical conditions coded in the prior year for
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Hierarchical Condition Categories risk adjustment models. The
availability of these two datasets will allow us to examine selection, health care use, quality, and risk coding
though a more refined clinical lens than in our previous P01 research. Our proposal includes three aims. Aim
1 will leverage the newly available MA encounter data to quantify differences in care delivery both between TM
and MA and among MA plans for patients with specific acute and chronic medical conditions. Aim 2 will assess
the potential contributions of various mechanisms to the differences in care identified in Aim 1, focusing first on
network formation and second on examining within- and between-provider differences in care for MA vs. TM
enrollees. We also will be able to examine heterogeneity within the MA program more specifically, as health
plans may adopt different approaches to network formation within an area. Aim 3 will examine the magnitude
of coding intensity differences between MA and TM and among MA plans and explore alternative approaches
to risk adjustment that reduce sensitivity to diagnostic coding practices in performance assessments. By
describing provider networks, examining how networks vary across plans operating in the same market, and
isolating within-provider differences in care for MA and TM enrollees, we will be able to assess the consistency
of various conceptual explanations of care differences between TM and MA with empirical observations now
made possible by the new data sources. This project is a natural extension of our current Program Project. We
build on our prior work by assessing patterns of health care use and outcomes in greater clinical detail and by
exploring potential mechanisms used to achieve those patterns. Understanding the role of private plans in
Medicare is crucial for designing systems of financing and delivery that best serve the elderly and disabled."

Medicare and Medicaid are the largest social health insurance programs in the United States, together
providing health insurance for over 130 million Americans. While the programs share some key attributes, they
also differ in important ways, with the key institutional difference being that states have significant control over
the design of their Medicaid programs while Medicare is managed at the national level. Despite their
importance to the U.S. health care system, there is little rigorous quasi-experimental work studying how the
two programs compare to each other in terms of their effects on health care access, quality, and outcomes for
enrollees. In this project, we will examine the relative effects of these two programs by following adults with
disabilities who are enrolled in Medicaid before age 65 into Medicare at age 65 and beyond—that is, as
disabled adults with only Medicaid switch to become dual-eligibles enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare.
Adults with disabilities who are dually enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare before age 65 will serve as the
control group, as they do not experience a transition between programs at age 65. Studying these changes to
dual eligibility will allow us to isolate the average effects of state Medicaid programs on patient care and
outcomes relative to a structurally different Medicare program (e.g., with a wider set of participating providers
than Medicaid), as well as to explore variation in these effects across features of state Medicaid programs. In
Aim 1, we will estimate how enrollees' care and outcomes differ in these two programs. In Aim 2, we will
explore the mechanisms behind the program differences. To do this, we will leverage the fact that there is not
one Medicaid program but 51, with varying levels of provider access and payment. Specifically, we will analyze
how the Medicaid-Medicare transition differs in states with high provider payments (relative to Medicare) vs.
states with low provider payments. We will do the same to compare states that contract out the provision of
Medicaid benefits to private managed care plans vs. states that do not. This will provide new evidence on the
extent to which these two important factors explain overall Medicaid-Medicare differences and will have
implications for program design. In Aim 3, we focus on one specific component of the Medicaid and Medicare
benefit packages: prescription drugs. We will use the introduction of Medicare Part D (which shifted dual-
eligibles from Medicaid drug coverage to Medicare drug coverage) to assess how the drug benefit component
of these two programs differentially affects enrollees' use of drugs and related health outcomes. Here, we will
also leverage variation across state Medicaid programs to explore mechanisms, focusing on variation in state
use of caps on the number of prescriptions beneficiaries can fill and prior authorization requirements. These
analyses will provide critical lessons for the effects of important program design decisions (payment rates,
managed care, drug caps, prior authorization) on health care delivery and health outcomes for low-income and
disabled Americans."

Millions of Americans have or will develop dementia, which has potentially dire implications for them, their
families, and the Medicare program. Beneficiaries with dementia already account for an estimated one in five
dollars of Medicare spending, yet the Medicare program has struggled to meet their complex medical and
supportive needs. Researchers' efforts to describe and improve the care Medicare beneficiaries with dementia
receive have been hampered by the difficulty of identifying those with dementia or cognitive impairments in
claims data, yet such data are currently the only data on Medicare beneficiaries that are available on a large
scale. Prior studies suggest that many beneficiaries have undetected or undiagnosed disease, while others
with intact cognition carry a false claims-based diagnosis. Accordingly, our first aim is to leverage linked survey
and claims data to predict the probability of dementia and its severity, according to a validated, survey-based
reference standard. Better identification of those with dementia is a prerequisite to obtain a more accurate
national picture of the care for this important population. The two data sources are also complementary; survey
data help assess under-diagnosis and the probability that a claim-based diagnosis truly represents dementia,
and claims data supports the examination of Medicare programs at scale. We will then describe the sorting of
Medicare beneficiaries across available plan options: Traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA),
and within MA, Special Needs Plans (SNPs). This work builds on our existing P01 research on choice, which
demonstrated that beneficiaries with less cognitive ability were more likely to choose a dominated plan. In this
project, we will examine sorting with respect to options potentially advantageous for those with dementia, e.g.,
SNPs. Finally, we will examine dementia care and outcomes in the changing Medicare program as both
payments for dementia beneficiaries and benefit flexibility increase. For example, MA plans will receive
substantially larger payments for enrolled beneficiaries with dementia starting in 2020 through risk adjustment
formula changes, which coincides with new flexibility in offering LTSS because of the CHRONIC Care Act.
Additionally, reimbursement of skilled nursing facilities will change in late 2019 to weigh cognitive deficits more
and therapy minutes less. Our study will provide critically needed evidence about the role of incentives and
program flexibility for beneficiaries with dementia receiving care within Medicare in an era of change."

10832560,"Engaging stakeholders throughout the full spectrum of the research process leads to better science and,
ultimately, better health outcomes. Yet, the 2014 National Center for Advancing Translational Science
(NCATS) Advisory Council Working Group Report found 1) a paucity of community-driven research; and 2) that
CTSA hubs lack sufficient infrastructure to support the science of community engagement. The Community
Engagement Core (CEC) includes a portfolio of innovative programs and collaborations that demonstrate the
benefits of engaging communities as active partners in research to addresses health priorities. We have
worked to build capacity in the community-engaged research workforce via training, networking, and grants.
Finally, the CEC has consulted with investigators and community stakeholders to optimize research processes
and worked with other CCTST Cores and CTSA hubs to facilitate dissemination and implementation of best
practices. In the Life Sciences, over 90% of published research is by two or more authors (1). The complexity
of the problems studied requires integration of knowledge from many disciplines and the ability to develop and
maintain effective teams. The siloed nature of universities and research institutions is partly responsible for
challenges investigators face when trying to find collaborators from other disciplines. Our Center for
Improvement Science (CIS) has taken a leadership role in developing mechanisms to build broad networks
across disciplines, colleges, institutions, and the community. Our initial cross-disciplinary network has resulted
in over $6 million in funding for interprofessional research and practice improvement projects. The CIS has
also implemented a multi-level team science training program that includes basic to advanced workshops, a
graduate-level course on Collaboration and Team Science, and Grand Rounds. In addition, we provide
consultations for creating teams, improving teams and writing team-based grants. Finally, our expertise in
quality improvement has built bridges between academic and health care systems to form a Learning Health
Care System. We will build on our successful track record in community engagement and team science to:
Aim 1: Further infuse community engagement within the CCTST and across the translational spectrum;
Aim 2: Increase capacity for bi-directional engagement through expansion of educational offerings in
community engagement and team science in translational research;
Aim 3: Facilitate the development of multidisciplinary Learning Communities (LCs) that support the
dissemination and implementation of best practices in community engagement and team science; and
Aim 4: Implement an innovative team science program to enhance the effectiveness of multidisciplinary
research teams."
10832562,"The University of Cincinnati’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) is dedicated
to providing all current and future members of the clinical and translational science workforce within our
institution, community, and beyond with state-of-the-science educational opportunities. To accomplish this
endeavor, we propose to further develop our Translational Workforce Development (TWD) program to
provide training for early-stage, mid-career, and established investigators; boots-on-the-ground clinical
research professionals; pre-professional trainees (allied health, pre-medical, nursing, dental, and medical
assistants); and innovatively, community residents and high school students. Specifically, we will: 1) create
new opportunities for formal training in community-engaged research for health equity, translational regulatory
science, and acute care research; 2) develop a comprehensive training program for clinical research
professionals to enhance the clinical research workforce, emphasizing a team-based approach; 3) expand and
diversify the pipeline of translational researchers by exposing early-stage students (high school, allied health
associate students, undergraduate health professions) to clinical research using existing and proposed
community-engaged programs; and 4) design training for high-quality clinical data management and
dissemination. To further support the workforce and development of translational research initiatives, the Pilot
Translational and Clinical Studies Program (PTC) provides the means for junior and established basic
science and clinical investigators to engage in multidisciplinary and collaborative team science approaches,
develop efficient methods and processes, and generate robust preliminary data necessary for large-scale
funding opportunities. The overall goal of the PTC is to accelerate the development of novel disease
biomarkers, diagnostic tests, and therapies by facilitating translation of basic science laboratory discoveries
across the Academic Health Center into novel clinical approaches and interventions. To build on the PTC’s
success, we will innovatively expand the program by facilitating novel pilot translational and clinical studies
through promotion of interdisciplinary and community collaboration and provide mechanisms for junior faculty
to increase independence by providing active investigator assistance and a robust portfolio of pilot project
mechanisms. Specifically, we will: 1) provide a comprehensive pilot project portfolio, including team-based and
community-engaged support programs and resources, to promote collaboration and catalyze advancement of
science across the translational research continuum throughout the Academic Health Center and beyond; and
2) develop training opportunities and resources for junior investigators to promote independence in clinical and
translational research."
10832563,"Aligning Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) methods and the CTSA consortium within a larger Learning
Health System can drive research and improve use of health care information to advance knowledge and
improve practice. To do this, CTR must rely on a complex array of methods, ranging from new study designs to
high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, mediation analysis, and Bayesian inference methods.
Because methodologic research is a key aspect of CTR, it is important to attract the best statisticians and
epidemiologists to CTR, and to nurture their professional development. Knowledge of the regulations and the
ability to navigate the ethical and compliance landscapes are also essential to CTR. The past few years have
seen significant changes in the regulatory framework, from NIH data sharing mandates, to the 21st Century
Cures Act, to patient “right to try” legislation and the 2018 revisions to the Common Rule regulations. Our
proposed Research Methods encompass the aims and approaches of the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and
Research Design (BERD) and Ethics, Regulatory Knowledge, and Support (ERKS) Cores. These essential
cores lead critically important activities in support of the aims of the Center for Clinical and Translational
Science and Training (CCTST). BERD and ERKS are highly integrated across the CCTST, and their goals
align with those of the overall CCTST. To engage stakeholders, the BERD Core will provide expert
consultation and focused collaboration with meritorious projects, and actively contribute to, and lead, the BERD
community in the CTSA Consortium. The ERKS Core will build an Ethics Center that encompasses all
stakeholders and enhances the informed consent process. To promote workforce development and
diversity, the BERD Core will cultivate the community of CTR methodologists, fostering BERD faculty and
staff development, and educate and train clinical and translational researchers in study design, data
management, and data analysis. The ERKS Core will provide training and education and promote ethics and
regulatory knowledge in professional development. To organize, integrate, and optimize data use, the
BERD Core will provide expertise that supports research design, data management, and data analysis and
promote the development and dissemination of new methods and processes. The ERKS Core will design and
implement study startup procedures that facilitate single Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and
accommodate other changes in the revised Common Rule."
10832564,"The goal of the Hub Research Capacity Core of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and
Training (CCTST) is to support the clinical and translational research enterprise of the future. As outlined in the
FOA, the Hub includes two cores: Participant and Clinical Interactions (PCI) and Integrating Special
Populations (ISP). The PCI Core will focus on improvement of infrastructure and processes to conduct clinical
and translational research, with an overall goal to enhance the experience of participants and investigators.
This will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) engage stakeholders in conducting clinical
and translational research; 2) promote development of a diverse, multidisciplinary workforce of the future; and
3) optimize the processes to conduct high-quality research studies in a safe environment. Examples of the
approaches to accomplish these aims include: engaging stakeholders through conducting biannual surveys;
extending clinical and translational research capabilities to underserved populations and those with health
disparities through a mobile unit; developing skills training in clinical research to provide knowledge on clinical
research implementation and the resources available to study investigators and study teams; streamlining
protocol assessment, review, approval, and monitoring; and utilizing state-of-art Clinical and Translational
Research Center (CTRC) infrastructure and highly qualified research personnel to conduct first-in-man
treatments such as gene therapy or use of organoids for treatment of diseases. The CCTST has a strong
history of effectively integrating special populations into clinical and translational research. Our Integrating
Special Populations Initiative (ISPI) will build on well-developed programs by increasing the participation of
special populations in research design and equipping research teams with the tools needed to overcome
barriers to research participation for special populations. To achieve this goal, we will 1) support innovative
strategies for engaging underrepresented populations in research studies; 2) expand infrastructure support for
integrating special populations into research; and 3) optimize recruitment of special populations using
biomedical data. These efforts will result in the development of a network of health care providers, community
partners, and researchers empowered to launch new research that will impact the most vulnerable and hardest
to reach special populations experiencing the greatest burden of health disparities."
10832567,"The Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) must have adequate support of
diverse network-wide activities to facilitate success in clinical and translational research. Our last competing
renewal contained a Network Resources section for the first time, as well as Optional Functions. With regard to
Optional Functions, we submitted: 1) Acute Care Research; and 2) Lifespan Data Integration. For Network
Resources and Multi-Site Study Support, we focused on local investigator support for multi-site trials via our
two Clinical Trial Offices (CTOs), since the Trial Innovation Network (TIN) had not yet been formed. In this
competing renewal, CCTST 3.0, we continue to support local multi-site investigators in the same fashion, with
some significant changes underway to improve CTO services across the Academic Health Center (AHC). In
addition, we have a fully functional TIN Hub Liaison Team and have had increasing collaboration with the TIN.
We now have two local investigators receiving TIN services and are continuing toward our participation in TIN
trials. We intend to further increase AHC-wide collaboration in support of multi-site human subjects research.
We have operationalized the Acute Care Research Core as a permanent feature of the CCTST. This builds on
the success of the Acute Care Research optional function to date, leverages our many unique strengths in
acute care research, and highlights the importance of acute care research within our AHC. We will adopt the
guiding principles of Learning Health Systems applied to continuous improvement of our Network Resources
described herein, along with close collaboration with the other CCTST cores. We will 1) engage stakeholders
in meaningful multi-site clinical research, including further involvement in TIN studies; 2) continue to develop a

10861288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The vast majority of women who develop and die from cervical cancer live in low- and middle-income
countries.1 In sub-Saharan Africa, geographic inequities in rates of cervical cancer are fueled by high HIV
incidence and prevalence among women with HIV (WWH). South Africa (SA) bears the greatest HIV burden in
the world2 and has the highest cervical cancer incidence rate globally;3 in SA, 53% of all cervical cancer cases
are attributable to HIV.4 With increased attention paid to the importance of cervical cancer screening (which, in
SA, is typically cytology-based via Pap smears),5 Pap smear screening rates have risen; as of 2018, 52% of
women had been screened,6 up from 18-25% in earlier studies.7 However, cervical cancer can only be prevented
if patients are retained in care and subsequently treated. Alarmingly, only 26% of WWH who received high-risk
abnormal Pap results completed medically-required follow-up and management within 18 months.8
 To increase retention of WWH in the cervical cancer treatment cascade, it is imperative that we investigate
the specific factors that negatively affect follow-up appointment attendance and engagement with necessary
treatment. Without a nuanced understanding of barriers to retention and treatment across multiple levels, WWH
will continue to be at disproportionate risk for cervical cancer.
 A multi-level retention care intervention that is tailored to the unique needs of WWH who have recently
received high-risk abnormal Pap results has strong potential to mitigate massive cervical cancer disparities. We
now propose to conduct the formative work that is necessary to develop the novel intervention, which, in line
with PAR-21-341, will modify the complex, intersecting factors that contribute to cervical cancer development
among WWH. In qualitative interviews with (1) WWH (n<10) who had a high-risk abnormal Pap smear in the
past six months and have not yet attended a follow-up visit and (2) WWH (n<10) who had a high-risk abnormal
Pap smear in the past six months and have attended at least one follow-up visit, we will explore the individual,
interpersonal, clinic-level, and structural barriers and facilitators to follow-up appointment attendance and
subsequent treatment. Intervention preferences will also be probed. In separate interviews with providers (n<8),
we will explore their perspectives on barriers to delivery of care and barriers to retention of patients in care post-
abnormal Pap smear. The qualitative data will inform the specification of the multi-level intervention, which will
be tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=60). Feasibility and acceptability will be the primary study
outcomes, which will be assessed among both patients and providers. We will also assess for signals of clinically
meaningful differences in (1) the proportion of women who attend a follow-up appointment (and, of those, the
proportion who complete the next phase of treatment, which will be exploratory), and (2) self-efficacy to attend
a follow-up and/or other cervical cancer-related appointments. If deemed to be feasible and acceptable, with
preliminary signals of efficacy, the intervention will be ready for an R01-level hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial."
10861557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Drug tolerant cells limit clinical success of many types of anticancer therapies. Drug tolerance has largely been
associated with cell heterogeneity. Surprisingly, identifying successful drug combinations has rarely been
done at the cell population level. We propose that the limited success of therapeutic strategies is due to the
gap in knowledge of the vulnerabilities of different cancer cell populations. We and others recently showed that
during the initial response to cancer therapy, drug tolerant cells exhibit differences in gene expression across
distinct cell subpopulations. The analysis of transcriptional phenotypes in lung cancer cell lines and xenografts
treated with a single agent has guided us to a successful targeting of the drug tolerant populations with the
second agent. This suggested to us that describing different cell populations using single-cell RNA data may be
used for identifying scorable drug response signatures. We put forward an innovative idea of assessing
druggable modulation in gene expression at the cell population level for identification of potential drug
combinations. The goal is to find the drugs, each targeting distinct cell population/s tolerant to the first drug, to
eliminate all cells with the prescribed combination treatment. This idea will be tested in three Specific Aims, by
drug scoring based on cell population signatures, drug validation in cell survival assays, and drug validation
through the characterization of affected cell populations. The data from single-cell RNA sequencing will be used
for in silico drug prescription, and the top drug combinations will be validated in vivo for inhibiting growth of
predicted cell subpopulations. To enhance translational value of this idea, we study the cell subpopulations that
are tolerant to the treatment with standard-of-care cancer therapies; we use relevant cancer cell line models;
and we determine applicability of our idea using large pan-cancer cohorts with available RNA-seq data. No drugs
that target cancer cell heterogeneity have yet reached the clinic. However, the inhibitors available in the
databases that we use, with known safety profiles, have been approved or are in clinical trials for cancer
treatment, and they could be candidates for halting drug tolerance. The proposed research helps find new
solutions and approaches for cancer treatment. It may enable oncologists to accurately tailor cancer care for
individual patients with the drugs that target emerging tolerant cell populations. Patients stratified by markers
predictive of drug response can enter clinical trials for combination therapy."
10839339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Autophagy, the process by which cells dispose of cellular contents, has been
increasingly appreciated as an important pathway in antiviral host defenses. Intriguingly, recent
studies demonstrated that autophagy and the antiviral type I IFN response are intricately
connected, and several molecules known to play key roles in IFN-mediated immunity are also
important regulators of autophagy. Among these molecules with dual roles in autophagy and
IFN-mediated immunity are several TRIM (tripartite motif) protein family members. However,
whereas the molecular mechanisms by which TRIM proteins act as antiviral restriction factors or
regulate IFN responses have been well characterized, our knowledge about the role of TRIM
proteins in autophagy in response to viral infection is still rudimentary.
 The proposed study builds on a recent discovery by the Gack laboratory that identified
TRIM23 as a critical regulator of autophagy-mediated host defense against a broad range of
viruses. TRIM23 interacts with and activates the innate immune molecule TBK1, promoting
TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of the selective autophagy receptor p62, which ultimately
triggers viral clearance and host resistance. Mechanistically, the N-terminal RING E3 ligase of
TRIM23 induces atypical non-degradative K27-linked auto-ubiquitination of the C-terminal ARF
GTPase domain, which is unique to TRIM23. ARF ubiquitination results in enhanced activity of
TRIM23 to hydrolyze GTP, activate TBK1, and mediate virus resistance. TRIM23 depletion or
gene-targeting in various cell types showed that TRIM23-mediated autophagy confers antiviral
activity against several viruses including HSV-1.
 Using molecular, biochemical, cell biological and structural approaches combined with
virus infection studies, we will define in precise detail how TRIM23 mediates autophagy during
viral infection. This study will yield insight into the mechanisms of TRIM23 activation by
upstream regulators during viral infection (Aim 1). We will further determine the molecular
details of how TRIM23 activates TBK1 and the role the enzymatic activities of TRIM23 – E3
ligase and GTPase – play in TBK1 activation. Finally, we will determine the physiological
relevance of TRIM23 for antiviral host resistance and viral pathogenesis using in vitro cell
culture systems and infection studies in TRIM23 knockout mice (Aim 2). Our studies will provide
a molecular understanding of a key pathway in the autophagy-mediated host defense, which
may guide the rational design of new antivirals."

Uncertainty, inference, and introspection in the primate visual system
Abstract
 Perceptual systems offer a window onto a world that cannot be known perfectly. Uncertainty about the world
can arise externally, when sensory cues are incomplete or contradictory, or internally, when noise corrupts neural
representations. Ideal perceptual systems do not ignore uncertainty, but take it into account. For example, if a
sensory cue is ambiguous, prior experience should guide the interpretation of the environment. Likewise, the
reliability of sensory signals should inform confidence in perceptual decisions. When humans and monkeys
perform perceptual tasks, they often follow these normative predictions. This implies that the neural circuits which
process sensory information also survey the uncertainty of this information, and put this estimate to use for
perceptual inference and perceptual introspection. How they do so is not well understood. A more precise
understanding of the neural processing of sensory uncertainty and its role in perception and cognition may help
to advance the treatment of pathologies such as agnosia, autism, and schizophrenia. Recently, several
theoretical frameworks have been proposed that offer explicit accounts of the neural processing of uncertainty
in low-level sensory and high-level decision-making circuits (linear probabilistic population codes, quadratic
probabilistic population codes, temporal sampling models, and the curved manifold hypothesis). These
developments form the background for this proposal. We will trace the processing of sensory uncertainty from
its initial computation and representation in early visual cortex to its eventual use in informing confidence in
perceptual decisions and in regulating the integration of sensory signals and prior information in high-level
decision-making areas in prefrontal cortex. We will use the data we collect to compare and contrast the
predictions of various theories of neural coding. First, we will study V1 population activity in awake, fixating
macaques while presenting stimuli whose orientation uncertainty is manipulated in distinct ways. Next, we will
examine how neural activity in primary visual cortex informs confidence in a perceptual estimate of stimulus
orientation. Finally, we will identify how sensory uncertainty shapes neural population representations in
prefrontal cortex during a perceptual inference task. The outcomes of this work will not only enhance our
understanding of the visual system, but will also provide a novel experimental paradigm to study perceptual
introspection in animals and a novel computational tool for analyzing behavioral confidence reports."

At least 50% of patients treated with 125I brachytherapy for uveal melanoma experience significant vision loss
within 3-5 years after therapy. Extensive vascular pathology has been reported in the normal retina
surrounding the melanoma after 2 years or more. These findings are in line with the accepted, but incompletely
tested, concept that microangiopathy causes radiation-related vision loss due to injury of the microvascular
endothelium during radiation. This leads to progressive capillary loss after a lag period of several years. If this
hypothesis is correct, preventing the development of, or treating, radiation-induced endothelial damage in
retinal microvessels will reduce capillary loss and save vision. However, this approach has been difficult to test
because early indicators of microvascular endothelial dysfunction have yet to be established.
The objectives of the proposed project are to: facilitate earlier detection, treatment and prevention of radiation-
associated vision loss. Specifically, we expect to 1. detect early endothelial dysfunction based on reduced
blood flow and response to light flicker 2. determine whether it is predictive of subsequent capillary loss and 3.
identify molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction. We will apply laser speckle
flowgraphy (LSFG) for noninvasive, real-time imaging and measurement of ocular blood flow, in human
subjects and mice to test our central hypothesis, that post-radiation endothelial dysfunction is driven by
mitochondrial oxidative stress, and is predictive of the severity of subsequent capillary dropout and
vision loss. We will test our hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1: Establish whether early impairment of the
microvascular endothelial function will predict microvessel drop-out and vision loss in humans after 125I
brachytherapy. For this purpose, LSFG, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A)
and tests of visual function will be performed in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing 125I brachytherapy
for choroidal melanoma. We will test whether early impairment of ocular blood flow and flicker light-induced
vasodilation by LSFG correlate with subsequent vision loss and capillary drop-out (as detected by OCT-A). Aim
2: Test whether selective inhibition of mitoROS production in endothelium prevents the early reduction of blood
flow and subsequent loss of capillaries after radiation. In this aim, genetic mouse models in which key
regulators of mitochondrial superoxide production are inhibited or overexpressed will be used to test whether
inhibition of mitochondrial ROS in the endothelium protects from early impairment of retinal blood flow,
endothelial dysfunction and subsequent capillary dropout.
The expected outcomes of the proposed studies are knowledge of biomarkers of early radiation retinopathy
and insights into the role of endothelial-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in radiation retinopathy. Our studies have
the potential to facilitate the development of first-in-class, targeted therapies for radiation-related vision loss."

The goals of this Pathway to Independence Career Development proposal are to request support for Dr. Fane
to develop training in tumor dormancy and underlying cancer immunology and bioinformatics techniques to
investigate how dormant melanoma cells located within metastatic tissues can regulate stromal cells to facilitate
metastatic outgrowth and resistance to therapy. The training plan outlined in this proposal will take advantage of
the extensive resources and career development programs available at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Fane has assembled
a team of leaders in the field of melanoma, dormancy, immunology, and bioinformatics who will guide his training.
Metastasis is the largest cause of melanoma deaths, with treatments failing to provide a durable response. While
a subset of patients show-remarkable responses initially to therapy, most of them will have tumor cells lying
dormant in distal organs that persist during therapy but are clinically undetectable. Eventually, these cells will
‘reactivate’ from dormancy to form metastatic colonies, now resistant to therapy. There are few labs that focus
on melanoma dormancy and as such, there are no current treatments or diagnostic tools to identify and target
dormant cells. The proposed studies are based on Dr. Fanes novel findings that upregulation of the tyrosine
kinase receptor MER promotes cancer growth, which allows ‘reactivation’ of dormant melanoma cells within the
lung. It isn’t known how ‘reactivated’ cells overcome targeting by the immune system, growth restrictive cues
from lung fibroblasts, or how they become resistant to therapy. Dr. Fanes preliminary data first shows that
MERhigh melanoma cells regulate lung fibroblasts to alter secretion of the extracellular matrix, changing it from
being dormancy promoting to allowing melanoma outgrowth. Dr Fane has also shown that following ‘reactivation’
of melanoma within the lung, there is an increase in Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and T-regulatory
(Tregs) cells which inhibit the immune system from targeting cancer cells for destruction and are often a common
feature in patients resistant to immunotherapy. Finally, Dr. Fane has shown that ‘reactivated’ melanoma cells
secrete high levels of the soluble protein PROS1, which is known to be involved in regulating the activity of
MDSCs, Tregs, and lung fibroblasts within other disease states, but has not been investigated in metastatic
dormancy. Dr. Fane will explore the following scientific aims: 1) Determine whether MER induced secretion of
PROS1 regulates lung fibroblast to promote outgrowth and therapy resistance and 2) Investigate the mechanism
by which MER induced secretion of PROS1 by melanoma cells in the lung regulates immune cells and response
to -PD1. The completion of the scientific aims in this proposal will develop Dr. Fanes scientific and professional
skills that are required to be an independent investigator into the field of dormancy and importantly, will provide
novel insight into how cancer cells overcome targeted and immunotherapies in dormant, metastatic disease."

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent a new drug class that have recently arisen to
the forefront of the treatment algorithm for type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to their glycemic, metabolic, and
cardiovascular benefits. However, their use has been hampered by gastrointestinal side effects. This proposal
aims to understand the genetic predictors of GLP-1 RA response in order to target treatment to those most likely
to benefit and avoid unnecessary exposure to those who are likely to experience intolerance. In Aim 1, the
candidate will harness the phenotypic and genotypic data available in several biobank-linked electronic health
records (EHR) to perform pharmacogenetic analyses. Outcomes of GLP-1 RA response will be curated using
best practices and a genome-wide approach will test associations between genetic variation and phenotypes of
GLP-1 RA response, with subsequent replication of genetic findings to be conducted in additional human cohorts.
Aim 2 will focus on the creation of a drug perturbation trial with oral semaglutide in healthy individuals for the
purposes of characterizing the acute biochemical response, as measured by changes in glucose and insulin
levels in response to a mixed meal tolerance test. Subsequently, this protocol will be implemented in Aim 3 to
assess how the acute response to oral semaglutide differs by genetic variation to generate insight into underlying
drug mechanism and T2D pathophysiology. The candidate will complete the proposed work under the primary
mentorship of Dr. Jose Florez, Chief of the Endocrine Division and Diabetes Unit at Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) and an internationally recognized leader in clinical translation of genetic discoveries in T2D. Dr.
Jordan Smoller will serve as a co-mentor due to his expertise on the application of EHR-based biobanking for
genomic research and active leadership roles in the Mass General Brigham Biobank and the All of Us Research
Program. Dr. Li will undertake coursework on bioinformatics and phenotype curation, expand on her experiences
in studying complex trait genetics, develop knowledge in clinical pharmacology, refine her expertise in
physiologic investigation, gain practical skills in clinical trial implementation, and receive periodic feedback from
a research advisory committee with complementary areas of expertise. This application reflects a carefully
planned training program directed at equipping the applicant with the tools necessary to conduct future
pharmacogenetic studies in T2D and advancing the scientific career of the applicant toward independence. If
successful, this proposal will generate evidence for precision medicine in T2D and serve as the foundation for a
future pharmacogenetics trial of genotype-guided therapeutic selection for GLP-1 RAs."

Response rates to current immunotherapies are comparably low in breast cancer patients, yet patients with T
cell infiltrates often respond better. To improve the response rates of breast cancer patients to immunotherapy,
it is imperative to develop strategies that enhance T cell infiltration. In a recent study, we demonstrated that
cancer cells compress blood vessels within metastatic breast tumors and impair the recruitment of T cells into
these tumors. Losartan, an antihypertensive and antifibrotic drug, reduced extracellular matrix production in
metastatic breast tumors, normalized blood vessels, and promoted T cell accumulation in tumors. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan decompresses the tumor
vasculature and promotes T cell trafficking into mouse breast cancers. To test this hypothesis, we will use a
lymph node window that allows in vivo imaging for two weeks. With the window, we will use optical coherence
tomography imaging to measure tissue compression and blood vessel function within primary and lymph node
tumors (Aim 1). In addition, we will use multiphoton microscopy imaging and adoptive transfer studies to test our
hypothesis that losartan promotes naïve and cancer specific T cell entry into decompressed vessels in primary
and lymph node tumors (Aims 1 and 2). Further, our experiments are designed to uncover how losartan,
combined with immunotherapy to enhance T cell function, leads to the eradication of breast tumors (Aim 2). We
will use single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to examine the composition and transcriptional
signatures of cells in the reprogrammed tumors responding to combination therapy. Finally, we will test whether
T cells are sufficient for tumor growth delay. Based on preliminary data from animal studies, we hypothesize
that the use of ARBs, such as losartan, by breast cancer patients is associated with reduced extracellular matrix
deposition in tumors and enhanced T cell infiltration into tumors. To study if ARB use is associated with these
predicted outcomes, we will use patient specimens from women enrolled in the Black Women’s Health Study
(BWHS), including those who took ARBs at the time of diagnosis. In Aim 3, we will use multiplex staining and
quantitative multispectral imaging to investigate extracellular matrix deposition, vascular structure, and immune
cell infiltration in 554 invasive breast cancer samples. A bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data obtained
from invasive breast cancer samples will be performed to investigate transcriptomic signatures associated with
cells in the tumor microenvironment. We will measure whether our findings from ARB-naïve patients and ARB
users strongly associate with survival and other clinicopathological characteristics. We anticipate that successful
completion of the proposed studies by our multidisciplinary team will reveal the clinical utility of ARBs as a
potential strategy to increase T cell entry into breast tumors and improve the disconcerting response rates to
current immunotherapies."

Despite significant research advances, many remaining questions must be addressed before global
implementation of impactful therapeutic and prevention options for patients affected by food allergy can be
realized. In response to NIAID’s RFA for the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR), the Arkansas
Center for Food Allergy Research (ArCOFAR) will build on its >30-year foundation of expertise and leadership
in food allergy to address CoFAR’s overarching program goals. The ArCOFAR site is ideally positioned to
function as a CoFAR Clinical Research Center (CRC). In addition to our extensive research experience,
distinguished by key contributions in advancing food allergen immunotherapeutics for peanut allergy and
eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), we will capitalize on our population’s distinctive geographic and
patient demographic characteristics. Namely, we serve a largely rural, widely dispersed, and underserved
population in which more than 50% are under-represented minorities and earn below $50,000 annually, and 33%
have earned only a high school diploma or below. This study participant population stands to contribute
significantly to the nationwide participant pool and to increase our understanding of allergy across a broad
demographic spectrum. Our efforts will be directed by the central hypothesis that ArCOFAR will measurably
impact patients with food allergy and related disorders through expertly designed, innovative clinical
trials using novel approaches that can advance translation of treatments and prevention strategies to
practice, while training the next generation of researchers. Our overarching goal is to provide a
comprehensive, collaborative research platform to measurably improve the lives of children and adults with food
allergy and related disorders. The studies proposed in this application highlight ArCOFAR’s strengths with a new
peanut peptide-based treatment approach to peanut allergy; evaluation of treatment response biomarkers in
EGID; and integrative research in food science, nutrition, and food allergy. Our hypothesis will be tested by
executing the following Specific Aims: 1) Expand therapeutic trials participation among food-allergic patients with
racial/ethnic diversity and for those living in rural, underserved regions by designing and implementing novel,
disease-impacting clinical trials; 2) Increase center-specific research into new focus areas of discovery that also
have capacity for expansion to larger, multi-center investigation; and 3) Promote career development of new and
early-career researchers into food allergy by linking established research mentors and new investigators through
direct engagement in center-specific projects. In these efforts we will coordinate appropriately with the CoFAR
network and participate in the CoFAR-wide clinical trial. This proposal’s outcomes will be to improve the health
of children and adults with food allergy in Arkansas and beyond while advancing CoFAR’s mission to
fundamentally transform food allergy research and treatment."

Loss of myelin, as seen in conditions like multiple sclerosis, frequently leads to balance issues. These dis-
ruptions in balance are attributed to the compromised function of neural circuits associated with the vestibu-
lar system. Despite the clinical significance of this problem, our understanding of how myelin loss affects the
functioning of these circuits remains limited. Consequently, there is a pressing need to elucidate the mecha-
nisms underlying the impact of myelin, its loss and restoration on circuit function. To address these questions,
I propose using zebrafish larvae as a model. They allow for in vivo observation of myelinated axons and func-
tional/behavioral testing. My preliminary data using a pharmacological hypomyelination model showed specific
changes in pitch sensitivity linked to a particular circuit, the vestibulospinal circuit. My aim is to understand the
role of myelin in behavior and circuit function, as well as the deficits caused by myelin loss and potential rescue
through remyelination.
In the K99 phase, I will (1) investigate changes in vestibulospinal circuit neuron responses to body tilts after
hypomyelination, (2) analyze postural and functional deficits after targeted demyelination, and (3) develop a
novel tool for circuit-specific myelin manipulations. These experiments will define the impact of demyelination
on vestibular processing and postural instability. Successful completion will provide functional characterization
of vestibular circuits and validate a selective myelin disruption tool. In the R00 phase, I will (1) explore mech-
anisms of neuronal and behavioral recovery after remyelination and (2) create conditional myelin inhibitors to
model circuit-specific incomplete remyelination. Achieving these goals will shed light on circuit-specific effects
of remyelination after loss.
My long-term goal is to run an independent laboratory using larval zebrafish to (1) understand the mechanisms
by which loss of myelin disrupts neural circuit function and behavior and (2) understand how remyelination
rescues behavioral and functional deficits. To achieve this, my lab will leverage the behavioral technologies I
have used in the first stage of my post-doctoral training, the functional imaging I will master in the K99 training
phase, and my previous training as a molecular and cellular glia -biologist. The proposed studies target an un-
met need: understanding the role of myelin in a circuit specific manner. This work is broadly significant as it ad-
vances our understanding of the relationship of myelin, circuit function and behavior with implications for novel
treatment approaches for demyelinating diseases."
10848432,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Many symbiotic or pathogenic bacteria have evolved complex specialized machines known as type
III secretion systems (T3SS), which have the capacity to transfer multiple bacterially-encoded proteins into host
eukaryotic cells. These machines are of great interest because they are central to the pathogenic or symbiotic
relationships of the bacteria that encode them. Proteins delivered by these machines, collectively referred to as
“effectors”, can modulate a great variety of eukaryotic cellular functions to shape the bacteria/host cell functional
interphase. Through work supported by this Grant, we have been studying a T3SS from Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), encoded within its pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1). This system mediates several
phenotypes that are essential for virulence including bacterial entry into and survival within non-phagocytic cells, the
induction of programmed cell death in macrophages, and the modulation of innate immune responses and
inflammation in the intestinal tract. The central component of all T3SSs is the needle complex, a supramolecular
structure which allows the translocation of proteins through the bacterial envelope during their journey to eukaryotic
target cells. The needle complex works in association with other components such as the export apparatus, which
mediates passage of the secreted proteins through the bacterial inner membrane, and the “sorting platform”, a
cytoplasmic structure that establishes an order in the secretion process. Additional components regulate the function
of this machine to ensure that it is activated and deployed at the appropriate time (i. e. upon contact with target cells).
Energy to drive protein translocation and the unfolding of the protein substrates is derived from an associated ATPase
as well as a proton gradient established by poorly understood mechanisms. This research project intends to
investigate less understood aspects of type III protein secretion including the mechanisms of sensing, signal
transduction, and activation of the type III secretion machine, the deployment of the T3SS translocon into the target
eukaryotic cell membrane, the structure and function of the T3SS export apparatus, and the mechanisms of by which
the T3SS recognizes its substrates. Accomplishing these objectives will not only enhance our understanding of
Salmonella spp. pathogenesis but also our understanding of T3SSs in general. Since this system is central to the
pathogenesis of many important pathogenic bacteria, these studies may provide the bases for the development of
broadly applicable anti-infective strategies."

The overall goal of this 5-year K76 resubmission is to support Anand S. Iyer, MD, MSPH to
become a leader in geriatrics-palliative care with the skills to improve the health and well-being
of older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dr. Iyer is a pulmonologist
and AHRQ-K12 COPD outcomes researcher. COPD is the third leading cause of death for older
Americans and accelerates loss of quality of life and functional independence. Research
priorities of the NIA identify a critical need for innovative geriatrics-palliative care models to
address unmet care needs for older adults, especially those from rural and underserved areas
where COPD is prevalent and palliative care access is limited. However, no geriatrics-
palliative care interventions have been systematically developed and tested for
community-dwelling older adults with COPD. Through this K76, Dr. Iyer will gain advanced
training in: 1) gerontology and geriatrics-palliative care; 2) clinical trials and implementation
science; and 3) leadership development in aging. To support his career development, Dr. Iyer
and his primary mentor, Cynthia Brown, MD, MSPH, have assembled a mentor team of experts
in geriatrics (Seth Landefeld, MD), palliative care-implementation science (Marie Bakitas, DNSc,
APRN), and COPD clinical trials (Mark Dransfield, MD). Dr. Iyer will seek advisement from
international leaders in aging biology (Steven Austad, PhD), lung aging (Victor Thannickal, MD),
geriatrics-palliative care (Christine Ritchie, MD, MSPH), and the aging brain in COPD (Karin
Hoth, PhD). Supported by an AHRQ-K12, Dr. Iyer developed, “EPIC: Early Palliative Care In
COPD”, a 6-month telehealth, palliative-nurse coach-led intervention for COPD patients and
their family caregivers. Preliminary feasibility results in middle-aged COPD patients and their
family caregivers are promising; however, it is not known how EPIC needs to be refined to meet
the needs of older COPD patients, especially the old-old. Guided by Baltes’ Theory of
Successful Aging, this K76 will: 1) Refine the geriatrics content of EPIC by engaging diverse
stakeholder groups of older COPD patients, family caregivers, clinicians, staff, and policy
leaders; and, 2) Conduct a hybrid type-1 effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized
controlled trial of Geri-EPIC plus usual COPD care versus usual COPD care alone to determine
feasibility and acceptability, to refine trial procedures, and to collect preliminary data on Life-
Space mobility to inform a fully-powered trial at the R01 level. Ultimately, this K76 will position
Dr. Iyer to be a leader in geriatrics-palliative care and patient-oriented aging research."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies, representing a diverse
collection of complex diseases. After 30-40 years without change of treatment strategy, the past 2 years have
seen several drug approvals, including recent approvals for the FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, and the BCL2 inhibitor,
venetoclax. While response rates to both of these agents are encouraging, drug resistance and relapse is still
problematic for nearly all patients. For the past decade, we have executed a functional proteogenomics platform
applied directly to primary samples from patients with AML and other hematologic malignancies. Using this
platform, we have collectively studied over 2,500 primary patient specimens. Through integration of these data
with expansive proteomic, phospho-proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, metabolomic, genome-wide CRISPR
screens, and detailed clinical annotations, we have defined biomarkers and mechanisms underlying response
as well as early and late resistance to both FLT3i and BCL2i. Consequently, we have started clinical trials testing
combinations that may mitigate these resistance mechanisms. For this project, our long-term goals are to
translate FLT3i and BCL2i therapeutic regimens such that resistance can be prevented with up-front
combinations and/or mitigated with sequential therapies. Our immediate goals are to define and
optimize specific biomarkers of response and resistance to these agents. Based on the central
hypothesis that examination of global proteomic features of AML provides predictors of drug response
and also identifies the dynamic changes during development of drug resistance, yielding mechanistic
insight to generate novel, improved drug combinations. To accomplish these goals, Preclinical and Clinical
work is proposed: Training of proteogenomic biomarkers on cell line models of early and late resistance – We
will perform proteogenomic analyses of a panel of cell lines that have been derived to exhibit drug resistance
resembling clinical features of resistance. Validation of signatures in archival patient sample material – We have
a substantial biorepository of specimens from AML patients, a subset of which are from patients treated with
FLT3i or BCL2i as standard-of-care or as part of our ongoing clinical trials. We will test our cell line derived
biomarkers in these banked patient specimens, and we will also use cutting edge proteomics technology that
enables low input material to study fractionated cell populations. Clinical validation of biomarkers of sensitivity
and resistance – We have opened clinical trials testing FLT3i and BCL2i combinations in AML. We will have
access to prospective, longitudinal specimens from patients on these trials. We will perform proteogenomic
analyses on these prospective specimens to evaluate the ability of our signatures to predict clinical responses.
Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of AML biology,
with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies and predictive biomarkers."

HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) mediate viral entry into host cells and are the sole target of neutralizing
antibodies. HIV-1 Envs of most primary HIV-1 strains typically exist in a closed conformation (State 1) and
occasionally transit to downstream, more open conformations (State 2 and State 3). Thus, current knowledge
guides immunogen design towards mimicking the Env closed conformation as the preferred target for eliciting
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to block HIV-1 entry. However, Env preferred conformations of more
than 37 million different circulating HIV-1 strains are unlikely to adopt exactly the same closed conformation. And
we still do not know how different State 1 conformations of diverse natural HIV-1 variants are.
Our hypothesis: State 1 Envs form a heterogenous group of Envs that exist in similar but not identical
conformations. Accordingly, improved ability of bnAbs to recognize multiple Env conformations will
broaden their neutralization activity.
To test our hypothesis, we will assess the conformational heterogeneity of Envs from different strains and build
mechanistic models for 1) Envs transitions, 2) generation and transmission of Envs that exist in specific
conformations, and 3) broad recognition of different Env states. In Specific Aim 1 we will study the conformational
diversity of transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 strains, which can establish HIV-1 in vivo and are the only target of
a preventive vaccine. We will study the mechanisms by which T/F Envs expose internal elements and how they
transit to downstream conformations. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate the generation and evolution of
incompletely closed Env conformation. We will reconstruct the evolution pathway of T/Fs in patients by using
available viral sequences to build evolved viruses at different time point followed by investigating changes in
their conformational states over time. In parallel, we will study Env conformational diversity among HIV-1 strains
that are archived in the latent HIV-1 reservoir of people living with HIV-1 and identify potential targets for
therapeutic interventions. These approaches will allow us to build a mechanistic model for how incompletely
closed Envs are generated, evolved, and transmitted. In Specific Aim 3 we will define important parameters for
broad recognition of CD4-binding site (CD4-bs) on different Env conformations of diverse primary strains. We
will study how the exceptionally broad N6 (CD4-bs) bnAb recognizes different Env conformations, will identify
critical interactions with residues on open and closed Env conformations, and will solve cryo-EM structures of
HIV-1 Envs in complex with N6 to define the mechanism of broad recognition.
Overall, our study will provide high-resolution and comprehensive view on the biology of HIV-1 entry pathway,
will refine the knowledge on HIV-1 Env conformations, and will form a strong basis for the development of new
strategies for HIV-1 cure and vaccine design."
10848446,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue that uses distinct mechanisms for regeneration during
homeostasis and injury-induced repair. Tissue regeneration is supported by heterogeneous cell types including
cycling Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) as well as reserve stem cells set aside for times of injury. We have
recently reported an essential molecular role for Wnt pathway ligands in Lgr5+ ISC maintenance and self-
renewal. We have also developed novel tools for the pharmacological manipulation of the ISC niche. While
adult stem cells serve to maintain and repair tissues for a lifetime, multiple studies have demonstrated that there
is an age-related decline in the regenerative capacity of stem cells across multiple different tissues. Our
preliminary data support diminished regenerative function in ISCs and suggest that these changes are driven by
alterations in the stem cell niche that result in decreased Wnt signaling in the ISCs. We hypothesize that age-
related niche alterations drive the impaired regenerative function of ISCs and these changes are reversible. Our
hypothesis is evaluated by the following Specific Aims: (1) to define how the mesenchymal niche contributes to
functional ISC decline in homeostatic regeneration during aging and (2) to examine ligand-level Wnt pathway
manipulation in the context of colorectal tumor initiation during aging. Achievement of these Aims will provide
insight into exciting new areas of ISC biology, and ultimately lead to improved strategies for tissue repair during
aging."

Progress towards understanding mechanisms of hearing, and the treatment of hearing deficits, requires an
integrated effort from multiple disciplines. The Center for Hearing Research (CHR) at the University of
California, Irvine (UCI) maintains an interdisciplinary training program that takes advantage of the breadth and
depth of hearing research at UCI to train new scientists broadly across multiple disciplines and deeply in one.
The 21 training faculty in CHR span six departments in five Schools (primary appointments in Biological
Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Education; joint appointments in Engineering) with research interests
that cover a broad range of levels (genes, molecules, cells, systems and behavior) and experimental
approaches (cell and molecular biology, neurophysiology, psychoacoustics, computation, human imaging,
human learning, medical device engineering). Thus, CHR is ideally positioned to offer interdisciplinary training.
We request support for three predoctoral students and two postdoctoral researchers including medical
residents. The didactic core of the training program is a course in Auditory Neuroscience, which covers the
auditory system from cells to psychoacoustics, cochlea to cortex, and basic to clinical sciences. Mandatory
features of the training program that encourage interdisciplinary interactions are participation in all CHR
activities (e.g., seminar series, journal club and annual conferences), presentations to scientifically diverse
audiences, and regular meetings with basic and clinical scientists. The normal period of support for trainees is
two years. Predoctoral trainees normally enter the program in their second year of graduate study and are
required to take a course on grant writing and prepare an NRSA proposal. The program is managed by the
Program Director and an Executive Committee, and will foster development of trainees’ intellectual, technical
and professional skills needed to pursue successful careers in hearing research."

 Precision medicine in oncology requires accurate prediction of drug response to guide personalized
treatment decisions. We developed a pharmacoproteomics platform that links kinome activity in liver cancer
cell lines to kinase inhibitor drug response. Preliminary results indicate that our KI-Predictor’s ability to identify
dysregulated kinase signaling is highly dependent on cellular context. To examine and optimize our predictive
model, we will use samples of normal human liver tissue and other inputs and evaluate its performance using
additional liver cell lines and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets. In parallel, we
propose to evaluate our KI-Predictor by profiling kinome activity in clinical liver cancer samples, selecting
candidate kinase inhibitors for testing in organotypic slice cultures derived from each individual patient’s tumor.
By comparing the predicted drug response with the observed response in the organotypic slice culture models,
the accuracy and reliability of the KI-Predictor model can be evaluated. This validation step enables the
assessment of the model's ability to capture the complexities of the tumor microenvironment, including
interactions between cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix."

Children who grow up in low-income homes are at risk for worse physical and cognitive health for their entire
lives, a phenomenon known as the “long arm of childhood”. But, understanding and intervening on this process
is enormously difficult, as the effects of childhood environments can take decades to become visible in adult
morbidity and mortality. What researchers need is a “wormhole”, i.e., a passage through time that connects
childhood and adulthood. In the proposed research, we will examine the utility of DNA-methylation (DNAm) as
a “molecular wormhole” for investigating how material and social conditions of childhood are linked with
physical and cognitive health across the lifespan. We have exciting preliminary research that supports our key
hypothesis that methylation profile scores (MPSs) can allow researchers to “see” – in real time – the impact of
children’s social environments on their lifelong risk for poor cognitive and physical health. However, there
remain yawning gaps in knowledge about the utility (and limitations) of MPSs for studying the life course. First,
MPSs have yet to be integrated into experimental, longitudinal designs capable of testing causal hypotheses
about the impact of childhood environments on development. Building on the Baby’s First Years Study (BFY;
est. N=850), we will, for the first time, integrate MPSs into a randomized controlled trial testing whether
unconditional cash transfers to low-income mothers for the first ~6 years of the child’s life cause changes in the
child’s methylome in early childhood. Next, we will examine whether MPSs show potential for change early in
the life course and whether this change is associated with longitudinal development of cognitive and physical
health across childhood in the BFY (ages 4 and 6), Texas Twin Project (TTP, N=1404, ages 8-20), and Future
of Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS, N = 2,020, ages 9 and 15). Second, previous studies testing
DNAm as a molecular wormhole have only traveled one way, by applying MPSs developed in studies of adult
health in child samples. We will travel forward through the wormhole, by developing MPSs that index the
socioeconomic conditions of childhood (comparing children in BFY low vs. high-cash groups, and in low vs.
high SES families in TTP and FFCWS), and testing their associations with longitudinal development of
cognitive and physical health in early childhood to adolescence and in older adulthood (Health and Retirement
Study, N = 4,018). Finally, in order to derive candidate biological mechanisms of action, research must
augment summary MPS measures with informatic approaches that identify biological pathways. We will
delineate overlapping and diverging biological pathways implicated in genomic markers identified in analyses
of socioeconomic contexts and cash gifts in childhood and markers identified in published adult studies of
health. This application is poised to make rapid scientific progress as all measures, including biological
specimens, are either already available or already being collected as part of separately funded projects."

The Vaccines and Therapeutic Antibodies to Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Peribunyavirus and
Phenuivirus (R2P2) ReVAMPP Center will utilize both well-defined and novel approaches to develop
prototype vaccines and human monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based treatments for rapid response to viruses
from the Paramyxoviridae, Peribunyaviridae and Phleboviridae families. R2P2 is composed of four primary
Research Projects: two that collectively focus on prototype viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family including
human parainfluenza viruses 3 and 1 (HPIV3, HPIV1), and human and bat mumps virus (MuV, BatMuV); and
two that focus on prototype viruses of the Bunyavirales order including the Peribunyaviridae Oropouche (OROV)
and La Crosse (LACV) and the Phenuiviridae Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) and Toscana virus (TOSV). Each
project in R2P2 follows a parallel structure and makes use of the principles of reverse vaccinology, where insights
from the structural and function studies will provide a framework to understand the molecular correlates of
immunity and antigenicity and provide a roadmap for designing optimized immunogens. The foundational studies
carried out in this ReVAMPP center will fill gaps in basic understanding of viral entry and will also inform how to
extend the stabilization approaches successfully used to advance vaccines against agents with Class I fusogens
(e.g., RSV), to those with Class II. A key R2P2 feature is that all four projects compare the same three vaccine
platforms: protein subunit, mRNA, and chimeric VSV, allowing for cross comparisons that will rapidly yield
information about platform performance in translating to related pathogens. The questions of which antigen
stabilization paradigms, and which vaccine platforms are most amenable to generalizing from the prototype
pathogens will be answered in depth and breadth by these comparisons across virus families. We assembled a
collaborative team of world-renowned experts on viral envelope protein structure and function, leading
immunologists, vaccinologists with extensive experience in industry and regulatory issues, and industry partners
(e.g., Modena, GSK). The inclusion of junior investigators with exceptional promise is designed to ensure the
engagement of the next generation of leaders in viral glycoprotein biology, viral immunology and vaccinology in
pandemic preparedness. These Projects are served by an Administrative Core (Core A), a Data Management
Core (Core B), and three Scientific Cores that perform structural biology, biophysics and protein engineering
(Core C), antibody isolation and assessment (Core D), and correlates of immune protection (Core E) experiments
in collaboration with multiple projects. The knowledge accumulated in this project and the robustness of the
approaches implemented to develop prototype vaccines will be expanded to different viruses of the same families
to evaluate their potential and broad applicability against emerging viruses of the Bunyavirales order and
Paramyxoviridae family."

necessary support structures for effectively managing, coordinating, and evaluating the Center's activities. The
Core fulfills several critical functions: facilitating Go/No-Go decision making through quarterly evaluations of
Projects and Cores, maintaining a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to review and recommend strategic changes,
fostering collaboration and an interactive environment among Projects and Cores, and working with Project and
Core leads to identify synergistic collaborations and additional resources. The leadership team composed of
Sean Whelan, Anne Moscona, and Rino Rappuoli, along with the Associate Director, will form the senior
management team of the Center, overseeing research progress, financial resources, and addressing challenges.
The team will actively involve the Scientific Advisory Board, NIAID, and other stakeholders in decision-making
processes. The Administrative Core will work with the Data Management Core to enhance collaboration by
facilitating data sharing and integration. The Core will be instrumental for supporting interactions with the
industrial partners, and creating a clear path from research to product development and will also ensure financial
accountability and regulatory compliance, and monitor and evaluating the progress of research projects and
Cores with the active involvement of the SAB, reporting progress to the SAB and NIAID through the preparation
of annual progress reports. The Core will ensure that all Intellectual Property arrangements have been negotiated
and completed prior to sharing and distribution of resources. The Core will act as a liaison between the Center
and NIAID, coordinating visits between team members, SAB, and NIAID, managing publication submissions and
covering publication costs and travel to ReVAMPP meetings, and establishing and maintaining a publicly
accessible website summarizing the Center's activities. Overall, the Administrative Core plays a crucial role in
facilitating effective decision-making, collaboration, compliance, and progress evaluation, ensuring the
successful implementation of the ReVAMPP program. With an experienced leadership team and a well-defined

Core B: Data Management Core
Washington University (Miller, J. Philip)
The overarching objective of the Data Management Core-B is to serve as the central hub for the analysis,
sharing and harmonization of data across the Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Peribunyavirus and Phenuivirus-
ReVAMPP (R2P2-ReVAMPP) center at Washington University. The core will work directly with Projects 1-4
and Scientific Cores C-E of the R2P2-ReVAMPP center to provide the expertise necessary to ensure the
effective collection, sharing, storage, harmonization, and analysis of data sets and to enable dissemination of
information broadly within the center. We aim to reimagine how a Data Management Core operates by leveraging
the power of cloud technology and metadata-based ontologies. Traditional models of data cores tend to
compartmentalize information into separate databases for each project or core, which are then merged for
specific analyses when needed. This approach, while functional, can lead to inefficiencies, discrepancies
between datasets, and an inability to harness the full potential of interconnected datasets. Our innovative
proposal involves the use of WUVAX, a modern, cloud-based system. Instead of separate databases, all data in
WUVAX is integrated, updated in real-time, and made directly accessible to investigators.
A simplified user interface where data and progress for Projects 1-4 and Cores C-E can be visualized and
assessed in real time will inform investigators of the progress of research within the Center. Metrics will be
displayed in a user-friendly manner involving graphs, charts, tables and project time-lines. We will develop and
implement a library on the WUVAX application where documentation, manuscript drafts, Center policies, reports,
datasets, etc. will be stored. The Core B team is skilled in various data analysis methods, including basic
univariate analyses (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests), advanced multivariable techniques (e.g., generalized linear
models), and machine-learning approaches (e.g., classification trees, random forests). Core B will apply these
skills to offer analytical support to the Projects and Cores. The Data Management Core-B will also interface
directly with the overall ReVAMPP network Coordinating and Data Sharing Center (ReVAMPP CDSC) so that
data is acquired and disseminated within the overall network, its partners, and the scientific community."
10863694,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Core C: Structure Core
Structure-based vaccine antigen design is a key component of the prototype pathogen approach to pandemic
preparedness. For each prototype pathogen, vaccine developers must choose which viral protein(s) to include
in the vaccine as well as which form of the viral proteins to present to the immune system to elicit the optimal
immune response. Structural biology provides atomic-level information on viral glycoproteins, which is essential
for initiating the rational design of engineered vaccine antigens. Structural information is also crucial for
evaluating the engineered antigens, ensuring that the modifications and stabilizing substitutions produce the
intended effect. Additionally, structural biology plays a vital role in elucidating the epitopes and binding
mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies. This knowledge guides the design of antigens capable of binding to the
most promising antibodies, thereby eliciting an effective immune response. Antigen design, production,
characterization and structural biology will be performed in Core C: Structure as services to enable the Research
Projects to accomplish their objectives.
 Core C will be led by Dr. Jason McLellan at the University of Texas at Austin, who is an expert in structural
virology and the development of structure-based interventions for viral pathogens. His laboratory has expertise
in the determination of viral protein structures and antibody complexes by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.
The McLellan laboratory also has extensive experience in protein engineering, expression, and purification. Dr.
Daisy Leung and her team will contribute to the biophysical characterization of antigens and antigen–antibody
complexes, and Dr. Anne Moscona and Dr. Tara Marcink will perform cryo-ET studies on whole virions to provide
structural information on higher-order glycoprotein assemblies and antibody interactions. One of the key services
provided by Core C is the rational and computational design of viral proteins to serve both as vaccine
antigens as well as bait for antibody isolation efforts. The second key service is the determination of structures
of viral glycoproteins, both alone and in complex with antibodies. These structures will provide the atomic-level
information required for structure-based antigen design, aid the characterization of antigen variants, define
antibody epitopes, and provide insights into mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization. As part of the
antigen design and development process, Core C will also express and purify viral proteins and variants
thereof. These proteins will also be rigorously assessed by Core C via biophysical methods, and those deemed
to be of sufficient quality and stability will be provided to the Research Projects and Cores to facilitate their
investigations. Collectively, the services provided by Core C will directly contribute to the development of vaccine
concepts, antigens, and antibodies that will inform development of medical countermeasures against
paramyxoviruses and bunyaviruses."

Core D: Antibody Core
Washington University (Ellebedy, Ali)
Respiroviruses, Rubulaviruses, Peribunyaviruses, and Phenuiviruses present major health burdens and have
pandemic potential. There are no preventative or therapeutic measures against most of the viruses in these
families. Infection with these families of viruses induces neutralizing antibodies against the viral surface envelope
glycoproteins, but key knowledge gaps remain with respect to the epitopes targeted by these antibody
responses. Dissecting protective antibody responses to identify the components that confer protection and the
components that are specific to particular viruses, virus families, or that recognize viruses across families is
critical to understanding how to most effectively target viruses that may emerge from these families in the future.
The central goal of the Antibody Core (Core D) is to generate large panels of recombinant monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) targeting the surface envelope glycoproteins of two candidate prototype viruses from each of
these families. Structural and functional analyses of these mAbs will be carried out in collaboration with the four
Projects and Cores C-Structure and E-Correlates, and will aid in understanding the specificity of the human
B cell response against these viruses and inform rational immunogen design against their viral families.
Furthermore, Core D-Antibody will generate and identify combinations of potently neutralizing mAbs with
intrinsically high barriers to resistance in collaboration with each of the four Projects and Cores C-Structure
and E-Correlates for potential therapeutic use. Core D-Antibody will use both conventional single-cell sorting
and single-cell RNA sequencing-based approaches to generate the mAbs. Our core will adapt its B cell sorting
strategies to accommodate targeting new epitopes or utilizing altered antigen probes that are identified in the
structural and functional analyses. In summary, state-of-the-art technologies will be used to generate novel
human mAbs targeting each of the candidate prototype viruses, and their functional and structural
characterization will generate new insights for the development of rationally designed vaccine candidates and
potentially identify therapeutically useful mAb candidates to protect against these potentially emerging viral
families."
10863697,"Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is the P1-Respiroviruses prototype for advancement of vaccines
and therapeutic antibodies against respiroviruses due to the advanced state of knowledge of structure and
function of the viral surface proteins: HN (receptor-binding protein; hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and F (fusion
protein). Respirovirus HN and F form a functional complex on the virus surface and mediate entry by fusing the
viral envelope directly with the cell membrane. Structural transitions in the HN/F complex during sequential
steps of entry will be characterized using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography (cryo-ET) to
identify optimal antigenic targets for respirovirus vaccines and antibodies. HPIV3 and human parainfluenza
virus type 1 (HPIV1) bracket the diversity of known respiroviruses making HPIV1 ideal for testing strategies
established with HPIV3. We will determine the utility of each surface glycoprotein as a target for immunity and
how best to present the antigen(s) by evaluating three vaccine platforms (subunit, mRNA, rVSV).
Aim 1: Define structure-function relationships of HN and F and extend the findings from prototype
HPIV3 to HPIV1. Structures of HN, F, and HN/F complexes and their intermediates for the prototype
respirovirus HPIV3 will be obtained to address gaps in basic understanding of the functions of the envelope
proteins in viral entry and assembly, reveal essential functional interactions between the proteins, and inform
immunogen design for vaccines and antibodies. Immunogenicity of proteins will be assessed in mice and
iterated back to antigen design. Results will be extended to HPIV1 to assess generalizability.
Aim 2: Identify monoclonal antibodies to prototype respirovirus HPIV3 HN and F with a high genetic
barrier to resistance and assess the generalizability of strategies using HPIV1. We will produce HPIV3-
binding mAbs from human B cells, compare their binding affinity, epitopes, and neutralization potencies;
identify neutralization mechanisms, leveraging mAbs that bind one or both proteins, different domains, and
different intermediate states of HN/F during entry; and evaluate mechanisms of escape. Abs that block critical
entry functions of HN/F, are protective, and have a high genetic barrier to resistance will be assessed for in
vivo protective/therapeutic capacity. Antigens that elicit such desirable antibodies will iteratively aid vaccine
antigen design. HPIV3-based approaches will be generalized and tested against HPIV1.
Aim 3: Comparison of vaccine platforms expressing HPIV3 HN, F, or HN/F complex. Immunogenicity of
mRNA- and VSV-expressed vaccine candidates will be evaluated in mice and compared to subunit antigens.
All three vaccine platforms (subunit, mRNA, rVSV) will be assessed for efficacy in cotton rats (HPIV3 model),
with iteration back to Aims 1 and 2. Generalizability of each platform design will be determined with HPIV1.
The results will define optimal immunogens and vaccine platforms for respiroviruses and inform the
development of vaccines against other paramyxovirus family members."

pathogen to study paramyxoviruses because we have a human vaccine that elicits protective humoral immunity
directed to undefined target(s). P2-Rubulaviruses dissects the structure and functions of the F and HN
glycoproteins in entry and as antigens. The goal is to identify a general strategy for stabilization of the pre-fusion
form of the F glycoprotein and move this and the HN glycoprotein forward, either individually or in complex as
vaccine candidates using established in vivo models. In Aim 1 rational antigen design builds upon existing head
domain structure of HN adding regions of the stalk and generates new structures of stabilized, pre-fusion F
glycoprotein. This is augmented by cryoelectron tomography (Cryo-ET) to study the interactions of the native
F/HN complex on the virion. The immunogenicity of individual and glycoprotein pairs will be assessed in vivo to
iteratively inform design, and the results tested in divergent rubulaviruses. In Aim 2 we isolate single B cells from
vaccines and characterize the mAbs to further inform immunogen design. The mechanism of action of the mAbs
will be assessed in vitro using a combination of assays including virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. Their individual
and synergistic activities will be determined and ability to protect animals from infection and disease evaluated
in a cotton rat respiratory system model. Genetic barriers to escape from neutralization will be defined to reveal
how rapidly resistance mutations are acquired and their location(s) in the glycoproteins. Extension of this work
by immunization of a humanized mouse with bat mumps (BatMuV) will extend the findings to related
rubulaviruses considered to represent “pre-spillover” pathogens poised with pandemic potential. Lead
immunogens are evaluated in Aim 3 for in vivo for efficacy as soluble-adjuvated proteins, mRNAs and within the
context of a replication-competent rVSV-expressing both glycoproteins. Identification of correlates of protection
will facilitate iterative analysis of next generation immunogens and may identify an optimal platform. The
P2-Rubulaviruses project has exceptionally strong synergy with P1-Respiroviruses which will rapidly enable
go/no-go decision making and contribute to down-selection and prioritization of mAbs and immunogens for a
pathway to industrial translation. Similarly, the cross-talk between the data obtained from these two projects
using the three vaccine platforms will be useful to drive existing and develop new collaborations with partners in
industry."
10863699,"SUMMARY.
The long term goals of Project 3 of the Respiro, Rubula, Peribunya, Phenui (R2P2) ReVAMPP are to use a
prototype pathogen approach to identify and validate generalizable vaccine strategies against peribunyaviruses,
and advance therapeutically useful monoclonal antibodies (mAb). To achieve those goals, we selected
Oropouche virus (OROV) as the prototype and will test our findings by extension into La Crosse virus (LACV).
A central goal of this project is to understand how to stabilize the pre-fusion form of the class II fusogen Gc to
determine whether principles successfully employed for class I fusogens and their advancement as vaccines
can be leveraged to stabilize class II fusion machines. In doing so, we will generate foundational mechanistic
knowledge regarding the structure and functions of the the attachment protein (Gn) and the fusion protein (Gc)
in viral entry and as immunogens, that will also inform the optimal targets for therapeutic antibodies. In
preliminary studies we identify viral entry factors including proteinaceous receptors in the LDL receptor
superfamily, extending mechanistic parallels with studies of the Phenuiviridae in Project 4 of R2P2-ReVAMPP.
In Aim 1, in conjunction with Core C Structure, we conduct a systematic structural and functional analysis of Gn
and Gc to help inform those regions of Gn and Gc recognized by the human immune system capitalizing on the
2,500 monoclonal antibodies obtained from PBMC of convalescent humans generated in Aim 2 in conjunction
with Core D Antibody. This knowledge will be leveraged to optimize the regions of Gn and Gc as immunogens.
In aim 2, we interrogate the mechanism of action of those antibodies in vitro will be examined using a suite of
assays to identify subsets that are neutralizing and define the precise steps at which they interfere with infection.
Understanding the mechanism of neutralization will permit us to determine whether there are correlates between
mechanism, genetic barriers to viral resistance, and optimal efficacy of antibodies in vivo. In Aim 3, we will
iteratively test optimized immunogens as both protein subunit and mRNA-LNP vaccines and extend our work on
VSV-vectored OROV vaccines, testing their efficacy in small animal challenge studies. This work will leverage
the full power and expertise of Core E-Correlates to identify the correlates of protection against infection, and
against disease. The close relationship between P3 and P4, ensures direct comparison of the extent to which a
prototype peribunyavirus informs the related studies of phenuiviruses and vice-versa, bringing exceptionally
strong synergy between the two projects that will accelerate go/no-go decision making."
10863700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Prototype pathogens are those that, if well-characterized, can be used to develop generalizable medical
countermeasures (MCMs) against new or unknown but related viruses. In 2021, NIAID convened a panel of
subject matter experts to delineate prototype pathogens across several viral families. Rift Valley fever virus
(RVFV), Toscana virus (TOSV), and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) were named
key prototype pathogens for the Phenuiviridae family. Whether generalizable vaccine approaches will work
for virus families such as Phenuiviridae is unknown. The goal of P4-Phenuiviridae is to study two prototype
phenuiviruses in parallel – RVFV and TOSV - using similar systems and approaches, draw conclusions on what
is and is unable to be generalized between the two viruses, and extend our observations into a more distantly
related phenuivirus (SFTSV). A major gap in the field, which hampers generalizable vaccine development, is
a lack of knowledge of commonalities in viral glycoprotein Gn/Gc structure and function across members of the
family and the therapeutic potential of targeting common epitopes within the viral glycoproteins. As part of this
U19, we assembled a unique team with extensive experience in RVFV, TOSV, structural biology, biochemistry,
vaccine development, and mAb identification to significantly enhance NIAID’s prototype portfolio. We will use
parallel approaches to understand the basic biology of RVFV and TOSV Gn/Gc structure and function, and to
identify commonalities and differences to inform immunogenicity, mAb identification, and vaccinology. Our Aims
are: 1) Understand Gn/Gc structure and function to inform stabilized immunogen design; 2) Reverse design of
Phenuivirus Gn/Gc antigens through mAb isolation and epitope mapping; and 3) Compare efficacy of mRNA,
stabilized glycoprotein, and VSV-based vaccines across prototype Phenuiviruses. We will accomplish these aims
by working in synergy with the Cores and other Projects within this Center. Our deliverables will be a
generalizable approach for vaccine and therapeutic antibody development for Phenuiviruses. By studying both
RVFV and TOSV in parallel, we have the unique ability to curate a more solidly generalizable platform and propel
the field forward in ways previously not feasible."
10859508,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes are hallmarks of a variety of deadly cancers, including
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and T cell lymphoma. Mutant
IDH enzymes drive cancer through an unusual mechanism – they produce a metabolite called 2-
hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that poisons gene expression machinery and locks malignant cells in a stem cell-like
state. Drugs that inhibit mutant IDH enzymes induce durable clinical responses in some patients with IDH-
mutant cancers, leading to FDA approvals for AML and cholangiocarcinoma. However, despite near universal
inhibition of 2HG production, over half of patients do not respond to IDH inhibitors. Even for patients who
initially respond to IDH inhibitors, most eventually acquire resistance to the drugs. While the mechanisms of
resistance to IDH inhibitors remain incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that acquisition of
specific co-occurring mutations during tumor evolution results in a loss of dependence on 2HG. Therefore, we
need new treatment approaches that target IDH mutations in different ways beyond simple inhibition of
the enzyme. We previously identified an unusual pattern of resistance mutations in the dimer interface of
mitochondrial IDH2 wherein they occur in trans (on the other allele) relative to the 2HG-producing active-site
mutation. Here, we show that in contrast to the in trans mutations that drive drug resistance, forced expression
of a dimer-interface mutation in cis with the active-site mutation resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and
impaired growth of leukemia cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that the in cis dimer-
interface mutation enabled IDH2 to aberrantly use NADH as an additional cofactor and dramatically enhanced
production of 2HG. Seeking to exploit the toxicity exerted by the in cis dimer-interface mutation, we performed
a chemical screen and identified small molecules capable of mimicking this aberrant enzymatic activity with
selective toxicity towards IDH2-mutant leukemia cells. Thus, we hypothesize that hyperactivation (rather
than inhibition) of mutant IDH offers an unexpected and effective new strategy to target IDH-mutant
cancers. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use enzyme assays and
structural approaches to elucidate the biochemical basis for mutant IDH2 hyperactivation. Aim 2 will employ in
vitro and in vivo cancer models to define the mechanisms of toxicity arising from hyperactivation of mutant
IDH2. Aim 3 will utilize biochemical and functional approaches to determine if the approach of hyperactivation
can applied to cytosolic IDH1 mutations. The proposed studies will reshape our understanding of the
oncogenic properties of 2HG and the biochemistry of neomorphic IDH activation. More fundamentally, this
work will demonstrate the feasibility of an entirely novel hyperactivation approach as a strategy to harness
oncogene-mediated toxicity that could be applied to a wide range of oncogenes and cancer contexts."
10859607,"Meibomian gland disease (MGD) is considered the leading cause of dry eye disease, a common multifactorial
disease with a global prevalence of 5 to 50% and a major age-related disease of the ocular surface. Meibomian
glands (MG) are modified sebaceous glands that line the margin of the eyelid, secrete lipids at the ocular surface,
and participate in increasing the stability of the tear film. MGs are holocrine glands, which implies they are
continually renewed since they deliver their secretory product, called meibum, by apoptosis. Thus, regulation of
MG stem cells is crucial to ensure the proper function of MGs. With the aging process or disease condition, MGs
can progressively lose their renewal capability and regress to an atrophic state. The pathogenesis of MGD and
the mechanisms by which aging affects the renewal process remain largely unknown. Treatment options are
currently limited mainly due to the lack of clear therapeutic targets and effective drug delivery strategies targeting
the tissue of MGs. Thus, there is a critical need to understand signaling cascades underlying the renewal process
of the MG that can be pharmacologically targeted to treat MGD. Our recent advances, with the aid of an NIH/NEI
R21 (EY030661), have led us to discover a novel role of the primary cilium in MG development and maintenance
suggesting a role of HH in the this process. The Hedgehog (HH) pathway plays a fundamental role in tissue
development, homeostasis, and repair, including adult stem cell maintenance. To determine the therapeutic
potential of targeting the HH pathway to treat MGD, we will investigate its role in MG development, maintenance,
and renewal and trace the cell lineage of HH-responsive cells involved in MG homeostasis. We will target the
HH pathway in mice using genetic and pharmacological HH modulators to improve age-related MGD. If
successful, the outcome of this work will reveal mechanistic insights into MG renewal and define a novel
paradigm for how to approach novel treatment strategies for MGD."
10861387,"Recovery of hand function is a top priority for survivors of stroke and spinal cord injury, yet most have
unresolved impairments that disrupt their ability to function independently in everyday life. Rates of recovery
associated with traditional rehabilitation are low, emphasizing the need for adjunct therapies that improve
functions impaired by injury. Pairing stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) with task repetition has been shown
to enhance outcomes, but VNS requires implantation procedures that are invasive and costly. There is
evidence to support that vagal nerve fibers innervate the skin of the external ear, providing a potential
noninvasive, affordable alternative to implantable VNS. Whether transcutaneous auricular “vagus nerve”
stimulation (taVNS) enhances motor learning is not well understood. Moreover, where and how stimulation
should be administered are recognized barriers to clinical translation.
The objectives of this proposal are to:
1) Identify the pupil-indexed site on the external ear for taVNS, and
2) Evaluate placebo-controlled effects of taVNS timing and intensity on motor learning.
To accomplish the first objective, pupil diameter will be recorded while brief pulse trains of electrical current are
applied to putative sites of vagal innervation on the external ear. Pupil dilation is an autonomic response
reflecting physiological brain states that support learning. The site on the external ear where stim-evoked pupil
dilations are elicited most readily will be targeted during training on a motor task. To accomplish the second
objective, individuals will be randomized into one of five groups in which stimulation amplitudes below or above
perceptual threshold are administered at the same time or after performance criteria are met during individual
repetitions on the trained motor task. Stimulating electrodes will be placed on the ear in a control/sham group,
but no stimulation will be administered. Learning will be inferred from changes in performance relative to
baseline one week and one month following the final training session.
Knowledge gained from this project will be used to guide future therapeutic trials that examine effects of taVNS
to improve functions impaired by neurological injury. Results will also inform the use of taVNS to treat
symptoms associated with other clinical disorders prevalent in U.S. Veterans and for applications that seek to
enhance human learning and performance."
10861134,"30-50% of cancer survivors who have completed treatment with curative intent have untreated insomnia. Cancer
survivors from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds experience a higher prevalence of insomnia (vs. non-
Hispanic white cancer survivors) yet are underrepresented in cancer survivorship research and sleep clinical trials.
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a first line, evidence-based treatment. Meta-analyses by our
group and others have found medium effect size improvements on insomnia, yet barriers to feasibility due to
current delivery modalities and lack of targeted content addressing cancer-related barriers to sleep hinder
retention. Our study team developed a synchronous, virtual CBT-I for cancer survivors with 4 weekly sessions
delivered to individuals (Survivorship Sleep Program; SSP) and conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial
demonstrating feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy vs. enhanced usual care up to 1-month post-
intervention. However, participants desired enhanced emotional support via a group format or booster sessions,
and additional outcomes (emotional distress, work-related functioning, use of sleep medications) were
unchanged or not assessed. In response to PAR-21-341, the primary aim of this resubmission is to optimize
synchronous, virtual delivery of the SSP in a 2x2 factorial trial (N=80 cancer survivors with insomnia) to
evaluate 2 intervention design components: delivery (individual vs. group) and booster sessions (0 vs. 3). The
primary outcome is change in insomnia severity from baseline (T0) to 1-month surveillance/booster 1 (T2).
Exploratory Aim 1 will characterize study participation and sleep outcomes by race and by ethnicity. Feasibility
benchmarks established in our previous pilot trial for enrollment (56% enrolled/eligible), retention (90% per
timepoint), and attendance (100%) will be examined by race and by ethnicity. Primary and secondary
(emotional distress, work-related functioning, use of sleep medications, sleep diaries, actigraphy) outcomes
across timepoints (T0-T3; 3-months surveillance/booster 3) will be explored by race and by ethnicity.
Exploratory Aim 2 will characterize the acceptability of the SSP design components via exit interviews
assessed post-SSP (T1) using quantitative ratings and qualitative codes to characterize preferences,
challenges, and future delivery considerations. Collectively, this proposal is innovative through its focus on 1)
optimizing CBT-I for cancer survivors, 2) testing a scalable, virtually-delivered synchronous intervention, 3)
including key secondary outcomes relevant to cancer survivorship, and 4) engaging community partners to bolster
recruitment of racially and ethnically diverse cancer survivors. The proposed strategy is strengthened by a
transdisciplinary expert team, partnership with two community organizations serving diverse cancer survivors, a
rigorous framework for optimizing behavioral interventions (Multiphase Optimization Strategy), an evidence-
based intervention on which to make adaptations, and use of qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings will
inform an R01-level trial and recommendations for addressing insomnia after cancer."
10863932,"A group of investigators seeks to renew support for the Minnesota Muscle Training Program (MMTP), the NIH
T32 interdisciplinary training program in muscle research at the University of Minnesota, for both predoctoral
and postdoctoral scientists. This program began in 2001 with a primary focus on basic muscle research. Since
that time, UMN has placed a high priority on the expansion of muscle research at all levels, particularly
translational research, aimed at the development of new therapeutic approaches. The institution has recruited
internationally prominent researchers in muscle disease and therapy and has established new facilities that
support this research. In the previous funding period, further developments have led us to improve the quality of
an already outstanding training program (which received a perfect score of 10 in 2011 and 2016), as measured
by the funding and training records of the faculty; and by the number of qualified trainees, their publication record
during training, and their research career success after training. Program faculty are drawn from several
departments, but their graduate students are enrolled in the interdepartmental graduate programs in
Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics (BMBB) or Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and
Genetics (MCDBG), which share a common admissions program (Molecular Cellular and Structural Biology,
MCSB) and first-year curriculum. The intellectual center of the training program is an intensive one-semester
course entitled “Muscle,” directed by the MMTP Director and taught by the MMTP faculty, which emphasizes
both basic and translational research. This course has been expanded to accommodate an increasing
emphasis on muscle disease and therapy. This is augmented by a weekly Muscle Journal Club, a biweekly
internal seminar program, a monthly external seminar including international leaders in muscle research, and an
annual MMTP Symposium in which all members of the training faculty’s research groups actively present and
discuss their research, featuring a keynote speaker who is an internationally prominent muscle researcher. A
significant strength of MMTP is its leadership. The Director (Thomas), who founded the program in 2001, is a
world leader in the molecular biophysics of muscle, has had NIH funding on muscle since 1980 (including two
MERIT Awards), and has mentored more than 100 predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, most of whom have
gone on to productive independent careers in muscle research. This program will now be strengthened by MPI
structure, with Thomas joined by Ervasti and Lowe. Ervasti is a world leader in the biochemistry of muscle
disease, and is Research Director for the Muscular Dystrophy Center, which is closely associated with MMTP.
Lowe is a world expert on muscle physiology in areas of aging, disease, and gender differences. The University
provides strong institutional support for MMTP, including a generous offer of matching funds. The primary
goal of MMTP is to help these exceptional predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to develop the intellectual and
technical tools needed for productive careers as independent investigators and educators in muscle research."
10863933,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
Centromeric satellites and their binding partners are engaged in an ongoing evolutionary arms race such that
each side is continuously evolving to win the race. As a result, centromeres are one of the most divergent
genomic elements in populations, which ultimately stop exchanging genetic material and become two lineages.
Highly intractable nature of repetitive centromeric satellite harboring loci has been an impediment to
investigating the role of centromere evolution. The proposed research will test the role of centromere evolution
in lineage separation by utilizing 1) a state-of-the-art genomics-based approach to study satellite evolution 2)
geographically separated and partially reproductively isolated house mouse lineages, which serve as an ideal
system to study lineage separation 3) a candidate based evolutionarily guided approach to delineate
genetically complex process of the lineage separation.
Interestingly, binding of centromeric proteins at centromeric satellites varies between these lineages despite
the short evolutionary time after their split. This suggests that rapid divergence of centromeres in these two
evolving species have acquired functional differences, which can be measured. This work proposes that
rapidly evolving subspecies-specific variants of centromeric satellites and centromeric proteins result in
functional centromere variation between house mouse lineages. This hypothesis predicts that a cross between
these lineages generates chromosome segregation asymmetries in the hybrid meiosis due to “centromere
incompatibilities”. Taking advantage of the measurable functional divergence, this proposal aims to identify
lineage specific centromere features that contribute to the hybrid failure. Our multidisciplinary evolutionary
guided approach combines genomics, cell biology, and genetics to study incompatibilities between
centromeres of diverging lineages in the hybrid.
The proposed research will not only help in understanding the role of centromere evolution in lineage
separation but will also provide insights into the mechanisms of centromere evolution and inheritance. It will
also enhance our understanding of widespread chromosomal disorders resulting from impaired centromere
function. Centromere metabolism in cancerous cells involves expansion of satellite arrays and over-expression
of centromeric proteins and mimics centromere evolution in nature. Findings from our research will thus
provide insights into the process of centromere microevolution in cancers."
10864794,"One in every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not
survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and
Cologuard have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%.
Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient
adherence. There is clearly a need for additional biomarkers that complement existing screening procedures to
identify individuals for subsequent colonoscopy and to better understand the biology that gives rise to tumors.
Untargeted metabolomics has become an increasingly common approach to identify sources of such biomarkers
from fecal samples; however, the general approach researchers use to analyze the data excludes the 95% of
metabolites that currently lack an annotation. Animal models of CRC and human population studies have
indicated that the gut microbiota has an underappreciated role in the disease. Therefore, it is critical that we
characterize the metabolites generated by the gut microbiota to better understand the disease. The long-term
goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and our understanding of the
mechanisms that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to develop an open
source R package, mums2, that allows researchers to identify metabolic biomarkers that can be associated with
cancer regardless of whether they have already been annotated or whether they are produced by human or
microbial cells. With this package, we will incorporate tools that allow researchers to implement the current state
of the art for analyzing untargeted metabolomics and we will develop and validate methods for improving the
quantification of MS features and clustering unknown metabolites based on their structural similarity. Three
specific aims are proposed: (i) develop the mums2 R package, (ii) construct a predictive abundance algorithm
for more accurate quantification of MS feature abundance, and (iii) construct operational metabolomics units
(OMUs) as a framework for clustering unknown metabolites by structural similarity. Successful completion of
these aims will result in a new platform for analyzing CRC metabolomics data for identifying biomarkers and
understanding the underlying biology of tumorigenesis. To support this framework, we will create an open source
R package, mums2, which will be useful for the expanding cancer microbiome and biomarker community. This
package will democratize metabolomic analyses to broaden their adoption, reduce costs, improve the rigor and
reproducibility of analyses, and enhance the ability to perform untargeted metabolomics analyses using a variety
of biospecimens. Finally, the most important next step will be to apply these methods to better understand the
interaction between the metabolome, microbiome, and tumorigenesis to identify diagnostic biomarkers and better
understand the progression of CRC disease. The approaches and goals of the proposed research complement
existing Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) projects."
10863823,"Aging is a fundamental biological process and age-related diseases are the leading causes of death in modern
societies. The Brown University Training Program in the Molecular Biology of Aging (MBoA) aims to train a next
generation of scientists to attack the immensely challenging yet important task of understanding and eventually
manipulating human aging. In its first 9 years the MBoA had 4 predoctoral slots per year and has operated under
the auspices of two existing and well-established graduate programs, the Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and
Biochemistry Graduate Program (MCBGP), and the Pathobiology Graduate Program (PBGP). The MBoA has
generated much interest and has attracted very talented students. Nineteen trainees have tracked through the
MBoA since 2012 with only one attrition (5%). This cohort includes 4 URM students (21%), with 100% retention.
Eight students have graduated with an average of 4 papers each, and all remain engaged in research or science-
related careers. The MBoA has grown from 13 faculty trainers in 2012, drawn from 6 departments, to 19 current
trainers in 8 departments. This escalating interest in the biology of aging is fueled by an increasing realization
that many degenerative disorders are profoundly influenced by basic aging processes, and conversely, that
many core molecular mechanisms, such as regulation of chromatin, influence aging. Our understanding of aging
has reached a watershed in the past 10-15 years that was enabled by the increasing use of invertebrate model
organisms; Brown has a strong base of investigators applying these systems to study a diverse array of biological
questions. Brown has increased its presence in neuroscience with the 2018 naming of the Carney Institute in
Brain Science, generating new hires and heightened interest in aging biology among its faculty. Building on this
momentum we propose to increase the number of MBoA trainers to 26 and affiliate the MBoA with 3 additional
graduate programs (in neuroscience, molecular pharmacology, and biomedical engineering). We request the
continuation of our 4 predoctoral slots and the addition of 2 postdoctoral slots. The MBoA has supported its
predoctoral trainees for a period of 2 years, typically in years 2-3, which we propose to continue. We propose to
support postdoctoral trainees for 2 years during early stages of their careers (NIH levels 0-3). The MBoA is part
of the new Brown Center on the Biology of Aging (founded 2018) which supports a broad array of programming,
including a seminar series, local workshops, retreats, a graduate course on aging and an annual symposium,
providing many learning, mentoring and networking opportunities for our trainees. The MBoA is fully engaged in
initiatives across the University to build and sustain an equitable and inclusive training environment in which a
diverse group of trainees will successfully gain quantitative, conceptual, technical and professional skills that will
allow them to conduct rigorous and reproducible research. The goal of the MBoA is to provide strong academic,
experimental and career mentoring in the current landscape of molecular aging research, and thus equip our
trainees with the skills and qualifications to compete in a sustainable and diverse US biomedical workforce."
10861202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Each year, over 100,000 Veterans survive an intensive care unit (ICU) stay for critical illness, but up to
half develop devastating and persistent impairments in physical function. Rehabilitation studies have
demonstrated limited efficacy to date, and little is known about the mechanistic underpinnings that link critical
illness and persistent physical function impairment. Improved understanding of underlying mechanisms is
urgently needed to improve long-term outcomes and allow for the development of effective interventions.
 During critical illness due, patients suffer from profound impairments in energy generation in skeletal
muscle due to disruptions in oxidative phosphorylation that leads globally reduced mitochondrial oxidative
capacity. Whether mitochondrial oxidative capacity normalizes in survivors, however, is unknown. Our
preliminary data indicates that ICU survivors suffer from impaired mitochondrial oxidative capacity as a form of
bioenergetic failure that limits physical recovery months after hospitalization.
 The hypothesis for this career development proposal is that reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity in
survivors of critical illness is associated with worse physical function. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct
the “Altered energy Metabolism and PhysicaL Function in recoverY after the ICU” (AMPLiFY-ICU) prospective,
observational cohort study. We will enroll 62 Veterans who have survived critical illness and measure
mitochondrial oxidative capacity using skeletal muscle 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cell oxygen consumption via extracellular flux analysis at 3 months post-
discharge and determine their association with physical function at 6-month follow-up. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that reduced muscle-specific mitochondrial oxidative capacity, measured using 31P-MRS 3 months
post discharge is associated with worse physical function (measured by the primary outcome of six-minute
walk distance, 6MWD) at 6-month follow-up. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that reduced systemic mitochondrial
oxidative capacity measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) at 3 months post-discharge is
associated with reduced physical function at 6-month follow-up. Aim 3 will explore whether reduced mobility in
the ICU is associated with reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity (31P-MRS & PBMCs) at 3-month follow-up.
 The goal of the study outlined in this proposal is characterize the role of mitochondrial capacity on long-
term physical function after critical illness and its association with ICU mobility. This work will advance the field
by utilizing novel research approaches to characterize understudied mechanisms of physical recovery and
provide a foundation for physiologically targeted interventions. This proposal will also foster Dr. Mart’s scientific
career development by providing him the training, mentorship, and resources necessary to pursue a career
merging the insights of applied exercise physiology, critical care medicine, and functional outcomes to develop
novel therapeutic interventions. Through this award, Dr. Mart will accomplish his career development and
training objectives to develop unique expertise in: (1) longitudinal critical care studies and clinical trials, (2)
approaches to measuring physical function, (3) translational methods in applied exercise physiology research,
and (4) effective scientific and grant writing. In completing the proposed study and career development plan,
Dr. Mart will mature into a national leader on physical outcomes after critical illness with the skillset to develop
new interventions aimed at helping patients restore their function and quality of life."
10863866,"Abstract
A heme utilization protein operon hupYZ encoding periplasmic proteins has recently been identified from
Streptococcus pyogenes, a significant pathogen involved in a wide range of diseases. One of the encoded
proteins, HupZ, was initially assigned as a heme oxygenase. However, our study revealed that this weak activity
was due to a poly‐His‐tag induced structural similarity with the active site of genuine heme oxygenases. The
tag‐free HupZ does not degrade heme; however, we recently discovered that tag‐free HupZ binds FMN. The
FMN‐bound HupZ crystal structure superimposes with the biliverdin reductase (BVR) recently found in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that utilizes an F420H2 cofactor. The flavin moiety of FMN in HupZ aligns well
with the deazaflavin moiety of the F420H2 cofactor. Therefore, we propose that HupZ is a flavin/deazaflavin
oxidoreductase (FDOR) dependent BVR in the heme utilization pathway (Hup) of Streptococcus. Structural and
functional characterizations are proposed to further the molecular understanding of this Hup protein using
biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural approaches. We will interrogate how tag‐free HupZ interacts with
its cofactor and substrate, and we will determine the critical residues involved in biliverdin reduction. We will
attempt to characterize catalytic intermediates and elucidate the catalytic mechanism. Completing the
proposed biochemical and structural studies will fill the gaps in our current understanding of the heme
utilization pathway in a significant pathogen. Only a few FDOR‐dependent enzymes have been described, and
the F420H2‐dependent BVR mechanism remains to be elucidated; therefore, this work is also highly significant
to mechanistic enzymology."

 The proposed ESTEEMED Scholars Program at Louisiana State University (LSU) will ensure the
training of underrepresented (UR) minority, low-income, and disabled undergraduates for research
careers and leadership positions in the biomedical /bioengineering related disciplines. LSU has
emerged as a national model for advancing and promoting inclusion, equity, and diversity and improving
the success rates of underrepresented students. We are ranked in the top 40 of baccalaureate-origin
institutions (2007-2016) producing Black PhDs in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math),
and top 50 of baccalaureate-origin institutions producing Black PhDs in engineering. The design of our
proposed ESTEEMED program is based on evidence-based practices, previous experiences, which
have contributed to these outcomes, and guidance from nationally renowned faculty. In fact, five faculty
at LSU, including the PI and the chair of the Advisory Committee, are recipients of Presidential Awards
for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM).
 The long-term goal of the LSU ESTEEMED program is to increase the number of UR racial and
ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities who are recruited as honors students into LSU, trained in
biomedical/bioengineering-related research, and who enter into biomedical/bioengineering focused Ph.D. or

10862056,"Paralysis as a result of a spinal cord injury can severely impact activities of daily living, limit
independence, and negatively impact overall health of Veterans. Powered exoskeletons are an evolving
technology aiming to improve mobility and quality of life for individuals with paralysis. Clinical studies of users
walking with exoskeletons report a reduction in pain and spasticity and improvements to bone density and
muscle tone. Currently, commercial exoskeletons have FDA 510(k) clearances that require continuous contact
guarding or stand-by-assistance by a spotter. During instances of falling, these devices are only designed to enter
joint-locking configurations and require the user to balance themselves via crutches, a walker, or intervention from a
caregiver to prevent impact with the ground. The rationale of this CDA-1 is that the absence of safety features that
prevent falling while wearing an exoskeleton may be restricting the technology to monitored environments with
trained caregivers and be preventing their widespread use within the community. The purpose of this award is to
provide Dr. Hnat with the required training to become a successful researcher within the VA system and to lead
her towards achieving her long term goal of designing an exoskeleton that detects destabilizations and
prevents falls from occuring. The current proposal addresses the candidate’s short term goals regarding the
issue of falling with powered exoskeletons by exploring configurations to reduce the impact with the ground and the
potential of injury should a fall occur. The proposed work is immediately translatable into a hybrid neuroprosthesis
resulting from the primary mentor’s funded research (Dr. Ronald Triolo) and will serve as preliminary data for
subsequent CDA-2 and VA Merit Award proposals.
 The project goals will be achieved through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 includes a series of able-
bodied walking experiments while wearing an exoskeleton while experiencing a slip or trip on an instrumented
treadmill. A Fall Classification Algorithm (FCA) will predict the occurrence and classify the type of a fall
using center of mass kinematics measured from the experiments. Specific Aim 2 focuses on identifying the
exoskeletal configurations that minimize the magnitudes and locations of impact forces on the user and
applying this information to design an Impact Mitigation Controller (IMC) that reconfigures the exoskeleton’s
joint angles into these safer configurations. Optimizations of a 3D musculoskeletal model developed in the
OpenSim Modeling Suite will minimize the impact forces at the head, joints (neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip,
knee, and ankle), and long bones. These experiments will be repeated on an instrumented crash-test dummy
and the potential for injury of the reconfigured positions will be statistically compared to the baselines. The
trained FCA and IMC will be validated in real-time in a repeated set of experiments with able-bodied
participants.
 All studies will be performed at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center in facilities associated
with Advanced Platform Technology Center, such as the Motion Study Laboratory directed by Dr. Triolo. Dr.
Hnat has identified multiple training aims within her proposal, including developing musculoskeletal models and
performing optimizations with them, designing experiments that represent realistic falling scenarios, learning
and applying statistical analyses to collected data, practicing hardware design and implementation, and
understanding the challenges experienced by individuals with SCI. The mentoring team she has assembled is
well equipped to help the candidate achieve the training aims outlined within this proposal as well as transition
to a successful independent researcher in rehabilitative technologies."
10823619,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Formation of disease-associated autoantibodies (Abs), including anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and
rheumatoid factor (RF), is an early step in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In fact, RA-Abs can
develop several years before the onset of joint inflammation during a preclinical phase of RA development. Our
preliminary data found that the presence of RA-Abs in sputum during preclinical RA is strongly associated with
development of classified RA in 3 years. Yet, there is a major gap in our understanding of the cellular mecha-
nisms leading to RA-Ab generation in the lung in preclinical RA. The overall hypothesis of the proposed project
is that CD4+PDhiCXCR5- T peripheral helper (Tph) cells and CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes in the lung
contribute to the sputum RA-Ab generation that predicts transition from preclinical to classifiable RA. This hy-
pothesis is based on our published and preliminary data including our finding that Tph cells and CD14+CD16+
monocytes are increased in the peripheral blood of individuals At-Risk for RA (i.e., in the preclinical phase of
RA based on serum anti-CCP positivity) compared to controls. Tph cells are known to promote B cell differenti-
ation and antibody production in inflamed non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lung. Moreover, we found in pre-
liminary data that sputum RA-Ab levels strongly correlated with sputum IL-6 levels, which can promote B cell
differentiation and antibody production and can be produced at high levels by CD14+CD16+ monocytes. The
proposed ancillary studies will leverage induced sputum samples already being collected as part of an ongoing
parent R01 study. This 1-year study will include individuals At-Risk for RA, individuals with classified RA and
healthy controls. The study will quantify the proportion of T and B cell subsets, including Tph cells, in sputum
using flow cytometry. In At-Risk subjects, the % Tph cells will be correlated with levels of sputum RA-Abs and
Tph-associated cytokines (IL-21, CXCL13). T cell subsets will also be sorted by FACS and undergo bulk RNA
sequencing. It is expected that sputum Tph cells will be increased in individuals At-Risk for RA, correlate with
sputum RA-Abs and have a distinct transcriptional profile reflecting a role in B cell differentiation and antibody
production. The proposed project will also quantify the proportion of monocyte and macrophage subsets in
sputum using flow cytometry. In At-Risk subjects, the % CD14+CD16+ monocytes in sputum will be correlated
with levels of sputum RA-Abs and IL-6. Bulk RNA sequencing will be performed on monocyte and macro-
phage subsets isolated by FACS. It is expected that sputum CD14+CD16+ monocytes will be increased in indi-
viduals At-Risk for RA, correlate with sputum RA-Abs and have a distinct transcriptional profile associated with
IL-6 production. Altogether, this proposal will further the strategic vision of the NIH by investigating novel cellu-
lar mechanisms in the lung that contribute to the RA-Ab generation associated with transition from preclinical to
classified RA and could serve as novel cellular targets for disease prevention in RA."
10823706,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite evidence that half of all surgical site infections (SSIs) may be preventable, SSIs continue to increase in
the United States and are a substantial cause of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. There is a lack of
evidence-based guidelines for pediatric SSI prevention. Previous efforts to identify pediatric risk factors to
inform actionable recommendations have been limited by small sample sizes and data availability. There is an
urgent need to provide clinicians with evidence-based, individualized SSI risk and prevention
recommendations to optimize patient care, reduce infection risk, and improve shared decision making and
informed consent for children and families undergoing surgery. The objective of this proposal is to harness
the power of machine learning to generate SSI risk prediction models using electronic health record
(EHR) data to inform pediatric SSI care and the design of an EHR-based clinical decision support tool.
This study will leverage a large national pediatric surgical dataset to train, validate, and test statistical and
machine learning algorithms that will then be applied to an external test set from Stanford Medicine Children’s
Health to evaluate performance and applicability for real-world clinical care (Aim 1). The investigators will then
apply human-centered design to create and test the usability of an EHR-embedded clinical decision support
tool prototype that provides clinicians with real-time, evidence-based SSI risk estimations and prevention
guidance (Aim 2). The long-term goal of this project is to produce a clinical decision support tool that will be
ready for prospective testing to augment real-time SSI prevention decision making to help clinicians care for
surgical patients with higher reliability using evidence-based, patient-specific actions. This research will support
NICHD’s focus on disease prevention and health promotion efforts through improving early detection of
children at risk for infection, optimizing timing of prevention efforts, and ultimately preventing adverse health
outcomes from SSI. The methods employed in this study will also advance NICHD’s aspirational goals to
leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence for precision medicine. The proposed training, guided by
an expert mentorship team, will enrich the applicant’s skills in machine learning and prediction, translational
data science for precision health, and clinical informatics and technology implementation. The applicant will
benefit from interdisciplinary expertise, directed mentorship, and coursework from both the University of
California, San Francisco and Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, two world-class research and clinical
environments. This research and training will prepare the applicant for a future career as an independent
researcher focused on optimizing pediatric health through evidence-based EHR tools with real-word impact on
patient care and outcomes."

 Understanding of the complex network of microbial interactions in the microbiome is integral to human health.
While most microbiome studies have focused on bacterial communities, recent metagenomic analyses report
that archaea comprise a significant percentage of the microbes living in and on our bodies. Yet, little is known
about the impacts of archaea and archaeal signaling in the human microbiome. In this proposal, I aim to study
cell signaling in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. In culture, H. volcanii cells at early-log phase are rod-
shaped, which then transition to pleomorphic disks in mid- to late-log phase. Cells stab-inoculated into soft agar
plates can form swimming motility halos, with motile rod-shaped cells at the edge and sessile disk-shaped cells
at the center. Applying cell-free conditioned media (CM) from a late-log culture to a fresh H. volcanii culture
results in exclusively disk-shaped cells at early-log phase. Moreover, when CM is incorporated into soft agar
plates, wildtype H. volcanii does not form a motility halo and instead grows as a nonmotile colony at the site of
stab-inoculation. These results suggest that a secreted signaling molecule in the CM mediates the shape change
and inhibits motility. I have coined the term Disk Forming Signal (DFS) to describe this signaling molecule.
Additionally, mutant strains lacking the protein CirA seem to bypass DFS, remaining as rods throughout growth
in culture and forming motility halos in soft agar supplemented with CM. Interestingly, several mutant strains that
have a disrupted cirA also harbor point mutations in arlI and arlJ, two biosynthesis genes of the archaella, the
archaeal flagella analog. Since cirA is in the same genomic region as arlI and arlJ, a potential link could exist
between CirA and the archaella in motility regulation in response to DFS signaling. In the proposed study, I
aim to discover components of a novel H. volcanii signaling mechanism. I will identify the structure of
DFS via analytical chemistry techniques and investigate the genes involved in DFS biosynthesis by
screening an H. volcanii transposon library. Additionally, I will characterize the role of CirA in the DFS
signal transduction pathway via quantitative proteomics and protein-protein interaction studies between
CirA, ArlI, and ArlJ. Discovering the identity of a signaling molecule produced by H. volcanii, along with defining
the proteins involved in its synthesis, recognition, and response will broaden our understanding of microbial
communities in the healthy human microbiome, begin to unravel the intricacies of signaling among all three
domains of life, and lead to applications of archaeal physiology in medicine and industry."

The bone marrow microenvironment most likely plays a significant role in promoting B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL) survival, progression, and escape from treatment. Our preliminary studies utilized single-cell
profiling approaches to comprehensively map the primary human B-ALL bone marrow immune
microenvironment throughout three distinct stages of the disease: diagnosis, remission and relapse.
Importantly, we uncovered a role for leukemia-associated monocyte subpopulations in B-ALL survival,
demonstrating that monocyte abundance at diagnosis is predictive of pediatric and adult B-ALL patient
outcomes. Using a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidics-based organotypic device, we show that human B-ALL
blasts alter a vascularized microenvironment to promote monocytic differentiation and depletion of leukemia
associated myeloid cells in Ph+ B-ALL animal models leads to prolonged disease remission in vivo. This project
will determine the precise origins and function of nonclassical monocytes in supporting B-ALL survival and,
ultimately, target leukemia-supporting monocytes to enhance the efficacy of existing ALL therapy. To achieve
this, we will use two-photon live-imaging to assess nonclassical monocytes' behavior within the leukemic
niche. We will then take advantage of murine strains lacking nonclassical monocytes, as well as established
single-cell profiling approaches, to assess monocyte abundance's impact on the remodeling of a vascularized
leukemic niche in vivo. We will expand our flow cytometric analysis of large cohorts of primary pediatric B-ALL
patient samples to establish the association between monocyte abundance, monocyte differentiation state, and
patient treatment outcome through a collaboration with pediatric leukemia experts, Drs. Karen Rabin (Baylor
University/Texas Children's Hospital) and Charles Mullighan (St Jude Children's Hospital). Finally, murine and
human xenograft pre-clinical in vivo B-ALL platforms to determine the impact of depleting leukemia-supporting
monocytes (anti-CSF1R therapy) in combination with conventional B-ALL chemotherapy on B-ALL survival.
These findings will ultimately provide the basis for clinical trials combining CSF1R inhibition with existing B-ALL
therapeutics. This proposal outlines my career development plan for obtaining the necessary preparation to
transition into a successful independent investigator. My postdoctoral supervisor, Dr. Iannis Aifantis, fully
supports my distinct research program. My ongoing training with experts in nonclassical monocyte biology (Dr.
Hedricks, La Jolla Institute for Immunology), live in vivo two-photon microscopy (David Fooksman, Albert
Einstein) and single-cell bioinformatics (Dr. Tsirigos, NYU Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories) will provide the
essential knowledge to accomplish my long-term scientific goals. Collectively, the proposed research and
career development plans will generate data with a significant impact on immune-based therapies in pediatric
leukemia and provide the basis of my future research as an independent researcher."
10932327,"Project Summary - Overall
 According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, foodborne illness is
common, costly, and preventable. CDC estimates that each year 1 in 6 Americans get sick from contaminated
food or beverages and 3,000 die from foodborne illness. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that
foodborne illnesses cost the United States more than $15.6 billion each year.1 Even with the advancements
made to improve food safety systems in the U.S., the occurrence of illness and injury is still too high.
 The purpose of this funding is to advance efforts for a nationally and fully integrated food safety system
(IFSS) that reduces the risk-factors associated with foodborne illness and outbreak, lowers the occurrence of
illness, and protects public health. Maintaining conformance with the most current version of the Manufactured
Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) is a critical component to achieving full integration and helps
better direct regulatory activities to reduce the foodborne illness hazards in plants that manufacture, process,
pack, or hold foods. Additionally, this funding will support Georgia’s Food Safety and Defense Task Force
(GaFSTF) and its diverse membership responsible for promoting integration through an efficient statewide
human and animal food protection system that is focused on preparation and readiness with its key players
before food-related incidents occur.
 Aims for this project include: 1) maintaining conformance with the most current version of the MFRPS;
2) providing FDA the foundation for improving contracts, inspections, investigations and enforcement to
effectively and efficiently protect public health; 3) applying the MFRPS response, enforcement and regulatory
framework to conduct follow-up inspections, investigations, and enforcement actions for positive and violative
samples and coordinate with the rapid response team as needed; and 4) supporting the GaFSTF to maximize
the protection of public health. For MFRPS, we plan to maintain conformance with the MFRPS, develop
information that can be shared and duplicated on a national basis, attend the annual face-to-face meeting,
participate in MFRPS initiatives that support the IFSS, maintain the food safety inspectional contract in good
standing, participate in work planning/sharing and develop capabilities for data sharing/exchange with FDA,
identify infrastructure needs and adopt applicable FSMA rules, propose how novel capabilities will be
maintained after the project concludes, maintain an information sharing agreement, and coordinate response
and compliance follow-up on laboratory samples in real-time with the FDA. For the task force project, we plan
to convene a GaFSTF annual meeting and a governance meeting yearly to inform, educate, and solicit input
from our stakeholders, report quantified metrics and measurable impact, and submit copies of presentations,
job aids, educational resources and other materials developed to the FDA Office of Partnerships annually."
10826765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual disability worldwide, resulting in a
significant medical and social burden. While the pathogenesis of AMD is multifactorial, dysfunction of the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) contributes early to the progression of the disease.
The RPE is a post-mitotic epithelial monolayer that is essential in maintaining the health and proper function of
the adjacent photoreceptors. The RPE performs several functions, which include nutrient delivery, regeneration
of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal for phototransduction, and phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer
segments (POS). In fact, the RPE is the most actively phagocytic cell in the human body, engulfing and
processing up to 10% of spent POS every day to avoid accumulation of harmful photooxidative products.
Therefore, it is critical to understand age-related changes in RPE physiology; however, the role of lipid
metabolism in regulating these changes has yet to be fully understood. It is becoming increasingly clear that
alterations in lipid metabolism occur during aging across several tissues. In particular, the eye is highly enriched
in docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs), which play key
roles in maintaining cellular membrane homeostasis. Recent research has correlated decreased levels of DHA
and VLC-PUFAs with advanced age, and this decrease was further amplified in AMD eyes. A separate study
has also linked a decline in RPE phagocytic function during aging, which also declined even further in AMD eyes.
Thus, this proposal will investigate the mechanistic basis for age-related changes in RPE lipid metabolism and
their influence on cell function. To pursue these objectives, we have generated Elovl2C234W mice, which lack
Elovl2 enzymatic activity and exhibit decreased levels of DHA and VLC-PUFAs. Elovl2C234W mice also show
accumulation of sub-RPE deposits with similar composition to drusen, one of the hallmarks of non-neovascular,
or dry, AMD. The retinal structure, visual function, visual cycle activity, and phagocytic ability of mutant mice will
be assessed at several ages. Changes in gene expression resulting from lack of Elovl2 activity will be analyzed
by bulk and single cell RNA sequencing in RPE and retina. Lastly, we will correlate findings from mouse RPE to
results from human RPE through the culture of RPE cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.
This proposal will be completed under the mentorship of Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD and co-mentorship
of Krzysztof Palczewsk, PhD in the Center for Translational Vision Research at the University of California, Irvine.
The scientific training will also be supported by the Department of Physiololgy & Biophysics, the Medical Scientist
Training Program, and collaborators and mentors from external institutions. The training plan details specific
goals under this proposal, which include technical skills, such as measurements of mouse visual physiology and
human induced pluripotent stem cell culture, analytical skills, including bioinformatic approaches, and
professional skills, such as scientific communication and mentorship."
10825728,"Project Summary/Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal blood disorders, whose pathogenesis is driven by a class of
oncogenic somatic mutations in RNA splicing factors (in the genes SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) in up
to 80% of cases. Efforts to target these mutations in MDS with splicing modulatory drugs have been largely
unsuccessful, and there is a great need for improved therapy. To this end, our group previously demonstrated
that mis-spliced mRNAs induced by splicing modulatory drugs can serve as rich sources of immunogenic
tumor antigens. Based on this proof-of-concept work, we hypothesize that mis-spliced mRNA isoforms induced
by spliceosomal gene mutations can also generate meaningful tumor antigens that can be targeted by cognate
T-cell receptor (TCR) therapeutics. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel antigen-based TCR
therapeutics for MDS with spliceosomal mutations. Spliceosomal mutations are also prevalent in clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) and associated with an increased risk of progression to MDS and acute myeloid leukemia,
and the project also aspires to develop safe and effective immunization strategies for these genomic subtypes
of CH.
The immediate objectives of the project are to identify mis-splicing-derived tumor antigens induced by
spliceosomal mutations as well as their cognate TCRs. In Aim 1, we will predict such tumor antigens by
analyzing RNA-Seq datasets of myeloid leukemia patient samples and performing immunopeptidomics. We will
then validate candidate peptides in vitro for their HLA binding affinity and ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses.
In Aim 2, we will identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in MDS patient peripheral blood and bone marrow and
extract their TCR sequences using dextramer-based single-cell multiomics. We will validate the potency and
specificity of the identified TCRs both in vitro and in vivo.
Overall, the project will (1) corroborate our previously findings that mis-spliced mRNAs are viable
immunotherapeutic targets and (2) inspire novel immunotherapies such as TCR therapeutics for MDS patients
and vaccines for subjects with CH. Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a clinician-scientist with expertise in spliceosomal
mutations in MDS and passion for mentoring future clinician-scientists, will sponsor the project. Dr. David
Scheinberg, also a clinician-scientist with expertise in TCR therapeutics as well as a track-record of training
multiple MD-PhD students, will co-sponsor the project. The research efforts will take place at the Sloan
Kettering Institute, where its researchers have made tremendous contributions to the understanding and
clinical implementation of immunotherapies into cancer medicine. Direct mentorship from Dr. Abdel-Wahab
and Dr. Scheinberg, combined with the guidance provided by the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, will ensure
the successful completion of the proposed project and prepare the applicant for the future career path as an
independent investigator."
10825729,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disorder mediated by a T cell driven autoimmune attack
against myelin in the Central Nervous System (CNS). There is a correlation between MS and Inflammatory Bowel
Disorders (IBDs), as studies suggest that patients with IBDs have an increased risk of developing MS.
Furthermore, patients with MS commonly present with gastrointestinal symptoms which frequently precede MS
diagnosis. Together, these observations suggest that the gut may play a key role in the etiology of MS. Enteric
glial cells (EGCs) are observed throughout the gastrointestinal tract where they closely associate with neurons
and immune cells. Our increased understanding of glial functions in the Central Nervous System (CNS) has
demonstrated their profound influence on neurological disorders. EGCs bear resemblance to CNS glia, although
they are understudied in the context of neurological disorders which impact the gut, such as MS. EGCs are
equipped to respond to inflammatory cues, as they express several immune receptors and cytokines, as well as
antigen presentation machinery. It is compelling to speculate an enteric glial origin of MS, as these represent the
only cell type to express myelin proteins in the gut – a highly dynamic environment prone to inflammation and
rich in neuroimmune interactions. Given their potential role as antigen presenting cells (APCs) and expression
of myelin proteins, it is reasonable to speculate that intestinal inflammation such as that seen in IBDs could drive
EGCs could promote myelin-autoreactive T cell activation with the potential to spread into the CNS.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize T cell responses against EGCs in the Experimental
Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model of MS, as well as assess how EGC ablation impacts disease onset and
severity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that suppressing autoreactive T cell responses driven in
response to EGC myelin antigen(s) in the gut during EAE is protective against intestinal and CNS pathology.
This hypothesis is supported by preliminary work described in this proposal which demonstrates a putative role
for EGCs in contributing to the peripheral immune response during EAE. The proposed experiments described
outline a plan to further characterize T cell responses against EGCs in a relapsing remitting EAE model (Aim 1)
and determine the impact of EGC ablation on EAE severity (Aim 2). This work could lend to a deeper appreciation
of MS etiology/pathology and the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
10825863,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare inflammatory myeloid neoplasm with a wide range of clinical
manifestations and severity caused by mutations that constitutively activate mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling in myeloid lineage cells- most commonly BRAFV600E. Constitutive MAPK activation endows
pathological histiocytes with a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)- leading to resistance to
apoptosis, increased inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression, and decreased ability to
migrate to lymph nodes. These features allow LCH cells to persist in tissues and reshape the microenvironment
leading to the characteristic granulomatous lesions harboring CD207+ cells. However, little is known about tissue-
specific and time-dependent features of the LCH microenvironment (LCH-ME).
 Treatment of LCH remains unacceptable due to significant drug-induced toxicity and inability of current
treatment strategies to eliminate LCH precursor cells leading to high-rates of disease recurrence. Recurrence
often leads to life-threatening sequalae. Drugs targeting both development and homeostasis of LCH cells could
revolutionize treatment for patients with LCH. Our lab showed histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) regulates multiple
facets of myeloid cell biology, including development and homeostasis. This F30 proposal seeks to define the
therapeutic potential of targeting HDAC3 to ameliorate LCH. Collectively, the data presented will further our
understanding of the epigenetic regulation of pathological myeloid cells, provide novel insights to the LCH-ME,
and provide preclinical data for HDAC3 inhibition (HDAC3i) as a treatment for LCH.
 In Aim1, we will us a mouse model of LCH to define tissue-specific and time-dependent features of the
LCH-ME. Using flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and imaging mass cytometry we will compare the
composition, gene expression, and spatial organization of lung and liver LCH lesions over time.
 In Aim2, the efficacy of HDAC3i will be evaluated in a mouse model of severe-multifocal LCH. Using
genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition, we will test how HDAC3i influences development, homeostasis,
and SASP properties of LCH cells, and the LCH-ME. These studies will address a major gap in our
understanding of LCH disease development and define a potential new therapeutic that could be
translated to treat LCH and other MAPK-driven histiocytic disorders.
 The training plan outlined in this proposal will be performed between Henry Ford Health System, Wayne
State University School of Medicine, and Karmanos Cancer Institute, which presents a unique opportunity to
leverage the advantages and expertise at all three institutions providing a robust clinical and research training.
Executing this training plan in such a vibrant multi-institutional environment, with the guidance of dedicated
sponsors, collaborators, and mentors with expertise in immunology, epigenomics, cancer biology, and
hematology, will provide an unparalleled training for a successful career as a physician-scientist."
10825986,"Hearing loss (HL) is an etiologically diverse condition that can occur at any age and severity level, affecting 1 in
500 infants and more than 360 million people globally1; 2. In numerous ethnicities, we have previously identified
pathogenic variants in the CIB2 gene encoding Calcium and Integrin-Binding protein 2 (CIB2) as the etiology of
HL4-6. In past funding periods, we discovered that CIB2 is expressed in the mouse hair cell stereocilia and binds
to the TMC1 and TMC2 components of the hair cell MET complex, and that deafness-causing CIB2 mutations
disrupt these interactions. We concluded that CIB2 is essential for the MET function7. We also generated two
mouse models carrying the human deafness-related Cib2 variants (Cib2F91S and Cib2R186W knock-ins) and
characterized them together with a mouse line lacking CIB2 (Cib2ko). We found that Cib2F91S and Cib2ko mouse
strains are deaf and lack typical MET responses in the auditory hair cells, despite the existence of tip links that
are ordinarily responsible for gating the MET channels. In contrast, the p.R186W mutation does not disrupt the
interaction between CIB2 and TMC1/27, and MET currents in mutant mice are diminished but still detectable. It
is particularly intriguing that CIB2's participation in the MET machinery may be responsible for at least some of
the several well-known effects of Ca2+ on hair cell mechanotransduction. Here, we will investigate the precise
function of CIB2 in MET. We hypothesize that CIB2 is a calcium-dependent element that regulates sensitivity of
the MET channels and force transmission to these channels in the mammalian auditory hair cells of. Our findings
further determined that CIB2 deficiency causes an overgrowth of transducing shorter row stereocilia in the hair
bundle without altering the non-transducing tallest row stereocilia7. This observation cannot be explained solely
by the loss of mechanotransduction, since blockage of the MET channels causes an opposite effect, the
retraction of transducing stereocilia8; 9. Hence, CIB2 must have some role in stereocilia growth, unrelated to
mechanotransduction. Here, we will investigate the involvement of CIB2 in the molecular networks implicated in
the development and patterning of auditory stereocilia bundles. A recent work has demonstrated functional
redundancy between CIB2 and CIB3 proteins in regulating MET function3. Therefore, using in vitro and in vivo
rescue experiments, we will test the hypothesis that cochlear hair cells require CIB2 for faster
mechanotransduction and specific hair bundle shape. Finally, we will explore the function of CIB3 in hearing.
The expected outcomes of this study are to uncover the precise mechanism of deafness associated with CIB2
deficiency, the physiological role of CIB proteins in hair cell functions, especially in MET, and their role in
stereocilia staircase patterning. The potential for positive impact is inherent; deciphering the functions of HL
proteins is a critical step towards the development of actual therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of HL."

The Data & Methods Core will provide cross-cutting expertise in data management and analysis methods. The
Core comprises researchers with extensive experience with the data and methods involved in the Program
Project. It will provide leadership on issues common to all projects, day-to-day direction in the management of
complex data sets and analyses, and novel methods to advance the scientific goals of the Program Project.
The Core has three primary aims. First, the Core will coordinate data resources, including acquiring, preparing,
integrating, managing, and ensuring quality of the data needed for projects. Across projects, many data
challenges can be solved once in the core rather than individually in each project, ensuring uniformity in
approach to data issues and cost-effective use of Program Project resources. Second, the Core will provide
general analytical expertise on Project analysis issues such as measure development, modeling techniques,
economic theory, causal inference, and statistical inference. Applying expertise across the range of projects
will enable investigators to identify cross-cutting issues and develop solutions that can be broadly applied.
Third, the Core will develop and apply novel methods relevant to missing data and quasi-experimental designs.
The methodological work will closely align with the research needs of the projects, enabling more robust and
rigorous research conclusions.
The Medicare program is vital to the health, welfare, and financial security of older adults and to the federal
government's budget. This Program Project, with leadership and support from the Data & Methods Core, will
conduct empirical analysis with broadly representative data, carefully specified measures of clinical quality and

Despite recent gains, the burden of malaria caused by P. falciparum (Pf) in sub-Saharan Africa remains
unacceptably high. Vaccines offer the greatest potential to produce sustained protection against malaria, but
the only licensed vaccine for malaria is short lived and only modestly effective. Decades of research have been
unable to produce a feasible vaccine which approaches the efficacy of naturally acquired immunity (NAI),
which provides nearly complete protection against symptomatic disease in adults in many endemic areas. NAI
to malaria is complex slow to develop. Antibodies are key effectors of NAI, and eventually overcome the high
degree of genetic diversity evolved by Pf antigens important in host-parasite interactions. This diversity may
underlie the slow development of NAI and relative inefficacy of current vaccines. While it is loosely understood
that increasing cumulative exposure to Pf leads to greater immunity, fundamental questions remain
unanswered. The aims of this project are (1) to determine the effect of the number, timing, and genetic
composition of blood stage Pf infections on NAI in childhood; and (2) to determine the effect of the number,
timing, and genetic composition of exposure to Pf in childhood on the antibody repertoire, and how antibody
responses relate to immunity. We are in a unique position to achieve these aims by leveraging an extensive
set of existing samples and data from multiple intensively followed early childhood cohorts in Uganda along
with a team of experienced collaborators with expertise in malaria epidemiology, statistics, genomics, and
immunology. In Aim 1, we will initially perform whole genome sequencing on a subset of Pf infections in our
cohorts to systematically identify antigenic variants under potential selection. These antigens, along with others
identified from existing data, will be deep sequenced from all infected time points using highly multiplexed deep
sequencing. We will quantify anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity using detailed clinical data, and combine
these data to test 3 fundamental hypotheses regarding the relationship between exposure and immunity. In
Aim 2, we will longitudinally evaluate antibody responses to Pf in our cohorts using ultra-high throughput long
peptide arrays, targeting the entire genome including all identified antigenic variants. We will identify
sequences of key antigens from these experiments and from Aim 1, and further evaluate antibody responses
using custom protein arrays with experimental validation using functional assays. Using these data, we will test
an additional 3 hypotheses. At the conclusion of this project, we will have identified fundamental factors driving
the development of NAI, including the role of strain-specific vs. transcendent immunity and the identification of
antigenic variants most associated with immunity and thus most appropriate for inclusion in a malaria vaccine."

 This application seeks five years' continued funding for a training program supporting four pre-doctoral
students with the aim of producing independent investigators capable of sustaining productive research
programs in the vision sciences. The program is designed for training students in the areas of molecular/cellular
biology, genetics, biochemistry, biomedical engineering, machine learning, and immunology with particular focus
on training in vision research. Mentors have been selected with an emphasis both on the productivity of their
current research and on their training records. The training program is organized to rigorously instruct and
reinforce skills pertinent to experimental science and involves a combination of coursework, independent
research, oral presentations (in-house, national and international), written research proposals, and the
sharpening of communication skills through continuous mentor feedback and peer review.
 The program is interdisciplinary and utilizes a core group of thirteen mentors with active research and
training programs whose primary and joint appointments span four colleges (Medicine, Liberal Arts and
Sciences, Engineering, and Veterinary Medicine). The Department of Ophthalmology serves as the
administrative and logistical center for this vision science training program, but individual faculty preceptors
maintain primary graduate training appointments in the Departments of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology,
Neuroscience, Pediatrics, Immunology, Pharmacology, Biomedical Engineering, Small Animal Veterinary
Sciences, and Psychology. The Department of Ophthalmology adds depth to the program by providing exposure
to current problems in clinical ophthalmology in order to acquaint the pre-doctoral students with relevant clinical
issues in vision. Overall, we propose an integrated program of research training and professional development
aimed at producing independent investigators capable of sustaining productive, innovative, independent
research programs in the vision sciences."
10839431,"Pneumonia (PNA) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. PNA can result in devastating acute
inflammatory injury in the lung manifesting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current treatments for
PNA have focused on the pathogens, but do not target excessive lung inflammation elicited by the host immune
response. Both the emergence of new infections, typified by COVID-19, and the expanding impact of antimicrobial
resistant pathogens, highlight the limitations of our current armamentarium and underscore the need to identify
additional therapeutic targets in PNA-induced ARDS. With the understanding that resolution of PNA is an
actively regulated program to promote return to homeostasis, our work has focused on identifying cellular and
molecular mediators of this resolution phase. Others and we have demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tregs)
promote resolution of infectious-ARDS.
Our strong preliminary data has identified lung-derived Treg DHX58, which encodes an RNA helicase protein
essential for antiviral responses, as a candidate gene upregulated during the resolution phase of ARDS. DHX58-
deficient animals fail to resolve lung inflammation after Streptococcus pneumoniae-ARDS with significantly
diminished lung Treg numbers during injury resolution, implicating DHX58 in optimal Treg function in vivo. Further,
we observed significantly increased 30-day mortality among carriers of a putative loss-of-function variant of DHX58
with infectious ARDS (71% vs. 47%, p=0.01), underscoring the potential clinical impact of DHX58 in ARDS
outcomes. Our in-silico analysis of the DHX58 promoter identified numerous estrogen responsive elements (ERE).
Indeed, DHX58 expression was induced in Tregs by estradiol (E2). Importantly, our published work showed that
therapeutic E2 promotes resolution of preclinical PNA-ARDS in a Treg-dependent manner. Estrogen receptor beta
(ER) was necessary for both Treg-dependent rescue of lymphopenic hosts and Treg-mediated suppression of
pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages in vitro. Preliminary gene expression analysis and high-
dimensional flow cytometry implicate E2 and its downstream-target, DHX58, in the regulation of critical Treg
transcription factors (TFs), notably Foxp3 and GATA3. Thus, we hypothesize that E2, in part via ER-dependent
upregulation of DHX58, orchestrates critical Treg pro-resolution functions, through regulating expression of key
TFs in Tregs. The goals of this proposal are to determine the cellular, molecular and transcriptional determinants
of E2-ER-DHX58 in Treg-mediated resolution of PNA-ARDS to provide the mechanistic underpinnings of the
regulation and functional role of ER in Tregs."
10861504,"Project Summary
Home-based exposures and poor housing quality contribute to health inequities (e.g., asthma, lead,
reproductive health etc.) and are a driving force behind many environmental injustices. Household exposure
research can inform solutions to these urgent problems. Responsible report-back of individual-level
research results (RBRR) from household exposure studies is essential to promote changes in behavior,
housing provider practices, community action, and policies to improve health. While high level report-back
principles have been developed for environmental health research, these do not provide specific guidance
on the unique ethical challenges of household exposure research. RBRR for household exposure studies
raises a number of ethically contentious issues related to the actionability of results, participants’ housing
status (e.g., income level, owner/renter, public/private housing), and the interests of third parties (including
family members, neighbors, health professionals, landlords and community leaders), among others. This
project aims to promote health equity and improve communication by developing guidelines for RBRR for
household exposure studies in ways that respect participant preferences and inform appropriate action. We
build on a longstanding community partnership with Rochester Energy Efficiency and Weatherization
(RENEW) and actively involve a Stakeholder Advisory Board that represents the diverse perspectives of
community groups, housing providers, IRBs, public health professionals and others who may be affected by
RBRR. We integrate prior report back studies by recruiting participants from several past housing exposure
research studies, including ROC HOME, to provide formative input to Aim 2. Successful completion of this
project will result in: (Aim 1) a philosophically and empirically-informed typology of the key ethical questions
faced by researchers during RBRR of household exposure studies; (Aim 2) a tool for eliciting participants’
preferences for RBRR in household exposure research; and (Aim 3) decision-support guidelines to help
research teams return individual results responsibly. Our collaborative approach will use a rigorous
transdisciplinary framework to fill a crucial gap in report-back guidance for household exposure research
and will serve as a model for future research on report-back of environmental and non-genomic research
results."
10864930,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Core C – Viral Vector Core)
The potential of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV)-mediated delivery of HIV inhibitors with
broadly neutralizing activities to HIV infection is clearly demonstrated in work from Phil Johnson, Reed
Clark, and Ronald Desrosiers (Nature Medicine 2009), Alex Balazs and David Baltimore (Nature 2012),
Matthew Gardner and Michael Farzan (Nature 2015). The therapeutic potential of AAV-expressed inhibitors
is clearly shown in this proposal and recent published work from the Desrosiers Lab (Immunity 2019). The
main objective of the Vector Core is to provide high quality single-stranded (ss) and self-complementary (sc)
rAAV vectors to support the proposed studies. We will accomplish this goal through two specific aims. Aim
1 will design, create, produce, and quality control test scAAV vector lots at different scales with a variety of
capsids, transgenes and expression cassettes to serve the specific needs of other investigators of this
program project. 154 rhesus macaques will be enrolled for different studies over 4 years, and hundreds of
mice will be used for pre-macaque evaluation. On average, we estimate that -30 vector lots will be
produced annually to meet the needs of those studies. Aim will develop a novel and scalable rAAV
production method for larger scale translational NHP studies and future clinical development of rAAV-based
anti-HIV vaccine and therapeutics. Our current AAV production system should meet the vector needs in the
early stage of this program project. However, large scale vector production may become a bottle neck for
larger translational NHP studies and future clinical development. We will utilize our extensive experience in
developing various vector packaging cell lines, suspension cell culture-based vector production,
corresponding downstream processing and chromatography-based purification systems to develop a
scalable suspension 293 cell-based production method to overcome this limitation. In doing so, we further
our common goal of establishing AAV-mediated functional cures in macaques and humans."
10864932,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1 – Robust functional cures with AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig) 
eCD4-Ig is a potent and exceptionally broad fusion of the first two domains of CD4 to an antibody Fc 
domain and a short tyrosine-sulfated coreceptor-mimetic peptide. In rhesus macaques, adeno-associated 
virus (AAV)-expressed eCD4-Ig mediates consistent and very effective protection against SHIV-AD8 and 
SIVmac239. eCD4-Ig also has properties that make it especially useful for establishing a functional cure in 
rhesus macaques and perhaps in humans. These include its potency, breadth, difficulty-of-escape, low 
immunogenicity when expressed by AAV, consistent expression by AAV, potent intrinsic ADCC activity, and 
collaboration with serum antibodies to mediate ADCC. These properties allow eCD4-Ig to circumvent two 
major problems associated with using AAV-expressed antibodies to establish functional cures, namely 
immune clearance and viral escape. In preliminary data we show that AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig can 
suppress replication of SHIV-AD8 for more than a year in 5 of 6 macaques. However we also show that, 
when compared to the “Monkey monkey” described in Project 2, this suppression was less robust, meaning 
that consistent ‘blipping’ of virus was observed in most eCD4-Ig-suppressed animals. Because the Miami 
monkey expresses roughly 10 times the amount of total antibody observed in these eCD4-Ig-expressing 
macaques, we hypothesize that greater expression of eCD4-Ig will result in more robust functional cures. 
The goals of this project are thus to increase AAV-mediated expression of eCD4-Ig, to establish robust 
functional cures in SHIV-AD8 and SIVmac239-infected macaques, to amplify the ADCC activities in these 
macaques by stimulating host antibody responses to epitopes unmasked by eCD4-Ig, to establish a 
consistent platform that will allow for evaluation of latency reversing agents, and to ask whether long-term 
expression of eCD4-Ig by itself can impact the viral reservoir. These studies will improve and help 
understand a viable approach to establishing similar functional cures in humans."
10864933,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 2 – Limiting anti-drug antibodies against AAV-delivered bNAbs)
Given the remarkable collection of human monoclonal antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against a
broad range of HIV-1 isolates (bNAbs), it has become possible to envision long-term delivery of a
combination of such antibodies as a means for achieving stringent, long-term virological control in the
absence of continuing antiviral drug therapy. In preliminary data and recently published paper in
Immunity, we shown that sustained AAV-mediated expression of two bNAbs, 10-1074 and 3BNC117,
introduced 86 weeks after an untreated SHIV-AD8 infection resulted in robust long-term suppression of
viral replication for over three years. This monkey has been referred to as “the Miami monkey”. We also
nonetheless show that consistent delivery of bNAbs using AAV has been severely hampered by anti-drug
antibody (ADA) responses to the bNAb in the majority of macaques. Although the broad antibody-like
immunoadhesin eCD4-Ig is less immunogenic, it also raises ADA that could potentially limit its efficacy or
its safety in humans. This project is therefore committed to finding approaches that can effectively and
practically suppress ADA responses to an antibody, using the immunogenic bNAb 3BCN117 as our
primary test case. In this project we will evaluate three approaches for doing so: (1) elimination of CpG
motifs in the transgene, (2) oral tolerization, and (3) tolerization with a bispecific antibody that coordinates
bNAb binding to erythrocytes. In addition, we will assist in evaluating the ADA responses from different
capsids and promoters (Project 1), and those from an AAV transgene whose expression has been
delayed by four months (Project 4). We will then use the best combination of these approaches and AAV-
expressed bNAbs to establish and characterize functional cures in ART-treated and untreated rhesus
macaques. This project will therefore address a central challenge to the use AAV-expressed bNAbs for
HIV-1 prophylaxis and therapy."
10864936,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 3 – Optimal use of ART in establishing functional cures)
In Project 3, Emmune, Inc. is collaborating with ViiV Healthcare to determine how antiretroviral therapy
(ART) should be administered so as to maximize the ability of AAV-expressed therapeutics to establish
robust functional cures and perhaps deplete the viral reservoir. ViiV Healthcare is developing long-
acting cabotegravir, a product with several potential synergies with AAV-expressed anti-retroviral
biologics developed by Emmune.
This program seeks to ‘functionally cure’ HIV patients with a one-time intramuscular injection of an
AAV-expressed therapeutic without the need for continuing antiretroviral therapy (ART). However,
when AAV is first administered, ART is probably necessary to prevent the emergence of resistant
viruses while the AAV-expressed therapeutic is present at suboptimal concentrations. Such resistance
has been observed when broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) were administered to patients. The
potential for resistance is an important reason why we have focused on eCD4-Ig, an immunoadhesin
constructed from an antibody Fc and the parts of CD4 and CCR5. Because it closely emulates these
HIV receptors, eCD4-Ig presents fundamental barriers to viral escape. Nonetheless, we have observed
the emergence of partial resistance to eCD4-Ig, albeit associated with a high fitness cost.
To prevent selection for partial resistance, we have pre-treated SHIV-infected macaques with ART
before administering AAV expressing eCD4-Ig. When ART was subsequently withdrawn, transient
‘blips’ of viral RNA were occasionally detectable. We hypothesize that the quality of these functional
cures can be improved by timing the application of ART so that host immune responses have not had
time to wane prior introducing AAV expressing eCD4-Ig. Thus, AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig and peak host
immune responses can work synergistically to deplete viral reservoirs and establish functional cures.
In this project, we will determine whether ART is detrimental to depleting viral reservoirs and
establishing functional cures in SHIV-infected macaques. To balance the need to prevent resistance
with the benefits of synergy with host immune responses, we propose initiating ART and AAV-
expressed eCD4-Ig at the same time. We also will determine whether a one-time administration of the
long-acting formulation of cabotegravir, at the same time as AAV-eCD4-Ig is administered, is a practical
solution for preventing partial resistance to eCD4-Ig. Conversely, we will also determine whether
expression of eCD4-Ig prevents cabotegravir resistance during its so-called ‘long tail’, when
cabotegravir concentrations are sub-clinical. Finally, these efforts will be supported by a panel of
immunological studies that will provide a mechanistic insight into how ART, eCD4-Ig and host immunity
collaborate to establish robust functional cures."
10865108,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This study is designed to answer one of the fundamental gaps in knowledge in the resuscitation of preterm
infants at birth: What is the optimal target oxygen saturation (SpO2) range that increases survival without long-
term morbidities? Oxygen (O2) is routinely used for the stabilization of preterm infants in the delivery room
(DR), but its use is linked with mortality and several morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
To balance the need to give sufficient O2 to correct hypoxia and avoid excess O2, the neonatal resuscitation
program (NRP) recommends initiating preterm resuscitation with low (≤ 30%) inspired O2 concentration (FiO2)
and subsequent titration to achieve a specified target SpO2 range. These SpO2 targets are based on
approximated 50th percentile SpO2 (Sat50) observed in healthy term infants. However, the optimal SpO2
targets remain undefined in the preterm infants. Recent data suggest that the inability to achieve SpO2 of 80%
by five minutes is associated with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and mortality. These studies raise concern
that current SpO2 targets (Sat50) may be too low resulting in persistence of high pulmonary vascular
resistance, respiratory failure and mortality. Preliminary data from my NICHD K23 funded pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of 75 preterm infants <31 weeks gestational age (GA) showed that infants randomized to
75th percentile SpO2 goals (Sat75) had a lower incidence of SpO2 <80% at five minutes in the DR compared to
infants randomized to 50th percentile SpO2 goals (Sat50). In addition, Sat75 infants had less oxidative stress at
one hour after birth, needed less respiratory support on admission, had less pulmonary hypertension and had
higher survival without BPD. We hypothesize that delivery room resuscitation of preterm infants < 31 weeks
GA with Sat75 targets compared to Sat50 targets will increase survival without BPD by 36 weeks’
postmenstrual age (PMA). We plan to conduct a multicenter RCT of Sat75 versus Sat50 powered for survival
without BPD. We will randomize 772 infants, 230/7- 306/7 weeks’ GA, to Sat75 (intervention) or Sat50 (control).
Except for the SpO2 targets, all resuscitations will follow NRP guidelines including an initial FiO2 of 0.3. In Aim
1, we will determine whether targeting Sat75 compared to Sat50 increases survival without BPD. In addition,
we will compare the rates of other major morbidities such as IVH. In Aim 2, we will determine whether targeting
Sat75 compared to Sat50 increases survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years of age. In Aim
3, we will determine whether targeting Sat75 compared to Sat50 decreases oxidative stress. We will conduct a
sub-study of 220 infants enrolled from a single site to measure 8-iso-PGF2α and 8-OHdG in cord blood and
blood samples collected at 1 and 24 hours after birth. The new understanding gained from this trial has the
potential to modify neonatal resuscitation practice and improve neonatal outcomes worldwide. This will be the
first clinical trial powered for survival without BPD to evaluate competing DR SpO2 goals and addresses a
critical knowledge gap recognized by NRP and NICHD."
10864997,"Abstract
 Neuron to (astro)glia communication is essential for functional synaptic transmission and physiology in
the CNS. Despite the important modulatory roles of astroglia in synapse function, molecular pathways that
regulate the neuron-astroglia functional unit are largely undefined. Exosomes (50-150 nm in diameter), a major
type of secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), are derived from intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in the early endosomal
compartment and are released from cells during endosome maturation. EVs and exosomes secreted from
various CNS cell types have emerged as a novel and important intercellular communication pathway in the CNS.
In particular, miRNAs (miRs) are often found in exosomes to shuttle between cells for intercellular signaling.
Intercellular transfers of miRs have been observed in CNS cells to regulate glutamate transporter function,
promote myelination, and maintain brain vascular integrity. Exosomal signaling has also been implicated in
pathological conditions of the CNS, including neurological injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and glioblastoma.
Despite the strong rigor in prior studies to suggest the importance of the exosomal pathway in CNS cell
communication, these studies are largely based on culture models or human CSF samples, exosome signaling
in situ in the CNS remains essentially unexplored. In addition, fundamentally important cell biology aspects of
this pathway, such as neuronal activity's influence, exosome internalization mechanisms, and downstream
regulation in recipient CNS cells also remain unknown. This is particularly important to address as CNS cell
types are highly distinct from cancer/immune cells where most of exosome knowledge is currently gained and
exosome signaling mechanisms can be very cell-type heterogeneous.
 Based on our published study and additional preliminary results, we propose the following aims in this
project: Aim 1: Determine the effect of neuronal activity on the subcellular localization of ILVs and neuronal
exosome secretion; Aim 2: Dissect recognition pathways and entry mechanisms involved in astroglial
internalization of neuronal exosomes; Aim 3: Investigate genetic regulation of neuronal exosomal miR-124 in
astroglia; We have generated a large amount of preliminary data to support our rationales and to demonstrate
feasibility for proposed aims. We will employ mouse genetics, molecular biology, virus injections, various imaging,
and biochemical approaches to complete these aims. Outcomes from this project will present in vivo evidence
to support a previously unrecognized mode of communication from neurons to glia in the CNS. It will also provide
much-needed cell biological knowledge and insights for understanding exosome signaling in neuron to glia
communication, especially about miR-124-3p's non-cell autonomous genetic regulation in astroglia following its
internalization. As altered neuron to (astro)glia communication is clearly implicated in many neurological
diseases, this knowledge and insights can significantly help understand how this pathway is involved in CNS
diseases."
10864931,"Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a potentially fatal infection and the second-most common tickborne
disease in the United States. Its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Indeed, the 39% rise in the number
of cases from 2016 to 2017 is greater than for any other tickborne infection. Even more concerning, the true
incidence of HGA in this country is estimated to be 10- to 50-fold higher. The causative agent of HGA is
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that exhibits an unusual tropism for
neutrophils. Like all obligate intracellular bacteria, Ap must invade cells to survive and cause disease. Identifying
the adhesins and their host cell receptors that facilitate this essential step is fundamental to understanding Ap
pathogenesis and preventing HGA. During the prior funding period, we identified three adhesins called Asp14,
AipA, and AipB that Ap expresses when it converts to the infectious form and during tick transmission feeding
on mammalian hosts. Hence, they are ideal targets for neutralizing infection. The adhesins’ receptor binding
domains are Asp14 residues 113-124 (Asp14113-124), AipA residues 9-21 (AipA9-21), and AipB residues 80-94
(AipB80-94). An antibody cocktail against all three domains robustly inhibits Ap infection of host cells, whereas
targeting only one or two is less effective. Therefore, they function cooperatively, are compensatory, and maximal
blockade of Ap infection is achievable by disrupting the full cohort of adhesin-receptor interactions. Asp14 binds
protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) on the neutrophil surface, which brings Ap in sufficient proximity to PDI such
that it reduces bacterial surface thiols as a key step in infection. AipB is a PDI substrate that potentially binds
CD18, a 2 integrin component and newly discovered Ap receptor. AipA and CD13 are a third Ap adhesin-
receptor pair that is critical for invasion. PDI, CD13, and CD18 cluster in lipid rafts, which are essential platforms
for Ap entry. Moreover, signaling events that CD13 and CD18 elicit are associated with Ap infection. Mice
immunized against Asp14113-124 and/or AipA9-21 are significantly, but incompletely, protected from Ap challenge.
Thus, Asp14 and AipA are important for Ap infection in vivo and their receptor binding domains are protective
antigens. For our competitive renewal, we will build on these compelling data. We will dissect how the AipA-
CD13 and AipB-CD18 interactions orchestrate Ap uptake into host cells and define the relevance of AipB to Ap
infection in vivo. We will determine the protective capacity of AipB alone and in cooperation with AipA and Asp14
against syringe-mediated and tick-transmitted Ap challenge. Completing the proposed aims will yield the most
comprehensive understanding of adhesin-receptor interactions for any rickettsial agent and one of the most
refined models for the molecular basis of infection among intracellular bacterial pathogens. This fundamental
knowledge will benefit design of approaches for protecting against HGA and significantly advance the field."
10864934,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting nearly one
million individuals in the United States. The disease is characterized by acute and chronic inflammation, myelin
loss; oligodendrocyte, neuronal and axonal pathology; and progressive neurological dysfunction. A number of
breakthrough translational discoveries, and especially the highly beneficial effects of B cell depleting drugs, have
set the stage for a growing, yet still imperfect, therapeutic pipeline. Research will fall short of its potential to
improve patient outcomes until the trigger(s) of disease onset and modifiers of progression are identified.
Central to this project is the hypothesis that B cells presenting in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral
blood during early MS play key roles in triggering MS and in mediating ongoing progressive disease activity. We
propose to interrogate unique patient cohorts, including an incident cohort, with novel enabling technologies to
identify triggers of MS and modifiers of the clinical course. Well characterized clinical populations, high-field
serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic information organized as functional operational networks, and
a focus on B cell biology are the central elements of this initiative. A primary goal will be to characterize the
molecular diversity of B cells and their receptors at various stages of disease to identify pathogenic populations
and their antigenic targets.
A multi-layered experimental strategy includes single cell B cell transcriptomics, together with comprehensive
phage-displayed synthetic human, viral and microbial peptidomes for the screening of antibody fingerprints
against external drivers in the serum, CSF, and recombinant antibody libraries. The integrative analysis will
contextualize the data using clinical, MRI and genetic determinants, striving to apply rigorous statistical
principles, including independent replication."

10864947,"Project Summary
Insomnia is among the most commonly experienced symptoms and is associated with significant distress and
impairment. The assessment of insomnia is reliant on patient self-report, which is often influenced by a number
of factors other than illness severity, complicating accurate diagnosis and treatment. Further, subtypes of
insomnia may exist based on the presence or absence of short sleep duration. Identification of a biological
‘signature’ of insomnia that could facilitate assessment and subtyping would dramatically improve symptom
management. Metabolic biomarkers have significant promise for meeting this need. Individuals with insomnia
demonstrate metabolic hyperarousal compared to good sleepers. Acute disruption of sleep in the laboratory
impacts the metabolome but the extent to which these findings extrapolate to chronic sleep disturbance or
insufficient sleep is unknown. Our own data indicate there is a clear metabolic signature that differentiates
patients with insomnia from good sleepers. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the effects of
chronic insomnia and insufficient sleep on metabolic profiles. In order to test this hypothesis we will conduct in-
depth phenotyping of sleep and metabolism in 100 subjects who are in one of four groups (n=25 per group): 1)
patients with insomnia and objective short sleep (<6 hours) on actigraphy; 2) patients with insomnia without
objective short sleep (>6 hours); 3) habitual short sleepers (<6 hours) without evidence of insomnia; and 4)
good sleepers. Home overnight polysomnography and actigraphy will be used to rule out comorbid sleep
disordered breathing and confirm the presence of insomnia. All subjects will participate in a four-day inpatient
protocol in the Center for Human Phenomic Science. Food intake will be provided in hourly isocaloric snacks to
control for meal-induced shifts in metabolism. The first two days will be used to acclimate subjects to the
environment and meals. On the morning of day 3 they will have an indwelling catheter placed for blood
sampling every two hours for 48 hours with overnight polysomnography each night. During this time lighting
levels will be kept constantly dim (<250 lux) to minimize the effects of light exposure on circadian rhythms.
Metabolomics analysis of serum samples will be carried out using NMR and mass spectroscopy. Blood
samples will also be used for melatonin and cortisol assays as standard markers of circadian rhythmicity. The
global hypothesis that motivates this proposal is that chronic insomnia, insufficient sleep, and their combination
are associated with distinct profiles of systemic metabolic dysregulation."

2019), the most prevalent dementia, yet MxD subjects are often excluded from AD trials. There is a paucity of
models with coexisting vascular and Alzheimer's (AD) pathologies, in addition to a lack of consensus in
neuropathological (or neuropsychiatric) diagnostic criteria for MxD. Therefore, this proposal seeks to identify
synergistic and independent interactions between AD and hypertension-associated cerebrovascular disease
factors in pathology, behavior and biomarkers and modulation by treatment, sex and ApoE isotype. The SHR-
Stroke prone (SHRSP) rat is the most widely studied model for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and develop
vascular pathology and a compromised neurovascular unit. We used this to create “SHRSPFAD” rats by
breeding in mutant APP/PS1 transgenes. Our SHRSPFAD rat shows multiple features of MxD including
tauopathy, recently speculated to be increased disproportionately to amyloid in MxD. We propose four aims,
which include methods to address limitations of one of the controls: normotensive WKY rats (founder of SHRSP),
which is used as the non-hypertensive control, but poses the same limitations as AD models with homozygous
colonies (e.g. ApoETR, 3xTg mice etc.), so the aims attempt to overcome this limitations, such as exploring how
severity of hypertension affects the synergism between AD and hypertension within phenotype. Aim 1
determines if further increasing hypertension, using high salt diet, used with SHSRP to exacerbate hypertension
(and lower VEGF and VGF) affects aging or sex modulation of synergism between AD and hypertension. Aim
2 also addresses this limitation, by reducing hypertension with Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), known
to protect the BBB and reduce dementia risk. Thus Aim 2 validates hypertensive-dependent effects on
pathology, biomarkers and behavior using ARBs in the SHRSPFAD model. Aims 3 and 4 address effects of
ApoE4 the main genetic AD risk factor (notably in women), also impactsing vasculature. Hypertension in post-
menopausal female E4 carriers creates a high dementia risk unlike rodents that lack a precipitous drop in
antihypertensive and neuroprotective estrogen. Therefore Aim 3: characterizes a novel ApoE SHRSPFAD model
and determines the impact of losartan and the anti-estrogen receptors involved in BP control. Since comorbidities
in MxD introduce multiple pathways, polypharmacy is necessary in the clinic. Disruption of VEGF signaling is
seen in VCI and with ApoE4, so we evaluate the effects of ARB with the FDA approved PPD3 inhibitor Cilostazol,
which restores VEGF signaling, protecting the neurovascular unit. Thus, Aim 4 determines efficacy of the
combination therapy ARB and Cilostazol. Aims 1-4 variables: vascular- dependent and cognitive variables, bulk
and glia- and endothelial-specific RNAseq analysis, tau, Aβ, demyelination, mitochondrial deficits and brain-
derived exosomal plasma biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation and disruption of the perivascular unit."

Acting at the interface between environmental inputs mediated by cellular signaling pathways and the inherited
genetic information, epigenetic mechanisms underpin cellular phenotypes and function through the control of
mRNA expression, splicing, and levels. Complementing recent advances that made epigenome-transcriptome-
proteome integration in dissociated single cells possible, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics enable
studying the functional readouts of epigenetic regulation in the context of native tissue architecture including at
the single-cell level. Thus, epigenomic analysis paired with spatial biology mapping greatly enhances our
ability to elucidate the contributions of molecular signaling pathways and environmental factors.
The C-SiG Epigenomics and Spatial Biology Core provides C-SiG members with integrated access to
epigenomics and spatial biology expertise and a powerful and robust set of technologies and services
to support innovative digestive disease-related cell signaling research. The Core implements current,
emerging, and future gene epigenomics and spatial biology technologies, develops them into highly
reproducible, rigorous core service, and helps center members to properly assess, keep abreast of, and
apply these scientific advances. The core provides essential expertise and dedicated personnel to advise and
execute cutting-edge technologies for C-SiG members in pursuit of the Specific Aims described below.
While the newly added spatial biology services have been independently developed by the C-SiG
Epigenomics and Spatial Biology Core, the epigenomics services leverage the Mayo Center for
Individualized Medicine (CIM) Epigenomics Program Development Laboratory to provide access for a
broader segment of the C-SiG membership to state-of-the-art epigenomic methods at a discounted price,
through C-SiG supported technologist effort (1.0 FTE).
The core is led by Core Director, Dr. Tamas Ordog, who has >25 years of research experience focused on
digestive disease-related transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulation. In 2011, he founded the CIM
Epigenomics Program and its laboratory, which develops, implements, and validates epigenomic technology
and offers these methods to investigators across the Mayo Clinic Enterprise.
Accordingly, we have defined and will pursue the following Specific Aims: i) Deliver state-of-the-art
epigenomics and spatial biology assays that are needed by C-SiG members, including bulk and single-cell
analyses and digital spatial profiling assays; iii) Accelerate research by connecting members to epigenomics
and spatial biology-related consultation and educational opportunities such as seminars, journal clubs, and
conferences; iii) Develop and implement cutting-edge epigenomics and spatial biology assays including single-
cell and subcellular spatial assays. The C-SiG Epigenomics and Spatial Biology Core services have been
used by 54% of current Center members and supported 32 publications during the past funding cycle."
10864956,"We are applying to renew the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Training Program (ADTP),
“Neurobehavior, Neuropathology, and Risk Factors in Alzheimer's Disease.” Our program focuses on
translational research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The objective of our research training
program is to provide interdisciplinary training for basic science, clinical, and translational researchers so that
they will be able to advance both clinical and mechanistic hypotheses about the etiology, pathophysiology, and
treatment of AD and related disorders. Our training program remains the only formal program at the University
of Washington (UW) focused on training investigators to carry out basic mechanistic, clinical, and translational
research in AD and related neurodegenerative dementing disorders.
 Our program is supported by the rich and interactive research environment of the UW and Veterans Affairs
Puget Sound Health Care System, where a critical mass of faculty conduct research across the spectrum of AD
and related dementias. The program requests funding to maintain the currently funded positions for 7
postdoctoral trainees and 4 predoctoral students. Postdoctoral PhD candidates come from a broad range of
disciplines, including clinical psychology, neuropsychology, biochemistry, genetics, neurobiology, and
pharmacology. Basic science trainees typically join the program during their first year of postgraduate training
and remain for three years. Incoming MD postdoctoral candidates are expected to have completed a residency,
usually in psychiatry, neurology, neuropathology, radiology, nuclear medicine, internal medicine, or geriatric
medicine. MD and clinician PhD fellows are expected to remain for a two-year period and will be strongly
encouraged to remain for a third year. Predoctoral trainees will be recruited from the following UW PhD programs:
The Medical Scientist Training Program, Genome Sciences, Molecular Basis of Disease, Molecular and Cellular
Biology, Neuroscience, and Pharmacology programs; recruited predoctoral trainees will join the ADTP program
in their second or third year of graduate training. Direct recruitment efforts are made to include underserved
minority trainees."
10866130,"PROJECT SUMMARY: MICROSCOPY AND MICROFLUIDICS CORE
The objective of the C-SiG Microscopy and Microfluidics Core (MMC) is to be a user-friendly resource
that connects investigators with state-of-the-art, optical and microfluidics technologies and services.
Under the direction of Dr. Mark McNiven, an accomplished cell biologist, and Dr. Alexander Revzin an
experienced biomedical engineer, the Core integrates existing resources with new equipment added during
this funding cycle (Zeiss LSM980 + Airyscan 2 and Nikon AXR confocal systems and microfluidic
devices). This Core also collaboratively partners with the Institution-wide Mayo Microscopy and Cell Analysis
Core to enhance resources available to center members by providing GI-relevant expertise and training for C-
SiG members. The Specific Aims of this core are three-fold. First, to provide reliable, accessible, state-of-the-
art microscopy and microfluidics technologies to C-SiG members to facilitate their study of GI cellular signaling
cascades. Second, to provide education, technical advice, guidance, and feedback on experimental design
and results for both basic and sophisticated cellular imaging and microfluidics methods. Emphasis is placed on
providing technical instruction as well as educating faculty on how such approaches can expand the scope and
breadth of their scientific programs. Third, to work collaboratively with C-SiG members to develop proficiency
in the use of cutting-edge optical imaging and microfluidics technologies that offer new capabilities for
assessing cell signaling. The most popular Core service is access to the well-maintained C-SiG
Microscopes (> 37,600 hours total during the past 5 years). The Core also provides consults, training,
technical advice, and development of novel, innovative optical and microfluidics approaches to the
study of signaling pathways in GI cells and tissues. Consults and training cover a wide range of topics
including: confocal, histology, live cell, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and super-
resolution microscopy; microfluidics device design and applications; expression and use of fluorescence-based
bioprobes that facilitate the study and localization of specific signaling molecules including both proteins and
lipids; cell/tissue computer morphometry; high resolution real-time imaging of live cells, and data analysis. In
addition, the Core now provides full-service microfluidics support including device design, fabrication,
and execution of microfluidics experiments for C-SiG members. Since September 2019, when we began
piloting microfluidics services within this core, the core has provided 17 C-SiG members with 692
microfluidics devices, including those developed for spheroid/organoid culture, organotypic cultures,
paracrine and juxtacrine co-cultures, and neuro-epithelial co-cultures. Over the past 5 years, the C-SiG
Microscopy and Microfluidics Core has provided services to 66% of current membership and supported 103
publications."
10864958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most prevalent hearing conditions that affects people of
all ages. As a major risk factor, noise insult early in life accelerates auditory dysfunction and exacerbates hearing
loss with age. Understanding the mechanisms of NIHL at early stages is crucial for the development of clinical
interventions to prevent or ameliorate permanent damage of the auditory system. Pathophysiology of NIHL has
been mostly reported in the cochlea, including detrimental changes in the sensory hair cells, the spiral ganglion
neurons (SGN), and the cochlear synapses connecting the two. One significant finding was that cochlea
synapses of the low spontaneous rate SGNs are vulnerable and can be preferentially damaged by noise,
preceding the occurrence of permanent overt hearing loss. It remains unclear how such noise-induced peripheral
changes link to structural and functional alterations in the central auditory system in contributing to compromised
hearing perception. As the only target for all SGNs and the starting site of central auditory processing, the
cochlear nucleus (CN) is expected to alter in morphology and physiology after noise insult in conjunction with
selective SGN changes and impact the signal processing of the entire central auditory system. The long-term
goal of this project is to elucidate the central mechanisms of NIHL in the CN by identifying noise-induced
synaptopathy at the auditory nerve (AN) central synapses from different subtypes of SGNs, and clarifying the
impact on the structure and function of the CN circuits. We hypothesize that AN synapses from low spontaneous
rate SGNs are subject to more profound synaptopathy upon noise insult, which lead to more dramatic
morphological and physiological changes in linked CN neurons with altered neural processing that contribute to
NIHL. We further postulate that AN synapses from high spontaneous rate SGNs and linked CN neurons are
unchanged during hidden hearing loss caused by moderate noise exposure, but damaged during overt hearing
loss after traumatic noise exposure. Combining electrophysiology with immunohistochemistry in genetically
modified mice, this project investigates the structure and function of identified AN synapses and neurons in CN
circuits after moderate or traumatic noise exposure. In Aim1, we will identify noise-induced AN central
synaptopathy both morphologically and physiologically at the giant endbulb of Held synapses from different
subtypes of type I SGNs. In Aim 2, we will characterize noise-induced changes in cellular morphology and
physiological properties of CN principal bushy neurons, and identify the altered CN output during NIHL. In Aim
3, we will elucidate the mechanisms of NIHL in CN inhibitory neural network by characterizing the noise-induced
synaptopathy at AN bouton synapses onto D-stellate neurons and identifying the weakened inhibition onto CN
bushy neurons. The outcome of this project will fill our knowledge gap on noise-induced AN central synaptopathy,
clarify the linked changes in CN circuits, and ultimately elucidate the central mechanisms of NIHL in the CN."
10866131,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CLINICAL CORE
The objective of the C-SiG Clinical Core is to provide a user-friendly, one-stop service to access digestive
disease-related biospecimens for Center members. Under the direction of Dr. Lisa Boardman, a well-
established clinician scientist with IRB, application of constitutional and somatic molecular genetics and their
impact of molecular pathways associated with disease and health, and biobanking expertise, the organization
and infrastructure of the C-SiG Clinical Core provides essential expertise and personnel to advise and interact
with C-SiG members in pursuit of two Specific Aims: First, to expedite access to GI biospecimens for C-SiG
members from study design development to identification of appropriate clinically and molecularly annotated
specimens. Second, to enhance existing individual GI-related biobanks operating within the Clinical Core
umbrella and develop new repositories. To achieve these aims the C-SiG Clinical Core: i) Integrates existing
tissue collections and annotated data into a collaborative web-based organizational structure that is easily
accessible by C-SiG members; ii) Expedites institutional IRB protocol/biospecimens committee approval and
coordinates priority access for C-SiG members to expert intramural biospecimens processing services; iii)
Facilitates the initiation of new biobanks that will focus on new diseases or types of biospecimens not currently
collected by existing biobanks with an emphasis on accruing diverse patient samples; iv) Develops best
practices for biospecimen processing and procurement in anticipation of tissues that will be optimal for
emerging technologies (e.g., cryopreservation for single cell isolation). The Core integrates existing resources
from individual investigators in GIH and from institutional biospecimens repositories, providing a cost-effective
approach to collaboratively translate GI signaling paradigms into human tissues. Additionally, the C-SiG
Clinical Core has developed strong partnerships with the IRB, anatomic pathology (aka TRAG; source of all
surgical biospecimens), the Pathology Research Core (tissue sectioning), the Center for Individualized
Medicine (whole exome sequencing data through the Tapestry Study) and the Mayo Biobank (blood based
biospecimens, FFPE tissues, and epidemiologic information). The primary services offered by the C-SiG
Clinical Core are IRB protocol development support, biospecimens request support, and biobank support
services. We support the collection of stool for human microbiome research and have developed an organoid-
related service line. We are developing molecular phenotyping and we will enhance the Institutional initiative
for digitalization of all clinical tissue slides by digitalization of C-SiG members research generated slides to
create a digital atlas repository which will both inform sample selection for future C-SiG members’ use and
provide the infrastructure for hypothesis generating and agnostic studies connecting molecular and histologic
features and disease states and outcomes. The C-SiG Clinical Core services have been used by 61% of
the current Center members and have supported 62 publications in the past 5 years."
10863652,"Project Summary
Over half of the 6.7 million adults with heart failure in the United States have a normal or near-normal left
ventricular ejection fraction, or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The prevalence of HFpEF
is increasing over time, due to ageing of the population and other factors. Morbidity and mortality for patients
with HFpEF remains high; rates are similar to those observed in HF with reduced ejection fraction. Poor
outcomes in HFpEF are related to a lack of evidence-based therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to
efficiently conduct large, simple, streamlined trials with clinically relevant endpoints comprised of therapeutic
interventions for HFpEF patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (including spironolactone) present one
promising treatment for HFpEF. In clinical trials of participants with HF with reduced ejection fraction,
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have consistently demonstrated their ability to improve symptoms, and
reduce mortality and hospitalizations. However, the TOPCAT trial was the largest study of mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists in HFpEF. In TOPCAT, spironolactone did not significantly reduce the primary outcome (a
composite of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF) relative to placebo, but did
reduce a secondary endpoint of HF hospitalization (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–0.99, p=0.04). A post-hoc regional
analysis of TOPCAT, limited to North and South America, found that spironolactone reduced the primary
endpoint (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98) compared to placebo. Therefore, TOPCAT demonstrated the potential
promise of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in HFpEF but was not definitive. The Spironolactone
Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-
HFpEF) randomized clinical trial was funded in 2018 for 5 years and has now randomized >1900 participants.
The primary aim of SPIRRIT-HFpEF is to test the hypothesis that use of spironolactone will reduce total HF
events (total hospitalizations for HF and death from cardiovascular causes). SPIRRIT-HFpEF will complete
enrollment December 31, 2023. The current application for SPIRRIT-EX is for a free-standing extension of the
SPIRRIT-HFpEF trial to extend follow-up through December 31, 2025 and to allow for accrual of additional
clinical events. The application will specifically support extended follow-up, secondary analyses (including a
pre-specified meta-analysis of data from another ongoing HFpEF clinical trial), dissemination of results, and
closeout activities of participants previously randomized in SPIRRIT-HFpEF. Resolving whether spironolactone
is beneficial in patients with HFpEF would have tremendous public health implications."
10866342,"ABSTRACT
Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infections debilitate the health of affected population while
representing a hidden source of parasite transmission that can compromise elimination efforts. The lack of
consensus on the best strategy to deal with this asymptomatic reservoir is partly due to the poor knowledge
on the biological mechanisms underlying these subclinical infections. Preliminary results in Mozambique
show that afebrile adults with a Pf infection detected by rapid diagnostic tests can progress to fever (10%),
clear the infection (20%) and stabilize at low-density (50%) or high-density (20%) parasitemias. We
hypothesize that these four main trajectories are driven by antibodies against Pf variant antigens, codified
by the var gene family and expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, which would clear the
infection unless the parasites develop immune evasion mechanisms, and by tolerance factors that minimize
parasite-induced pathology and sustains host homeostasis.With the overarching goal of identifying key
biological factors sustaining afebrile malaria infections, this project will establish a cohort of afebrile
Mozambican adults followed during one month to identify subjects who can reduce pathogen load and
eventually clear the infection, those who maintain infections at high-density and afebrile levels (tolerant),
and those who fail to establish disease tolerance and progress to fever. We will quantify circulating and
overall parasite biomass, and identify new infections during follow-up using next-generation sequencing.
Clinical samples from individuals with low and high parasite densities will be used to test whether
parasitological trajectories of afebrile Pf infections correlate with host antibody immunity against erythrocyte
surface antigens and the transcription of Pf var genes involved in cytoadhesion and immune evasion (Aim
1). Cytometry by time of flight and global mass spectrometry will be applied on clinical samples from afebrile
individuals with high parasite densities (tolerant) and those progressing to fever (non-tolerant) to identify
leukocyte populations and metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of inflammation, tissue damage
and normoglycemia that support host-parasite relationships at afebrile levels (Aim 2). We will validate these
results using an independent set of samples obtained from a Ugandan cohort of children and adults with
longitudinal measurement of malaria incidence and parasite prevalence. This project will contribute to
develop scientific capacity at the Manhiça Health Research Center and create a sample repository for future
investigations on host and parasite interactions during afebrile malaria infections (Aim 3). The expected
outcome of this project is the identification of key molecular drivers of afebrile Pf infections for a better
understanding of the relevance of these infections in different transmission setting which may require
context-specific control approaches, as well as for the development of new tools to achieve sterilizing
immunity and enhance disease tolerance."
10866587,"Abstract
Changes that can persist for many generations without altering DNA sequence have been reported in many
organisms. The existence of such heritable epigenetic changes has also been claimed in humans in response
to some stressful experiences such as starvation and psychological trauma. However, there is poor
understanding of the mechanistic basis for the persistence of epigenetic changes across generations in any
organism. Although molecules mediating such changes have been identified in multiple systems (e.g., DNA
methylation, chromatin modifications, small RNAs, etc.), the mere presence of these molecules and chemical
modifications do not predict the persistence of any newly introduced epigenetic change. Recent conceptual
advances that provide a system-level understanding of heredity suggest that changes in regulatory architectures
drive and maintain heritable epigenetic changes. Therefore, focusing on the regulatory architectures can reveal
the important interactions required for explaining any change that can last for multiple generations regardless of
the particular molecules that mediate these interactions. In the nematode C. elegans, multiple phenomena have
been reported whereby RNA-mediated regulation is used to sustain the silencing of gene expression for
hundreds of generations. These phenomena thus provide opportunities for analyzing heritable epigenetic
changes at single-gene resolution to gain insights. In addition to the expected broad applicability of insights into
regulatory architectures, even some of the specific molecules used to regulate heritable epigenetic changes in
C. elegans such as piRNAs, phase-separated RNA granules, the double-stranded RNA importer SID-1, and
small RNA-bound Argonaute proteins are conserved in many organisms, including humans. Our preliminary
results have revealed insights into a regulatory architecture that promotes stable RNA silencing of a model
transgene encoding a fluorescent protein and endogenous genes that are similarly susceptible to heritable
epigenetic changes in gene expression. The aims of this proposal are: (1) to analyze model genes to discover
the regulatory sequences and perturbations that promote transgenerational gene silencing; and (2) to analyze
regulation of endogenous genes to elucidate the regulatory architectures that have evolved to control heritable
epigenetic changes in gene expression within the germline. Completion of these goals will provide both a general
view of heritable epigenetic changes at any gene and reveal the regulatory architecture of evolved mechanisms.
These results will provide a better understanding of hereditary diseases, particularly diseases that could have
an epigenetic origin in earlier generations."
10866411,"Abstract/Summary - ATC
Adipose tissue is composed of a wide range of cell types (e.g. adipocytes, fibroblasts, stem
cells, leukocytes) that control the ability of adipose tissue to store nutrients and regulate
metabolism. Obesity leads to qualitative and quantitative alterations in all AT cell types that
depends on location in the body, metabolic state, and sex. The fundamental role of adipose
tissue expansion in obesity requires investigators access to the reagents, techniques, and
assays to evaluate adipocyte size, adipose tissue inflammatory tone, lineage relationships
between cell types, and metabolic function in pre-clinical mouse models as well as human
samples. The high lipid content of adipose tissue and the challenges in tissue processing limit
the broad application of rigorous adipose tissue assessments in research studies leading to
many gaps in the field of obesity research. The Adipose Tissue Core (ATC) was established to
address these gaps has assisted a range of investigators incorporate adipose tissue
assessments in their conceptual models and experiments. The aims of the ATC are (1) To
provide consultation and training on rigorous experimental approaches to investigate how
adipocytes develop, function, and interact with other cell types through paracrine and endocrine
mechanisms. (2) To provide access to the specialized techniques required to rigorously
evaluate adipose tissue biology. (3) To provide investigators with tissues, cells, databases,
state-of-the-art assays, histological and other equipment, and animal models for the study of
adipose tissue function. (4) To develop and implement new technologies beneficial to MNORC
investigators interested in adipose tissue biology. Services will be offered to investigators in line
with these aims with oversight from experts in adipose tissue biology to ensure rigorous and
reproducible application of state of the art approaches to assess adipose tissue function in
mouse and human samples."
10866416,"Abstract/Summary – P/F Program
The primary goal of the MNORC Pilot and Feasibility Grants Program (P&F) is to promote
research on the biological and behavioral determinants of obesity, the effects of altered
composition and quantity of nutrients to alter metabolism and modulate disease risk, and to
develop interventions to reduce obesity and its disease sequelae using basic, clinical, or
population approaches. To achieve this goal, we provide opportunities for both new and
established University of Michigan investigators to generate sufficient preliminary information for
a successful application for major research funding from NIH or other national granting
agencies. The $100K/year for the MNORC P&F grants program is largely funded from cost-
sharing provided by several Schools within the University of Michigan, and is currently in the
midst of its second cycle of funding. Two to three standard grants have been given out each
year, and despite that the program has only completed two funding cycles, this investment has
resulted in a considerable return of published papers, funded NIH grants, and collaborations
with other MNORC members. In addition to the P&F grants currently provided, the P&F program
will expand over the next cycle to include shared grants funded with the Michigan Diabetes
Research Center and the Taubman Center for common research interests."
10866418,"Abstract/Summary – Enrichment Program
The overall goal of the Enrichment Program is to advance basic, clinical and translational
research on nutrition and obesity by fostering scientific interchange among MNORC members
and promoting training and development of students, fellows and junior investigators. To
accomplish this goal, the Enrichment Program will 1) promote active collaboration and
interchange among MNORC investigators with laboratory, clinical or population-based research
on nutrition and obesity; 2) foster interactions among researchers from diverse, relevant
disciplines that can drive discovery and innovation in nutrition and obesity research; 3) advance
training in nutrition and obesity. Our primary venue for cross-disciplinary interaction is the
MNORC symposium and poster session on cutting edge topics in nutrition and obesity research
that have implications for basic, clinical and public health researchers and their trainees across
campus. Additional, weekly research seminars on nutrition and obesity topics that attract
MNORC members feature in-depth discussions of study design, statistical analysis and
interpretation to support rigor and reproducibility in basic and translational research. Bi-monthly
investigator meetings through the Momentum Center/Child Obesity Research Core include not
only presentations of ongoing research but also discussions of measurement standardization,
study design and best practices for recruitment and retention and data collection protocols in
pediatric nutrition and obesity research. Trainees (dietetic interns, medical and graduate
students, fellows and allied health professionals) are provided supervised clinical internships in
the MNORC Cores and Weight Management Program. The expansion of courses in
molecular/biochemical nutrition and nutrition epidemiology and interventions through the
Department of Nutritional Sciences, launched at the School of Public Health in 2015, and via the
School’s new online MPH in Population Health (including a certificate in Precision Nutrition) has
dramatically expanded opportunities to train future health professionals and nutrition
researchers at undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. MNORC investigators
routinely present their research in the Nutritional Sciences bi-weekly seminar. Through the
Enrichment Core, online videos of Core services will allow for easy access by MNORC
members to best practices in human phenoytyping, adipose tissue studies and metabolomics.
Enrichment program activities are integrated and coordinated through the Administrative Core,
ensuring they support rigor and reproducibility across cores’ services and optimize coordination
and interactions among nutrition and obesity researchers and trainees."

Obesity leads to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart attack, many types of cancer, hypertension,
stroke, and is estimated to soon be the leading cause of death in the US. Through twin and family studies,
obesity has been found to have a 40-70% heritability rate, pointing to a strong genetic etiology. The long-term
objective of our studies is to determine how genetic variation predisposes humans to obesity and what the
therapeutic implications are for this condition.
To find common genetic variants associated with obesity, numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have been performed. Over 500 loci have been found to associate with increased body weight index (BMI), all
of which reside in noncoding regions of the genome . However, little progress has been made in outlining the
causal SNPs and understanding the mechanisms by which they actually cause obesity.
In this proposal, we explore the hypothesis that obesity-associated SNPs affect regulatory regions that are
active in neuronal sub-population implicated in the regulation of food intake and body weight.
Using state-of-the-art approaches that we have recently pioneered through collaborations between the Ahituv
and Vaisse laboratories we propose to:
- Extend and refine the regulatory landscape of hypothalamic neuronal subpopulations implicated in body
weight regulation to identify candidate regulatory elements overlapping obesity GWAS single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs).
- Use CRISPR inactivation (CRISPRi) in mice to directly test the functional role of regulatory elements that
encompass obesity-associated SNPs.
- Use CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) in mice to test the therapeutic potential of activity modulation of identified
target regulatory regions.
Combined, our work will not only provide a regulatory map of neuronal subtypes associated obesity, but also
functionally characterize these regions and show their therapeutic potential."

This R01 renewal proposal intends to extend the PI's past productivity that includes 35 publications since the
year, 2016, including 3 senior-authored manuscripts in Clinical Cancer Research and 2 additional bodies of work
that are under review in Neuro-Oncology and Nature. The scientific premise of the PI's renewal application is an
extension of continuous NIH/NINDS F32 (Postdoctoral NRSA), NIH/NINDS K99/R00 (Pathway To
Independence) and NIH/NINDS R01 support that have collectively focused on the investigation of indoleamine
2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO; IDO1) in glioblastoma (GBM). IDO is expressed in >90% of all patient-resected GBM
and potently suppresses the anti-GBM immune response. IDO expression is increased by GBM-infiltrating T
cells and therefore represents a key mechanism of resistance to immune-based therapies, since targeted
approaches that aim to enhance T cell infiltration into GBM, will in-turn, result in a compensatory increase of IDO
expression and suppression of the anti-GBM immune response. Importantly, the high intratumoral IDO
expression is associated with significantly decreased GBM patient survival and increased immunosuppressive
regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+). Since IDO is canonically characterized as a rate-limiting enzyme that
metabolizes the essential amino acid, tryptophan (Trp), into the downstream metabolite, kynurenine (Kyn), the
depletion of Trp and/or accumulation of Kyn has been the presumed mechanism of how IDO suppresses the
anti-GBM immune response. However, our work has challenged this hypothesis, supported in-part through the
creation of IDO-deficient murine GBM cells reconstituted with either (i) empty expression vector, (ii) a vector
expressing wild-type IDO, (iii) or a vector expressing enzyme-inactive IDO. When intracranially-engrafted into
the syngeneic mouse brain, GBM cell IDO expression increases Tregs and decreases survival independent of
tryptophan metabolism. Our collective results indicate that GBM cell IDO represents a complex mechanism of
immune resistance that has motivated our development of IDO-proteolysis targeting chimeras (IDO-PROTACs)
- compounds that bind to IDO protein and recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase to facilitate proteasome degradation.
IDO-PROTACs enable experiments to address IDO immunosuppressive effects that are enzyme independent.
The aims of our proposal are therefore to (i) investigate the mechanism responsible for GBM cell IDO enzyme
independent immunosuppression and (ii) design, create and optimize novel IDO-PROTACs that mediate IDO
protein degradation in human GBM cells. Determination of how IDO suppresses the immune response combined
with the generation of potent IDO-PROTACs will address knowledge gaps about GBM immunobiology while also
improving treatment outcomes of GBM patients that are co-treated with immunotherapy and IDO-PROTACs."

This application is for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research for Dr. Sankar
Navaneethan. He is a Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in the Section of Nephrology, at
Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Navaneethan’s research projects have focused on improving cardiovascular
and kidney outcomes for those with and at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). He has extensive experience
in epidemiological investigations, clinical trials, and systematic reviews. Over the past decade, he has
mentored trainees at different levels including medical students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty on
various patient-oriented research studies. Current proposal would help him achieve following goals: a) dedicate
additional time to mentor young investigators in various patient-oriented research projects related to
cardiovascular disease in kidney disease, b) learn new skills in mentoring skills through both formal courses
and workshops and interactions from mentors within and outside his institution, c) enhance ongoing patient-
oriented research activities in obesity and impact of other metabolic diseases on cardiovascular disease in
CKD population, d) to identify new scientific areas of patient-oriented research that are critical to improvement
in cardiovascular outcomes of CKD population, and e) to develop leadership skills. Proposed research projects
by the applicant over the 5-years would help understand the uptake of and barriers in the adoption of cardio-
kidney protective medications among those with kidney disease and investigate the potential role of sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in improving outcomes of those with pulmonary hypertension.
These projects would utilize and expand PI’s current research infrastructure and provide data for future
interventional studies. Aim of the first project is to study the pattern of initiation and uptake of SGLT2i and
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) among those with kidney disease using data collected
from the Veterans Affairs health system. Objectives of the second project is to conduct a pilot non-randomized
study to examine the effects of SGLT2i on pulmonary artery pressure in those with CKD."
10863851,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Inflammation contributes substantially to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general
population. Epidemiology, basic science and randomized clinical trial data support the importance of this
relationship. Patients with systemic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), can provide
important insights into this relationship because of their more extreme systemic inflammatory phenotype.
Investigators have appreciated the elevated risk of CVD experienced by RA patients: the risk of MI and stroke
are both elevated in RA compared with the general population, contributing to a shortened lifespan. CVD risk
stratification in RA is imprecise and general population tools are not accurate. Most attempts at improving CVD
risk stratification have added clinical RA factors to existing population risk tools. Easily assessed protein
biomarkers would likely enhance CVD risk prediction. The literature strongly suggests relationships between >
20 biomarkers shared by RA and CVD. These relationships have never been studied systematically across
diseases. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify protein biomarkers for CVD in RA patients,
leveraging the structure of a controlled trial and rigorous methods for deriving and validating a risk score. We
complement the robust biomarker analyses with high-dimensional cellular immuneprofiling, which has the
potential to link specific cell types mechanistically to protein biomarkers and to identify new cellular biomarkers.
 We conducted a randomized controlled trial, the TARGET trial, to examine whether specific treatments
for RA produce reductions in CV risk as measured by FDG PET/CT. This trial, funded by NIH (U01 AR068043)
allowed us to prospectively characterize RA patients, collect biospecimens before and after treatment, and
conduct baseline and 24-week FDG PET/CT scans to assess vascular inflammation. Analyses are still ongoing
to determine whether different RA treatments translate into differential changes in CV risk. We propose to
leverage the TARGET study cohort, dataset and biorepository for the following aims. Aim 1: To use a
comprehensive biomarker panel to derive and validate a CV risk score for patients with RA. The TARGET trial
provides biospecimens, patient phenotypes, and a broad biomarker discovery panel that will have been run as
an in-kind donation. We hypothesize that adding biomarkers to the Pooled Cohort Equation and variables
related to RA disease activity will significantly improve prediction of CV outcomes in RA patients. Aim 2: To
elucidate cellular immune mechanisms linking RA and CVD through scRNA-seq profiling. We will use single
cell transcriptomic and surface proteomics (CITE-seq) to study PBMCs from a subset of TARGET patients,
including both responders and non-responders based on FDG PET/CT, to identify circulating immune cell
populations associated with CV risk and CV biomarkers. We hypothesize that specific immune cell populations
will associate with CV risk at baseline and will decrease in abundance or activation state after treatment in
parallel with CV risk. Further, these treatments will differ in their effects on relevant cell populations."
10863852,"We aim to identify, predict and control the central brainstem neurons that integrate interoceptive inputs to
produce and determine the activity of the vagus nerve in regulating the heart. The level of “vagal outflow” is
strongly associated with the health of the heart. Insufficient vagal outflow contributes to many forms of heart
disease, which appear preventable and, potentially, reversible by increases in cardioprotective vagal outflow.
We aim to study the central neurons within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) that are an important
source of cardioprotective vagal outflow to the heart, as these are associated with some of the most devastating
diseases of the heart. We will determine the cardioprotective molecular mechanisms in DMV neurons in order to
use this information to intervene and affect those molecular mechanisms in ways that allow control of the vagal
outflow. We will accomplish this through an integrated experimental and computational analysis of the responses
of microRNAs and mRNAs in DMV neurons (e.g., Gorky et al. 2021). We have successfully followed this
approach using microRNA regulation in a parallel project on hypertension (DeCicco et al. 2015; Gorky, DeDicco
et al. in review), and seek to emulate that approach here. We have preliminary DMV data integrating interoceptive
inputs in cardiac ischemia and remote ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) suggesting this approach will be
applicable for vagal cardioprotection in male and female rats. We hypothesize that the vagal outflow that
drives cardioprotection in rIPC derives from an altered molecular activity within the dorsal motor nucleus
of the vagus (DMV), mediated by differential microRNA regulation in DMV neurons. Aim 1 will seek to
renormalize the molecular state of DMV neurons following left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation
by modulating the microRNA regulatory networks within the DMV. Aim 2 will identify the dynamic trajectory of
rIPC-induced microRNA and gene regulatory networks in DMV to predict rIPC-induced microRNA control points
in DMV that can potentially extend the molecular cardioprotective effect beyond the currently described 24-hour
efficacy window post rIPC. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that microRNAs regulated in response to rIPC, and
their targets putatively contributing to cardioprotection, are co-regulated in one or more specific subsets of DMV
neurons. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team for this project. Dr. Vadigepalli is a systems biologist with
skills in the analysis of high-dimensional datasets to derive predictions of transcriptional network modules and
of microRNA network regulators. Dr. Schwaber has extensive experience with the integrative circuit
neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the central mechanisms of vagal cardiac activity. Dr. Brailoiu is an expert
on neuronal processes in the brainstem autonomic nuclei and brings technical expertise on single neuron
isolation and analysis. These studies will take state-of-the-art molecular neurogenetics of systems biology and
control systems approaches, to enable test of our new central neuronal cardioprotection hypothesis, revealing
brainstem neuronal druggable targets for treatment of heart disease."
10861701,"The overarching goals of Dr. Myers’ research program are to apply exercise therapy and lifestyle intervention
to help restore function, reduce disability, and reduce health care costs in Veterans with chronic disease. These
areas include diagnostic and prognostic applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and the physiologic
effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs in patients with chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease,
abdominal aortic aneurysm disease, spinal cord injury, mild cognitive impairment, and chronic renal failure. He
is currently PI on a VA RR&D project entitled, “Telehealth Vs. Web-based deliveRed home-basEd walKing for
Vets with Peripheral Artery Disease (TREK-PAD)”, and a PCORI-funded project entitled, “Prehabilitation and
Rehabilitation in PAD: A Randomized Exercise Intervention Trial (PREPARE-IT)”. These projects extend his
lengthy history of research on the clinical applications of rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular disease.
TREK-PAD applies novel telehealth applications of exercise therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease
(PAD), a poorly represented group in rehabilitation studies. PREPARE-IT assesses the impact of a
prehabilitation strategy in patients with PAD scheduled to undergo endovascular stenting for leg pain due to
PAD. These studies are impactful in Veterans because studies have shown that Veterans have a markedly
higher prevalence of PAD than the general population; Veteran males between the ages of 45 and 64 undergo
peripheral angioplasty at a rate that is nearly 10-fold higher than rates for the US male population. Prehabilitation
is an emerging strategy recommended in numerous surgical guidelines but remains underutilized. Dr. Myers’
current projects also include studies involving rehabilitation in patients with mild cognitive impairment and
patients with kidney disease awaiting transplantation.
Dr. Myers initiated and manages a relational database of clinical, angiographic, and exercise test responses
dating back to 1987. This database has been a resource for answering many epidemiologic questions affecting
Veterans (termed the Veterans Exercise Testing Study, or VETS). The VETS study is an ongoing, prospective
evaluation of Veteran subjects referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons, designed to address exercise
test, clinical, and lifestyle factors and their association with health outcomes. The VETS data set has >750,000
subjects who have undergone a maximal exercise test in the VA system. Studies from the VETS cohort have
addressed the prevalence, temporal trends, and health care costs associated with statin use, obesity, chronic
heart failure, cardiac rhythm abnormalities and other chronic conditions, and how these conditions are
influenced by fitness, physical activity and other lifestyle patterns. Published studies from the VETS cohort have
influenced guidelines on exercise testing from major health organizations. He coordinates two other national
data bases, a 7-center heart failure cardiopulmonary exercise test consortium, and the AHA/CDC-sponsored
Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). The FRIEND initiative is
designed to develop a national fitness registry in order to better inform clinicians and the public about the
importance of physical activity and fitness and their role in the prevention of chronic disease. As Co-PI, he
recently completed a 6-year NIH-funded Specialized Center of Clinically-Oriented Research (SCCOR) project
entitled, “Exercise Therapy in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease.” The SCCOR program was initiated by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to foster multidisciplinary research on clinically relevant topics
facilitating basic science findings to be more rapidly applied to clinical problems, with an emphasis on
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a particular disease. This project has particular relevance to Veterans,
since it has been shown that the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurism disease in Veterans >60 years is
14.3%, with potentially lethal consequences if the disease is not treated."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease with a median survival of only 5-7 years.
Pathophysiologically, PAH is a progressive vasculopathy of the precapillary pulmonary vessels that increases
pulmonary arterial pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance while reducing pulmonary arterial compliance.
The changes in the pulmonary vasculature augment the work load of the right ventricle, which ultimately results
in right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). The presence of RVD is the greatest risk factor for death in PAH;
however, no current PAH therapies actually target the RV directly. In this proposal, we will investigate the
hypothesis that GP130 activation in RV cardiomyocytes promotes cardiomyocyte dysfunction via microtubule
remodeling which causes t-tubule derangements and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. We will use state-
of-the-art approaches to probe the molecular and physiological effects of GP130 antagonism on right
ventricular function in porcine RV failure."
10863939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, progressive aging-associated disease characterized by
scarred lung tissue containing excessive extracellular matrix (ECM). Changes in the oxidative (redox)
environment have long been known to accompany IPF, yet the mechanisms whereby redox perturbations affect
IPF pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Our laboratory has discovered that a specific type of protein
oxidation, termed protein glutathionylation, is increased in the lungs of IPF patients and inversely correlates with
lung function. Importantly, the activity of glutaredoxin (GLRX), an enzyme that reverses protein glutathionylation,
was strongly decreased in IPF patient lungs. New studies from our laboratory showed that collagen 1A1 (COL1),
a major component of the fibrotic ECM, is a target for glutathionylation (COL1-SSG) that is increased in IPF.
Glutathionylation of COL1-SSG in the C-terminal pro-domain caused partial resistance to degradation by multiple
collagenases. We also discovered that COL1-SSG is a potent activator of fibroblasts and causes oxidative
signals that promote further glutathionylation. Collagens are the most abundant proteins produced in the ER and
are challenging to properly assemble and process, requiring oxidative processes. Collagen has its own
autophagy system consisting of calnexin (CANX) and FAM134B to remove aberrantly processed collagen via
ER-linked autophagy. Autophagy is decreased in aging, and both CANX and FAM134B are decreased in lungs
from IPF patients. These collective observations led us to hypothesize that in the aging lung, increases in ER
oxidation and diminished collagen autophagy result in the secretion of COL1-SSG to promote the progression
of pulmonary fibrosis by the activation myofibroblasts via a self-propagating stimulus that can be diminished by
GLRX. In Specific Aim 1 we will address whether the activity of protein disulfide isomerase A3 which is important
in the oxidative folding of COL1, and attendant increases in ER oxidoreductin 1-derived hydrogen peroxide
contribute to COL1-SSG and the increases in age-associated persistent fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2 we will
examine whether COL1-SSG is secreted by fibroblasts from fibrotic lung and whether this is linked to alterations
in ER redox stress and collagen autophagy. In Specific Aim 3 we will elucidate whether GLRX status affects
COL1-SSG, myofibroblast activation and age-associated lung fibrosis. Completion of these proposed studies
that utilize a combination of targeted knockout models in aged mice and isolated (myo)fibroblasts from patients
with IPF will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which ECM dysregulation via oxidation (specifically
glutathionylation) affects COL1 stiffness and promotes the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Completion of the
workplan will begin to unravel the potential role of aberrant collagen autophagy in IPF. Finally, completion of the
proposed studies will also further elucidate the mechanisms of action whereby GLRX exerts anti-fibrotic activity
and identify the potential improved anti-fibrotic action of a newly created oxidation-resistant version of GLRX."

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory posits that early-life environment
contributes to nearly all common pediatric diseases (asthma, learning disorders, birth defects, obesity) and to
diseases in adult life. Recently the nascent field of “exposomics” -the study of all health relevant environment
across the lifespan has also taken hold, with new research initiatives such as the NIH Environmental influences
on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program and the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR)
program. Multiple IOM reports state that there is a national need to expand research to address environmental
medicine issues, and new NIH initiatives (HHEAR and ECHO) have emphasized that children's environmental
health is a research priority. There is a clear need for scientists trained in the principles and methodologies of
exposomics who can then translate research into environmental pediatrics. To address that need, the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine seeks both to renew its 2-3 year transdisciplinary, post-doctoral research training
program in environmental pediatrics that began in 2007 and to expand its scope to Exposomics, the study of all
health relevant environment. Two fellows are admitted per year. Focus is on training in epidemiology,
biostatistics, data science, lab assays, geospatial statistics, environmental medicine and of course, child health
and development. An MS or MPH degree in epidemiology is available as well. Our program excels in mentored
research that produces publications, meeting presentations/posters, NIH K awards and fosters transition
toward independent research. Our fellows develop a methodological base in child development and exposure
science principles giving them a versatile set of skills and resources that they can apply to study a wide range
of scientific questions. Each fellow is guided by an interdisciplinary mentoring team. Courses and experiential
training are provided in grant writing, ethics and responsible conduct of research. Supervised clinical
experience in environmental pediatrics ensures that research training is grounded in clinical translational
principles. Formal evaluation of fellows is conducted semi-annually. An Executive Faculty Committee and an
External Advisory Board are in place. Our program builds on a unique base of NIH funded children's
environmental health research, including 2 HHEAR Lab Hubs, the HHEAR Data Center, 2 ECHO cohorts, a
P30 Core Center grant, multiple child health research cohorts, a Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit,
and a unique Exposome Lab that specializes in exposure biomarkers. In its first 14 years, our program has
successfully recruited 30 fellows and graduated 24 (6 are still in training) of whom 14 have academic faculty
positions; 2 are doing additional research training fellowships, and the remaining 8 are in industry or
government. Seven have secured NIH funding; 4 in the last 5 years. Graduates are faculty at UC-Davis,
Columbia, NYU, U Minnesota, U of Cincinnati, Mount Sinai, work at the CDC and for Industry, have published
>400 papers and are now leaders in the nascent field of pediatric exposomics."

A Low Blood Volume Platform for Recurrent Anticoagulation and Kidney Monitoring during Continuous Renal
 Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Children
 (Fast-Track SBIR PA-20-260)
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a sudden decrease in the ability of the kidneys to adequately
maintain electrolyte, acid-base, and fluid balance. Up to 30% of children admitted to intensive care units develop
AKI and the presence of AKI is independently associated with increased length of hospitalization and higher
rates of mortality. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has emerged as the preferred dialysis modality
for critically ill children and is becoming increasingly common for newborns and small children (under 10 kg) with
AKI and congenital kidney failure. Frequent monitoring (2-6 times a day) of anticoagulant therapy (heparin,
heparinoids, etc.), kidney function (urea), and electrolyte composition (potassium, phosphorus, etc.) is necessary
during the course of CRRT. Existing laboratory tests require large blood volumes, and the cumulative blood loss
from routine bloodwork contributes to iatrogenic anemia. The majority of critically ill newborns (90% of extremely
low birth weight infants and 58% of premature infants) will require red blood cell transfusions during their time in
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as a result of frequent blood draws.
To meet the critical unmet need for rapid, low volume blood tests for CRRT monitoring in newborns and children,
we will develop a panel of four assays on our near-patient digital microfluidic (DMF) platform to provide
comprehensive profiling of anticoagulation dosing, kidney function, and phosphorus balance. Our innovative
system will simultaneously measure anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), and phosphorus from < 50 µL of whole blood input. Plasma separation from whole blood
(necessary for all four assays) will be automated on the cartridge to facilitate testing near the patient. By
combining four technically complex assays (typically sent to different sections in a lab such as hematology and
chemistry) into a single automated test, we can reduce sample-to-answer time and personnel time needed to
perform each individual assay, and can significantly reduce the cumulative volume of blood required for recurrent
monitoring over the full course of CRRT therapy.
Our collaborators on this Fast-Track project include pioneers in pediatric acute care nephrology with multiple
recent publications describing novel approaches to CRRT in newborns. Phase I of the project will establish
feasibility of the proposed testing platform through development of DMF anti-FXa, aPTT, BUN, and phosphorus
assays and demonstration of sufficient analytical and clinical performance. Phase II will combine the four assays
into a multiplexed reaction with a time-to-result of under 15 minutes, evaluate the analytical performance and
clinical concordance of each assay, and conduct onsite lead user testing of the system to establish reliability and
usability. Our final product will initially be marketed for use in newborn and pediatric patients undergoing CRRT.
Secondary markets will include both pediatric and adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery or other procedures
associated with kidney failure, toxin removal, and ultrafiltration of fluid."

 The proposed study will test the efficacy of a family-focused preventive intervention in improving
healthy lifestyles among first-time parents in military families and reducing obesity risk among their
infants. The ultimate goals of the intervention are to reduce rapid infant weight gain, an early indicator of
future obesity risk, and new mothers’ postpartum weight retention, a contributor to intergenerational
obesity transmission. In three trials, the Family Foundations (FF) program—consisting of a series of
classes delivered in a health care context before and after birth—has demonstrated robust, replicated,
long-term impact on family relationships (coparenting, parenting, family violence) and on parent and
child internalizing and externalizing problems through at least 7 years after birth. The theoretical “active
ingredient” of FF, validated by mediation analysis of program impact, is support for the development of a
cohesive, supportive coparenting relationship. In the proposed study, we will test an adapted version of
FF (termed “FF+”) that broadens the coparenting approach to help parents’ cooperate and support each
other in establishing and maintaining healthy family lifestyle behaviors and specific health-promoting
parenting strategies. We propose to test FF+ in military families, who experience overweight/obesity at
levels similar to their civilian counterparts. Recruitment and intervention will be conducted within
obstetric clinics in three Military Health System hospitals. Recruitment, intervention delivery, data
collection, and follow-up will be facilitated by the military context.
 Aim 1. To assess the efficacy of the adapted FF+ program in a randomized trial. 250 families will be
randomized to FF+ or control conditions. Data will be collected in home visits at pre-test during
pregnancy, post-test at 6 months postpartum, and follow-up at 12 months postpartum, with additional data
obtained from electronic health records. Aim 2. To test mediation pathways. Aim 3. To assess whether
baseline parent characteristics, program delivery fidelity, or participant engagement moderate program
effects on outcomes."

This application investigates the long-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures on child and
parent outcomes in a large and diverse sample of children and families recruited from Oregon and California.
The proposed study will draw from four existing federally funded prospective longitudinal studies investigating
the development of child emotional and behavior problems and related parenting experiences among
preschool and school aged children with and without developmental disabilities (DD; R01HD059838,
R01HD093667, R21MH114075, R324A180037). The targeted sample will include 613 children, ages 4–15
years, their caregivers, and their teachers who have been previously recruited and enrolled in separate
studies. Two of the four studies are randomized controlled trials in which parents received behavioral parent
training intervention to improve parent adjustment and child emotional and behavioral problems in youth with (n
= 257) and without DD (n = 356). This application proposes to continue to follow these study cohorts over a
period of three years and collect six additional assessments (Fall/Spring) of child and parent outcomes to
assess long-term impact of pandemic-related school closures on children and families. We will employ
harmonized data across the four related developmental prospective and experimental studies to estimate and
describe growth in child emotional and behavioral problems and parenting adjustment across three specific
COVID-19 school closure phases using piecewise growth model periods: (a) Pre-school closure, (b) During
school closure, and (c) Post-school closure. We will employ cohort-sequential missing data models with
propensity score matching of independent studies, study cohorts, and intervention conditions to compare
estimated prospective school closure phases. We will test the impact of perceived COVID-related stress on the
growth of child emotional and behavior problems and parenting adjustment across the three specific COVID19
school closure phases and test whether behavioral parent training intervention serves as a buffer to COVID-
related stress impacts on child emotional and behavior problems and parenting adjustment. The COVID-19
pandemic has undoubtedly impacted children, families, and educators in important ways, notably through loss
of educational services, economic and financial loss, illness or risk of illness, and stress and mental health
impacts. The extent to which these impacts affect long-term outcomes is unknown. Focusing on the long-term
impacts of pandemic-related school closures is a significant public health issue with implications for both policy
and intervention practices. Our sample is racially, ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse
providing additional generalizability of our findings. This proposal draws on our existing strengths in conducting
longitudinal intervention and prevention trials with children and youth with or at-risk for disability, our
longstanding collaborations, and the complementary expertise of the investigator team."
10863975,"Superoxide and other derivative reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote atherosclerosis (athero) as well as
vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) and macrophage inflammatory signaling. Anti-atherogenic strategies
targeting O2--producing NADPH oxidases, however, increase susceptibility to infection. This project’s goal is to
discern novel mechanisms for constraining ROS-promoted atherogenesis while minimizing adverse effects on
immunity. One such mechanism may involve the ubiquitously expressed noncoding small nucleolar (sno)
RNAs from the ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a) locus: SNORD32A, SNORD33, SNORD34, and SNORD35A.
We found that these snoRNAs augment ROS levels and oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Our Preliminary
Studies with Rpl13a-snoRNA-/- (snoKO) mice and SMCs derived from them show: (1) snoKO SMCs have
lower levels of ROS, cell proliferation and migration than congenic WT SMCs. (2) Compared with WT SMCs,
snoKO SMCs express 5.7-fold more cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2 (COX4I2), which reduces
mitochondrial O2- production. (3) SnoKO carotid arteries develop less athero than WT carotids when
transplanted orthotopically into Apoe-/- mice. (4) Compared with Apoe-/- mice, snoKO/Apoe-/- mice develop
40% less brachiocephalic athero. (5) Compared with snoRNA+/+ brachiocephalic arteries or carotid grafts,
snoKO arteries demonstrate less SMC-to-foam-cell transdifferentiation, a process potentiated by ROS.
SnoRNAs bind to their target RNAs via an antisense domain, then recruit the enzyme fibrillarin, which effects
RNA 2’-O-methylation. SnoRNAs canonically modify ribosomal RNA; however, we discovered that at least one
of the Rpl13a snoRNAs can target mRNA for 2’-O-methylation—a process that alters mRNA abundance and
translation. Nonetheless, specific mRNAs that constitute targets for pro-oxidant effects of Rpl13a-snoRNAs
remain obscure. This project will therefore test the hypotheses that Rpl13a snoRNAs promote athero,
particularly by potentiating SMC-to-foam cell transdifferentiation, and that that Rpl13a-snoRNA-guided mRNA
2’-O-methylation affects protein expression of key ROS-regulating enzyme(s) in SMCs and Mφs, including
COX4I2. To do so, this project will compare athero in Rpl13a-snoRNA-/-/Apoe-/- versus Apoe-/- mice, and use
bone marrow transplantation to discern the roles of Rpl13a-snoRNAs in bone marrow-derived cells versus
arterial wall-derived cells. We will investigate how Rpl13a-snoRNAs affect foam cell formation in macrophages
and SMCs, and determine whether COX4I2 engenders lower ROS levels and inflammation in snoKO SMCs.
Finally, we will identify mRNA targets of Rpl13a-snoRNAs in SMCs and macrophages, by performing
transcriptome-wide mapping of 2’-O-methylation sites on mRNA from WT and Rpl13a-snoRNA-/- SMCs and
macrophages, by using the RibOxi-seq and crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH)
approach. By elucidating mechanisms by which snoRNAs regulate ROS in SMCs and macrophages, this
project should identify new therapeutic targets for athero."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death due to a single pathogen globally and the UN has
set ambitious targets for reducing the burden of TB by 2030. TB preventive therapy (TPT) is a critical
intervention for preventing TB disease and modeling studies consistently indicate that expanded TPT coverage
is essential for reaching UN targets. Implementation of TPT among the populations at risk remains extremely
poor, however, and new regimens that are shorter and safer than the decades-old standard of isoniazid
preventive therapy are urgently needed. Over the past several decades, we have pioneered the development
of short-course, rifamycin-based TPT. We demonstrated the efficacy of 3 months of weekly rifapentine and
isoniazid (3HP) in people with and without HIV infection and showed that it is non-inferior to longer courses of
isoniazid, with better adherence and less toxicity. This regimen is now recommended as a first-line treatment
for latent TB infection by the CDC and the World Health Organization, offering the potential of substantially
increased uptake of TPT as part of the END TB Strategy. More recently, supported by NIAID, we have shown
that one month of daily rifapentine and isoniazid (1HP) is non-inferior to nine months of isoniazid in people with
HIV infection, with higher completion rates and less toxicity. The availability of two innovative, new short-
course TPT regimens offers a transformative opportunity to global TB control. The potential of a one-month
regimen to catalyze uptake of TPT in high-risk populations is enormous, but data on its safety and tolerability in
people without HIV infection are needed.
The goal of this investigator-initiated, clinical trial application is to conduct a randomized trial comparing
treatment success rates and safety of 1HP and 3HP TPT regimens in high-risk patients without HIV infection.
While 3HP has been proved safe and effective in HIV-positive and –negative people, 1HP has only been
shown to be safe and efficacious in HIV-positive people. Efficacy of 1HP in non-HIV populations may be
inferred based on previous experience that shows comparability of TPT regimens across risk groups, but
toxicity and tolerability is not known. We will 1) compare treatment success with good adherence, documented
by self-report, pill count, and pharmacologic monitoring, of 1HP compared with 3HP in HIV-uninfected adults
and adolescents at increased risk of TB and 2) compare the safety of 1HP vs 3HP in this population. We
hypothesize that successful treatment with 1HP will be superior to 3HP, and that the safety and tolerability of
1HP will be superior to 3HP. We will also compare the cost-effectiveness of 1HP and 3HP using a societal
approach, modeling the incremental cost-effectiveness of 1HP vs 3HP, 6H, and no treatment. We hypothesize
that 1HP will be cost saving vs 3HP, vs modelled costs of 6H and v no TPT. The results of this trial will be
extremely valuable for establishing global and US guidelines for use of 1HP in HIV-negative people."

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), is a type of bariatric surgery, which improves obesity-related diastolic dysfunction, a
hallmark finding of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). As weight reduction through dieting
and caloric restriction fails to improve cardiac function, this suggests a mechanism for diastolic function
improvement initiated from the alteration in gastrointestinal anatomy after SG. The broad, long-term objective
of this project is to explore if gut microbial changes after SG, lead to a bile acid pool rich in farnesoid X receptor
(FXR) agonists, that mediate diastolic function improvements. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
the post-SG gut microbiome increases plasma bile acid FXR agonists as a mechanism for cardiac function
improvement. Studies will be conducted utilizing fecal material transfer of SG mice as well as metagenomic
sequence analysis of SG stool from rodents and humans to determine the transferable effect of the gut
microbiome on the plasma BA pool and diastolic function. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether SG
plasma decreases cardiomyocyte metabolic stress via FXR activation. Human and rodent cardiomyocyte cell
lines will be engineered for regulated FXR expression to determine whether SG plasma reduces cardiac
metabolic stress through FXR agonism. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether SG improves diastolic
function through cardiomyocyte FXR signaling in vivo by performing surgery and assessing cardiac function in a
cardiomyocyte-specific FXR knockout mouse model. We hypothesize that SG enhances FXR signaling through
microbial-derived products to improve cardiac function. These findings will enhance our understanding of the
mechanisms for diastolic recovery after bariatric surgery to develop novel surgical and non-surgical therapies for
diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF which replicate the metabolic mechanisms generated by a SG."

Malaria afflicted 247 million people in 2021, of which over 600,000 died. In the most severe cases, patients can
develop organ-specific pathologies related to vascular leak, including cerebral malaria and malaria-associated
acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS). The mechanisms of pulmonary vascular leak are poorly
understood, and the long-term goal of this work is to define the molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary
vascular leak in malaria to develop rationale therapeutics to treat this condition. It has been previously shown
that CD8 T cells and platelets are activated by Plasmodium in humans and are required for vascular breakdown
in mouse models, but specific mechanisms underlying how these cells incur damage is still unclear. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that platelets contribute both directly and indirectly to MA-ARDS by promoting
CD8 cytotoxicity leading to barrier dysfunction. The rationale of this work is that identifying how platelets
augment the pathogenicity of CD8 T cells will provide new avenues for chemotherapeutic targeting of MA-ARDS.
Published work from the Lamb lab and preliminary data shown here demonstrate that mice deficient in platelet
a-granules (Nbeal2-/-) survive Plasmodium berghei infection and fail to develop vascular leak in the lungs and
brain. In intestinal colitis models, published work by the Petrey lab has demonstrated that platelet granule-derived
hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) is responsible for driving degradation of hyaluronan (HA) in the endothelial glycocalyx
(eGC), which serves as a key modulator of barrier integrity. Our preliminary data show that HA fragments in the
plasma, an indicator of glycocalyx breakdown, are increased in infected wildtype mice but not in platelet a-
granule-deficient mice. The literature shows that HA fragments can promote cellular activation and proliferation,
and our preliminary data demonstrate that the Nbeal2-/-, which have low plasma HA, have low CD8 T cell
accumulation in the lung during Plasmodium infection. The published literature and our preliminary data have
led us to form the working hypothesis that platelet cleaves the endothelial glycocalyx, promoting CD8 T cell
activation and recruitment via circulating HA fragments and exposing endothelial cells to CD8 effector molecules,
resulting in barrier damage. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Demonstrate that platelet a-granule HYAL2 is required for eGC breakdown in MA-ARDS.
 Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that plasma HA promotes pathogenic CD8 trafficking via CD44 binding.
We expect that the work proposed in Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which platelet hyaluronidase
causes pulmonary vascular leak during MA-ARDS, which has not previously been described in malaria, and
demonstrate how the resulting plasma HA modulates CD8 T cell activation and trafficking. We anticipate that the
findings from this work will provide a much-needed deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MA-ARDS,
inform on potential mechanisms underlying vascular leak in other disease models, and give insight into potential
pathways that could be targeted therapeutically to disrupt MA-ARDS in the clinic."

Macroautophagy is a degradative cellular process that is upregulated in response to stress. Dysregulation of
autophagy is broadly associated with several diseases including cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration.
However, since this process is essential for mammalian development, diseases affecting core autophagy
genes are very rare. For example, ATG3 is a core autophagy gene that is crucial for the formation of the
autophagosome and there are no known disease-causing mutations within this gene. Interestingly, there is a
patient with an undiagnosed severe neurodevelopmental disease found to have a point mutation in a single
allele of the ATG3 gene. Intriguingly, ATG3 has been implicated in other conjugations thought to be
independent of autophagy. These other conjugations regulate mitochondria and endolysosomal trafficking,
both of which have significant roles in neurologic disease. My thesis work has largely focused on the patient
mutation and its effect on autophagy, but my preliminary data indicates that all ATG3 activities appear to be
disrupted in patient cells. Therefore, I propose to develop tools to further understand the cell biological
consequences of these non-canonical ATG3 activities and use these tools to understand the effect of
the patient mutation beyond autophagy. This project is designed to provide training for a successful future
career in independent research. The findings from this project will improve the understanding of complex
cellular processes and how they can result in disease.
This proposal focuses on two aims: Aim One – Determine the impact of a patient mutation on lipidation-
independent activities of ATG3; Aim Two – Determine if lipidation-independent ATG3 activity is dependent on
membrane binding. Aim One will use microscopy techniques I developed in patient cells and a knockout-
rescue strategy in gene-edited cells to directly evaluate the impact of the mutation on the formation and
downstream consequences of these autophagy-independent complexes. Aim Two will capitalize on the
techniques established in Aim One and biochemical experiments routinely performed in our lab to investigate
potential mechanisms by which these autophagy-independent ATG3 complexes are regulated and function.
The work in this proposal detailing the effect of this ATG3 mutation has the potential to describe the first severe
disease-producing allele of ATG3. Additionally, this work aims to distinguish and characterize previously
inseparable ATG3 functions, leading to a new understanding of both foundational biological processes and
their downstream clinical relevance."
10826029,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. Beyond their ability to restore normal
tissues, their potential can be expanded even further through engineering approaches to create new lineages
with therapeutic properties that are not normally made in vivo. In preliminary studies, we have created pluripotent
stem cell lines that 1) have been genomically edited such that they are able to cross human-mouse barriers; 2)
engineered these cells to carry a knockin insertion of a broadly neutralizing HIV antibody at the endogenous loci.
With these cells, we will develop strategies to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into transplantable
pathogen-specific plasma cells. This process will involve iterative and recursive steps to engineer pluripotent
stem cell differentiation to downstream hematopoietic, B cell, and plasma cell lineages using single cell
transcriptional trajectories as guides. These targeted approaches will be complemented with unbiased genetic
and small molecule screens for new pathways that promote or inhibit specific steps in differentiation, and
additional single cell transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses to provide templates for cellular engineering."

Clonal expansions increase with age throughout many tissues in the body. These outgrowths are driven by
somatic mutations that provide a selective advantage over wild-type cells within a specific microenvironment.
Clonal expansions radically increase with age, and are also shaped by disease-related factors. How these factors
and clonal mosaicism (CM), reciprocally influences each other constitute some of the most important biological
questions in current human genetics. A detailed understanding of the biology of aging at the cellular and
molecular level is needed for the development of potential mitigation therapies that target aging morbidities.
To make progress toward this goal, we need enhanced ability to identify and characterize recurrent somatic
mutations in both healthy and diseased aging tissues at high-resolution. As identification of clones is hampered
by low tissue availability and resource-intensive DNA sequencing methods, conceptual and technical innovation
overcoming these challenges could rapidly accelerate the pace of variant discovery. Once discovered, functional
characterization of these clonal variants in genetically heterogenous tissues requires application of genotype-
aware, multi-modality methods in primary human samples to link genotypes and epigenetic profiles of individual
cells. Currently, no such tools exist to characterize multiple molecular features of the somatic epigenome.
To address these important gaps, we aim to (i) develop tools for the identification of candidate somatic variants
at scale from publicly available data and (ii) apply novel technologies that map genotype to epigenetic phenotype
in single cells, enabling analysis of multiple tissues from clinical samples obtained from aging individuals.
Specifically, we aim to harness advancements in machine learning to develop a tool that can accurately identify
somatic variants in bulk RNA-seq and apply it to publicly available data in healthy and diseased tissue from aged
individuals. We believe that we can gain valuable information about the clonal architecture of diabetes, obesity,
hypertension and other age-related diseases from our public databases at low cost and high speed.
Furthermore, we aim to examine how epigenetic modifier mutations shape the chromatin regulatory landscape
(including histone modifications and chromatin accessibility) to promote clonal outgrowth in CM. We will use
newly developed tools to assay genotype, chromatin accessibility and histone marks in ASXL1-mutant CH and
FOXO1-mutant fatty liver disease to define differentially accessible and active regions, their associated genes
and transcription factor binding motifs and their enrichment along lineage trajectories. By integrating these
modalities, we will have an unprecedented view of the effect of somatic variants on the aging epigenome and
gain insights into how these mutations may drive clonal expansion. This project will be ideal for a training
physician-scientist, given its use of novel sequencing technologies and direct clinical implications. With the
mentorship of my sponsor, thesis committee, MD- PhD program, and the support of this fellowship, I am confident
I will be well prepared to pursue and achieve my goal of being a physician scientist and independent investigator."
10826835,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
All patients in the US with kidney failure should have fair and timely access to the benefits of kidney
transplantation, but long-standing disparities and ineffective organ allocation policy have frustrated that
promise. There have been multiple changes to the kidney allocation system to address transplant disparities,
most recently in March 2021 when kidneys were prioritized to candidates listed within a 250 nautical mile
radius of the hospital of the deceased donor (KAS250), rather than within fixed donor service areas.
Because kidney organ allocation uses complex rules that incorporate several patient characteristics to
determine which candidates receive deceased donor organs, changes aimed at mitigating one problem often
have unintended consequences. For instance, a 2014 change to the allocation system increased kidney
transplants for sensitized candidates but unintentionally reduced transplants for pediatric candidates 0-6 years
of age. We therefore propose to comprehensively study the impact of the new allocation system, both in
ensuring equitable distribution of organs to transplant centers across the US based on patient priority on the
waitlist, which was the aim of the policy change, and the new policy’s impact on kidney transplant rate
disparities for vulnerable populations who have historically been disenfranchised by allocation policy.
The new KAS250 system will ultimately evolve to continuous allocation where transplant candidate distance
from donor hospital will be one weighted component among other patient factors. Our group has an ongoing
R01-funded study (R01DK132395) to design a continuous allocation system for kidneys using a
computationally intensive simulation and optimization algorithm that simulates thousands of possible
continuous allocation systems. We will apply our equity metrics to simulation outputs to determine the impacts
of any proposed allocation system on vulnerable populations. We will also incorporate our metrics into the R01
algorithm to design a continuous allocation system that prevents inequity by design.
In this project, we will accomplish the following aims: (1) To evaluate whether the supply of organs is equitably
distributed among US transplant centers in the new KAS250 system (2) To develop novel metrics that describe
the landscape of disparities for vulnerable populations in the new allocation system and (3) To evaluate
projected disparities from simulations of proposed continuous allocation systems. The equity metrics of Aims 1
and 2 will be calculated from adjusted regression models using national databases. By performing this
research while pursuing a PhD in Epidemiology at the richly resourced NYU Langone Vilcek Institute, Dr.
Liyanage will receive rigorous training in epidemiology, research methodology, conceptual frameworks of
social determinants of health, and simulations and machine learning as it applies to health policy, furthering her
goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist by following the example of her mentor, Dr. Dorry Segev."
10826961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Despite conventional lipid-
lowering therapies to treat CVD, nearly 50% of patients suffer recurrent cardiac events that is attributed to
excessive inflammation. Recent work from our group and others has demonstrated that failed resolution of a
chronic inflammatory response is an important driver of inflammation seen in atherosclerotic plaques that result
in clinical events. The resolution program is orchestrated by the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) and
the production of anti-inflammatory agonists known as specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs). Notably,
continual efferocytosis, which entails the successive uptake of ACs by individual macrophages in settings where
cell death is rampant, is necessary to resolve inflammation. Advanced atherosclerotic plaques are characterized
by large necrotic cores, caused by inefficient efferocytosis, and an imbalance of pro-inflammatory to pro-
resolving mediators compared to early lesions, suggestive of failed resolution. Our primary aim for project is to
uncover the endogenous cues that underlie dysregulated inflammation resolution seen in atherosclerosis.
Intriguingly, recent publications suggest macrophages can have a memory-like response called “trained innate
immunity”. In response to an inflammatory stimulus such as oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL), innate
immune cells undergo metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming that primes them to a ‘hyperactive’ state, where
they can more rapidly mount an augmented secondary response. Hyper-responsiveness upon activation by a
second innate stimuli ultimately boosts bacterial and viral immunity but may be detrimental for chronic diseases
like atherosclerosis. Our preliminary data identified Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase IV (CaMK4) as
regulator of both resolution and innate immune memory. Our preliminary data suggests that CaMK4 supports
the proinflammatory phenotypes seen in innate immune memory in part due to its negative regulation on
efferocytosis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that myeloid CaMK4 is a critical mediator of immune
memory and that immune training impairs resolution through a CaMK4-dependent mechanism. Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that trained immunity impairs continual efferocytosis in myeloid cells, promoting
atheroprogression. Aim 2 will explore the role of CaMK4 in the development of trained immunity through its
negative regulation of important resolution genes."
10827014,"Abstract: The welding industry in the US exposes over 600,000 workers to toxic welding fumes, including the
neurotoxic metal manganese (Mn), which can cause manganism, a condition with psychological, cognitive, and
motor deficits similar to Parkinson's disease. While effects of inhalation exposure to Mn and accumulation of
brain Mn in welders have been studied widely, most (if not all) studies tend to exclude the contributions of iron
(Fe), which competes with Mn for the same metal transporter for uptake into the brain. Information about the
effects of excess exposure to both, Mn and Fe, is still scarce and unclear. Some studies indicate that excess of
both metals could enhance metal-associated toxicity, while other evidence suggests that co-exposure to Mn and
Fe appears to counteract oxidative stress from each other. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) allow for the separate visualization of manganese and iron deposition in the human brain. More specifically,
multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques surpass the limitations of conventional imaging by
determining tissue parameters quantitatively. The advantage of this quantitative approach is the ability to better
disentangle Mn and Fe depositions and identify how regions of high Mn or Fe deposition may correlate with
specific symptoms of manganese neurotoxicity. To address the current knowledge gap on the relationship
between high chronic exposure to Mn and Fe, and the onset of neurologic dysfunction, this research aims to
develop methods that combine qMRI and network science to better understand the brain’s mediation mechanism
to excess metal accumulation and distribution, and neuropsychological changes associated with these
processes. This will ultimately enable non-invasive measurements to support early diagnoses, monitor metal-
related disease progression, and assess therapeutic responses. Our long-term goal is to use this newly acquired
knowledge to establish feasible clinical screening tools to diagnose and prevent adverse health effects due to
exposure to toxicants in the environment. To test the central hypothesis that quantitative MRI (qMRI) can quantify
changes in Mn and Fe deposition separately, the specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) To visualize and
quantify subject-specific excess brain Mn and Fe deposition using qMRI imaging and 2) To characterize the
brain’s mediation mechanism to excess metal accumulation and its association with neuropsychological
outcomes. Our project will have a significant translational impact by expanding the scope of innovative imaging
technology to other fields interested in assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of MRI contrast-enhancing
toxic metals such as chromium and gadolinium. Furthermore, these findings may guide policies on establishing
safe exposure limits for airborne particles to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for welders."
10826918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acanthamoeba castellanii is a free-living amoeba (FLA) that causes usually fatal central nervous system
infections like granulomatous amebic encephalitis. FLAs like A. castellanii are bacterivorous and co-exist with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa are ubiquitous environmental Gram-negative bacteria. Given that A.
castellanii creates an evolutionary pressure for P. aeruginosa to defend itself against amoebal grazing, we
hypothesized that P. aeruginosa may produce one or more secreted amoebicidal compounds that can be
harnessed to treat amoeba infections in humans.
We have since demonstrated that the cell-free supernatants of P. aeruginosa strain PA14 are lethal to A.
castellanii trophozoites. Our preliminary data has established that trophocidal activity resides in a <3 kDa (“small
molecule”) fraction of the cell-free supernatant, which is not toxic to mammalian cells. Importantly, the small
molecule fraction prepared from ᐃrhlRᐃrhlI mutant bacteria (PA14ᐃrhlRᐃrhlI), which do not secrete
rhamnolipids, retains trophocidal activity. Using a bioactivity guided fractionation pipeline developed by the
Crawford lab, I have begun to narrow down fractions which retain activity. I will determine the identity and
structure of small molecules present in these active fractions through mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. The isolated compounds will be tested for efficacy against FLAs and toxicity against
human cells.
The PA14ᐃrhlRᐃrhlI small molecule fraction causes rapid A. castellanii cell rounding and detachment (within 40
minutes) and complete amoeba death between 8 and 10 hours. In the second aim of this proposal, I will
determine the mechanism of cell death of small molecules produced by P. aeruginosa by assessing essential
cellular processes such as cell membrane permeability, changes in mitochondrial activity, and DNA damage. My
long-term goal is to understand the key chemical weapons that P. aeruginosa is secreting to kill A. castellanii
trophozoites. Knowledge of these natural compounds and their mechanism of action will help us develop novel
therapeutic agents for devastating human infections by A. castellanii and other free-living amoebae.
This project encompasses a broad interdisciplinary training in not only microbiology and chemistry, but also
molecular biology. My training plan entails immersing myself in two distinct but intertwined fields, rigorous
integrative coursework, multiple opportunities for mentoring and developing scientific communication skills. This
training plan will provide me with a supportive, collaborative, and gratifying environment that will allow me to
develop and succeed as an emerging female Latina scientist in field."
10826972,"Project Summary
 Depression, addiction, and disordered eating are common mental health disorders that affect millions of
people worldwide, and all involve dysregulated reward circuitry leading to abnormally low, or abnormally high
reward pursuit. While there are some effective treatments for these disorders, not all individuals respond well to
these treatments and some experience significant side effects. Therefore, it is vital to develop new therapies that
induce behavioral changes quickly and remain effective for extended periods. Recently, clinical trials using
psychedelic drugs to treat these disorders and others have shown promising and long-lasting results, and trials
are now underway using psilocybin to treat eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder.
 Although these findings are exciting, it remains a concern that little is known about the mechanisms by
which psychedelics may have therapeutic effects, other than that their actions require agonism of the serotonin
(5-HT) 2A receptor. Animal models are useful to study these mechanisms and establish their causal effects, but
animal models of depression, and especially of psychedelic drug actions, are to say the least challenging in
rodents. Here we capitalize on our well-validated, translationally relevant rat early-life adversity (ELA) model,
which causes long-lasting and sex-dependent alteration in reward circuitry, such as anhedonia in males and
excessive pursuit of rewards in females. Parallel findings emerge in our model and in men and women who
experienced low socioeconomic status, trauma, or chaotic early-life environments, allowing us to interrogate in
rodents the responsible brain mechanisms, and potential therapeutics.
 My project will examine the effects of psychedelic 5-HT2A agonist drugs DOI and psilocybin on ELA-
induced alterations to food-seeking behavior and reward circuit function in rats. We acknowledge that these
drugs may act differently in rats and humans, but nonetheless our preliminary data suggests that at least some
ELA-induced changes in reward pursuit are persistently reversed by a single dosing of DOI when it’s
administered in a familiar and reward-filled “set and setting.” The current proposal aims to replicate and extend
these exciting findings, determining the effective DOI dose range, and determining whether DOI effects also
occur with the more readily translatable 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin. Further, we investigate whole-brain regional
activity associated with ELA-induced anhedonia/hyperhedonia, and of its reversal by psychedelics.
 These studies may help develop a new animal model of the therapeutic effects of 5-HT2A stimulation,
leveraging established models of developmental adversity, multiple 5-HT2A agonist drugs, and behavioral
procedures modeled to the extent possible on human treatment protocols. We hope these studies will contribute
to the sorely-needed body of basic research on psychedelic drug effects, and provide new insights that could be
capitalized upon when developing maximally effective, but minimally disruptive therapeutic strategies."
10832570,"Efforts to improve maternal and child population health outcomes require access to reliable and timely data
while appropriately addressing challenges related to regulatory barriers, privacy issues, data ownership, and
technical limitations. In the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) 2.0, we
addressed these challenges with the implementation of the first phase of the Lifespan Data Integration Module.
Program goals included 1) supporting seamless integration of maternal, neonatal, and pediatric records to
establish a population-based, regional perinatal research data repository, or data hub, which would also enable
linkage to ancillary data sets using individual level identifiers or geocoded address information; and 2)
investigating longitudinal lifespan exposures before, during, and after pregnancy that impact disease
susceptibility and health trajectories. We addressed regulatory concerns [Institutional Review Board (IRB)
protocol approval granted at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and the University of
Cincinnati (UC) Medical Center], established formalized data sharing agreements, and convened a stakeholder
advisory board to approve distributions of de-identified data sets. We acquired data representing over 150,000
mothers and their infants born from 2013-2018 from CCHMC, Every Child Succeeds, and UC Health. These
data were geocoded and linked using automated and validated algorithms built by the study team with
technical details and a roadmap for overcoming regulatory challenges outlined in several peer-reviewed
publications. Multidisciplinary partnerships have likewise published results of studies using the Lifespan Data
Integration Module. One study team leveraged the module’s geocoding capability to implement census tractlevel
neonatal surveillance representing rates of intrauterine opioid exposure, neonatal abstinence syndrome,
and hepatitis C exposure. Another team study evaluated trends in antibiotic use among newborns with
abdominal wall defects. For the next phase of the Lifespan Data Integration Module under CCTST 3.0, we will:
1) increase the volume of core records by integrating electronic health records from additional birth hospitals
and incorporate vital statistics records; and 2) expand the types of data contained through integration of social
determinants, environmental exposures, and a biospecimen research inventory. As a result, the Lifespan Data
Integration Module will continue to catalyze perinatal research efforts through engagement of additional
multidisciplinary teams, both within and external to the CCTST community."
10857034,"Significant disparities in incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer are reported 
among ethnically and racially diverse population. African Americans suffer from lung 
cancer more than any other population. High mortality rate in lung cancer is due to 
being diagnosed at a later stage, where treatment options are limited. Our long-term 
goal is to lay the groundwork for developing novel nanoplatform based device which 
will provide a more accurate determination of the circulating cancer biomarkers from 
lung cancer patients in blood screening facilities. The objective of this proposal is to 
design magnetic-fluorescence multifunctional nanoplatform based device to capture, 
isolate and detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor derived exosomes from 
blood samples in lung cancer patients and to establish correlations of these findings 
with survival. Our central hypothesis is that bio-conjugated multicolor fluorescence 
carbon dots attached magnetic nano-platform can be used to capture multiple types 
of CTCs and circulating exosomes from blood samples, and as a facile multicolor 
fluorescence probe for accurate identification of circulating biomarkers. The central 
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Developing fluorescence- 
magnetic nanoplatform for capture, and identification of multiple types of CTCs from 
lung cancer patient blood and 2) Capture and identification of tumor derived 
exosomes using nanoplatform and demonstration of clinical applications. The 
proposed research is significant, because with high sensitivity and real-time 
detection possibility, CDs attached magnetic nano-platform will be highly promising 
for detection and identification of several subpopulation types of CTCs and 
exosomes. The proximate expected outcome of this work is improving the capability 
of identifying multiple clinically relevant blood based biomarkers in blood screening 
facilities."
10865111,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Black Americans are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EOL) care in part due to racial disparities in goal-
concordant care, inadequate pain treatment, and reduced palliative care access, among others. Despite dec-
ades of research documenting racial disparities in EOL care, there has been little progress in rectifying these
inequities. This is in part due to a failure to recognize structural racism (e.g. anti-Black discrimination and mis-
treatment created and reinforced by multiple societal institutions including education, employment, housing,
policing, and healthcare) as a root cause of racial disparities. There is a critical research gap in our under-
standing of how structural racism influences racial disparities in the receipt of quality EOL care and
interventions to address them. The objective of this Beeson proposal is to understand and address structural
racism and its influence on the receipt of quality EOL care in older Black adults. This project's career develop-
ment plan will provide Dr. Elizabeth Dzeng with skills and knowledge in CBPR, implementation sciences,
clinical trials, leadership in community academic partnerships, structural racism scholarship, geriatrics, and life
course perspectives. A Beeson award will enable her to become an independent investigator in understanding
and addressing structural racism in EOL care using CBPR and support her long-term goal to become an inter-
national research leader in health and racial equity in geriatric palliative care. This study will be conducted at
two sites, the San Francisco Bay Area and Birmingham, Alabama, to provide institutional and local variation to
enable understanding of the influence of local and institutional histories, policies, and cultures on healthcare.
Dr. Dzeng has already been establishing community connections and developing her Community Advisory
Board. The first aim of this proposal seeks to understand the lived experiences of structural racism that older
Black adults face and how they perceive it influences EOL care. The project's second aim is to understand how
structural racism at the institutional and community level drives inequities in the provision of quality EOL care
and the barriers and facilitators to institutional change. The third aim is to design, pilot, and determine the ac-
ceptability and feasibility of an intervention that adapts a multi-component pathway to hospitals to mitigate
structural racism in EOL care. This study is highly innovative because it would be the first study to systemati-
cally examine and address structural racism in geriatric palliative care using life course perspectives and
CBPR. It uses novel interview methods and CBPR to examine the multi-level factors that contribute to racial
inequities in EOL care at a systemic level. This study is significant because it will develop understand at a
deeper level of how structural racism impacts end-of-life care and address structural racism through a multi-
disciplinary multi-component intervention. This study will inform a future R01 application for a multi-center hy-
brid effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial of an institution-level anti-racism protocol development
intervention to mitigate structural racism in EOL care."

 To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence
risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment
(MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to
identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The
K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet
her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide
strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient
adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD,
Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak
Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase
research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research
using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be
conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of
Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked
genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are
twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations
of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the
role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these
relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary
data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand
program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods
study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators
influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify
factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the
candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder
research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis
including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6)
implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk
factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health
systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD."
10865113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of my laboratory is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how intracellular
metabolic pathways impact bone health. Within this scope the current project aims to explore the osteo-
anabolic effects of intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) via its modulation of lipid metabolism on cells within
the skeletal niche. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are late-onset diseases affecting a staggering 54 million
people in the U.S
.
In addition to the financial burden, osteoporosis-related fractures often lead to multiple
comorbidities which significantly reduce longevity. While anabolic agents that increase bone formation such as
PTH or PTH related protein’s (PTHrP) have aided in the management of osteoporosis, patients still experience
adverse side-effects. Therefore, continued development of refined therapeutic options is necessary. As such,
this project presents dual, complimentary mechanisms whereby PTH signaling up-regulates lipolysis in bone
marrow adipocytes (BMAdipo), releasing lipid species into the skeletal niche, while also enhancing fatty acid
oxidation in osteoblasts. Given the intimate proximity of BMAdipo to osteoblasts, it stands to reason that PTH
treatment acts on both BMAdipo to liberate lipid species while also ‘priming’ the osteoblast to utilize these lipids
as a mechanism capable of supporting the energy demanding process of bone formation. Therefore, our
overarching hypothesis is that PTH’s bone anabolic actions involve stimulation of lipolysis in BMAdipo and
enhanced fatty acid oxidation in osteoblasts. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. The first aim
(SA1) will determine the ability of PTH-stimulated BMAdipo lipolysis to support PTH-induced bone formation,
both in vivo and in vitro. This will be accomplished using a new mouse model, developed by the Co-I, designed
to specifically inhibit lipolysis in BMAdipo. These mice will then be ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated on
and be treated with PTH or vehicle control. Skeletal and metabolic parameters will be assessed at the end of
the study. In addition to this experiment, lipid species released from BMAdipo upon PTH treatment will be
characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The second aim (SA2) will define
PTH’s ability to alter osteoblast lipid metabolism via modulation of cellular bioenergetics. Tracing of 13C18 oleic
acid will be performed using LC-MS to determine fatty acid metabolic fate during PTH treatment in osteoblasts.
Additionally, osteoblast mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation substrate dependency will be measured during
PTH using Seahorse XFe96 technology. Finally, osteoblast bioenergetics will be monitored using reversed-
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to determine adenosine monophosphate (AMP),
adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ATP flux under control conditions and during PTH stimulation. In summary,
the goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of PTH’s ability to promote bone formation via the
modulation of lipid metabolism. This project is expected to have substantial health-related influence as it will
identify new areas for therapeutic exploration that are crucial to improve the management of osteoporosis."
10866346,"Among older adults, heart valve disease is common and often requires treatment with valve repair or
replacement. What used to require open heart surgery can now be done with less invasive transcatheter heart
valve interventions (THVIs), allowing for less morbidity and quicker recovery. However, despite the safety and
procedural success of THVIs, over one-half of patients are dead, have poor quality of life (QoL), and/or are
hospitalized 1 year after a THVI. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) effectively mitigates these poor outcomes in
patients with cardiovascular disease, including those undergoing heart valve procedures. However, among
Medicare beneficiaries, only 25% of those undergoing a THVI participate in center-based CR (CBCR), which
highlights a significant unmet clinical need. To address this need, our long-term goal is to develop a home-
based CR (HBCR) program that extends the benefits of CR to more individuals after THVIs. Our over-arching
hypothesis is that a HBCR mobile health intervention that innovatively addresses key target health behaviors
will reduce clinical events and improve physical activity, functional capacity, and QoL after THVIs and that an
interactive delivery and longer duration of the active intervention will produce greater benefits. We propose a
multicenter randomized controlled trial enrolling 375 patients undergoing aortic or mitral THVIs who do not
intend to participate in CBCR; those who intend to pursue CBCR will be followed in a registry. Participants will
be assigned to 3 groups: control (1) vs. a HBCR mobile health intervention with hands-off (2) vs. interactive (3)
delivery. The intervention addresses key target health behaviors and includes Apple Watch (to encourage
physical activity and give reminders on healthy living) and an exercise prescription (to build strength/balance).
The hands-off and interactive delivery groups receive the same intervention, except for a video call (every
other week) with an exercise physiologist (interactive group only). Each intervention group (hands-off,
interactive) will be randomized to 12-week vs. 24-week duration of the active intervention. The co-primary
endpoints are: (1) clinical events composite (death, rehospitalization, skilled nursing facility visits); and (2)
average daily total activity counts. Key secondary endpoints: amount, intensity, consistency of physical activity;
6-minute walk distance; and QoL. We test whether the HBCR mobile health intervention (compared to control)
reduces clinical events and improves physical activity, function capacity, and QoL after THVI (Aim 1) and
whether interactive vs. hands-ff delivery (Aim 2) or 24-week vs. 12-week active duration (Aim 3) of the
intervention yields greater benefits. We also explore mediators of clinical benefit and mechanisms of behavior
change. With population aging, prevalence of heart valve disease and number of THVIs are rapidly increasing.
Overcoming disablement associated with severe valve disease requires more than simply fixing a valve; the
potential of THVIs to improve quantity and quality of life is unfulfilled without integrating CR. If successful, our
approach will optimize value of care and patient outcomes with broad implications for other patient populations."
10866445,"Problem: There is urgent need to reach women involved in criminal justice (WICJ) for
lifesaving, evidence-based PrEP and medications for OUD (MOUD), using innovative
healthcare delivery models that surmount existing social and structural barriers to engagement.
Purpose: We use our newly validated decision aid and eHealth to remotely deliver integrated
PrEP and MOUD to community-based WICJ with OUD in New Haven, Connecticut (CT) and
Birmingham, Alabama (AL). Methods: We will enroll 250 PrEP-eligible WICJ with OUD to
undergo randomization to: a) the “Athena” strategy, which includes the decision aid + eHealth
for remote integrated PrEP/MOUD with a provider using outputs from the decision aid; or b)
decision aid-only with referral to community-based PrEP/MOUD. Randomization will be stratified
by site; past 6-month use of any stimulants; and baseline receipt of MOUD. Follow-up study
assessments occur at months 1, 3, and 6. To understand implementation, we will conduct
population modeling and engage with relevant stakeholders through focus groups using nominal
group technique and in-depth individual interviews. Aims: The Aims of the project are: 1) To
compare the Athena strategy to decision aid-only in terms of patient-level engagement in the
PrEP and OUD care continua, considering key site differences; and 2) To assess scale-up
potential of the Athena strategy in terms of modelled long-term outcomes and how stakeholders
interact with eHealth for integrated PrEP/MOUD in WICJ in two diverse epidemiological and
implementation contexts (CT and AL), using standardized definitions of implementation
outcomes. Significance: The proposed research directly addresses the key objectives of RFA-
DA-22-040 and priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research by testing innovative interventions
to reduce stigma and improve the PrEP and OUD care continua in the key priority population of
WICJ with OUD. Importance is high due to the focus on WICJ with OUD who have high HIV risk
and in whom PrEP delivery strategies are limited. Innovation is high through use of a stigma-
reducing decision aid and eHealth to overcome documented barriers to PrEP uptake, and a
design that measures clinical alongside implementation outcomes in two diverse settings.
Feasibility is high due to access to large numbers of WICJ with OUD in both contexts and a
research team with considerable content expertise, collaborations, and supportive research
infrastructure. Public health significance is high because delivering PrEP to key populations is
central to EHE and assessing implementation factors to guide scale-up in two diverse contexts
will help guide other settings where HIV prevention is needed."
10866447,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The preclinical phase of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LoAD) is a crucial time period for diagnosis and
intervention that is not well-modeled by the transgenic animal models commonly used in aging research. This
lack of strong models exists despite the fact that LoAD accounts for well over 90% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
cases and thus represents the bulk of the disease burden. At particularly high risk for LoAD are female carriers
of the ε4 apolipoprotein allele, a risk that has been linked to the menopause transition (MT). Macaque monkeys
well-model the preclinical phase of LoAD; this species recapitulates patterns of accumulation of amyloid and
tau pathology seen with aging in humans, and shows accompanying memory impairment equivalent to mild
cognitive impairment in humans. Furthermore, female macaques undergo the MT, and there is only one
macaque apolipoprotein isoform, equivalent to the human ε4 allele; all female macaques are therefore at high
risk for LoAD-like pathology. The macaque monkey thus offers a unique opportunity to study preclinical brain
changes in aging and LoAD, in a species with a brain that is structurally and functionally very similar to that of
humans. It has long been known that in humans during the preclinical phase of LoAD, amyloid and tau
pathology show characteristic sites of origin and (particularly for tau) patterns of spread; the mechanisms
behind these spatial features of the disease are not yet known. In order to understand the spatial
neurochemistry of the aging primate brain, we will study peri- and post-MT female macaques, and age-
matched male controls, delivering within-subject spatial atlases of metabolite levels (spatial metabolome),
protein expression (spatial proteome), and extant pathology for the cortex and cerebellum. The metabolome
and proteome will be obtained from the same samples, allowing trans-omic integration to understand spatial
patterns of biochemical pathway activity across the brain. The histopathological data will come from the
opposite hemisphere of the same individual. We will use spatial principal components analysis and a novel
spatial adaptation of multiple correspondence analysis to identify individual biomarkers and combinations of
biomarkers that account for spatial position in the cortex, and to identify biomarkers and biomarker
combinations that are associated with observed (in an individual) and predicted (from the literature) spatial
patterns of pathology. These crucial data will yield unprecedented insights into early aging and the critical
prodromal phase of LoAD, offering possibility of identifying biochemical factors that confer risk or resilience
upon local brain circuits. Factors promoting resilience are opportunities for intervention, while risk factors hold
the possibility for early diagnosis and screening; both of these outcomes will be crucial if we are to understand
and effectively address the most prevalent form of this devastating brain disease."
10866589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While common, evolutionarily conserved themes of early neuronal patterning in the developing
embryo have emerged over the years, there are, as of now, no firmly proven, common organizational
themes for how neuron acquire and maintain their terminally differentiated state. We propose to
probe here existence of such a common organizational principle, by testing the hypothesis that each
neuron class of the nematode C. elegans is functionally specified by members of a specific family of
transcription factors, the homeodomain-type transcription factors. We test this hypothesis by using
rigorous genetic loss of function analysis, using mutant alleles of all 70 conserved homeobox genes
and using a multicolor bar coding scheme, through which we visualize the differentiated state of all
neurons throughout the nervous system. The finding that homeodomain transcription factors control
the identity of all neurons in a simple nervous system would have wide-ranging implications for our
understanding of evolution of the nervous system and may provide explicit directions for how to
classify and then functionally study neuron classes in mammalian nervous systems."

10866446,"CANCER RESEARCH CAREER ENHANCEMENT AND RELATED ACTIVITIES: PROJECT SUMMARY
Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) has a strong research training environment and a long-standing record of trainee
success. Rooted in the robust educational infrastructure of Washington University, SCC enhances training and
education initiatives available to cancer researchers and efforts to develop a more diverse cancer research
workforce. The SCC Cancer Research Career Enhancement (CRCE) will build upon these current efforts to:
1. Provide new cancer education opportunities at SCC that fill specific existing training gaps by funding
 new specific cancer research programs, supplementing existing programs to enable more SCC member
 participants, supporting travel to select scientific meetings, and sponsoring seminars and workshops.
2. Coordinate existing research education and training activities at Washington University by sharing and
 promoting didactic courses and other training opportunities across the spectrum from undergraduate to junior
 faculty. We also share lessons learned from the Cancer Biology Training Consortium (CaBTraC) meetings
 and the eight F, eight K, four T32, two K99/R00, and one K12 Calabresi award from the NCI to help identify
 additional training grant opportunities and slots for eligible candidates.
3. Ensure effective training opportunities for underrepresented minorities (URMs) by funding the
 Community Research Fellows Training program, requiring inclusion and diversity training for faculty and staff,
 expanding URM recruitment for cancer research training, and enhancing URM retention efforts.
4. Develop new initiatives to enhance education and training opportunities by expanding existing SCC
 CRCE opportunities to better support the cancer research workforce and improve programming through
 structured evaluation and filling of existing training gaps. New efforts will include establishment of a Cancer
 Biology PhD program, additional grant writing support, hosting team science symposia, as well as expansion
 of cancer biology courses, workshops, and clinical research programs across other training programs. We
 will also develop workshops and provide mentoring for continued development of faculty, as well as for
 community scientists and physicians in emerging areas of cancer research.
We believe the current and future SCC CRCE programming will transform the future cancer research workforce.
The CRCE will do this by providing the training, education, and mentorship needed to successfully advance
trainees to independence. We will build upon successful existing programs and streamline efforts to train cancer
researchers throughout all specialties of the SCC. We will target some of the key needs of trainees, developing
focused mentorship, supportive research communities, tailored career guidance, and practical understanding of
available funding sources and grant submissions. With this foundation of support in place, we believe our
investigators will transition to independence more quickly, have the ability to focus on their patients and research,
and will result in making significant contributions to cancer research and patient outcomes."

10866451,"GENOME ENGINEERING AND iPSC CENTER (GEiC) SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
(iPSC: induced pluripotent stem cells)
The past five years witnessed the extraordinary development of CRISPR technology for genome manipulation.
The Genome Engineering and iPSC Center (GEiC) shared resource (SR) grows as the technology matures. At
last renewal, the GEiC was a new SR with five FTEs at a fairly early stage of establishing CRISPR-involving
workflows. Today we have 14.5 FTEs with a wide range of service offerings to meet the various needs and levels
of Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) members on cell (both cancer and iPS cells) and animal models. In the past
five years, the GEiC has completed over 500 engineering projects in various cancer cell lines and another 200
in iPSC and hESCs, designed and validated reagents for over 350 mouse models, validated 3500 gRNAs,
banked over 400 patient samples, and reprogrammed over 110 lines of patient-derived iPSCs.
 New services launched include 1) banking and reprogramming from whole blood, including clotted blood,
allowing great flexibility for patient sample submission, 2) differentiation of iPSCs into various tissue types, neural
stem cells, peripheral neuronal cells, hematopoietic stem cells, CD34+ cells, and macrophages, 3) library
construction for CRISPR screens and data analysis, 4) reagents for CRISPR-mediated gene activation and
inactivation and the use of base editor for introducing SNPs without cleaving the chromosomes, 5) next
generation sequencing-based short tandem repeat (STR) profiling for cell line authentication. Additionally, we
made significant process improvement in cell and animal model creation, such as optimized single cell cloning
efficiency during gene editing of iPSCs, increased efficiency and consistency of SNP introduction by using
CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex with end protected single stranded oligo DNA donors, and electroporation
of single-cell mouse embryos instead of microinjection, which allows us to achieve over 95% success rate on
obtaining the challenging conditional alleles (floxing) in mice.
 In the next project period, we will build on our success and strive to make disease modeling more relevant
and accessible to SCC members. We will expand the tissue types that can be differentiated from iPSCs and
establish protocols for simultaneous reprogramming and editing of iPSCs for speedier disease/corrected
isogenic pair creation and for reversible immortalization to proliferate primary cell types without losing their
physiological characteristics. We are also working on establishing a repository for healthy iPSC controls of
various ethnic backgrounds and further improving genome engineering efficiency in cells and embryos through
automation and process improvement. In the meantime, we will keep up with advancement in the fields of
genome engineering and iPSCs and ensure SCC members are served with the most up-to-date technologies."
10866454,"GENOME TECHNOLOGY ACCESS CENTER (GTAC) SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer genomics is widely studied and integral to the understanding, treatment and prevention of the disease.
The Genome Technology Access Center (GTAC), a shared resource within the McDonnell Genome Institute
(MGI), is one of the largest genomic centers in the nation and provides full access to its considerable assays,
tools, technology, and expertise to Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) members to enable advances in the fight
against cancer. The common infrastructure of GTAC occupies 27,000 sq ft. of space and is staffed by
approximately 75 scientists and technicians that support both service functions and program project research.
Within this space, GTAC operates both research specific and CAP/CLIA-certified clinical genomics operations.
 As GTAC is a SCC-supported facility, the close working relationship between GTAC faculty and staff and
cancer researchers streamlines the design, execution, and interpretation of all applied genomic assays.
Furthermore, the dual nature as both a research and CAP/CLIA-certified clinical genomics service provider offers
investigators a complete translational path for their research efforts. The GTAC provides next-generation
sequencing (NGS), microarray analyses, high-throughput PCR and a number of other specialized services. NGS
microarrays and PCR are also available within the CAP/CLIA-certified laboratories.
 The combination of scale, availability, and expertise in the application of genomic technologies has enabled
a great deal of impactful research. During the project period, the GTAC (~500) and MGI (~1400) have enabled
a combined 1,900 publications as reference/acknowledgment, co-authors, or authors with a substantial
percentage dedicated to oncology research. Within this substantial body of research, key advances include the
development of a laboratory and bioinformatic workflow to support neo-epitope selection in vaccine trials, the
development of new clinical assays, including the AML exome and Myeloseq, and the invention of novel
computational platforms such as COMPBIO."
10866456,"IMMUNOMONITORING LABORATORY (IML) SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Immunomonitoring Laboratory (IML) is a shared resource (SR) facility within the Bursky Center for Human
Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs established in 2013. The IML provides the structure, instrumentation,
and expertise to monitor the impact of specific immunotherapies on patient immunologic profiles, interrogate
mechanisms and pathways related to treatment protocols, and advance the conceptual basis for targeted
treatment strategies. In addition, the IML monitors developing immune responses to new therapies in animal
models of cancer treatment to elucidate novel therapeutic strategies or develop unique processes to evaluate
treatment outcomes in translational studies and new clinical trials. The IML is composed of four integrated groups
that include cytometry (conventional flow cytometry analyses, mass cytometry [CyTOF2], and imaging mass
cytometry), immune monitoring (multiplex analysis and functional assays), custom tetramer development
(currently with an inventory of over 50 HLA alleles), and tissue processing related to IML projects. The IML has
recently brought on board two imaging technologies: a Hyperion CyTOF capable of detecting > 40 distinct metal-
labeled biomarkers from tissue sections and a CODEX system that can visualize >40 unique DNA barcoded
biomarkers from frozen or FFPE sections using light microscopy. These two state-of-the-art technologies will
allow investigators to visualize the spatial orientation of interacting immune, stromal, and tumor components and
allow scientists to see the interaction between cells and understand the molecular and cellular basis of complex
diseases that arise as these interactions become abnormal.
 In the current project period, the IML has grown the number of laboratories serviced by 3-fold and more than
doubled the number of Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) users, along with supporting a number of ongoing clinical
trials. The IML continues to acquire new technologies as specialized tools become available to meet the needs
of our Washington University (WU), SCC, and Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) clinicians and scientists. In addition
to our new Hyperion and CODEX technologies, the IML is currently developing MHC class II tetramers that will
be available in the coming months to track and quantitate antigen specific CD4 T cells in response to
immunotherapy. In addition, the IML is actively working with other institutions to harmonize validation assays for
tetramer staining of patient samples. The IML works to customize assays for maximal data recovery from rare
samples, has the flexibility to develop new protocols, and has been responsive to calls for the newest
technologies to support our clinicians and scientists."

10866459,"PROTEOMICS SHARED RESOURCE (PSR): PROJECT SUMMARY
The Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) Proteomics Share Resource (PSR) has been a major contributor to the
emerging field of proteogenomics with a track record of high impact publications and external funding. The PSR
is poised to continue as leaders in the field in the next five years, using reproducible and repeatable deep-scale
proteomics (≥ 10,000 genes) and phosphoproteomics (≥ 37,000 sites) and the harmonized protocol that was co-
developed with the National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Studies
are underway with comprehensively characterized Acute Myeloid Leukemia and pre/post treatment ovarian
cancer cohorts (Aim 1). In the current project period, PSR has developed high-precision assays for absolute
quantification (copies/cell) of 361 of the 526 protein kinases in the human kinome using CPTAC guidelines for
validation toward FDA approval and clinical utility. The PSR proposes to have complete coverage of the human
kinome by 2023 and to continue applying and developing cancer-type specific panels for PDX and human drug
trials (Aim 2). Proteomics is on the cusp of next generation instrumentation that will lead to quantification of all
expressed proteins and generate wider coverage of post-translational modifications. Using these new platforms,
and in collaboration with the recently-established Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Mass
Spectrometry Center, the PSR will develop new services for SCC members and increase the value and utility of
proteogenomic analysis in support of SCC research programs (Aim 3). Future directions for the next project
period include an emphasis on expanding services and enhancing cross-core interface to improve user

10866462,"SMALL ANIMAL CANCER IMAGING (SACI) SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
With the revolution in molecular biology, transgenic animal models – in particular mice – have become an
indispensable part of the cancer research armamentarium. The Siteman Cancer Center’s (SCC) Small Animal
Cancer Imaging (SACI) Shared Resource (SR) (initially established under the auspices of the NCI’s Small Animal
Imaging Resource Program) addresses the need for nondestructive imaging and analysis of small animal
laboratory models of cancer. It provides state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure for magnetic resonance
imaging, positron emission tomography, X-ray computed tomography, single-photon emission computed
tomography, and optical (including Cerenkov) imaging of mice, rats, and other small laboratory animals that
serve as models of cancer.
 SACI combines instrumental and intellectual capabilities found at few other institutions and serves a broad
community of cancer scientists who have a pressing need for quantitative image analysis of small animal
model systems. The principal functions of SACI are to provide SCC members: i) access to, and maintenance
of, small animal magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, and optical imaging scanners for cancer research; ii)
technology expertise and consultation in study design, protocol development, and data analysis/interpretation.
In addition to supporting cancer research applications of small animal imaging, SACI also provides research
and development at the frontier of imaging technology in an effort to make the most powerful new imaging
strategies available to its community of users. The SR is organized around three modality-specific imaging
components: (i) nuclear medicine, (ii) magnetic resonance, and (iii) optical. An overarching goal is translation to
the clinic of imaging protocols and therapeutic agents developed and validated with small animal models. Thus,
SACI directly supports the mission of the SCC by supporting basic discovery cancer research and cancer
imaging protocols with translational potential."
10848981,"The Resource for Molecular Imaging Agents in Precision Medicine is a transdisciplinary consortium of
facilities and expertise centered at Johns Hopkins University. Participants are the Russell H. Morgan Department
of Radiology and Radiological Science, the F. M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, the
Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, with key
industrial collaborators in biomedical imaging and pharmaceuticals to ensure widespread dissemination. Our
work will synthesize, develop, and deploy precision imaging tools and theranostic agents for early detection,
interception, and cure. The long-term objective of the NCBIB is to promote the translation and dissemination of
new molecular imaging and theranostic agents and their attendant best practices along the spectrum of cancer,
inflammation and immunity. Our proposed work capitalizes on advances made in the past five years in artificial
intelligence (AI), new and more sensitive translational imaging devices, nanotechnology, gene manipulation, and
new techniques to produce specific molecular affinity agents and will create a scientific ecosystem that can
transform the healthcare landscape. Collaborative academic centers such as ours, while steeped in the culture
of fundamental discovery, are beginning to pivot toward the development of new work products – working
backwards from unmet needs – in the context of increasing academic-industrial partnerships and
entrepreneurship. Working closely with our partners, we will leverage these advances in scientific and academic
cultural thinking, and provide new materials to our collaborating and service partners, some of whom have
worldwide reach, to address pressing and unsolved medical challenges. During the first funding period we
consolidated our ability to work together seamlessly as a NCBIB; in this renewal, we have added collaboration
with a new local NCBIB that complements our work by providing biological reagents relevant to
immunoengineering, offering AI capability, founding one company dedicated to advancing use of AI in molecular
imaging and another company for commercialization of imaging and theranostic agents, received FDA approval
for an imaging agent (analogs of which are already in use in the NCBIB), and providing precursors, other
reagents and IND cross-references to multiple institutions. Our goals for the renewal period are, across four
TR&Ds, to develop: new reagents to detect and promote an immune reactive tumor microenvironment (TR&D1);
an integrated nanoplatform to manage a variety of cancers (TR&D2); translational imaging agents, theranostics,
and software for managing inflammation and/or cancer in the periphery or central nervous system (TR&D3); and
a method to use extracellular vesicles as a nanotheranostic platform in neuroinflammation (TR&D4). Together
with the Collaborating and Service Projects (CPs and SPs) we will generate next-generation precision platforms,
tools, and techniques for tackling problems at the forefront of biomedical research with a focus on those that will
lead to near-term translation, as we have done previously."

responsible for organizing oversight, namely, meetings of the Internal and External Scientific Advisory
Committees. In collaboration with staff in the Training and Dissemination Core It will be the focal point for
organization of scientific meetings and retreats related to the TR&Ds in a continual effort to maintain their
cohesion and sense of purpose.
The PI of this Core, Dr. Pomper, is experienced in the synthesis and development of molecular imaging agents
for a variety of modalities and is conversant in both basic research and clinical medicine, particularly radiology
and nuclear medicine. He has substantial experience in running NIH-funded programs in parallel and in
collaboration with investigators external to Johns Hopkins. Dr. Pomper will be responsible for routine operation
of this Core in close collaboration with the PIs of the four TR&Ds, which will form an Executive Committee of the
BTRC. The PIs of the TR&Ds work in close proximity on the Broadway Campus of Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions, facilitating face-to-face meetings, which will occur formally on a quarterly basis. As these PIs are
already collaborating on other projects, informal meetings will occur much more frequently if not on a daily basis.
The Executive Committee will turn to the IAC and EAC for further input on an annual basis, each, offset by a six
month interval. The IAC and EAC will be comprised of local and extramural experts, respectively, in the synthesis,
characterization, validation and implementation of molecular imaging agents for a variety of modalities. As the
biological theme of the NCBIB is relationships between cancer, inflammation and immunity, we will have at
least one IAC and one EAC member dedicated to immunology at all times. The EAC has one member who
serves as a patient advocate. Minutes of the EAC meetings will be provided in annual progress reports to NIBIB.
There are many other informal aspects of oversight at Johns Hopkins with which the Administrative Core will
interface, including the Radioactive Drug Research Committee, the Animal Care and Use Committee, the
Clinical Research Office of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Institutional Review
Board. The Administrative Core will support the TR&Ds in development and maintenance of relevant animal
and human protocols, where appropriate.
Financial aspects of the NCBIB will be closely monitored through the Administrative Core. There is strong
institutional support, including financial support, for the NCBIB as described in the letters from the Director of
Radiology and the CEO of D&D Pharmatech."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with high heterogeneity and few available
treatment options. SCLC cells are of highly plastic enabling them to adapt and change characteristics in
response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This project aims to interrogate therapeutic responses that
targeting replication stress, hallmark of SCLC. Specifically, we will establish novel SCLC animal models, with
co-mutations that identified in the clinic responsible for the development, progression, or drug resistance. To
do that, we will use establish SCLC lines with P53 and RB1 mutation, two most common mutations found in
SCLC that serve as intrinsic factor responsible for replication stress, and introduce co-mutations including
MYC, KMT2D, and/or the STK11/PTEN etc. We hypothesized that c-MYC, YAP1, PTEN, STK11, KMT2D,
p130 dysregulation may contribute to SCLC heterogeneity, replication stress, and will affect tumor growth. We
will evaluate in these models, the impact of co-mutations toward the treatment of CDK2 and/or PARP
inhibitors. In addition, we will further delineate, the cancer cell intrinsic versus extrinsic effect upon drug
treatment using state-of-art immune competent SCLC models. Finally, we will further explore the possibility of
combinational treatment of targeted drugs with immunotherapy drugs in SCLC models with different co-
mutations. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To investigate
the impact of the co-mutations on SCLC plasticity and transcriptional subtypes of SCLC; (2) To evaluate the
impact of co-mutations on the responses to CDK2 and PARP inhibition responses in SCLC; and (3) To
elucidate the impact of co-mutations on the SCLC tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) and sensitivity to
immunotherapeutic combinations. Project 4 is integrated cohesively with Projects 1, 2 and 3, and Cores A, B
and C, permitting innovative and synergistic approaches and quick breakthroughs in moving basic science
discoveries to translational therapeutic strategies. IMPACT: By investigating a new scientific direction in this
P01 through pioneering work on the co-genetic alterations and pre-clinical studies, we will develop new
mechanistic insights into biological mechanisms of SCLC replication stress that can be translated into clinically
relevant therapies for patients."
10848850,"The Advanced Microscopy and Computational Approaches Core (Core C) will provide advanced
imaging and computational approaches to support this Program Project in elucidating the
molecular mechanisms of DNA replication stress that drive therapeutic response and resistance

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating diagnosis and there is a critical need to understand the fundamental
molecular pathogenesis of AD to design effective therapies. In addition to the well-known AD pathologies,
perturbed glucose metabolism is also a clinical feature of AD. Glycogen and N-linked glycans are two critically
important but understudied facets of glucose metabolism. Both glycogen and N-linked glycans are complex
carbohydrates that play vital roles in brain physiology such as cognition, memory formation, and life span.
Despite the importance of these pathways in normal brain function, whether complex carbohydrate metabolism
are perturbed during AD disease progression remains a critical knowledge gap in neurobiology. In exciting
preliminary data, we discovered profound glycogen accumulation and protein hyperglycosylation in the
prefrontal cortex of both mouse models of AD and human AD specimens. Further, we found a positive
correlation between increased glycogen and Braak staging in an analysis of a 97-patient cohort. Finally, oral
glucosamine supplement, a precursor to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, building block of N-linked
glycans further exacerbated hyperglycosylation and led to poorer cognitive performance in the 5xFAD mouse
model of AD. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that aberrant complex carbohydrate
metabolism are pathogenic processes during AD disease progression. The major objective of this study is to
systematically resolve cellular and extracellular origins of perturbed complex carbohydrate metabolism using
state-of-the-art single cell technologies. We will achieve this through synergistic integration of multi-parameter
single-cell mass spectrometry imaging methodologies. First, we will define complex carbohydrates with clinical
course and disease progression in patient samples (Aim 1). Then, we will interrogate cellular and extra-cellular
architecture in normal and AD patient samples (Aim 2). Finally, we will apply multimodal integration to track
cellular and extracellular origins of complex carbohydrate perturbation in AD (Aim 3). This study will provide
critical new information regarding ideal cell-, region- and temporally-specific opportunities for therapeutic
modulation of AD. Collectively, we believe the resultant findings from this proposal will be highly salient for
multiple related fields of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders."

Regulation of the transsulfuration pathway is key to maintaining healthy levels of the sulfur metabolites,
homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Dysfunction of the first enzyme in this pathway, cystathionine β-
synthase (CBS) results in homocystinuria and affects four major organ systems. CBS catalyzes the condensation
of serine and homocysteine, generating cystathionine and water. Alternatively, it can catalyze the condensation
of cysteine and homocysteine, generating cystathionine and H2S. CBS is a modular protein in which the central
catalytic domain is flanked by an N-terminal heme domain and a C-terminal S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)
domain, both of which are regulatory. Long range communication is involved in allosteric regulation of CBS with
the distance between the heme and active site being ~20 Å and between the heme and AdoMet sites, being ~50
Å. A subset of patient mutations map to the linker region between the catalytic and C-terminal domains, and is
predicted to perturb allosteric regulation by AdoMet and in turn, AdoMet-responsive regulation of the heme
domain. I hypothesize that the linker mutations disfavor the conformational transition from the basal to the
activated state that is triggered by AdoMet. I will test my hypothesis by addressing the following aims. (i) I will
characterize the steady-state kinetic parameters of the pathogenic linker mutations (G347S, K384E/N, and M39I)
in the canonical and H2S-producing reactions catalyzed by CBS and the binding constant for AdoMet. I will
assess the impact of the linker mutations on the flux of sulfur through the transsulfuration pathway. (ii) I will
investigate the effects of the linker mutations on the heme redox environment by determining the reduction
potential of the bound heme. The kinetic and binding constants of CO and NO• binding to ferrous heme in the
presence and absence of AdoMet will be determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. (iii) I will crystallize the
linker mutants and determine the structure of full-length CBS. Successful completion of these studies will
broaden our understanding of how CBS is regulated and deepen insights into the mechanism of long-range
communication between distal regulatory domains."
10866571,"Project Summary/Abstract
Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a high mortality, largely driven by the early withdrawal of life-sustaining
therapies during hospitalization. This critical decision is influenced by whether patients remain unresponsive
after TBI. Current models use age, basic neurological assessment, and radiological findings as predictors of
recovery. Bedside neurological examinations are examiner dependent, and often misclassify patients as
unresponsive despite preserved awareness. Current approaches to predicting recovery of consciousness and
functional recovery lack accuracy. Brain activation using a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging
or electroencephalogram (EEG) measure preserved awareness in clinically unresponsive patients, known as
covert consciousness. Covert consciousness indicates a higher chance of recovery after acute brain injury. Most
research studies examining covert consciousness have not been performed in the acute, intensive care setting
(ICU) when clinicians discuss the patients’ goals of care with families. Music and spoken words are auditory
stimuli to which unresponsive brain-injured patients may easily attend. Our preliminary data provide the scientific
premise and the feasibility of using brain activation to music and spoken words in the ICU as a biomarker to
detect covert consciousness after TBI. We hypothesize that preserved brain activation to music and spoken
words may indicate preserved basic cognitive functions and subsequently predict recovery after TBI. In this
study, we propose using a personalized prognostication approach shortly after severe brain injury using our
assessment battery MUSICA (MUsic and Speech Induced Cerebral Activation). Our assessment battery
MUSICA encompasses brain activation to [1] classical music; [2] words, phrases, and sentences; [3] congruent
and incongruent sentences. Using MUSICA, we aim to identify covert consciousness in unresponsive TBI
patients in the ICU (AIM 1). We will also determine if brain activation to MUSICA can be used to predict recovery
after TBI (AIM 2). A total of 80 unresponsive TBI patients will be recruited from a high-volume level 1 trauma
center during the ICU stay. We will test patients’ brain activation to MUSICA and compare their responses to
responses from 20 healthy subjects (AIM 1). We will assess global, functional, and cognitive outcomes at 1-, 3-
and 6-month follow-up to determine the predictive value of MUSICA (AIM 2). Results from this study will change
the current prognostication paradigms in clinical practice after severe TBI using an electrophysiologic signature
to music and spoken words."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60--70% of cases, followed in prevalence by Lewy body dementia (LBD), responsible for 17% of the cases. AD and related dementias are thought to be caused by the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain. In AD, protein aggregates mostly appear in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of amyloid-beta (ABeta) and hyperphosporylated Tau, respectively. In LBD the main component of the aggregates is the alpha-synuclein (aSyn) protein. However, there is a substantial overlap of pathological abnormalities, leading to the relatively frequent appearance of mixed pathologies, characterized by the presence of multiple protein aggregates in the same brain. Indeed, up to 30-40% of AD patients display aSyn Lewy bodies in their brains. Although, much investigation has been devoted to understand the role of A~ and Tau aggregates in AD, little research has been done to evaluate the contribution of aSyn in AD and related dementias. Recently, we implemented and developed a highly sensitive and specific assay (termed aSyn-PMCA) to faithfully amplify aSyn seeds present in brain and biological fluids of patients affected by various synucleinopathies, including LBD. Using this technology we were able to amplify seeding competent aSyn aggregates from patients' samples and identify conformational strains associated to different diseases. The major goal of this project is to take advantage of the reliability of the aSyn-PMCA technology to massively amplify aSyn polymorphic variants in order to produce and distribute to the scientific community well-characterized aSyn aggregates amplified from patient's samples. Materials will be characterized for their size, biochemical, biophysical, structural and biological properties using various in vitro, cellular and animal models. Specific aims include: (1) Production of aSyn aggregates by aSyn-PMCA amplification from brain and CSF of patients affected by AD and LBD (as well as other synucleinopathies) and comprehensive analysis of the size, biochemical and biophysical properties of these aggregates; (2) Study the structural basis differentiating different synucleinopathies, in particular we propose to elucidate the structural fold at atomic resolution for aSyn aggregates implicated in different diseases; (3) Study the biological properties of aSyn aggregates derived from AD, LBD and other synucleinopathies using in vitro and in vivo models. (4) Produce and distribute to the scientific community well-characterized and biologically relevant aSyn aggregates. The resources generated in this project will be made fully available to researchers in order to standardize reagents and ensure the biological relevance of the findings."

Pancreatic cancer is the most common form of pancreatic cancer and is currently incurable. Unraveling essential
cellular reprograming required for PDAC development and progression, and further identifying new drug targets
to treat the disease is crucial to impact the outcomes for patients with this devastating disease. In this application,
we propose to study the function of transmembrane protein in regulating major nutrient supply routes by which
cells scavenge “food” to fuel their growth. It stands to reason that targeting such transmembrane protein will
block the nutrient supply of pancreatic cancer cells and result in cell death. Building on our strong expertise in
study transmembrane proteins in pancreatic cancer cell survival and growth, the overarching objective of this
proposed research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of transmembrane protein in mediating
the nutrient supply routes and evaluate the potential of such transmembrane protein as a targeting node for
pancreatic cancer treatment. The major advantage of studying transmembrane proteins is their accessibility by
therapeutic agents, such as antibodies. To achieve the translational potential of our study, we will further develop
and characterize novel therapeutic agents direct target such membrane proteins in various new preclinical models
of pancreatic cancer. Upon completion of the proposed research, we will have more complete knowledge of the
extent to which pancreatic cancer is reliant upon transmembrane protein for nutrient salvage, how the nutrient
supply machinery is regulated by transmembrane protein on the surface in pancreatic cancer, and whether
targeting such membrane protein-mediated metabolic reprogramming may be potent to eradicate pancreatic
cancer cells. Answering these questions will significantly impact our ability to determine whether a rational
approach to therapeutically intervene in nutrient supply routes in pancreatic cancer exists. Furthermore, our
research is significant because it may have broad implications for other types of human cancers depending similar
nutrient supply mechanisms. In the short term, findings from this project will advance our understanding of the
nutrient supply routes required to sustain pancreatic cancer cells and provide strong preclinical evidence for
targeting the nutrient supply routes as therapeutic strategy in treating pancreatic cancer. In the long term, findings
of our research are expected to guide the development of clinical trials for achieving clinical benefits for patients
with pancreatic cancer. We believe that the results of our studies will have a positive impact on the general public
in the United States, benefiting individuals affected by pancreatic cancer and potentially leading to improved
outcomes and enhanced quality of life."
10863191,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive disease subtype that conveys poor patient
outcomes. While targeted therapies exist and are highly effective for other breast cancer subtypes, there is a
paucity of targets/targeted agents for this disease, making cytotoxic chemotherapy the standard of care.
Identifying approaches that could sensitize TNBC to targeted therapies that are effective in other breast cancer
subtypes or in small populations of TNBC, should provide a accelerated approach for expanding the inventory
of treatments for this disease. This proposal focuses on leveraging inhibitors of NEK2, a mitotic kinase that is
overexpressed in TNBC, to potentiate the efficacy of two FDA-approved drug classes: CDK4/6 inhibitors and
PARP inhibitors. Unlike other breast cancers, TNBC are generally resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast,
PARP inhibitors are effective in TNBC, but in the limited number of cancers that have mutations in the BRCA1
gene. The efficacy of both can be improved in various model systems by elevating chromosomal instability
(CIN) and decreasing EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). Notably, mitotic kinases, including NEK2,
can control both of these phenotypes, suggesting that they may be strong targets for improving CDK4/6 and
PARP inhibitor efficacy, but this has not yet been explored. Mitotic kinases were thought to be ideal cancer
drug targets because their disruption leads to mitotic delay and dysfunction, ultimately inducing CIN that results
in cell death or senescence. However, drugs targeting these enzymes have often failed in clinical trials due to
dose-limiting toxicities as a result of their essentiality in normal cells. Identifying and leveraging novel mitotic
kinases that are more selective for tumor versus normal cells should greatly improve the ability to sensitize
TNBC to CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors. NEK2 stands out as a potential target because it is overexpressed in
triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and is associated with worse disease outcomes. Therapeutically
targeting NEK2 can also potentiate the efficacy of taxanes, a standard-of-care drug for this disease, without
inducing toxicity in mice. Most importantly and unlike other mitotic kinases, the growth inhibition resulting from
blocking NEK2 is selective for TNBC and not normal cells. Together, these results suggest that targeting NEK2
may provide a novel approach for improving CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitor response in TNBC without increasing
toxicity. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand our preliminary data demonstrating proof-of-principle that NEK2
inhibitors can potentiate CDK4/6 inhibitor response in a murine xenograft model to assess the impact of NEK2
inhibition on the efficacy of these drugs using several in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC that reflect the
genomic heterogeneity of this disease. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if the ability of targeting NEK2 to
increase the efficacy of CDK4/6 and/or PARP inhibitors involves modulation of CIN, EMT, or new, as yet
undiscovered pathways. Together, these studies will provide the foundation for developing clinically useful
NEK2 inhibitors and pairing them with CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors to treat TNBC patients."

The benefit of MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy for melanoma has been limited to patients with BRAFV600 mutant
melanoma. Since the development of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) combination to suppress acquired resistance to type
I RAF inhibitor (RAFi), progress to further suppress resistance has stalled. Similarly, there has been little
progress in the development of MAPKi therapy for the other ~50% of patients with BRAFV600 wildtype melanoma,
due to contra-indication of type I RAFi and rapid resistance to MEKi monotherapy. Our overarching hypothesis
is that a comprehensive proteogenomic understanding of how the full-spectrum of melanoma subtypes evolves
MAPKi resistance will renew clinical interest in the development of MAPKi-based combinations. Recent studies,
including ours, support the notion that a wide-spectrum (BRAFV600MUT, NRASMUT, NF1-/-, triple WT) of melanoma
is highly addicted to the MAPK pathway. The lack of efficacy of single-agent MAPKi (e.g., MEKi) therapy belies
this exquisite pathway addiction because of an inability to control pharmacologically MAPK pathway reactivation.
Thus, effective preclinical strategies that directly tackle MAPK pathway reactivation as well as downstream or
parallel phenotypes of acquired resistance warrant clinical development. To anticipate clinical resistance to
MAPKi across melanoma subtypes, we will build a comprehensive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) bank of not
only MAPKi-naïve melanoma but also subclones with acquired MAPKi-resistance. We will combine sequencing
(whole-genome, exome, transcriptome) and mass spectrometry (proteome, phosphoproteome), coupled with
temporal analysis of transcriptomes at the single-cell level and chromatin accessibility, to provide a multi-omic
landscape of therapeutic resistance evolution in a highly clinically relevant platform (Melanoma Resistance
Evolution Atlas or MREA) to functionalize therapeutic vulnerabilities. We will test our hypothesis with the following
Specific Aims: (1) Discover the proteogenomic landscape of melanoma with acquired MAPKi-resistance, (2)
Evaluate combinatorial strategies targeting recurrent drivers of MAPKi-resistance, and (3) Create multi-omic data
integration tools to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities of acquired MAPKi-resistance. MREA version 1.0 (years 1-
2; 28 PDX models) will encompass BRAFV600MUT and NRASMUT melanoma, whereas MREA v2.0 (years 2-4;
additional 60 PDX models) will encompass the full spectrum of cutaneous melanoma subtypes. To nominate
resistance-specific alterations (RSAs) for functional validation and in vivo preclinical trials, we prioritize RSAs
based on critical criteria: high recurrence, multi-omic convergence, druggability/human safety data, orthogonal
support from the literature and additional public and custom databases, and potential of RSA-targeting to yield
synergy with immunotherapy."
10866430,"Chronic nonspecific neck pain (CNNP), which is not due to organic pathology, is responsible for significant
direct health care costs, health care provider visits, and work-related productivity loss. Though one of the top
five chronic pain conditions in terms of prevalence and years lost to disability, to date, neck pain has received
only a small fraction of the research funding given to low back pain. Consequently, there is a limited evidence
base to guide management. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are widely used to
manage CNNP, but effect sizes are, at best, low to moderate, and no one therapy stands out as superior.
 CNNP is best understood from a biopsychosocial framework that recognizes etiology, severity, and
outcomes as a complex and interrelated array of biological, psychological and social factors and points to the
promise of complementary and integrative health approaches for successful disease management and
treatment. Accordingly, this application explores the feasibility of pragmatically delivering and clinically
evaluating the combined impact of two widely available approaches for managing CNNP––chiropractic care
and Tai Chi (TC). These specific modalities were chosen because both individually show promise in managing
CNNP, and based on their complementary approaches, strengths, and therapeutic components, there is a
strong likelihood of additive or synergist effects when the two are delivered in a coordinated manner.
 Our long-term goal is to conduct a multi-site fully powered trial evaluating the effectiveness of chiropractic
care combined with TC training to reduce pain and disability in adults with CNNP. As a first step, we propose to
conduct a three-arm, mixed-methods pilot study. We will recruit and randomize (1:1:1) 48 adults with CNNP to
receive: 1) 10 chiropractic treatments (delivered over 16 weeks) with concurrent TC training (16 weeks of in-
person group training) plus enhanced usual care (EUC; usual care (UC) with CNNP educational materials); 2)
chiropractic care plus EUC; or 3) EUC alone. Individuals will be followed for 8 weeks after the end of their
intervention period to assess longer-term outcomes. Aim 1 will evaluate our ability to recruit a network of
chiropractors and Tai Chi instructors, refine our interventions, and assess fidelity of intervention protocols. Aim
2 will assess the feasibility of recruiting, retaining and monitoring the safety of adults with CNNP into our trial.
Aim 3 will refine data collection procedures and evaluate outcomes for future trials.
 Given the widespread availability of chiropractic and TC nationally, if proven effective, this multimodal
approach for treating CNNP could represent a practical strategy with immediate public health impact. This
application aligns with NCCIH’s 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, including advancing research on the whole person
and investigating non-pharmacological pain management strategies that can improve first-line chronic pain
management."

American Indians (AI) in Minnesota have 5-6x the opioid overdose death rate of other groups, and this figure
continues to rise. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the standard of care for opioid use disorder (OUD)
treatment, but implementation and uptake has been slow nationally, especially for AI communities. Thus, there
is an urgent need to understand multi-level barriers and facilitators of OUD treatment, including how AI cultural
knowledge and practices can be interwoven within OUD treatment and how engagement can be improved
along all points of the OUD “Cascade of Care” (CoC). This project will involve a partnership between the
University of Minnesota Medical School, Duluth Campus, and a rural Minnesota tribal Nation. The overall
objective of this application is to characterize the OUD CoC in a reservation-based, tribal treatment context.
Our central hypothesis is that AIs benefit from MAT programs and OUD treatment, but there are multi-level
barriers and facilitators that affect implementation of the CoC, some unique to tribal communities. The rationale
for this project is that careful assessment of factors influencing the OUD CoC with AIs will optimize treatment
implementation and ultimately reduce opioid-related heath inequities. The preparatory R61 aims include (1)
characterizing the OUD CoC in a tribal context and delineating its components and transition points using
community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods and data from existing sources; (2) identifying
barriers and facilitators to engagement with the OUD CoC at key transition points via interviews with clinical
stakeholders and individuals with OUD and their families, and (3) preparing and confirming feasibility of
observational longitudinal data collection (R33 Aim 1) by developing and piloting study protocols and
measures. The R33 aims include: (1) prospectively examining barriers and facilitators to treatment
engagement and clinical outcomes defined within the CoC among 200 AIs with OUD after initial MAT clinic
intake assessment, and (2) identifying a set of culturally-centered, evidence-based implementation strategies
to address barriers and optimize treatment engagement across the CoC. The proposed project will leverage
and complement the tribe’s SAMHSA Tribal Opioid Response and MAT Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction
funding. It is innovative because it considers barriers and facilitators across the entire OUD CoC in a tribal
context, and is one of the first studies to apply a dissemination and implementation lens to opioid research with
AI communities. The expected outcomes of the research include a culturally-centered description of the OUD
Cascade of Care with identified implementation strategies to address barriers to engagement. Findings would
provide generalizable scientific knowledge to optimize OUD services to reduce opioid-related health inequities
for American Indians."

Although “implementation intentions”-based tools have been found to enhance colorectal cancer (CRC)
screening uptake, prior studies have not tested to scale their implementation into routine primary care delivery
settings serving hard-to-reach populations such as those with limited English proficiency. Our research group,
led by Prof. KA Greiner, has developed and tested an “I2” CRC decision-making tool via multiple NCI-funded
studies. It addresses the “when,” “where” and “how” details of screening via stool sample tests or colonoscopy.
In this study, we will conduct a parallel cluster-randomized trial in 20 clinics participating in the American
Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network, serving communities in which at least 25% of the
patient population's preferred language is Spanish. Specific aims for the project will be: (Aim 1) To compare
CRC screening outcomes at 6 months between two implementation approaches for our “I2 tool” : (1)
implementation through a Normalization Process Theory-guided Participatory Learning in Action (NPT-PLA
arm) process versus (2) implementation with a usual quality improvement process (control arm) in primary
care practices using a parallel cluster randomized trial; and (Aim 2) to evaluate the facilitators and barriers of
the implementation approach in each study arm using the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) framework.
Multi-disciplinary clinic `implementation teams' that include clinic staff and patients whose preferred language is
Spanish will meet monthly during the first 6 months of clinic participation and aim to integrate the I2 tool into
routine primary care delivery, using the NPT-PLA intervention or control approach. The I2 tool will be delivered
via an on-line RedCap® survey or (if patients prefer) by paper form; and has been customized for use in
English and Spanish. We will enroll all patients in each clinic eligible for CRC screening (a minimum of 100 per
clinic). Primary (Aim 1) outcomes will be CRC screening orders placed (by clinic staff) and completion of CRC
screening (by patients) over 6 months of patient follow-up after initial exposure to the I2 tool. A secondary aim
will be to determine whether completion of the I2 screening tool varies between study arms. For Aim 2, in all
clinics at baseline and after 6 months of clinic participation we will administer a survey based on the NPT
constructs (the “NOMAD”) to assess implementation team members' comprehension of their role in the project,
the salience of our intervention approach, their buy-in, the feasibility of altering workflows, and the potential
sustainability of the intervention in their clinical setting. We will also conduct summative qualitative focus group
discussions in all clinics with the implementation team after 6 months of clinic participation, and at 12 months
with team leaders to assess maintenance. Key personnel include the Multiple-PIs (KA Greiner, J LeMaster, C
Hester), KUMC Biostatistician B Gajewski and an international NPT expert, A MacFarlane. The study will
provide important information on barriers and facilitators of embedding NPT-PLA interventions in “real-world”
primary care clinical settings to promote cancer screening successfully."
10858137,"Measles remains one of the most important causes of child mortality with recent increases in cases
exacerbated by lapses in immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measles virus (MeV) is a highly
infectious non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus. Studies of measles in children and a well-characterized
rhesus macaque model have shown that wild type (WT) MeV infection is initiated in the respiratory tract and
spreads to lymphoid tissue with profound short and long-term effects on the immune system. Measles induces
intense immune activation, increases susceptibility to other infections, decreases Ab to other pathogens, can
trigger autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and induces life-long immunity to MeV. Although infectious virus is
cleared during the rash-associated adaptive immune response, viral RNA persists in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphoid tissues for months with ongoing immune stimulation and continued
production of MeV-specific antibody-secreting cells, antibody maturation and multiple waves of functionally
distinct T cells. The live attenuated measles vaccine (LAMV) was developed by passage of WT MeV in chicken
cells, licensed in 1963 and has been remarkably successful in controlling measles. Safety and availability of
reverse genetics has led to development as a vaccine vector and oncolytic agent. However, there is little
knowledge of where LAMV replicates, mechanism(s) of attenuation or how the immune responses induced
differ from WT MeV for protective immunity or immunosuppression except to note that Ab titers are lower and
protection less durable. We have shown that a central difference between infection with LAMV and WT MeV is
replication in immune cells, that antiviral treatment accelerates RNA clearance and impairs antibody
production. We hypothesize that persistent viral RNA is required for stimulation of durable immunity to MeV
and that immune activation in response to infection affects pre-existing immunity. We will address these gaps
in knowledge of LAMV biology through the following specific aims: (1) Identify the viral determinants of
inefficient LAMV replication in immune cells through construction of recombinant LAMVs with WT sequences;
(2) Identify the in vivo sites of LAMV replication and dynamics of RNA clearance compared to WT MeV through
study of MeV replication in rhesus macaques; (3) Define the immune responses to infection with LAMV and
WT MeV and effects of antiviral therapy in rhesus macaques; and (4) Determine the mechanism(s) by which
WT MeV infection decreases Ab diversity in rhesus macaques and whether this occurs after infection with
LAMV."

Sixty years of observational studies have consistently demonstrated an association between respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and asthma, the two most common respiratory
diseases of infancy and childhood, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide.
However, we have demonstrated the problem with this approach, given confounding due to shared heredity.
To overcome this, we have demonstrated in both retrospective and prospective studies that RSV infection, not
only severe infection, during a susceptible age window increases the risk of asthma development, and that
delayed primary RSV infection until after infancy is associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing
childhood asthma. Our results along with human and experimental findings, provide the preliminary data to
support that there is an age-dependent causal relationship between infant RSV infection and asthma. Key
remaining unanswered questions include determining the critical susceptibility period/timing of RSV infection
during which infection results in increased childhood asthma, establishing causality between RSV infection and
asthma, and determining if new RSV prevention products impact long-term respiratory morbidity.
We hypothesize that there is an identifiable age-dependent window during which RSV infection results in an
enhanced risk of childhood asthma, and that prevention or delay in initial infection protects from asthma
development. To test the hypotheses, we will assemble a population of over 4 million infants who were born
and enrolled in a state Medicaid program and the Department of Defense Military Healthcare System from
2003-2028. We will address the questions using 1) an instrumental variable (IV) approach and 2) the “natural
experiment” of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time period which resulted in more than a year during which there
was almost no RSV circulation followed by an off-season summer RSV peak and an extremely early RSV
season. The IV approach, designed to address causal questions using observational data, is a novel statistical
method that has been successfully implemented in many health outcome studies. We will also address this
question by taking advantage of the soon-to-be available RSV protection product(s) during the 2023-2028 RSV
seasons to assess if they have an impact on long-term childhood respiratory morbidities including asthma.
Establishment of an age-dependent causal relationship between RSV and asthma will be of enormous public
health importance for asthma prevention, as there is currently no effective primary prevention strategy for
asthma. Further, results of this study will be important in understanding required duration of protection during
infancy to inform RSV prevention product recommendations. Lastly, demonstrating value added long-term
benefit of RSV prevention strategies will certainly enhance the cost-benefit for uptake of RSV prevention
products in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as individual acceptability and adherence to
recommendations for RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies."
10859408,"Cell engineering has provided the opportunity to tune cell function to address therapeutic needs and discover
novel biology. We recently performed a set of experimental CRISPR gene perturbation screens that indicated a
gene, ZNF865, which is only known through sequence analysis and does not have any in depth publications to
date, has significant effects on cell function. Our preliminary data indicate that ZNF865 regulates many genes
that modify the cell's overall activity regarding cell cycle, protein processing, senescence, and RNA transport in
multiple unrelated cell types. ZNF865 appears to regulate these functions in all human cell types, implying a
wide range of potential therapeutic applications and a need to understand the biology of this gene more broadly.
Our group has utilized advancements in CRISPR-based cell engineering to engineer cells to tightly control their
phenotype by modulating cell gene activation/repression in a highly targeted and multiplexed manner. Our
preliminary data demonstrates that we can engineer cells that show dramatic increases in chondrogenic tissue
deposition without growth factors after CRISPRa upregulation of ZNF865 in chondrogenic engineered cells.
Additionally, our preliminary data demonstrate that CRISPRi targeting of ZNF865 drives a senescent phenotype
in primary cells across multiple cell types. Finally, we are able to cause human degenerative IVD cells to escape
senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by upregulating ZNF865 with CRISPRa. Our
overall hypothesis is that ZNF865 acts as a transcription factor to regulate key processes in cell
activity/senescence that can be regulated by CRISPRi/CRISPRa to control cell activity levels, improve
cell therapeutic outcomes, and manipulate senescence. Aim 1: We will modulate ZNF865 with CRISPR
in the disc to regulate cell activity and senescence in the IVD. (Aim 1a). CRISPRi vectors downregulating
ZNF865 will be delivered to the healthy rat IVD to investigate its ability to induce disc degeneration through the
induction of senescence within the IVD, potentially developing a senescence-driven model of disc degeneration.
(Aim 1b). CRISPRa vectors upregulating ZNF865 will be delivered after induction of disc degeneration using the
rat annular puncture model to observe the ability for enhanced cell activity to protect and/or recover from disc
degeneration. (Aim 1c) We will investigate ZNF865s interactions with the genome using ChIP-seq, which can
be combined with rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME). Aim 2: We will
modulate ZNF865 upregulation in multiplex CRISPR-engineered chondrogenic cells to understand its
ability to boost cell therapy outcomes. (Aim 2a). ZNF865 will be modulated in engineered chondrogenic cells
and investigated in human-sized engineered IVDs (DAPS) to investigate their ability to boost the production and
maintenance of functional engineered human IVD tissue. (Aim 2b). DAPS with ZNF865-modified cells will be
challenged subcutaneously in the rat to investigate the ability of CRISPR-engineered cells to produce functional
tissue in vivo in human-sized DAPS."
10864030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common neurologic disease that can result in significant restriction in activity and
participation. MS is caused by intermittent inflammation causing demyelination and axonal damage. The
promotion of remyelination is a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome and prevent MS disability by
improving the conduction velocity of action potentials and providing neuroprotective insulation for the axon.
Effective remyelination will likely require a multimodal approach, including rehabilitative and pharmacologic
therapies, to stimulate remyelination along neural pathways. In animal models of MS, aerobic exercise can
promote remyelination alone or synergistically with pharmacotherapy. However, it is currently uncertain how to
measure remyelination in people with MS and this lack of a reproducible and reliable measure of myelin status
is a major obstacle to the development of remyelination therapies. Prior to the successful development of
large-scale multimodal clinical trials, there is a crucial need to 1) determine the optimal outcomes to assess the
extent of remyelination, and 2) demonstrate the feasibility and study design of a rehabilitative aerobic exercise
intervention.
The central hypotheses of this study are that 1) spinal cord demyelination in MS, as measured by prolongation
of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) latency, is associated with reduced function, activity and
participation in people with MS, and 2) aerobic stationary cycling is a safe and feasible rehabilitative
intervention in people with MS to improve mobility. Besides addressing these hypotheses, we will gather
preliminary data on the effects of aerobic exercise on SSEP latencies, walking speed, and other measures of
activity and participation. SSEPs are an ideal objective measure as they are inexpensive, reproducible,
commercially available, and provide a functional measure reflecting myelination in the spinal cord. This
proposed study will explore the association between myelination, as assessed by SSEPs, and a panel of
outcome measures of body structure, function, activity and participation, to determine optimal clinical outcomes
to monitor remyelination. This study will also determine the safety and feasibility of a 24-week aerobic
stationary cycling intervention as compared to an MS symptom education control intervention in a randomized,
single-blind, parallel clinical trial in people with MS. An experimental aim will explore if aerobic stationary
cycling is associated with improvements in mobility and remyelination of the spinal cord, as measured by
SSEP. The goal of this study is to lay the ground work needed to design and implement a future, R01-funded,
multimodal, randomized clinical trial of aerobic stationary cycling and pharmacotherapy to stimulate
remyelination in people with MS."
10864811,"Animals learn to associate otherwise neutral sensory cues with positive or negative contingencies and rely
on those associations to make adaptive decisions. Flexible updating of these acquired associations as
contingencies change is also important. Failure to update internal representations plays a causal role in some
mental disorders, including schizophrenia and anxiety. While the neural substrates of acquiring and updating
associations have been studied in mammalian models, the complexity of the mammalian brain has made it
difficult to obtain precise cellular and synaptic mechanistic understanding. Drosophila flies exhibit flexible
associative learning: they learn to avoid an odor paired with electric shock, and extinguish that learned
association when the odor is later presented without shock. Flies have powerful genetic tools to allow precise
manipulation and visualization of neural activity with cellular resolution in the mushroom body brain region
(MB), where neural plasticity underlying learning occurs. Our long-term goal is to use Drosophila to gain
mechanistic insight into how acquisition and extinction are implemented by synaptic microcircuits of the MB.
Our novel hypothesis is that plasticity of dopamine neurons embedded in a recurrent synaptic microcircuit
residing in the fly mushroom body underlies extinction of odor-shock associations. To test this hypothesis we
employ in vivo Ca2+ imaging and optogenetics to visualize and manipulate dynamic changes in neural activity
of specific genetically targeted MB cell types as a fly acquires and extinguishes an association between a neutral
odor and aversive electric shock."

The George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (GWSPH) has vast experience in
international research ethics education, training, and research in research ethics in Africa. The main aim of the
US-Zim RETP project is to establish and implement International Research Ethics (IRE) education, training, and
research in Zimbabwe at the University of Zimbabwe Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (UZFMHS).
UZFMHS is the premier health professionals education and training institution in Zimbabwe and is the major
centre for health research in Zimbabwe. There is inadequate research ethics training, education, and capacity
in ethics research to support the growing robust research agenda to provide the evidence base to address the
most pressing health needs of the country. The overall goal of US-Zimbabwe Research Ethics Training
Program (US-Zim RETP) project is to develop the capacity for research ethics education, training, and ethics
research in Zimbabwe. The aims of the program are to; Aim 1: Enhance the pedagogical and curricular strengths
of key UZFHMS faculty to deliver research ethics courses and mentoring in Zimbabwe. Aim 2: Develop and
implement a two-year Master’s level degree in Research Ethics at UZFMHS. Aim 3: Promote research around
key priorities for research ethics in Zimbabwe. The US-Zim RETP program will be implemented by GWSPH
faculty in collaboration with UZFMHS faculty and other experts in the region. The ethics research will be in line
with the priority national research agenda, infectious diseases, and non-communicable diseases. The Master’s
program will consist of mentorship/multiple mentorships, coursework, mentored research projects, attachments
to research ethics committees, and training in grant and scientific writing and presentation skills. The degree
program is designed to run for 2 years. Three cohorts of 5 students each will be recruited over the 5-year grant
period. The short courses will be run 3 to 4 times per year, while the faculty development programs will have
health ethics components embedded in them."
10863887,"Project Summary
When sick with an infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic disease, humans report sleepiness and excess or
unrefreshing sleep. The features of human sleep during sickness are shared with those in Drosophila.
Sickness behavior in fruit flies as in humans and other species is induced by stressors such as bacterial
infection or aseptic injury, which reduce activity and increase sleep. While the causal mechanisms underlying
altered sleep during sickness are unknown, immune system and lipid dysregulation are implicated. We will
exploit the Drosophila genetic model to directly test specific interactions between the innate immune system
and lipid homeostasis to determine how these interactions contribute to sleep need during sickness. We
recently identified a novel brain-expressed antimicrobial peptide (AMP) nemuri (nur), which links the immune
response with sleep. nur is strongly induced by infection and sleep deprivation and loss of it reduces sleep
under these conditions. Our preliminary data indicate that induction of nur is mediated by Nuclear Factor κB
transcription factors (NFκB). Overexpression of nur in the brain also promotes sleep and is associated with
dysregulation of lipid metabolism in a manner that parallels that of patients with myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Preliminary data also indicate lipid depletion by
sustained sleep deprivation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that prolonged expression of nemuri,
either genetically or as induced by chronic sleep deprivation or infection, causes lipid bilayer stress (LBS).
Under normal circumstances, the unfolded protein response, mediated by IRE1/XBP1 signaling, resolves LBS
(UPRLBS) and terminates the acute stress-induced sleep response. However, prolonged activation of nur
disrupts NFκB activity, which is central to the innate immune response. The suppression of NFκB signaling
subsequently prevents an appropriate response to LBS by reducing the adaptive lipid homeostatic UPRLBS,
thereby increasing sleep need. We will use behavioral genetic, lipidomic, biochemical, and pharmacological
approaches to test key aspects of this hypothesis. Given that immune, lipid metabolic, and UPR pathways are
highly conserved between flies and mammals, results of our proposed studies will provide a framework for
understanding a mechanism for sleep during sickness, with implications for unrefreshing sleep and fatigue
associated with numerous illnesses in humans."
10863983,"Converging epidemiological studies indicate that a life-threatening event increases the incidence of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which carries a 30-50% comorbidity with substance use disorders (SUDs).
Such comorbidity results in greater drug use and poorer treatment outcomes. The proposed research builds
upon my recent publication, where I showed a remarkable overlap between the enduring neuroadaptations
produced in nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) excitatory transmission after acute restraint stress and drug use.
Recently, I paired a stressful event with a novel odor and found that the stress-conditioned odor alone induced
cocaine seeking. In NAcore, ~95% of neurons are medium spiny neurons (MSNs) chemically coded as
selectively expressing D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Different studies showed that D1 activation generally
promotes and D2 activation inhibits behaviors during drug seeking. At molecular level, I observed that activated
matrix metalloproteases signal through β3-integrins and are required for the transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP)
characteristic of drug seeking elicited by cocaine cues. Here, I will examine the role of D1- and D2-MSN neuronal
activity in response to stress-conditioned cues and determine if the changes in neuronal activity encode coping
behavior or cocaine seeking. Furthermore, I will determine if changes in activity in D1- and D2-MSNs are integrin-
mediated. To accomplish this, I will be trained in vivo single cell Ca2+ transients in real time. I will also use
DREADDS technology for cell-type specific modulation and Cre-dependent shRNA for cell-specific target protein
knockdown. In the K99 aims, I propose to determine if exposure to stress-conditioned cues elicit different patterns
of activity during defensive burying (DB) (Aim 1). I will selectively inactivate D1- or D2-MSNs during restraint
stress to evaluate the necessity of each cell type for encoding coping during DB (Aim 2A) and I will evaluate if
the activity in either cell type is dependent upon β3-integrin signaling using Cre-dependent shRNA knockdown
(Aim 2B). MUSC provides an ideal research environment in which to attain this training and complete these aims,
as it boasts one of the leading neuroscience departments for addiction research with multi-PI center grants. This
training will enhance my qualifications for transitioning to an independent tenure-track faculty position at a major
research institution, which is my ultimate goal. Moreover, Dr. Kalivas is a well-established mentor who has
demonstrated abundant success in facilitating the transition of his postdoctoral trainees to faculty positions. Once
I achieve a faculty appointment during the R00 period, I will determine if the changes in Ca2+ transient in D1- or
D2-MSNs during stress-conditioned cues are similar to those observed during stress-induced cocaine seeking
(Aim 3). I will examine the necessity of each cell type for encoding cocaine seeking (Aim 4A) and I will evaluate
if the activity in either cell type is dependent upon β3-integrin signaling (Aim 4B). These experiments have the
potential to reveal novel neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD that induce the increased vulnerability to SUDs.
Understanding this link will enhance our ability for rational drug design to treat comorbid PTSD and SUDs."

The goal of this research proposal is to develop brain-penetrant inhibitors of glutamate carboxypeptidase II
(GCPII) as a new therapeutic strategy to improve cognition and reduce risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease
(AD). GCPII (EC 3.4.17.21) is a membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase that cleaves the C-terminal
glutamate from N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) producing N-acetylaspartate and glutamate. NAAG is
known to act as an endogenous agonist at metabotropic glutamate receptor type 3 (mGluR3) and we have
recently found that NAAG can enhance memory-related neuronal firing in monkeys through stimulation of
Gi/Go-mediated regulation of postsynaptic cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling. Therefore, GCPII inhibition may
offer a new therapeutic approach to the cognitive impairments by increasing extracellular NAAG levels and
controlling cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling dysregulated in the aging brain. In the absence of mGluR3-selective
agonists and positive allosteric modulators, this approach is particularly attractive as a number of structurally
diverse and potent GCPII inhibitors have been developed and preclinically evaluated in a variety of
neurological disorders with a robust efficacy and an excellent side effect profile. Indeed, our preliminary data
show cognitive enhancement upon treatment with 2-MPPA, a clinically tested GCPII inhibitor, in aged rats
and monkeys. To date, however, efforts on clinical translation of GCPII inhibitors have been substantially
limited despite the significant therapeutic potential. This prompted us to propose a broad range of
pharmacological approaches to the development of brain-penetrant GCPII inhibitors. We are poised to seize
this therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of age-related cognitive disorders by executing the following
three Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Design and synthesis of GCPII inhibitors and their prodrugs; (Aim 2) Evaluate
the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GCPII inhibitors in rats and monkeys; (Aim 3) Assess the effects GCPII
inhibitors on cognitive function in aged rats and monkeys. The successful execution of this project will lead
to a novel therapeutic strategy with greater feasibility for clinical translation to address the main healthcare
needs of the growing elderly population."
10862160,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is prioritizing employee well-being due to crisis levels of
clinician burnout and turnover. The VA aims to achieve this by becoming a “Best Place to Work” while deliver-
ing high quality, safe and equitable care to Veterans using learning health system (LHS) and high reliability or-
ganization (HRO) principles. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) has proposed organizations create
supportive learning environments to improve workforce well-being. However, there is no one-size-fits all solu-
tion. While the VA has invested in system level well-being efforts, including the Reduce Employee Burnout and
Optimize Organizational Thriving (REBOOT) initiative, there is little guidance for teams on how to create sup-
portive learning environments. To fill this gap, we developed The Relational Playbook. The Playbook consists
of research-based resources and 50 evidence-based interventions for nurse managers to implement to change
their team cultures including how to create joy in work and address difficult relationships. To support managers
implementing the Playbook, we propose leadership coaching as a novel implementation strategy.
Significance: The significance of this project is the potential to provide frontline managers with resources and
research-based tools to create supportive learning environments that enhance employee well-being. Addition-
ally, the study will contribute to the fields of implementation, LHS and HRO science and the VA efforts to en-
hance employee well-being and reduce burnout and turnover (2023 VA HSR&D research priorities).
Innovation and Impact: The proposed research is innovative in that it attempts to shift the current paradigm for
the creation of supportive learning environments from an organization-level focus to the team level – where
Veterans receive care. We will partner with VA cardiac catheterization laboratories (CCLs) as a model LHS for
this work. We aim to implement and establish the feasibility and acceptability of the Relational Playbook inter-
vention combined with leadership coaching. Our hypothesis is that enhanced leadership coaching will be a
more feasible and acceptable approach to support Playbook implementation and the cultivation of supportive
learning environments than standard implementation support.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the implementation, feasibility and acceptability of the Playbook intervention, coach-
ing strategy, and study procedures. The VA Collaborative Evaluation Center (VACE), an independent group of
mixed methods experts, will collect the feasibility and acceptability measures developed by Weiner et al. and
select Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (REAIM) measures.
Aim 2: Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation of intervention implementation. VACE will collect inter-
view data to understand 1) intervention adaptations, ease of use, engagement, usefulness, and 2) implementa-
tion speed, costs, barriers, facilitators, and unintended consequences.
Methodology: We propose a pilot, site randomized trial design with an embedded mixed methods process eval-
uation. We have enrolled 6 CCLs and will collect staff and unit level data using surveys and interviews at base-
line, 6 and 12 months. All 6 sites will implement the Playbook. CCLs will be randomized to enhanced leader-
ship coaching implementation support (n=3) or standard implementation support (n=3). The enhanced imple-
mentation group will receive 6 months of virtual leadership coaching support. The standard implementation
group will receive logistical support, but no advisement or coaching.
Next steps: The study findings will 1) establish the feasibility and acceptability of the Playbook intervention
combined with a leadership coaching implementation strategy, and 2) inform the design of a pragmatic adap-
tive effectiveness trial. This trial will test the impact of the Playbook and coaching on employee well-being and
factors that contribute to employee burnout, which is a new VA research priority area."

The Ehlers Danlos Syndromes encompass a group of heritable connective tissue disorders with a complex
phenotype affecting multiple body systems. Among these, the hypermobile subtype of EDS (hEDS), is the most
common type of EDS affecting 1 in 500 individuals. The disease phenotype is characterized by hypermobile
joints that lead to musculoskeletal defects, skin manifestations, tissue fragility, and multiple comorbidities. The
healthcare burden associated with hEDS is substantial, with patients often requiring care from a variety of
medical specialists, frequent surgeries and hospitalizations, management of debilitating chronic pain, and
consistent physical and occupational therapy. Despite well-documented inheritance, the genetic causes of hEDS
remain unclear, and diagnosis relies on clinical criteria, resulting in an average 14-year delay in diagnosis. There
are currently no direct treatment options for hEDS other than symptom management. Recent findings from our
group have highlighted the crucial role of a gene family of trypsin-like serine proteases in hEDS. This proposal
will build on these discoveries by exploring the molecular, cellular, and additional genetic mechanisms that
contribute to hEDS pathogenesis and connective tissue homeostasis. We will explore how proteins encoded by
hEDS genes regulate collagen fibrillogenesis (Aim 1), investigate their contribution of mast cells to altered
extracellular matrix (Aim 2), and perform genome wide association studies (GWAS) to reveal common variants
associated with hEDS and connective tissue biology (Aim 3). By employing our unique and novel mouse models
and leveraging our extensive clinical genetic registry, we aim to gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of
hEDS and its related comorbidities. From these discoveries, we aim to accelerate the development of targeted
therapies for hEDS, create more accurate molecular diagnostic tools and ultimately alleviate the burden on
patients and the healthcare system."

This proposal requests partial support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on autophagy to be held in
Barga, Italy, March 10-14, 2024. Autophagy is a fundamental cellular homeostatic mechanism affecting many
developmental processes, as well numerous age-related human diseases such as neurodegeneration and
inflammation. Growing evidence also suggests autophagy as a major molecular mechanism of aging, warranting
its mechanistic study. The broad and long-term goal of this GRC series is to highlight the expanding role and
regulation of autophagy in physiological and pathological processes that underlie human aging and diseases.
The specific aims of the 2024 GRC meeting will be to convene 40 invited speakers and discussion leaders in
key areas of autophagy research along with 200 participants for a five-day conference. The GRC will be preceded
by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) designed to enhance the participation of junior investigators. The program
will include a keynote session with keynote address from three world leaders who have made seminal
connections between molecular mechanisms and physiological processes. The conference will also feature eight
sessions that address current issues relating to aging, neurodegeneration, cancer, inflammation, immunity, bulk
and selective autophagy mechanisms, membrane dynamics, and lysosomal secretion and repair. In addition, 20
short talks will be selected from submitted abstracts and GRS presentations, and two poster sessions will permit
all participants to contribute to these topics. The significance of this application is that the GRC on autophagy
has become the most important venue that critically influences, directs and drives research in the international
community of autophagy researchers. GRC meetings bring together a broad group of investigators who are at
the forefront of the autophagy research and allied fields, and provide ample opportunities for junior scientists and
trainees to present their work and exchange ideas with leaders in the field, thus nurturing the next generation of
autophagy research leaders, following in the footsteps of the 2016 Nobel Prize winner Yoshinori Ohsumi, who
discovered the molecular mechanisms of autophagy. The health relatedness of this application is that autophagy
directly impacts a wide spectrum of human health and diseases related to aging, such chronic inflammation and
neurodegeneration. The research highlighted by GRC meetings on autophagy will lead to a greater molecular
understanding of a critical process and help develop new approaches to treat age-related diseases and improve
healthspan."

Research has shown a high prevalence of trauma-related disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) co-
occurrence. However, the mechanisms by which a traumatic event increases the vulnerability to SUD
development and relapse are unknown. It is known that the prelimbic cortex (PL) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)
core play critical roles in trauma-related disorders and SUD, but the neurophysiological changes caused in these
structures by trauma and cocaine exposure are not fully understood. This proposal aims to dissect the
mechanism by which a traumatic experience and cocaine exposure alter PL and NAc core communication in
ways that may increase vulnerability to cocaine use disorder development. The hypothesis is that a traumatic
event and cocaine exposure will cause neurophysiological changes in PL-NAc core synapses, resulting in
increased drug-seeking behavior. To test the hypothesis, we will assess the effects of fear conditioning (FC) as
a traumatic event, and cocaine exposure on cocaine-seeking behavior in male and female rats. Also, we will
analyze the synaptic changes of the PL-projecting neurons to the NAc core, using whole cell patch-clamp
electrophysiological recordings with optogenetic manipulation (Aim 1), as well as the influence of PL inactivation
on cocaine seeking (Aim 2) from cocaine-exposed rats with or without FC. Preliminary behavioral data show that
FC prior to cocaine exposure increases cue-primed reinstatement and cocaine-primed reinstatement in male
rats, providing a suitable behavioral paradigm for investigating the neurophysiological changes that occur in this
comorbidity. The findings of the proposed study will provide insight into how PL modulates the NAc core neurons
in the presence of a traumatic experience and drug exposure, to influence drug-seeking behavior."

In this F31 proposal resubmission, I use novel synthetic transcription factors (TFs) delivered to the mouse medial
prefrontal cortex (PFC) to uncover and manipulate the brain molecular processes that govern complex social
behaviors. Social behaviors are central to the health of society and the individual, and are disrupted in a number
of psychiatric illnesses. However, the neurobiological origins of social behaviors are incompletely understood.
Here, I present synthetic biology approaches to re-program the function of ZFP189, a Kruppel-associated box
(KRAB) zinc finger TF whose expression and function in the mouse PFC was previously determined to be
protective against stress-induced social deficits. To interrogate gene targets and nuanced behaviors controlled
by ZFP189, my laboratory and I developed novel synthetic ZFP189 TFs, each capable of exerting distinct forms
of transcriptional control at in vivo ZFP189 target genes. We replaced the endogenous repressive KRAB moiety
of ZFP189WT with a synthetic transcriptional activator in ZFP189VPR. Viral delivery of these synthetic TFs allows
me to knowingly augment ZFP189-mediated transcription in the PFC of awake and behaving mice. In data
presented in this application, I observe that virally delivering ZFP189VPR to the PFC of mice ablates social
behaviors, without other observable behavioral deficits. By performing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on
manipulated tissues, I identify that the ZFP189 TFs of opposing function exert divergent impact on genes relating
to adaptive immune response. These preliminary findings are in agreement with earlier published work proposing
a co-evolutionary link between social behavior and the molecular cascades associated with anti-pathogen
response in PFC pyramidal neurons. Other published evidence suggests that KZFPs bind repetitive DNA
elements, including transposable elements (TEs), with are self-replicating sequences of DNA. My data shows
that some of the transcripts most activated by ZFP189VPR are TEs. Based on my data and previous literature, I
believe ZFP189 represents an evolutionally ancient link between regulation of brain TEs and the immune
cascades that drive pro-social behaviors. Completion of this project will resolve the impact of synthetic ZFP189
TFs in governing social behaviors and social cognition necessary to function in a social group (Aim 1).
Additionally, this project will illuminate the brain transcriptional mechanisms regulated by ZFP189 by performing
RNAseq of virally manipulated PFC tissues (Aim 2). Together, this work will provide new approaches to identify
the TF functions and illuminate the molecular origins of complex social behaviors. The skills I develop through
this project and fellowship will position me for a competitive and successful career as a scientist."

Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a
contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined
substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living
in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most
adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are
novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those
targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier
to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know
which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that
could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down-
regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive
reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand,
events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level
terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to
resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms
(e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There
is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation
and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its
mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level
construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual
differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals
for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level
construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to
quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes
to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal
to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high-
level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a
sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based
treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level
construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2)."

10828368,"Growing evidence suggests that patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), like other neuro-developmental disorders, have mis-wiring of neuronal connections that form during development. These
defects in neuronal connectivity likely contribute to symptoms of TSC, such as cognitive deficits, autism and
epilepsy. However, defective axon guidance by human neurons has only been suggested from brain imaging
studies, as models to study the molecular basis for mis-guidance of developing human neurons have not been
developed. To directly address these fundamental questions, we will study the development of human neurons
that we differentiate from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from TSC patient-derived cells and
their genetically engineered counterparts. Using a series of cell behavior and molecular signaling assays, we
will compare TSC2 mutant neurons with their gene-corrected, isogenic control neurons both in vitro and within
3D forebrain spheroids. We will examine changes in mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways in TSC2
mutant neurons to determine the relative contributions of each signaling pathway to neuronal development.
While modulation of mTOR-dependent protein synthesis has been suggested to be required downstream of
both attractive and repulsive axon guidance in several animal model systems, it is unknown if similar
mechanisms function in developing human neurons. Our surprising preliminary data suggest that TSC2
functions independent of mTOR in growth cones to directly regulate the cytoskeleton to control axon guidance.
In this proposal, we will determine how loss of TSC2 function alters the development of human forebrain
neurons, with a current focus on axon extension and sensitivity to key axon guidance cues, two important
cellular consequences of abnormal TSC2 function. We will determine the molecular mechanisms downstream
of TSC2 and test functionally how these signaling pathway contribute to abnormal axon extension and
guidance cue responses. Over the long term, we believe our research may help identify key druggable targets
in patients with TSC."
10828371,"The periosteum plays a critical role in cortical bone expansion and homeostasis, has regenerative capabilities
and responds to anabolic drugs. However, in spite of its clinical significance our basic understanding of
periosteal cellular characteristics, local or paracrine regulatory factors as well as the specific mechanisms by
which anabolic drugs regulate it, remain elusive. Thanks to powerful new sequencing technologies, a
periosteal population of cells labeled by Cathepsin K (Ctsk+), which includes bona fide periosteal stem cells
(PSCs) and non-stem periosteal progenitor (PP1 and PP2) cells has been recently identified in the long bones
and calvarium, providing a great opportunity for studying the regulation and physiological relevance of the
periosteum in skeletal phenotypes. In this context, our recent studies have established that loss of function
mutations of the Wnt inhibitor SFRP4 lead to Pyle’s disease, a rare skeletal disease characterized by limb
deformity and fragility fractures. Using the Sfrp4-/- mouse model we uncovered that Sfrp4 contributes to cortical
bone expansion and homeostasis by regulating endosteal remodeling and periosteal formation. The studies
proposed here are focused on the biology of the periosteal surface. Our objective is to identify the role of
Sfrp4-mediated signaling in regulating its activity. We have found that Sfrp4+ cells in the periosteum constitute
a specific pool of Ctsk+ “periosteal” progenitors (PP1 and PP2) and that Sfrp4 deletion alters the % of PSCs
and PP2 cells. The goal of the studies proposed in Aim 1 is to address whether Sfrp4 regulates the expansion,
differentiation and/or function of periosteal stem cells and progenitors and the mechanisms by which this
occurs. Given that PTH is a potent stimulator of periosteal bone formation, the findings that PSCs, bona fide
stem cells, express the PTH receptor together with the findings that PTH positively regulates Sfrp4 in the
periosteum are of significance and may have clinical consequences for the treatment of Pyle’s disease
patients. The goal of the studies proposed in Aim 2 is therefore to explore whether Sfrp4-Wnt mediated
signaling cooperate with PTH to regulate periosteal formation. Compelling evidences have demonstrated that
stem cells in the calvarium suture and periosteum serve as growth centers for bone formation during
development and support bone repair in response to injury. In the calvarium PSCs are mainly within the suture,
while PP2 cells are predominant in the calvarial periosteum outside of the suture and PP1 are found at both
sites. Despite canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling activation, the absence of Sfrp4 results in lack of new
bone formation in response to injury. The goal of the studies proposed in Aim 3 is to explore the mechanism(s)
by which Sfrp4+ cells contribute to the bone regenerative potential of stem cells/progenitors using calvarial
defects as injury repair model. Analysis of signaling pathways regulating periosteal stem cells and progenitors
may open novel and specific therapeutic options for human diseases associated with bone fragility and
impaired bone healing and bone regeneration."

 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 infection suppresses viral replication, preserves and improves the
CD4+ T cell count and prevents disease progression. However, treatment with ART is not curative, and
interruption of therapy consistently unleashes viral relapse. The persistence of a viral reservoir following ART
is the major obstacle to an HIV cure. Proposed “shock and kill” strategies to activate and eliminate the HIV
reservoir are currently not informed by a knowledge of the T cell states or lineages that support latency. One
of the greatest challenges in latency research is to distinguish latent cells from non-latent cells, which is
inherently difficult to do without perturbing the latent state of the cells. With current approaches, cellular
activation is required to enumerate latent cells, which disrupts the very state that we would like to study. To
overcome this major roadblock to latency studies, we have developed an HIV-induced lineage tracing model
(HILT) in humanized mouse that irreversibly genetically marks infected cells. When combined with single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) approaches in HIV-infected, ART-treated animals, the result is an emerging
genomic resolution view of transcriptional states associated with HIV infection and latency. Preliminary studies
presented here begin to provide an unprecedented, single cell genomic classification of HIV-infected CD4 T
cell lineages and states during acute infection and during early antiretroviral treatment. In this proposal, we
explore single cell multi-omics of persistently infected human CD4 T cells in humanized mice and examine how
it responds to oligoclonal TCR activation versus homeostatic proliferation. The systems biology of T cells will
be used to dissect latent reservoirs in novel small animal models for HIV to understand how a reservoir is
generated and maintained in distinct cell states. Genomic analysis may be used to identify drugs or biologic
interventions that can push cells towards active HIV expression and are independent of cellular activation
state. These could be used to develop cure strategies aimed at enhancing expression and the progressive
decay of the latent reservoir. We hypothesize that a single cell multi-omics approach will elucidate
developmentally diverse T cell lineages and transcriptional states that harbor HIV reservoirs, and that each
cluster may display unique gene programs associated with HIV persistence. Reversing the expression of
factors associated with HIV persistence may reactivate the reservoir. Single cell multi-omics may unveil new
targeted strategies to purge HIV from different T cell states. The proposed study leverages a team with
expertise in HIV immunopathogenesis, humanized mice, single cell genomics, to deeply phenotype human T
cell reservoirs in novel small animal models."
10826326,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex, multi-factorial syndrome with an unacceptable
high mortality rate. Endothelial injury characterized by persistently increased lung microvascular
permeability resulting in protein-rich lung edema is a hallmark of ARDS. In both animal models of acute
lung injury induced by sepsis and ARDS patients, there are mounting evidence demonstrate loss of
endothelial cells (ECs). Recent studies provide some information that ECs play predominant role in lung
endothelial regeneration. However, the pulmonary vascular ECs are quite heterogenous. It is unknown
whether all resident ECs contribute to endothelial regeneration following sepsis-induced vascular injury.
The most important question in the field is whether there is a special endothelial stem cells responsible
for endothelial regeneration and vascular repair following sepsis-induced lung injury. Our supporting data
show that there is a novel rare subpopulation of ECs responsible for lung endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair following sepsis-induced lung injury. These cells express many of the genes essential for
cell cycle progression and proliferation and also some of the stem cell genes, however, not the markers
of recently identified vascular endothelial stem cells/progenitor cells such as Apelin, CD157 and EPCR.
Based on their unique expression of 2 genes, we named this rare subpopulation of ECs as UC+
endothelial stem cells (UC+ESCs). Genetic depletion of UC+ESCs in mouse lungs led to inhibited
endothelial regeneration and impaired vascular repair resulting in persistent inflammatory lung injury.
Thus, we hypothesize that UC+ESCs are the long-sought endothelial stem cells responsible for
endothelial regeneration and vascular repair following inflammatory lung injury induced by sepsis
challenge. The proposed studies will address the following Specific Aims. Studies in AIM 1 will determine
the fundamental role of UC+ESCs in vascular repair and resolution of inflammatory lung injury induced
by sepsis challenge via genetic depletion of UC+ESCs. Two complementary sepsis models including i.p.
LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) which induces polymicrobial sepsis will be used. AIM 2 will
define the role of UC+ESCs in regenerating endothelial subpopulation(s) and the molecular mechanisms
of UC+ESC proliferation and expansion following sepsis challenge. These studies will define a novel
rare endothelial stem cell subpopulation responsible for endothelial regeneration following sepsis-
induced inflammatory lung injury and provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of the cellular
mechanisms of endothelial regeneration and vascular repair. We believe successful completion of the
studies will lead to novel therapeutic strategy to harness this specific intrinsic endothelial stem cell
subpopulation for the prevention and effective treatment of ARDS induced by sepsis."
10839278,"Project Abstract
 Unlike the sporadic exposure of the general population in wildfire prone areas, exposure of wildland
firefighters (WFFs) to WF smoke is recurrent, and has recently become more so due to the increase in the
acreage of land burned by wildfires and prescribed (managed) fires. WFFs are exposed to elevated levels of WF
smoke while working at wildland fires. The airborne concentrations of the reactive particles in WF smoke at the
fireline are at least an order of magnitude higher than the health-based air quality standards in the U.S. The
inhalation exposure of WFFs at the fireline is exacerbated because they work extended hours on multiple days
per year at the fireline. Additionally, wildland firefighting is conducted mostly without any respiratory protection,
as no respirator is currently approved for the profession. Nevertheless, knowledge about the chronic respiratory
effects of such exposure is lacking. The proposed study is designed to address NIOSH’s “Public Safety” sector,
and its “Respiratory Health” and “Cancer, Reproductive, and Cardiovascular Diseases” cross-sectors by
assessing the association between occupational WF smoke exposure and subclinical indicator of pulmonary
health impairment and cancer-related molecular changes in the respiratory airways. Therefore, the hypotheses
of the proposed study are: 1) that cumulative recurrent WF smoke exposure induces adverse long-term
respiratory effects among WFFs, and 2) that a situational use of an air purifying respirator (APR) during periods
of peak particulate exposure concentrations will reduce exposure and adverse acute physiological responses.
The first hypothesis will be tested by comparing changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in the nasal
epithelium and lung function across a three-year period between WFFs and a control group of emergency
medical technicians (EMTs) matched by age, sex and ethnicity (N = 50/group). The proposed outcomes are
disease precursors and are relevant for characterizing risk of disease that may evolve long after exposure or
retirement. The second hypothesis will be tested by comparisons of cross-shift changes in urinary biomarkers of
exposure, gene expression in the nasal epithelium, and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines among WFFs (N =
35) between occasions when they wear the APR and when they do not, while working at prescribed burns.
 The objective of the proposed study is well aligned with NIOSH’s priority extramural research goals to reduce
occupational cancer and respiratory disease and exposures causing them. Following the completion of the study,
we would have determined the adverse respiratory effects of cumulative occupational exposure to WF smoke
and a practical approach to mitigate them. The envisaged outputs from the proposed research, which would
include publicly accessible results and publications, would directly inform NIOSH’s priority goal to reduce
incidence of exposure and illnesses among wildland firefighters. These outputs, which will also be made
accessible to stakeholders via a virtual workshop, will contribute to appropriate risk assessment of WF smoke
exposure, the development of exposure and risk mitigation strategies, and methods to test their effectiveness."

This K01 Career Development Award application proposes a multidisciplinary 5-year training program to
provide the candidate, Dr. Zheng Wang, with the experience and resources necessary to launch a successful
career as an independent investigator. The training plan, developed closely with primary mentor Dr. Qibin Qi,
co-mentors Drs. Robert Burk and Jorge Kizer, and an Advisory Committee (Drs. Rob Knight, Robert Kaplan,
Tao Wang, and Anjali Sharma), will expand Dr. Wang’s research experience and expertise, in oral microbiome,
integrative multi-omics analyses, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology. Building upon two well-
characterized HIV cohorts (Women's Interagency HIV Study, WIHS; Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, MACS)
and pre-existing circulating metabolomics and proteomics data, the proposed research project offers the
candidate an exceptional opportunity to become proficient in the novel area of oral microbiome and integrative
multi-omics analyses research, in the field of CVD epidemiology in HIV population. Taking advantage of
collected oral saliva samples, carotid atherosclerosis (measured by ultrasound) and cardiac fibro-inflammation
(measured by magnetic resonance imaging) data, circulating metabolomics data and proteomic inflammatory
markers data in the WIHS, this project proposes to measure oral microbiome taxa and functional components
using shotgun metagenome sequencing, in 320 participants (216 HIV+ and 104 HIV-; 84 with carotid artery
plaque and 236 without plaque). We will identify alterations in the oral microbiome associated with HIV-related
factors, and examine associations of oral microbiome features with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and
cardiac fibro-inflammation. We will further investigate the oral-gut microbiome crosstalk (with pre-existing gut
metagenomics data) and its implications in subclinical CVD, in the context of HIV. Replication analysis will be
performed in 400 MACS participants to validate the findings. Moreover, we will examine prospective
associations of baseline microbial-associated metabolites with incident carotid artery plaque over 7-years
follow-up (n=737), to explore the role of microbiota in CVD development. Employing advanced ""multi-omics""
analytical approaches, we will examine the microbiome–metabolome–proteome interactions and generate a
network illustrating interrelationships between oral and gut bacteria, circulating metabolites, proteomic
inflammatory markers, microbial translocation biomarkers, CVD and HIV infection.
Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a larger study proposal to measure oral and gut
microbiome longitudinally and integrate microbiome with other omics data more comprehensively. These
studies will advance our understanding of interrelationships among microbiome, host inflammation and
metabolism, and shed light on potential underlying mechanisms, which will provide useful information for
effective strategies in the prevention and management of CVD in people living with HIV."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the lives of people living with HIV (PWH). However, the increased
burden of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
obesity is leading to higher morbidity and mortality among these individuals. The disruption of the intestinal
barrier, resulting in microbial translocation and chronic systemic inflammation, has been linked to NCDs.
However, the mechanism of intestinal barrier disruption in PWH on ART remains incompletely understood.
Interactions between tissue resident CD8+ T cells and the intestinal epithelium are critical for maintaining barrier
integrity. Colonic CD8+ T cells are dependent upon on lipid metabolism for energy production and PPARs
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) are a family of lipid-sensing receptors that critically regulate lipid
metabolism in colon CD8+ T cells. Increases in PPAR-induced lipid metabolism have previously been shown to
boost CD8+ T cell immune function in the tumor microenvironment and improve colitis in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease. In PWH on ART, we show that PPARs are downregulated in colon CD8+ T cells,
which results in impaired internal lipid storage. Moreover, PPAR deficiency in these cells is also associated with
CD8+ T cell-mediated epithelial damage that disrupts intestinal barrier integrity. This has led us to hypothesize
that in PWH on ART, downregulation of PPARs result in impaired lipid metabolism in colonic CD8+ T cells, which
decrease effector functions and leads to impaired intestinal barrier integrity. During the K99 phase, this proposal
aims to determine the effects of PPARs on CD8+ T cell effector function in PWH on ART. In Aim 1 we will use
PPAR knock-out mice to determine the role of PPAR signaling in the CD8+ T cell subpopulations in the mouse
colon (K99 phase). Aim 2 we will characterize the mechanism of how PPAR signaling impacts lipid metabolism
in colonic CD8+ T cells (K99 to R00 transition). In Aim 3, we will determine how dysregulation of cellular
metabolism in colonic CD8+ T cells impacts epithelial function in the intestine (R00 phase). This proposal will
involve using ex vivo intestinal organoids that incorporate colonic CD8+ T cells from human subjects and
genetically engineered mice with deficiencies in CD8+ T cell cellular energy production. To carry out these aims,
the PI has assembled a team with combined expertise in HIV pathogenesis, mucosal immunology,
immunometabolism, intestinal pathology, and single-cell transcriptomics who will collaborate and support the
PI’s work and career development. This proposal seeks to identify novel therapeutic interventions that can
restore tissue-resident CD8+ T cell function in PWH on ART (K99) and characterize the molecular mechanism
of intestinal barrier damage associated with chronic immune activation to help ameliorate NCDs in ART-treated
PWH (R00)."

Psychosocial (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress) and structural problems (e.g., food insecurity) are
associated with worse antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and higher viral load. Depression, post-traumatic
stress, and food insecurity are also highly comorbid and are thought to interact synergistically to confer greater
risk for worse HIV outcomes (i.e., syndemic problems). The goal of this proposal is to obtain the necessary
training and support needed to develop and test a multilevel intervention to address syndemic problems and
improve ART adherence (CBT-SA). Candidate: I am a clinical psychologist with specialized training in
behavioral medicine and quantitative psychology, and currently a post-doctoral fellow at Massachusetts General
Hospital and Harvard Medical School. This 5-year career development award will provide the mentorship,
training, and experience needed to become an NIH-funded independent investigator studying the effects of
syndemic problems on HIV and developing and testing interventions to address these syndemic effects in
resource-limited settings globally. Mentoring: Dr. Conall O’Cleirigh will serve as my primary US-based mentor
given his expertise in trauma, depression and HIV in resource-limited settings. Dr. John Joska will be my primary
SA-based mentor due to his experience with the presentation of depression and trauma, and developing
interventions in SA. My co-mentors will be Dr. Christina Psaros given her expertise in conducting qualitative
research and Dr. Jessica Magidson because of her experience in implementation science. My Scientific Advisory
Board is comprised of experts from SA and the US: Dr. Ashraf Kagee (intersection of structural and psychosocial
problems), Dr. Steven Safren (intervention development), and Dr. Daniel Feaster (biostatistics), with consultation
from Dr. Julian May (addressing food insecurity) and Dr. Lenny Naidoo (government). Training: I propose to
obtain training in qualitative methods for conceptual framework development and intervention evaluation,
intervention development and the NIH Stage Model, and implementation science theory and frameworks. These
training goals will provide the necessary knowledge to develop, test, and eventually implement interventions to
address syndemic problems and HIV treatment outcomes. Research: The proposed specific aims are to: 1)
explore the complex interrelationships between food insecurity, depression, and post-traumatic stress, as they
relate to engagement in HIV care, and explore attitudes to potential intervention components; 2) develop a
multilevel intervention to address syndemic problems and improve adherence (CBT-SA) and conduct an iterative
proof-of-concept pilot trial use syndemic theory; 3a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of CBT-SA in a pilot
RCT; and 3b) identify barriers and facilitators of CBT-SA engagement among PWH and uptake among care
providers and other key local partners to inform a future hybrid effectiveness/implementation R01 trial. If

10839344,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Unhealthy diet and obesity are major causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emerging adults (ages 18-25)
are a crucial group to target with CVD prevention interventions because they have lower dietary quality and
experience more rapid weight gain than adults in middle and older adulthood. Moreover, emerging adulthood is
distinct developmental period during which lifelong eating behaviors and CVD risk trajectories are largely
established. Communication interventions, particularly those appealing to emerging adults’ strong interest in
both environmental sustainability and personal health, are a promising but understudied strategy for
addressing unhealthy diet in this age group. The goal of the proposed research is to design and rigorously
evaluate a communication intervention to reduce dietary risk factors for CVD among emerging adults. The first
aim is to identify specific dietary substitutions that emerging adults can readily make to reduce their CVD risk
and dietary environmental harms. To identify these substitutions, I will analyze dietary intake data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys linked to a comprehensive database of foods’ greenhouse
gas emissions. The second aim is to develop and optimize health and environmental messages about these
dietary substitutions. I will develop candidate messages, pre-test them in qualitative focus groups, then use a
randomized factorial experiment with 800 emerging adults to identify the most effective message strategies.
The third aim is to evaluate the impact of the messaging interventions on healthfulness of food purchases. In a
longitudinal randomized controlled trial, I will assign 500 emerging adults to 1 of 4 conditions: control (no
messages), health, environmental, or health + environmental messages. Participants will simulate five weekly
shopping trips in an online grocery store with their assigned messages prominently displayed. I will evaluate
each messaging interventions’ initial, sustained, and overall impacts on purchase healthfulness and identify the
most effective type of message. This research will further NHLBI’s strategic goal of preventing CVD and NIH
Nutrition Research Objective 2-6 to leverage behavioral science to initiate and sustain healthy eating. Further,
this award will help me achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on
effective, scalable CVD prevention interventions for emerging adults. With support from this K01, I will build on
my expertise in nutrition policy to fill critical training gaps in: 1) the CVD and environmental impacts of food, 2)
communication interventions for emerging adults, 3) mixed methods, and 4) advanced analytic techniques for
longitudinal studies. My detailed training plan includes tutorials with my interdisciplinary mentorship team at the
Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, formal coursework, hands-on research activities, and participation
in conferences, workshops, and seminars. The K01 will provide me with the expertise and preliminary data
needed to become an independent researcher successfully competing for R01 funding in this area."
10862410,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare monogenic cancer caused by a reciprocal chromosomal
translocation that generates the TAZ(WWTR1)–CAMTA1 (TC) fusion gene. No effective treatments exist for
patients with aggressive EHE who do not survive beyond 2 years post-diagnosis. Further, no human cell models
of EHE exist, making both preclinical testing of potential therapeutics and a mechanistic understanding of
aggressive disease quite challenging. To begin to address these problems and identify potential treatments, we
generated two genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of EHE: an indolent/less aggressive model, by
recreating TC fusion at the endogenous Taz locus, and an aggressive EHE model by combining TC fusion with
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a) conditional knockout. We also derived the first EHE cell lines
from aggressive tumors via ex vivo expansion; however, we were unable to develop cell lines using the
indolent/less aggressive model. TC is a transcriptional coregulator that is predominantly localized to the nucleus;
therefore, we reasoned that drugs/small molecules that translocate TC to the cytoplasm or destabilize TC would
reduce oncogenicity. To this end, we performed phenotypic screening based on TC immunofluorescence to
identify such drugs/small molecules. We identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi) dinaciclib as a
potent drug that can cause TC nuclear exit and destabilization. This translates to decreased cell proliferation and
enhancement of apoptosis, as EHE cells are ‘oncogene-addicted’ to TC. Our long-term goal is to understand
EHE tumor biology and identify a therapeutic vulnerability for the effective treatment of EHE. Aim 1: We will
determine the efficacy of dinaciclib in allograft models of EHE and elucidate its mechanism of action. All the top
hits in our phenotypic screen, including dinaciclib, were transcription inhibitors that prevent the assembly of the
productive transcription elongation complex. Therefore, we hypothesize that incorporating TC into the productive
elongation complex prevents its nuclear exit. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate by immunoprecipitation
and mass spectrometry whether TC binds to components of this complex and will characterize the TC
interactome after treatment with transcription inhibitors. Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of Cdkn2a introduction on TC
localization and stability in vitro and in allograft models by introducing p16Ink4a and p19Arf, the two major protein
products of Cdkn2a, into our EHE cell line via CRISPR-HDR. Given that CDK inhibition destabilizes TC, we
hypothesize that Cdkn2a, a physiological CDKi, will destabilize TC. Clinically, CDKN2A loss is associated with
late-stage or aggressive disease; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore,
we will investigate if Cdkn2a decreases TC stability. In sum, this work will be significant because we will have
shown that dinaciclib is potentially the first effective treatment for aggressive EHE, and we will have deciphered
the mechanism linking CDK inhibition and TC nuclear exit/stability."
10863922,"The devastating impact on public health, global economy and social stability incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic
in the last two years has highlighted the importance of basic research into zoonotic pathogens. This application
describes structural and functional studies into the rodent-borne human pathogen lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV), a member of the Arenaviridae family in the Bunyavirales order. Like other members of the same
family, LCMV has a negative sense, bi-segmented genome consisting of a large (L) and a small (S) segment.
The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L RdRp) protein and the multi-functional matrix
protein (Z). The S segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP) precursor of the
glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is later cleaved into a stable signal peptide (SSP), GP1, and GP2. In the virion,
nucleocapsids of NP coated L and S segments associated with the L protein are copackaged through interactions
with membrane-associated Z proteins, which also interact with GPs embedded in the membrane envelope.
Although structures of individual proteins from AVs have been solved by x-ray crystallography or cryo electron
microscopy (cryoEM), the architectural organization of these proteins in the virion and the assembly mechanism
of NP and RNA into the nucleocapsid are poorly understood. We hypothesize that NP interacts with genomic
RNA segments and L RdRp to form a nucleocapsid, which is recruited to GP-decorated membrane patches
through Z for budding of virions. The proposed structural and functional studies aim to test this hypothesis of
LCMV virion and nucleocapsid assembly with techniques just established by our team in the collaborative studies
of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), another negative sense RNA virus. Specifically, cryo electron tomography
(cryoET) will be used to reconstruct the first 3D model of the LCMV virion at molecular resolution and atomic
models of individual proteins will be fitted into the virion tomogram to establish the architectural framework of the
virion and to unveil molecular interactions among GP, Z, NP and L proteins (Aim 1). Near-atomic resolution with
novel sub-particle reconstruction method will be used to image fully assembled nucleocapsids consisting of NP
protein and genomic RNA segment to define the protein-RNA interactions at atomic details. The nucleocapsid
structure will be used to guide sub-particle reconstruction workflow and be complemented by in situ structures
of nucleocapsids from virions (Aim 2). In both Aims, structure-guided functional studies will be performed to test
hypotheses of assembly mechanisms of LCMV nucleocapsid and virion. Structure-function relationship relevant
to viral RNA synthesis will also be explored. Overall, the anticipated results will provide new insights into the
mechanism of virion assembly and viral RNA synthesis, not only for LCMV but also for Arenaviruses in general.
The proposed studies harness cutting-edge technologies in structural biology and will generate new knowledge
of viral structures currently unavailable to any of Arenaviruses. As such, the innovative studies shall make unique
contributions by accelerating discoveries of antiviral agents and vaccines to control future AV outbreaks."
10864949,"ABSTRACT
Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools that allow the tracking of chemical events inside
living cells, in real time. Even with a detailed understanding of biochemistry, enzymology, regulatory signaling,
and genetics, there is no substitute for direct empirical information about the dynamics of chemical processes
and signaling in cells. Unlike most biochemical measurements, the biosensors can provide spatial resolution at
the level of single cells or parts of cells, and temporal resolution of seconds (or better). Nevertheless, there are
major gaps in our ability to follow the details of cell signaling or metabolism using biosensors. For many
interesting biochemical processes, we have no biosensors for the key metabolites. And even when a biosensor
exists, it may not have the right sensitivity and specificity required for observing the desired process, or it may
have sensitivity to pH or other environmental parameters that can mislead the experimenters.
Biosensors are constructed by combining a fluorescent protein (like the jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP)
with a binding protein for the chemical of interest. But finding the right way to combine the proteins is challenging,
and even with a well-reasoned design, getting a biosensor with a strong, specific, and robust signal requires a
large amount of optimization. This optimization is done by screening targeted random libraries of sensor variants.
Current methods are typically limited to processing hundreds of variants per day, usually with just a single pair
of measurements to guide selection of a variant for further validation.
In the previous grant period, we developed a high-throughput, high-content screening pipeline that can
screen thousands to tens of thousands of variants in a day, selecting “winners” based on detailed dose-response
and selectivity data. Our approach uses microfluidic encapsulation of both DNA and protein for each variant in
a small, semipermeable bead, followed by automated microscope imaging of thousands of beads under a series
of conditions (varying [analyte], other test compounds, pH, etc.). This screen will permit thorough optimization
of sensors and will allow success in otherwise failed sensor projects.
We propose to use the new screening method to optimize some existing sensors (e.g., glucose and ATP:ADP
ratio) and sensor prototypes (e.g., lactate and malonyl-CoA). We will also optimize a new general strategy for
constructing sensors from dimeric transcription factors (a large family of microbial proteins useful for sensing),
and we will exploit the high throughput of the screen in concert with computational methods to change the binding
site specificity of existing sensors to produce sensors for important metabolic target molecules.
In parallel, we will make improvements in the screening pipeline to expand its reach, with the goals of substan-
tially increasing efficiency and throughput, and of recovering genotype information on a large number of pheno-
typed sensor variants. These advances can dramatically improve the development of novel and improved
biosensors, as well as other tools for the study and manipulation of chemical processes in living cells."

 Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive, 3-dimensional imaging method to
visualize and quantify microvasculature throughout the retina. The proposed study evaluates the clinical utility
of OCTA measurements compared to standard structural measurements of the optic nerve head (ONH), retinal
nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula measured using the current clinical imaging standard, spectral domain
optical coherence tomography (OCT) to predict and detect progression of disease in glaucoma suspects and
glaucoma patients. Our research, and that of others, has shown that superficial retinal vessel density
(proportion of measured area composed of blood vessels) in the ONH region and macula is less dense in open
angle glaucoma (OAG) eyes than in healthy eyes. Moreover, diagnostic accuracy is improved with increasing
disease severity. Research from our laboratory suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of vessel density is
similar to that of OCT-measured RNFL thickness, and that vessel density is reduced in retinal regions
associated with localized visual field (VF) defects. These cross-sectional results strongly suggest that OCTA
measurements reflect damage to tissues relevant to the pathophysiology of OAG. In a longitudinal study, the
mean rate of change in macula vessel density was shown to be significantly faster in OAG eyes than in
glaucoma suspect or healthy eyes. Finally, recent results indicate that shallow machine learning analyses of
combinations of OCTA measurements can improve classification of healthy and glaucoma eyes compared to
standard instrument measurements as can deep learning analyses of OCTA enface images. The current study
provides a unique opportunity to extend the longitudinal OCTA data that has already been collected from 480
eyes racially diverse individuals for up to 10 years to investigate vessel density change over time in healthy,
glaucoma suspect and OAG eyes, and to compare it to other imaging modalities. The aims of this study are 1)
to improve our understandingof the relative change over time of OCTA and OCT measurements in healthy and
diseased eyes to identify true disease-related change more accurately and 2) to improve our understanding of
the risk of developing glaucomatous progression using statistical and deep learning-based analyses of multi-
modal OCTA and OCT measurements. The proposed studies will enhance our understanding of age and
glaucoma-related change in vessel density and retinal tissue thickness allowing us to predict and detect
change more accurately, thus possibly slowing the rate of progression and consequently reducing the risk of
reduction of vision related quality of life, including blindness."

Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term
career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing
of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill
patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of
traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify
patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification
could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post-
traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of
care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best
define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more
feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal
processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic
Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong
mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon
Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI
analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim
proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that
optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion
volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional
MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk
for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together
advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens
new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic
brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in
concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are
essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to
improving patient outcomes."

Coxsackievirus is a common infection that causes viral myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and hand, foot, and
mouth disease in children and adults. Coxsackievirus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and initiates infection
in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, there is a lack of effective prevention and treatment options for
Coxsackievirus infections. Using a mouse model, recent data demonstrate that Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)
utilizes bacteria to aid viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. However, the mechanism for this observation is
unclear. In preliminary data, we have demonstrated that bacteria can enhance CVB3 infectivity and
thermostability in vitro. We also found that Gram-negative Salmonella enterica binds to CVB3 and can enhance
infectivity and stability of CVB3 while Escherichia coli does not. We also found that structures in the major cell
wall component of Salmonella, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can impact viral stability. These data suggest that
specific bacteria and bacterial cell wall components are required to enhance CVB3. Therefore, this study aims
to elucidate the bacterial structure and site of binding to CVB3, and investigate the mechanisms by which bacteria
aid viral thermostability. This goal will be accomplished in three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the bacterial
cell wall components that interact with CVB3. Using Salmonella LPS mutants, we will characterize the critical
elements of LPS required to interact with CVB3. In Aim 2, we will identify the virion binding site between bacteria
and Coxsackievirus. Using a combination of state-of-the-art cryogenic electron microscopy and CVB3 mutants,
we will elucidate the LPS footprint on the CVB3 virion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the effect of
lipopolysaccharide on CVB3 infectivity and viral stability. Overall, this project will significantly impact our
understanding of viral-microflora interactions and aid future studies to identify antiviral targets for the
development of novel therapeutics."

10864963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In atrial myocytes excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
have unique features that result from the lack or the irregular organization of the transverse tubule membrane
system. Atrial myocytes have two types of SR, junctional (j-SR) and non-junctional (nj-SR). Ca release from j-
SR is controlled by Ca entry through voltage-gated L-type Ca channels (ICa,L) whereas release from nj-SR
occurs by subsequent propagating wave-like Ca-induced Ca release (CICR) driven by the newly identified 'fire-
diffuse-uptake-fire' (FDUF) mechanism. IP3 receptor-induced Ca release (IICR) contributes to ECC by
enhancing inotropy, but also leads to arrhythmogenic Ca release and alternans. Cardiac alternans has been
linked to cardiac arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation. Alternans is defined as beat-to-beat alternations in
action potential (AP) duration (APD, electrical alternans), contraction strength and Ca transient (CaT)
amplitude, and thereby generates a dynamic arrhythmia substrate. Disturbances of the bi-directional coupling
of [Ca]i and membrane voltage (Vm) regulation ([Ca]i↔Vm coupling) are responsible for alternans occurrence.
Sex differences in cardiac structural and electrical properties have been linked to differences in arrhythmia
susceptibility and determine alternans inducibility. Focusing on the FDUF mechanism, the overall goals are to
establish a mechanistic model of atrial ECC, Ca release and atrial alternans and its sex-specific attributes at
cellular, cell pair and organ level.
Specific aim 1. Determine FDUF-dependent mechanisms of atrial alternans. We will determine the critical
role of the novel FDUF paradigm in atrial alternans, testing the hypotheses that 1) uncoupling of j-SR and nj-
SR Ca release promotes 'reverse' FDUF and triggers alternans; 2) the FDUF trigger signal (ICa,L, junctional
CaT) has Vm dependence, and that 3) SERCA dependent Ca uptake; 4) mitochondrial Ca buffering, energetics
and redox signaling and 5) IICR modulate FDUF and alternans.
Specific aim 2. Determine FDUF alternans mechanisms in cell pairs. Alternans is either Vm- or Ca-driven.
Vm-driven alternans is spatially homogeneous, while Ca-driven alternans can be spatially discordant where
over short distances regions alternate out-of-phase. Cell pairs define the elementary structural and functional
unit of cell-cell communication. We will test 1) the spatio-temporal organization of CaT and APD alternans in
cell pairs, 2) how during Ca-driven alternans the FDUF mechanism, SERCA, mitochondrial signaling and IICR
determine cell pair alternans; and 3) how Vm-driven alternans precipitates CaT alternans in adjacent cells.
Specific aim 3. Determine the spatio-temporal organization and mechanisms of Ca- and Vm-driven
tissue alternans. We will determine at organ level (perfused hearts, live animals) the mechanisms,
manifestations and spatio-temporal organization of 1) Ca-driven and 2) voltage-driven alternans, and test
pharmacological interventions to reduce pro-arrhythmic alternans risk."

Post-acute care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) is common, and outcomes are poor and variable. Over the
past decade, SNFs have been a target of efforts to improve outcomes while controlling spending, but robust
gains remain elusive. Our prior work showed that the number of physicians who specialize in SNF-based care
(i.e., “SNFists”) grew rapidly over the past decade. In this study, we will examine whether physicians
specializing in SNF-based care improve functional outcomes and reduce potentially avoidable healthcare
utilization (such as hospital readmissions) of patients receiving post-acute care in SNFs. We will also examine
patient functional outcomes and healthcare utilization of SNFists vs. non-SNFists under value-based
purchasing initiatives. To accomplish these goals, we will expand an existing dataset of Medicare claims and
SNF clinical assessment data for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital
to a SNF from 2012 through 2018. Using this database, we will examine the trends in physician specialization
in SNF care in the context of value-based purchasing (i.e., whether the discharging hospital participated in
bundled payments or an Accountable Care Organization), market competition, and other market and physician
characteristics. Next, we will measure the impact of physician specialization in SNF care on patient outcomes
and potentially avoidable healthcare utilization using difference-in-differences cross-temporal matching. Lastly,
we will conduct semi-structured interviews with key personnel (e.g., director of nursing) in SNFs to
quantitatively identify training, practice strategies and care processes that differ between physicians who
specialize in SNF care and those who do not. When complete, these studies will inform practice and policy to
optimize (increase or reduce) post-acute care patients' access to physicians who specialize in SNF-based
care."

 This proposal is a competing continuation of a T-32 Institutional Training Grant in Tissue Engineering
and Regeneration (DE07057-45). Since its inception, over 140 trainees have completed this Program (92%
completion %), with 82% in a research-intensive or research-related career.
 A primary goal of modern dentistry and medicine is to predictably restore tissues and organs that have
been lost due to pathology, trauma, or congenital abnormalities. Recent advances in understanding the
factors, cells and mechanisms regulating tissue function, coupled with new materials science technologies
capable of providing physiological cues to sites of repair and advances in imaging and bioinformatics have
provided the tools required for researchers to focus on designing ""tissue engineered products"" for therapeutic
use. These efforts require an interdisciplinary approach, with involvement of biomedical scientists, engineers,
and clinical researchers. TEAM (Tissue Engineering at Michigan), a Training Program in tissue engineering
and regeneration, was developed with recognition of the need to train individuals in these various disciplines
and of the need to ensure active exchange of ideas between individuals across disciplines. The goal of our
Program is to provide an interdisciplinary research-intensive training environment to enable a scientifically and
demographically diverse set of individuals to pursue independent research careers in the oral sciences, with a
focus in the area of restoration of dental-oral-craniofacial tissues. This goal is achieved through coursework,
research training, seminars, journal clubs, career development, responsible conduct of research and
intellectual interplay at the intersection of the life sciences, engineering and dentistry. This Training Program
provides intensive training opportunities in both basic biomedical and clinical science, enabling trainees to work
at the interface of clinical and basic science. Our Training Program is comprised of 3 groups of trainees (2 year
appointments each): 1) DDS/Ph.D. (4 slots); 2) Ph.D. (4 slots), and 3) Post-doctoral Fellow (2 slots).
 Trainees will be selected based on strong academic records, research potential, recommendation
letters and commitment to a research career focused in oral science, with an emphasis on tissue engineering
and regeneration. Mentors undergo mentor-the-mentor and DEI training and we have developed T32-specific
initiatives to recruit and retain underrepresented individuals. TEAM is a multidisciplinary program that spans
across departmental and school boundaries, providing trainees the flexibility to choose mentors across
departments. TEAM involves 3 schools, Dentistry, Medicine and Engineering, where in addition to core training
elements in tissue engineering, didactic training is provided through the degree-granting departments at these
schools. The University of Michigan recognizes the importance of quality training programs and is committed
to training oral scientists as independent researchers, enabling the development of a diverse and highly
qualified workforce that significantly impacts oral health."

The C-SiG Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Program is vital for helping us attract new investigators to
digestive disease research. The P/F Program provides investigators with sufficient funds to obtain
robust preliminary data to be used in research grant applications awarded by external agencies,
especially NIDDK. In addition to research funding, P/F awardees are mentored by the C-SiG
Leadership and are provided career development opportunities through the C-SiG Enrichment
Program. Awardees receive feedback on their work through the internal review process and when
presenting to the External Advisory Committee. Thus, the P/F program allows C-SiG to foster and
strengthen the pipeline of new investigators engaging in digestive disease research.
The primary goal of the C-SiG P/F Program is to support new investigators (Type N) just
beginning their careers in digestive diseases research. Proposals are also accepted from established,
funded investigators who are new to digestive disease research (Type EN) who wish to test the
applicability of their expertise to a digestive disease-related problem. The P/F Program typically
funds 3 outstanding proposals each year for a total of $100,000 per year. Since its inception in
2009, the P/F Program has received an average of 9 applications each year, and funded 42
investigators (41 Type N ,1 Type EN, 0 Type E) with first year awards ranging from $25,000-$40,000
(average award $33,000) in direct annual costs. Additionally, P/F recipients are eligible to compete for
a New Supported Investigator Award funded by Mayo that provides a second year of funding (up
to $50,000) to one P/F Award recipient who has made exceptional progress during their first year.
Since 2009, 10 Named Supported Investigator Awards have been given to meritorious P/F projects to
provide a second year of funding (average award $37,000 per year [range $20,000-50,000; total
$370,000] provided by Mayo). As of Jan 2023, 30/42 (71%) of P/F award recipients have achieved
independent Federal funding.
A detailed and rigorous multi-tiered peer review process has been developed to select projects of the
highest quality. Built in this process is a mechanism to provide detailed constructive criticism to all
eligible applicants, including the unfunded ones. The following sections detail the eligibility
requirements, the mechanisms used to announce program funds, the application process and
mechanisms for scientific review, and the mechanisms for program oversight and review."
10866345,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain tumors have become the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Ependymoma (EPN)
accounts for a substantial number of these deaths. Over 70% of children presenting with ependymoma will
relapse and almost all children who relapse will eventually die. Unlike medulloblastoma, no effective
chemotherapy has been developed in ependymoma to complement the standard, and eventually for most
ineffectual, surgery and radiation. In particular, children with the most common type of ependymoma,
posterior fossa Group A (PFA1), relapse more frequently and experience more invasive, metastatic disease at
relapse. Thus, there is a critical need for more effective therapies to combat high-risk PFA1 tumors. Single-cell
RNAsequencing data suggest that the epigenetic silencing of LDOC1 within a specific subpopulation of tumor
cells has a profound, direct impact on the tumor biology of PFA1 tumors. The driving hypothesis is that
epigenetic silencing of LDOC1 with in the MEC subpopulation, as a result of chromatin remodeling, is the
molecular driver in PFA1 EPN, through upregulation of non-canoncial NF-B activation. To address this
hypothesis, the studies in aim one will determine the role of LDOC1 expression in EPN by examining 1) the
mechanism of gene silencing, 2) the functional role of loss of LDOC1 in vitro and in vivo, and 3) the genomic
transcriptional targets of LDOC1. Aim two is designed to 1) determine how LDOC1 regulates non-canoncial
NF-B signaling and 2) identify the functional consequences of the NF-B signaling pathway. The collective
proposed studies will define the effect of LDOC1 loss, which we hypothesize to be the molecular driver of
tumor biology of PFA1 EPN. These studies will significantly add to our understanding of childhood EPN and
have the potential to identify rational therapeutic targets for children with this high-risk, poor-outcome pediatric
brain tumor."

The Imaging and Response Assessment Core (IRAC) is a shared resource (SR) operated by the Department of
Radiology within the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). The IRAC facilitates research by
providing support services and analysis for both standard and novel imaging methods used for characterizing
tumor biology and predicting and monitoring response to therapy in patients enrolled in clinical trials performed
at the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC). To accomplish this, the IRAC provides a variety of services to investigators
including: 1) assistance with protocol development; 2) imaging-related regulatory services; 3) site qualification;
4) coordination of imaging examinations to ensure protocol compliance; 5) data transfer to trial sponsors or
external core laboratories; and 6) tumor measurements on both anatomical and functional imaging studies
performed by dedicated radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Additionally, the IRAC implements new
software tools to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor measurements and to allow for incorporation
of newer approaches of tumor measurement (for example, three-dimensional volumetric measurements and
metabolic tumor volume) into clinical trials at SCC.
 The overall goal of IRAC is to increase the impact that quantitative imaging plays in clinical cancer research.
The IRAC provides unique imaging management and analysis services that are not available elsewhere within
the WUSM. The SCC has a large portfolio of clinical trials that use computed tomography (CT), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), and the IRAC contributes to the overall
success of SCC trials by providing these imaging support services to investigators."

Research on neuronal primary cilia has largely focused on their role in the developing brain. However,
emerging research is beginning to reveal the role of primary cilia in the mature brain. Mature excitatory cortical
neurons contain a remarkably high concentration of a unique receptor, somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), and
previous in vitro work from the Turrigiano lab has shown that SSTR3-mediated signaling can regulate
postsynaptic strength and number of excitatory synapses onto excitatory pyramidal neurons. Because SST
release is likely correlated with network activity levels, this pathway may serve as a circuit-wide homeostatic
feedback loop that slowly adjusts the excitation/inhibition balance to stabilize activity. Here I propose to
determine the source of somatostatin (SST) responsible for this modulation, and the impact of this modulation
on network processing. I will focus on layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (L2/3 PNs) in primary visual cortex of
juvenile mice during the classic critical period, a time when these networks are especially plastic. I will use slice
electrophysiology and morphological analysis after SSTR3 knockdown to assess the postsynaptic strength and
number of synapses onto L2/3 PNs. While SST is known to be release by cortical SST+ interneurons, it
remains unclear whether SST ciliary signaling occurs via paracrine signaling or direct contact between SST+
axons and cilia. By manipulating SST release and production using genetic/optogenetic approaches, I will
determine the source of SST released, and whether the modulation of synaptic properties is bidirectional.
Finally, I will use an ethologically-relevant vision-dependent learning task (prey capture), in which mice learn to
capture crickets, to assess the impact of disrupted ciliary SST signaling on visual cortical activity and function.
These experiments will greatly extend our understanding of the role of neuronal primary ciliary signaling in
circuit wiring and stability. Furthermore, this fellowship will provide comprehensive training in cutting-edge
techniques for probing how network-wide homeostatic signaling pathways influence network properties and
activity within the mature brain."

Approximately 200,000 new cases of ovarian cancer (OC) occur per year, but overall survival has not
significantly changed for decades and novel therapies are urgently needed. High grade serous OC makes up
about 70% of cases. It is most commonly derived from the fallopian tube epithelium and is characterized by
nearly 100% mutant TP53 and high expression of transposable elements (TEs). Nearly half of our genome is
composed of TEs, and their transcription is tightly regulated during development. Select TEs are expressed at
high levels in embryonic stem cells, but most are silenced by DNA methylation and repressive histone
modifications in differentiated cells. As part of the global epigenetic dysregulation that cells undergo during
transformation from normal to cancer, TE silencing is compromised and TEs become transcribed. Recent
studies from our group and others have implicated TEs in control of innate immune signaling in OC. Our
studies in a cancer progression model show that LINE-1 elements lose methylation and are transcribed
specifically during cellular transformation rather than immortalization. LINE-1 is the only protein-coding TE
known to be able to retrotranspose, and LINE-1 is significantly overexpressed in OC. We showed that LINE-1
is expressed after P53 mutation in OC precursor lesions and that wild type and mutant P53 transcriptionally
regulate LINE-1 in OC cell lines. Finally, LINE-1 activation in the absence of P53 interferes with DNA
replication to activate the DNA damage response in cancer cells. We know that LINE-1 and other TEs become
activated during cancer progression but we do not understand how this occurs or the immune effects of this
activation. The objective of this application is thus to uncover the biological mechanisms by which epigenetic
dysregulation of LINE-1 changes the OC tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that by loss of epigenetic
regulation, LINE-1 contributes to OC immune evasion. We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims: 1)
Determine effects of LINE-1 expression on innate immune signaling, 2) Determine effects of LINE-1
retrotransposition on innate immune signaling, and 3) Determine how LINE-1 expression affects the OC
immune microenvironment. Using existing immortalized fallopian tube lines with wild type, mutant, and null
P53, we will transform the lines with the C-Myc oncogene. We will perform genome-wide characterization of
LINE elements during transformation and will assess effects of LINE-1 expression on the DNA damage
response and the tumor immune microenvironment. Taken together, the experiments described in this
proposal will add to our knowledge of epigenetic regulation and immune activity of an understudied 20% of our
genome, LINE-1 elements. These experiments will enable us to identify potential OC driving alterations and
vulnerabilities to novel immunotherapies."

Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer’s disease, but its
pathogenesis is poorly understood. Cerebral blood vessels undergo age-related degenerative changes resulting
in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and hypoperfusion, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
Pericytes (PC) are key components of the BBB whose behavior is regulated by extracellular matrix components
such as the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan. We hypothesize that age-related overexpression of
cerebrovascular perlecan, coupled with reduced proteolytic activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin
B, which processes perlecan into a neuroprotective laminin globular domain 3 (LG3) peptide, plays a
central pathological role in VaD, by reducing PC coverage of blood vessels, leading to diminished BBB
integrity. First, cerebral blood vessels in aged mice show increased perlecan expression that correlates with
BBB disruption and reduced PC coverage. Second, young mice exposed to chronic mild hypoxia (CMH; 8% O2
for 4 days) display similar increased perlecan expression that correlates closely with reduced PC coverage and
BBB disruption. Third, perlecan inhibits PC proliferation and migration in vitro, in keeping with similar effects
described for smooth muscle cells, in which inhibitory effects are lost with removal of heparan sulfate (HS) side
chains. Fourth, cerebrovascular perlecan expression chronically increased in the brain after ischemic stroke.
Fifth, perlecan is increased in conditions with abnormal brain vasculature including arteriovenous malformation.
Sixth, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficient mouse model of VaD display reduced PC coverage
and BBB damage; our preliminary data show these mice have increased brain perlecan and reduced cathepsin
B, with progression to VaD. Seventh, our preliminary data shows cathepsin B KO mice express significantly more
brain perlecan and less PC coverage, supporting the role of cathepsin B in perlecan processing and perlecan’s
role in PC coverage. Therefore, we hypothesize that the fully intact perlecan molecule and its LG3 fragment, as
regulated by cathepsin B proteolysis, have opposing deleterious and beneficial effects, respectively, on vascular
health and integrity in cerebrovascular diseases such as VaD. Specifically, we hypothesize that (i) in response
to aging +/- hypoxia or diminished eNOS, upregulation of cerebrovascular perlecan in association with
decreased cathepsin B activity, and thereby less LG3, leads to reduced PC coverage and BBB disruption,
culminating in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, and (ii) perlecan LG3 ‘replacement therapy’
may prevent or mitigate this process. To test this hypothesis we propose to: 1, Determine how age and sex
influence levels of full-length perlecan (and its HS modification), the LG3 fragment, and cathepsin B in the eNOS-
deficient and CMH mouse models of spontaneous VaD, 2, Define the molecular basis of the positive (integrin
binding sites) and negative (HS side chains) effects of perlecan and LG3 on PC behavior, and 3, Determine the
therapeutic potential of LG3 in the eNOS-deficient and CMH mouse models of spontaneous VaD."

Background: Transcriptional mechanisms that regulate epidermal homeostasis have
been well established but recently we have discovered that mRNA export mechanisms
play prominent roles in maintaining epidermal self-renewal. We have shown that RBM15
associates with the NXF1 exporter only in stem and progenitor cells while ZC3H18
associates with NXF1 in differentiated cells. This association allows RBM15 or ZC3H18
to control the mRNA export of key transcripts involved in epidermal growth and
differentiation.
Objective/hypothesis: This proposal seeks to understand the regulation of epidermal
stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation through post-transcriptional
mechanisms. We have identified RNA binding proteins that are necessary for the export
of self-renewal mRNAs to promote epidermal self-renewal. Similarly we have identified
RNA binding proteins that are necessary to export differentiation inducing mRNAs to
promote epidermal differentiation. Furthermore mutations in these proteins can lead to
clonal expansion of the skin due to altered regulation of epidermal growth and
differentiation.
Specific Aims: (1) To determine the role of RBM15 and ZC3H18 on epidermal growth
and differentiation. (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms of RBM15 and ZC3H18
wildtype and mutant proteins impact on epidermal homeostasis.
Study Design: To study epidermal homeostasis in a more clinically relevant setting, we
generate 3-dimensionally intact human skin, containing human epidermal cells (that
have been permanently knocked down for RBM15 or ZC3H18) in the context of human
dermal stroma and basement membrane, regenerated on immune compromised mice.
By using this model, we can perform loss of function experiments on RBM15 or ZC3H18
in regenerated human skin to characterize their role in epidermal growth and
differentiation. We will also use RNA immunoprecipitations followed by next generation
sequencing to determine the RNAs associated with these proteins."
10864013,"Heart disease and heart failure remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Adult
mammalian heart demonstrates limited regenerative potential. Numerous measures, such as stimulating
preexisting cardiomyocyte proliferation by activating cell cycle, have been attempted previously to induce
heart regeneration, although only modest effects have been achieved to date. Adult cardiomyocytes need to
undergo dedifferentiation first before proliferation, if not simultaneously. In fact, adult zebrafish heart
regeneration is accomplished through both dedifferentiation and proliferation. Chromatin state and
remodeling is often associated with numerous physiological or pathological processes including organ
development, aging, and cancer. However, it is unclear whether epigenetics dictates cardiomyocyte
proliferation capacity, or, whether harnessing epigenetics in adult cardiomyocytes stimulates proliferation.
Through a comparative transcriptomic analysis of murine embryonic day (E) 14.5 hearts (proliferation
active) and adult hearts (proliferation inert), we identified a number of chromatin remodeling factors
including histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) that are enriched in E14.5 hearts but missing in adult hearts.
HDAC7 belongs to Class II HDACs, which have specific tissue distributions and shuttle between the
nucleus and cytoplasm in response to signals. Studies have shown that knockout of HDAC7 compromises
vascular integrity during heart development, while overexpression of HDAC7 induces tumor growth and
epithelial proliferation. However, the potential role of HDAC7 in cardiomyocyte proliferation is undetermined.
In our preliminary studies, upon knocking down of HDAC7 in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes
(NMCMs), we found that cardiomyocyte proliferation was significantly decreased. By contrast,
overexpression of HDAC7 in NMCMs resulted in significant cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and increased
proliferation. Further, overexpression of HDAC7 in adult cardiomyocytes in vivo significantly induced
cardiomyocyte proliferation and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Based on these novel
and exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that HDAC7 is both necessary for cardiomyocyte
proliferation and sufficient to reactivate postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferative and regenerative
potentials. Three aims are proposed to test our central hypothesis. Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms
by which HDAC7 promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation; Aim 2: To determine whether HDAC7 is required for
cardiomyocyte proliferation; Aim 3: To test whether HDAC7 overexpression promotes adult cardiomyocyte
proliferation and improves heart function after myocardial injuries. We intend to achieve these goals by
using a synergistic approach of mouse genetics, developmental and molecular biology, and biochemistry.
Results of these experiments will establish a novel and rigorous therapeutic strategy for promoting heart
regeneration and pave a new path to effective heart repair in humans."

There is an emerging workforce crisis in the number of scientists entering translational research careers. This
shortage is occurring against the backdrop of increasing complexity in modern scientific research, where single
discipline research studies simply cannot answer the challenges that face modern medicine today. The ever-
growing complexity of 21st century translational science requires transdisciplinary (TD) team-based
research that integrates and extends beyond discipline-specific concepts, approaches, and methods to
accelerate the innovations that will solve complex real-world problems. The NCATS KL2 career development
program is a key initiative designed to maintain and expand the pipeline of innovative, collaborative and
productive clinical-translational scientists though implementation of customized individual development plans
(IDPs), TD mentoring, and individualized curricula. Our goal is to develop a cohort of TD scientists who have
the breadth and depth of skills necessary to navigate the critical future issues of health and disease in our
increasingly complex world. In our newly envisaged ConduITS career development program, we will focus on
training TD clinical translational research data scientists. The KL2 scholars will be trained in core competencies
including epidemiology, study design, biostatistics/data science, informatics, clinical trials, and
ethical/regulatory guidelines, as well as have broad exposure to the methodological steps of the translational
process from discovery to community engagement via innovation, life course research, and workforce
development. Moreover, we focus on training team-based clinical and translational researchers by leveraging
our rich research environment of large-scale clinical datasets, well-established cohorts and biobanks, such as
the BioMe Biobank and the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohort among other
big data resources. Our state of the art programs in genomics and exposomics, and strong community
engagement have helped Mount Sinai develop a number of highly innovative programs in drug discovery,
entrepreneurship, and team-building, bringing together biomedical research stakeholders that reflect scientific
expertise across the lifespan. Our workshops, short courses and advanced training seminars focus on strategic
areas, such as informatics, big data, workforce development, team science, and community engagement, as
well as academic skills including scientific writing, negotiation skills, conflict resolution, industry interactions,
federal grant preparation and management, and the promotion process. We also offer a mentor training
program aimed to teach mentors the skills that will help improve the mentoring experience, promote mentees’
growth and help build resilience and confidence. Furthermore, to provide our younger generation of scientists
networking opportunities, we are building an institutional K-Club of successful junior faculty with career
development grants, to serve as a communication hub for various career development activities. Finally, we
partner with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to promote a more diverse cohort of KL2 scholars."

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major test of the health care delivery system, disrupting primary and
mental health care to vulnerable children and threatening the financial stability of providers. In doing so, the
pandemic created an opportunity to examine where the delivery system is robust and where improvements and
alternative policy approaches should be considered. For children with pre-existing vulnerabilities these
disruptions, in the face of increased risks from social isolation and economic stressors, are particularly
concerning. How health systems recover and respond to the needs of the most vulnerable speaks to the
structure of safety net systems and the policies that support them. The proposed study examines multiple
vulnerable and at-risk child populations in safety net systems – children with emotional disorders, children who
experienced prior abuse, children in foster care, homeless children, children who identify as LGBTQ+, and
those who are make Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC).
The proposed study uses electronic health record data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network
which represents more than 500,000 children treated annually at safety net, community health centers. This
unique clinic network cares for largely uninsured and publicly insured children in 30 states. In addition, the
study also uses Medicaid data in 3 of the largest study states to examine additional primary and mental health
care outcomes. The aims of the study are to examine changes in primary and mental health care to vulnerable
children through the pandemic, transition and recovery periods, to examine health inequities in care over time,
and to uncover clinic, community, and payment policy drivers in safety net performance, in order to inform a
multi-pronged, corrective policy response to redress gaps."

The
functional interaction between the opioid and the eCB system at the level of neurochemical, neuroanatomical
and molecular pathways. Our preliminary results find that indirectly enhancing levels of the endocannabinoid 2-
AG levels through pharmacological inhibition of its catabolic enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL),
attenuates the rewarding effects of morphine, while maintaining its analgesic effects. In this proposal we will
dissect at a circuit, synaptic and molecular level how elevated 2-AG attenuates opioid reward.
 Recent studies have underscored the role of local GABAergic neuronal inputs from the rostromedial
tegmental nucleus (RMTg) in regulating the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key dopaminergic brain region
involved in opioid reward. Opioids are thought to act by disinhibiting RMTg inhibition onto VTA dopamine neurons
by activating presynaptic mu opioid receptors (MOR), subsequently increasing dopamine cell firing and nucleus
accumbens (NAc) activity that drives reward. However, little is known about how cannabinoid receptors (CB1R)
and MORs signal and crosstalk at these key synapses. Aim 1 will examine 2-AG mechanisms in the VTA on
opioid reward behavior and its effect on NAc dynamics. Aim 2 will examine the role of CB1R and MOR in the
RMTg→VTA projection on opioid reward behavior and NAc dynamics. Aim 3 will examine synaptic and molecular
mechanisms of CB1R and MOR crosstalk to determine how enhancing 2-AG levels leads to blunted opioid
reward."

studies along with advancing the science and understanding of the food allergy syndrome related to alpha-gal.
These goals will be pursued via the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Establish infrastructure for the VUMC CoFAR CRC, which is capable of rapidly implementing
and executing single site and multi-center clinical trials, with high quality and fidelity, focused on the prevention
and management of patients with food allergy, supplemented by studies to better elucidate the mechanisms
underlying food allergies and, in particular, alpha-gal syndrome. This CRC will serve as an opportunity for New

comparative effectiveness of early peanut introduction with once weekly peanut feeding (low weekly peanut
protein dose, 2 gm) versus thrice weekly peanut feedings (standard weekly peanut protein dose, 6 gm) in the
prevention of peanut allergy in at risk infants.

10863853,"Exposure to life stressors across development is known to increase the likelihood of adolescent substance
misuse, but the few available comparisons of Black and White youth have revealed a paradox. Whereas Black
youth are more likely than White youth to experience stressors in the form of socioeconomic disadvantage,
traumatic events, and discrimination, often within a context of structural racism, studies show they have lower
rates of nearly all types of substance misuse. This paradox could have health consequences, for example, by
contributing to stigma among Black individuals who do struggle with substance misuse, because the adverse
consequences of substance misuse, once initiated, are more severe for Blacks than Whites. However,
significant gaps in knowledge exist and will be addressed in the proposed study. Little is known about how the
different types, timing, and trajectories of stress exposures, including those associated with the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, may differentially predict substance misuse for Black and White youth (Aim 1), and
potentially through different mediating mechanisms (Aim 2), including parenting, neurocognitive functioning,
and psychopathology. Also, it is important to understand the resilience-promoting protective factors that may
be stronger buffers against stressor-related risk for substance misuse for Blacks than Whites (Aim 3). This
application proposes to extend the ongoing CANDLE (Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and
Learning in Early Childhood) study. CANDLE is a longitudinal cohort study involving 1,136 women recruited
from 2006-2011 in Shelby County/Memphis, TN during their second trimesters of pregnancy, and has followed
them and their children upon birth throughout childhood. The sample is 60% Black and 34% White, with the
small balance reflecting other racial/ethnic minority groups. Extensive multi-method data have been collected
during the prenatal period and through childhood up to age 8 years. A clinic visit with dyads at child age 10 is
nearing completion and another funded clinic visit at age 12 is underway. The proposed research will collect
new data in adolescence at ages 14, 15, and 16 years to examine life stressors in relation to the onset and
progression of substance misuse for Black compared to White youth, with tests of differences as well as
similarities in mediating pathways and resilience factors. Sex differences also will be explored. A local advisory
board of Black community members and advocates has already been formed and will help guide this study.
Guided by the minority stress model and stress-coping theories of addiction, the central hypotheses are that,
despite a Black-White paradox, different patterns of life stress exposures will predict substance misuse for both
Black and White youth, operating through selected group-specific mediating mechanisms; based on resiliency
theory, Black youth also are expected to display certain unique patterns of resilience against substance
misuse. CANDLE is one-of-a-kind, and the current aims hold promise for informing tailored preventive efforts."
10861585,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a universally lethal form of brain cancer that affects
both children and adults, with most patients passing away within 1 year of diagnosis following standard of care
radiation therapy. Not a single drug has been FDA approved despite a multitude of clinical trials, with most agents
tested not designed specifically for this disease. This highlights the need for identification of therapeutic targets
directly linked to the pathogenic mechanism in DMGs. The hallmark of DMGs are dominant negative mutations
in histone H3, a key structural and regulatory constituent of the chromatin structure in which DNA is packaged.
Mutant H3 drives tumorigenesis by promoting transcriptionally silent chromatin at specific tumor suppressor
genes including CDKN2A. How transcription is silenced at these genomic sites is poorly understood and is a key
knowledge gap in the field. Our preliminary data implicates a mechanism in which mutant H3 induces silent
chromatin at tumor suppressor genes by hijacking the activity of a specific configuration of the polycomb
repressive complex 1 (PRC1). PRC1 is an epigenetic silencing complex with numerous protein subunits which
can adopt highly heterogeneous configurations (>150 combinations), making it particularly challenging to study.
Leveraging pooled CRISPR screens integrated with quantitative proteomics, we have implicated a PRC1
complex containing chromobox 4 (CBX4-PRC1) as the mediator of inappropriate transcriptional silencing in
DMGs. Our central hypothesis is that CBX4-PRC1 is co-opted in DMGs to drive tumor growth by transcriptionally
repressing tumor suppressor genes including CDKN2A. The goal of this proposal is to define CBX4-PRC1 as
the functional configuration which mediates inappropriate transcriptional silencing in DMGs and determine
whether targeting CBX4 can be combined with standard of care radiation treatment in DMG models. We will
leverage our strong preliminary data, multi-disciplinary team, and novel patient-derived DMG models to test our
hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Define the functionally essential PRC1 complex configuration in DMGs.
2) Elucidate the role of CBX4 in PRC1 chromatin recruitment and silencing function in DMGs. 3) Evaluate the
therapeutic potential of targeting CBX4 in conjunction with standard of care radiation therapy in DMGs. This
proposal will lay the mechanistic framework for CBX4 as a novel therapeutic target in DMGs, a currently incurable
brain cancer. We will reveal the specific mechanism by which mutant H3 promotes inappropriate transcriptional
silencing to drive DMG growth and determine the relevance of this mechanism across DMG subtypes to guide
patient selection in the future."
10861315,"This proposal will determine the morphological, molecular, and functional mechanisms on
how the cochlear aqueduct (CA) changes over the lifespan. This will be the first histological
and molecular characterization of the cochlear aqueduct over the lifespan of CBA/CaJ mice.
Aim 1: A complete characterization of passage of tracers, spheres, or immune cells through the
CA with increasing age is lacking and therefore this information is needed for the future
development of using the cochlear aqueduct as a point of entry to the cochlea for rescue strategies
for the inner ear. The route used to deliver these substances will be through the CA by injecting
into the CSF in the cisternae magna. Experiments are designed to determine the relative
distribution of tracers throughout the cochlea by using Gadovist and contrast-enhanced MR
imaging at different ages. The highest resolution of pre-clinical MRI (a 9.4 T Bruker machine) will
be used for cochlear fluid imaging in living animals. The study will determine the size limitations
of passage through the barrier membrane (located at the cochlear end of the aqueduct) and if it
changes with increasing age. To determine the accessibility of microspheres (0.2-2µm), which is
a new technology that can deliver drugs, stem cells, and other therapeutics, histological
investigations will be performed after they are injected into the cisterna magnum and then
histologically quantified. We have found macrophages and lymphoid markers in the CA and we
hypothesize that the CA could be a source of immune cells that enter the cochlea. We will inject
GFP-labelled CX3CR1 monocytes isolated from Cx3cr1CreER-Eyfp/wt mice available in our facility,
into the cisternae magnum before or after a PTS-inducing noise exposure (110 dB, 2h, 6-12 kHz
in awake animals) known to trigger inflammatory processes in the cochlea and evaluate by
histology whether these cells delivered in the CSF have been populating the cochlea in greater
abundance than in sham exposed animals. Aim 2: A complete characterization of the cellular
identity of the tissue surrounding the CA is needed to better understand its role as a cochlear gate
keeper. Laser capture microdissection coupled with next generation sequencing (LCM- Smart-
seq3) developed at the Karolinska Institute and will determine the molecular composition and the
cellular identify of the inner tissue layer. This unique work will establish a morphological,
physiological, and molecular characterization of the CA. Knowledge will be generated regarding
how the influx of fluids from the CA aqueduct is regulated during the lifespan. The results from this
project will establish a fundamental basis for understanding the CA as a passage route to and
from the cochlea and its use for pre-clinical delivery strategies to treat cochlear disorders."

Our sense of smell depends on our ability to detect and discriminate a vast array of odor molecules. In
vertebrates, odors are predominantly detected by odorant receptors (ORs), which are G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) in vertebrates. The human genome encodes ~400 ORs, providing our olfactory system
with the ability to detect diverse odorants. Despite incredible advances in our understanding of GPCR function,
the fundamental molecular logic of odorant recognition by ORs remains elusive. It is unclear why closely
related ORs can have distinct odorant preferences, or why some ORs respond to a small subset of odorants
while others are more broadly responsive. Moreover, the process by which an odorant turns an OR “on” is not
well understood. Recently, our collaborative team determined the first experimental structure of a vertebrate
OR, the human receptor OR51E2, which provided critical insights into molecular recognition and OR activation.
Building on this advance, we will address three fundamental aspects of odorant receptor biology: 1) Identify
OR features that are responsible for odorant selectivity, 2) Reveal distinctions in odorant recognition by Class I
and Class II ORs, and 3) Describe the fundamental mechanisms for how odorants activate ORs. Towards this
end, we will combine structure determination with iterative mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics
simulations, thereby providing direct insight into the molecular logic of odorant recognition and OR activation.
The proposed studies will provide fundamental insights into the structure and dynamics of OR function and
yield inroads into an atomic framework for understanding our sense of smell."

Myocardial fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the myocardium
and has been identified as one of the main determinants of age related cardiac remodeling. This
can manifest as either increased diffuse interstitial fibrosis or focal fibrosis as a scar and lead to
cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis characterized by infiltration of the
myocardium by misfolded transthyretin protein, on the other hand, has emerged as an important
cause of accelerated remodeling leading to heart failure and CVD, and predisposing to frailty and
dementia. Importantly, novel FDA approved therapies (tafamidis, inotersen) may allow treatment
of cardiac amyloidosis highlighting the need for early detection. We expect this study to establish
the pivotal importance of quantifying fibrosis and amyloidosis at the population level to facilitate
clinical detection and orient the development of novel strategies to prevent heart failure, atrial
fibrillation and complications of CVD in older adults. Therefore, our specific aims are: Aim 1a)
determine the cross-sectional associations of presence as well as extent of amyloidosis measured
by Tc-PYP, with extent of myocardial fibrosis measured by MRI T1 mapping at MESA Exam 7.
1b) determine cross-sectional associations of presence and extent of amyloidosis as well as
fibrosis, with magnitude of cardiac remodeling defined as structural and functional alterations of
the left and right heart chambers by cine MRI at MESA Exam 7.1c) construct prediction models
for presence as well as for extent of both cardiac amyloidosis and progressive fibrosis at Exam 7,
by combining risk factor exposure and subclinical disease trajectories based on phenotypes
obtained from all MESA Exams (1-6) prior to Exam 7. In Aim 2a) we will compare the magnitude
of ECV change between MESA Exams 5 and 7 in the absence versus presence, as well as extent
of amyloidosis measured at Exam 7. 2b) compare the magnitude of 12-14 year changes in 4
chamber cardiac remodeling attributed to amyloidosis versus those attributed to progressive
fibrosis. 2c) construct longitudinal predictive models of 12-14 year change in ECV attributed to
amyloidosis versus ECV changes attributed to progressive fibrosis, using all phenotypic variables
obtained from MESA Exams 1 through 5. We propose to use data acquired during 2010-2012 in
800 individuals (400 men and 400 women) as part of the MESA 5 exam. As part of this proposal,
all participants will undergo a repeat MRI exam and Tc-99m-PYP at Exam 7. This study leverages
the already acquired MESA phenotypic data to predict amyloidosis and malignant progressive
fibrosis leading to adverse remodeling, CVD, frailty and dementia."

There are two, partially overlapping goals of this research: (1) comprehensively define the array of G protein-
coupled neuropeptide receptors that act to modulate and mediate acute actions of ethanol in vivo. (2)
investigate the impact of specific behavioral states on acute sensitivity to ethanol. We will characterize the
roles of all neuropeptide receptors in C. elegans in basal locomotion behaviors and ethanol-induced behavioral
effects. This comprehensive assessment will identify receptors that positively and negatively regulate the
neuronal circuit that controls locomotion and those receptors that act to promote or negatively regulate ethanol
actions. We will assess both the level of initial sensitivity to ethanol and the time-dependent development of
acute functional tolerance to the drug. In addition, for those receptors that act to modify responses to ethanol,
we will classify any interactions with the neuropeptidase nep-2, which is orthologous to the mammalian
neprilysin protein. The mammalian neprilysin protein is involved in the regulation of levels of multiple important
signaling peptides, including enkephalins, tachykinin, substance P and others. A mutation in the nep-2 gene
produces an ethanol-resistant behavioral phenotype. We hypothesize that a peptide target of NEP-2, which is
likely to be elevated in a nep-2 mutant background, acts to counteract acute effects of ethanol via increased
signaling through a neuropeptide receptor. The proposed experiments will identify that receptor and test the
hypothesis that the receptor acts in a defined neuronal circuit that controls behavioral state decisions. Our
preliminary data has identified several mutants that affect both ethanol responses and a behavioral state
decision that affects exploratory behavior. The circuit that regulates that decision is well defined, and includes
the sites of action of neuropeptides and serotonin. We will define networks of genes that act to regulate that
behavioral decision and ethanol responses, and test specific neurons in the controlling circuit for their role in
regulating ethanol responses. The relationship between an emotional (or affective) state in humans and the
problematic use of drugs of abuse is of significant interest. The successful outcome of this proposed research
will provide a better understanding of how specific behavioral states, controlled by a known regulatory circuit,
can impact the acute responses to an abused drug. There is a significant correlation between the level of an
individual’s initial response to alcohol and their likelihood to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Genetic
variation in any of the human orthologs of the C. elegans genes identified in this study has the potential to alter
an individual’s level of response to ethanol, and therefore could impact that individual’s predisposition to
develop an AUD later in life."

Delayed-type drug hypersensitivity reactions (dtDHR) are a major yet underappreciated public health problem,
occurring commonly in skin-limited form, morbilliform drug eruption (MDE), and causing significant morbidity
and mortality in severe systemic forms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). dtDHR are significantly understudied.
Consequently, understanding of immunopathogenesis has been limited, and subsequent to that, so too
clinical care. Two major clinical limitations are the lack of a reliable laboratory test to identify culprit drug and
an inability to accurately screen patients to prevent dtDHR. Our recent work in identifying T cell subsets
mediating disease employed novel technologies to overcome research barriers in dtDHR and in-so-doing
made several critical observations that, along with supporting publications by others, leads directly to this
proposal. Herein, we propose the overarching, potentially transformative hypothesis that clonal
repertoire analysis of skin could serve as a readout to identify culprit drug in dtDHR and to screen
patients prior to drug administration to prevent dtDHR. Importantly, while this proposal has major
implications for clinical care, it is purposefully designed to interrogate clonal repertoire and mechanisms of
pathogenic T cell activation both broadly and mechanistically through innovative translational research as a
critical next step. To achieve its goals, this grant builds on ample preliminary data and uniquely available
patient populations along with the highly complementary expertise of its investigators to ensure feasibility and
scientific rigor through three related but independent aims. First, it aims to interrogate clonal repertoire during
active dtDHR using (i) T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing (seq) + single cell RNA seq on prospectively
collected skin and blood and (ii) high-throughput TCR beta (HT-TCRb) sequencing on retrospectively obtained
skin samples, from SJS/TEN, DRESS, MDE and healthy controls. Sample size allows breadth and depth
across patient HLA alleles and culprit drugs. Second, it aims to investigate the temporality in vivo and
reactivity ex vivo of pathogenic T cell clones. Specifically, using HT-TCRb sequencing, it tests whether drug-
reactive T cells persist in skin and blood after disease resolution and/or pre-exist in skin prior to drug
exposure. Study populations include patient cohorts and drug-tolerant controls. Third, it aims to identify the
antigen specificity of pathogenic T cells in dtDHR by assaying in vivo the immunopeptidome with subsequent
ex vivo mechanistic experimentation. In sum, this work has potential to profoundly impact the fields of dtDHR
and more broadly adaptive immunity by generating incredible insight into in vivo mechanisms of antigen
presentation and T cell activation, and concurrently clinical care by advancing toward development of much-
needed diagnostic tests."

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a human disease characterized by the formation of bilateral vestibular
Schwannomas (resulting in deafness) and other tumors, is caused by loss of the tumor suppressor
protein Merlin. Studies using the fruit fly Drosophila and subsequently confirmed in mammalian systems
indicate that Merlin is an upstream component of the Hippo pathway, a conserved signal transduction
pathway that regulates tissue growth. Mutations in Merlin and other Hippo pathway components are
believed to cause tumors because they cause activation of an oncogenic protein Yorkie/YAP and
increased expression of growth promoting genes. Identifying specific proteins and signal transduction
pathways with which Merlin interacts is especially important because these partners may act as genetic
modifiers of NF2 disease phenotypes and provide potential targets for therapeutic agents.
We seek to understand how Merlin and the other HSW components are organized into a signaling
complex at the cell cortex and how the activity of this complex is controlled. We have shown that Merlin
and its binding partner Kibra nucleate formation of a signaling complex at a site separate from
intercellular junctions, and thus that these proteins can function in parallel to another upstream
regulator, Expanded. We also have shown that as these proteins assemble a signaling complex, they
recruit an E3-ligase complex that degrades Kibra and represses signaling in a negative feedback loop.
In the next funding period, we propose that Kibra degradation is promoted by mechanical tension and
that this is one mechanism by which tension controls tissue growth. We also plan to test a model we
propose in which Kibra and Merlin are recruited to the junctional cortex in an inactive state by the apical
polarity protein aPKC in opposition to medial actomyosin networks which facilitate medial accumulation
and activation of these proteins. To explore these novel hypotheses, we have developed tools and
techniques that allow us to examine the localization and dynamics of Hippo pathway proteins
expressed at endogenous levels in living tissues. Using with the exquisite genetic tools available in
Drosophila, we can now elucidate the role of each pathway component in assembling and activating the
Hippo pathway. These experiments are expected to provide insights into NF2, tumor suppression in
general, and the role of actomyosin dynamics in regulating signaling processes. Finally, these studies
should contribute to work on the mechanisms by which cellular interactions function to control tissue
growth and determine cell fate during development and regeneration."

Suicide is a leading cause of global mortality and rising suicide rates have been particularly steep in the United
States. Accordingly, NIMH is investing heavily in prevention, including calls for improved precision care—
interventions delivered based on specific, granular understanding of person-level vulnerabilities and their
interaction with local environments. Although stress, a well-established concurrent and prospective risk factor
for suicidal ideation (SI), is experienced by all, it varies at both group- (e.g., discrimination, local events) and
person- (e.g., arguments, accidents) levels in timing, frequency, and experience. Thus, there is a significant need
to improve the accuracy in detailing the stressful events – SI relationship, as well as elucidate person-level
markers that increase vulnerability to this association. Tonic (trait-like) and phasic (state) impulsivity (IMP) and
emotion dysregulation (ED) are well-established predispositions for suicide risk. IMP and ED alone are
insufficient markers of SI risk, yet each may increase risk for SI in the context of stressful life events. Their joint
effects may also potentiate the relationship between changes in person-level stress and risk for momentary SI;
however, this has yet to be tested, leaving little known about person-level, moment-to-moment SI prediction. The
overarching objective of this research is to specify person-level conditions that portend imminent SI, information
that has the potential to inform the development of effective just-in-time interventions, consistent with precision
care objectives of the NIMH Strategic Plan. This research will: (1) evaluate the direct effect of real-time stressful
events on concurrent and prospective momentary SI, (2) evaluate the moderating effects of tonic (trait-like) and
phasic (state) IMP and ED on the prospective relationship between real-time stressful events and momentary
SI, and (3) explore the propensity to experience SI in response to prior stress as a potential moderator of the

The gut microbiome plays a significant role in immune function, infection resistance, cognitive function,
metabolism, and growth. The first year of life is a critical period for the development of a healthy and diverse gut
microbiome. Enteropathogen infection and heavy metal exposures have also been associated with measurable
changes in gut microbiome composition - a primary route of exposure being consumption of contaminated
drinking water. While we know that gut microbiome composition is heavily influenced by early environmental
exposures such as mode of delivery and diet, there are key gaps in our understanding of the impact of other
environmental exposures, specifically drinking water, on the developing gut microbiome. I hypothesize that
drinking water quality, and associated factors such as reliability and access, is associated with gut microbiome
composition during the first year of life. Access to a safely managed water supply is critical for health and well-
being. Interventions to improve drinking water access and quality often fall short of achieving measurable health
gains, possibly because the intervention fails to effectively reduce contamination and sustainably increase
access. Comprehensive, reliable estimates of exposure are necessary to understand why an intervention
achieved – or failed to achieve - expected health gains, but reliable estimates of exposure are rarely used in
practice. Specific Aim 1 in this proposal aims to address this gap by comprehensively evaluating whether or not
a large-scale intervention (i.e., the provision of an improved piped water network) is effective in reducing
microbial and toxicological contamination and increasing water access. Results from this aim will improve our
understanding of the overall impact of a community-wide intervention on drinking water quality and access.
Specific Aim 2 will assess whether a large-scale water intervention is associated with differences in child gut
microbiome composition. This aim will fill knowledge gaps on the health effects of a large-scale water intervention
in low-income settings, which are sorely needed to improve child health. Specific Aim 3 provides the first
opportunity to assess whether drinking water quality, an important but overlooked environmental exposure in gut
microbiome research, is associated with gut microbiome composition among children. Since harms to the gut
influence health outcomes in addition to diarrhea, such as growth and metabolic function, investigating the
influence of drinking water quality on gut microbiome composition allows us to assess the total effects of water
quality on gut health. Results from this aim will provide insight into the relationship between water quality and
the gut microbiome, which is critical for understanding both acute and chronic health outcomes associated with
early perturbations to the gut."

Histone proteins are crucial for regulating gene expression and accessibility to genomic DNA. Mutations in genes
encoding histones cause abnormal gene expression, disrupt DNA compaction, and even result in disease, such
as neurological disorders or cancer. Many of these mutations alter residues that are sites of extensive post
translational modification, including acetylation and methylation. One of the first histone mutants identified is
histone H3K36M, which is implicated in driving various cancers. Elucidating the molecular basis for abnormal
growth caused by H3K36M will shed light on key biological functions of histone proteins. Histone proteins are
highly conserved, supporting the use of model systems to explore histone function. For example, budding yeast
and human histone H3 proteins share 97% sequence identity. Studies in budding yeast have revealed that
H3K36 mutants show sensitivity to a number of drugs that perturb different cellular pathways. A budding yeast
high copy suppressor screen was previously performed to identify proteins that suppress drug-sensitive growth
defects in H3K36 mutant cells. One candidate suppressor identified in the screen is Esa1/Tip60, which is the
catalytic component of the NuA4 lysine acetyl transferase complex. This complex targets lysines within the N-
terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A, though Esa1/Tip60 also has non-histone targets. The NuA4 complex is
recruited to nucleosomes via methylation at H3K36, particularly in the presence of DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs), in both yeast and humans. Both H3K36 methylation and H4 tail acetylation play roles in DSB repair.
Thus, I hypothesize that Esa1/Tip60 promotes normal growth in H3K36 mutant cells through
compensating for H4 tail acetylation and that Esa1/Tip60 inhibition in H3K36 mutant cells could severely
impair growth. I will test this hypothesis through three aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of Esa1-mediated
suppression, by examining whether there is a specific requirement for the catalytic subunit of NuA4, Esa1,
compared to other lysine acetyl transferases and whether the lysines present in the H4 histone tail are critical
for this Esa1-mediated suppression. The functional impact of Esa1 overexpression on the transcriptome in these
mutants will also be analyzed; 2) Examine the consequence of Tip60 inhibition in H3K36M-expressing human
cells on DNA repair and growth properties; and 3) Initiate characterization of a different histone variant, which
disrupts growth and is implicated in human disease, by performing a new high copy suppressor screen of
H3G34V mutants to identify suppressors related to DSB repair. Characterizing the molecular basis of these
disease-implicated histone mutations will enhance the understanding of fundamental chromatin processes. This
work will also establish a paradigm of investigating current and future histone variants via rapid discovery in
budding yeast and then translating findings to a human system. As a training fellowship, the proposed work will
provide a thorough training in yeast as a model system and novel technical approaches. The environment of co-
sponsors with complementing expertise is ideal for the successful completion of this project."

Heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the United States and in the developed world.
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) in particular is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in both young
people and athletes, remains difficult to diagnose, and has no currently effective treatments. ACM is termed a
disease of the desmosome, a cell-cell junctional protein complex critical to cardiomyocyte adhesion, as 40-50%
of underlying genetic mutations known to be pathologic for ACM affect a core desmosomal gene component.
Importantly, the loss or reduction of any singular desmosomal protein component at the intercalated disc is
associated with a “domino effect,” where adjacent desmosomal protein expression is lost, compromising cellular
attachment and gap junction electrical conductivity in the heart. Our hypothesis is that the dysregulation of
desmosomal protein content homeostasis is directly correlated to ACM disease progression and can be
leveraged to identify viable therapeutic targets which could be translated into patient care. Here I will employ
both molecular and theoretical approaches to screen for differential transcriptomics and proteomics related to
reduction and loss of the core desmosomal component plakophilin-2 (PKP2). In addition to these unbiased
approaches, I will leverage human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and mouse models of PKP2-mutant ACM
to characterize candidate regulatory pathways of disease progression. These models each contain distinct splice
acceptor site mutations, and have displayed sufficiency to recapitulate disease phenotypes, providing first-of-
their-kind platforms to address how RNA alternative splicing and post-transcriptional dysregulation may drive
ACM. We further show preliminary studies demonstrating that gene therapy reintroduction of the gap junction
protein connexin-43 (Cx43) rescues both early- and late- stage disease phenotypes in spite of the continued
absence of the desmosomal core component desmoplakin. Here I will assess whether Cx43 itself may serve as
a master regulator of desmosome protein content at the intercalated disc by applying Cx43 gene therapy in the
novel context of PKP2 loss, and characterize the broad applicability of this therapeutic approach. My goal for
this project is to provide a comprehensive characterization of desmosomal protein regulation across
multiple platforms, leveraging predictive systems-level computational molecular models and state-of-
the-art RNA binding protein pull-down techniques to identify essential mediators in this signaling
network, while assessing the efficacy of Cx43 candidate gene therapy in ACM rescue using
physiologically relevant tissue engineered models of human disease and in mice, to establish a
generalizable mechanistic model to treat the array of ACM disease presentations in the clinic.
Understanding common regulatory pathways controlling desmosomal protein expression at the intercalated disc
could be critical to preventing, mitigating, and treating ACM in humans."

When making a decision we can use our understanding of available action-outcome relationships to prospectively
evaluate the consequences of our potential actions and choose the one that is currently most beneficial. This goal-
directed strategy is, thus, quite flexible, allowing us to readily adapt when circumstances change. For example,
when ordering dinner, you consider how nutritious and delicious each potential meal will be and will avoid options
that you’ve just had for lunch or do not meet your current nutritional needs. But we don’t always think about the
consequences of our behavior. Usually this is fine. Such habits are a way for our brain to efficiently execute routine
behaviors. But disrupted goal-directed learning and overreliance on habit can cause inadequate consideration of
consequences, inflexibility, a lower threshold for compulsivity, and disrupted decision making. This can contribute
to aspects of numerous diseases, including substance use disorder (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder,
obesity, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism. Chronic stress can attenuate goal-directed learning and
tip the balance of behavioral control towards habit. This is one major avenue through which chronic stress can
predispose one to SUD and other mental illnesses. But we know very little of how chronic stress promotes habit
formation. The overarching goal of this proposal is, thus, to expose the neuronal circuits through which chronic
stress promotes premature habit formation. This work will help us to understand how chronic stress can promote
maladaptive and pathological habits, which will be critical for understanding and treating SUD and mental illness.
Filling this gap is especially important because chronic stress contributes to mental health disparities in the US.
 Recent evidence from our team has suggested that central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala projections
to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) may be critical conduits for stress-potentiated habit. Based on prior and our
preliminary data, our novel, comparative hypothesis is that BLADMS and CeADMS promote and oppose,
respectively, goal-directed learning and associated neuronal activity in the DMS and that chronic stress amplifies
CeADMS and attenuates BLADMS pathway activity to promote premature habit formation. We will test this
with a multifaceted approach including projection-specific optical neuronal activity monitoring and manipulation,
cell-type specific, cellular resolution, microendoscopic calcium imaging with pathway-specific chemogenetic
manipulations, a model of chronic stress, and theory-driven behavioral tools. We will expose how ensembles of
DMS neurons organize their activity during goal-directed and habit learning and how this is impacted by chronic
stress. We will reveal the functions of two understudied amygdala-striatal pathways in goal-directed and habit
learning and how they are influenced by chronic stress. More broadly, we will uncover neuronal circuitry through
which chronic stress promotes habit formation. This will provide a critical basic science foundation for our long-
term goal of understanding of how chronic stress is a conduit to pathological habits."

Current U.S. predoctoral graduate education is not designed to train researchers how to communicate
research results to nonacademic audiences. Population Reference Bureau (PRB) addresses this gap with its
U.S. policy communication training program, preparing current Ph.D. students to present findings in ways that
are understandable and accessible to policy audiences, including decisionmakers, advocates, and the media.
The program's main goal is to expand the cadre of U.S. population research professionals committed to policy
communication. The program's objectives are to: (1) Address barriers that researchers face in communicating
population-related research results to policy audiences; (2) Engage a diverse group of predoctoral students
(future population professionals) in policy communication over their careers; (3) Teach population scientists
about: the process by which research informs the policy environment, how to identify and communicate the
policy implications of their research, and various tools/skills for communicating findings to U.S. policy
audiences.
To achieve these objectives, PRB will select annually 12 U.S. predoctoral students who apply on a competitive
basis to participate in a three-part training program consisting of: (1) virtual orientation and introduction to the
U.S. policy process; (2) summer workshop; (3) virtual writing and social media instruction and writing
assignments during the academic year. Only students with findings to use in the program's writing and
presentation exercises will be selected to participate. The summer workshop includes exercises in writing and
presenting, giving participants experience in using their own research findings as the basis for building
communication skills. Participants also meet in small working groups led by PRB staff or accomplished training
program graduates, where they discuss their research and develop a presentation for a policy audience.
To increase diversity of the training cadre, PRB proposes revising participants' eligibility criteria to include U.S.
predoctoral students studying in accredited departments that are not institutional members of the Association
of Population Centers. This change will allow us to prepare a more diverse pool of trainees pursuing research
relevant to the mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, Population Dynamics Branch, to effectively translate research into understandable, policy-
relevant messages. Based on program graduates' early outputs, we expect this R-25 application will contribute
significantly to expanding access to and use of understandable and useful information on key demographic,
reproductive health, and population health issues to inform U.S. and global social policy."

 Dr. Al-Balas is a clinical investigator with a research focus on hemodialysis vascular access. This award
will provide Dr. Al-Balas the support necessary to become skilled in patient-oriented clinical research on
individuals with hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction. To achieve these goals Dr. Al-Balas has assembled
a team of mentors with a wealth of research experience and a track-record in mentoring junior investigators.
When this is combined with the exceptional resources, institutional support, and the proposed career
development activities, Dr. Al-Balas will be well positioned to achieve his long-term goal.
 Surgically created arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), the current gold standard technique for establishing a
channel between an artery and vein for hemodialysis (HD), are associated with several problems, including a
high rate of non-maturation, a frequent requirement for a second procedure prior to successful use (assisted
maturation), and frequent interventions to maintain AVF patency after maturation. An endovascular AVF (endo-
AVF) creation is a novel and promising non-surgical approach that became available in the U.S. in 2019.
Uncontrolled pilot studies with endo-AVFs suggest that their clinical outcomes are superior to those obtained
with the standard surgical AVF creation, but head-to-head comparisons are lacking.
 The potential advantages of endo-AVFs can be definitively addressed only by a randomized clinical trial
(RCT) comparing endo-AVFs to surgical AVFs in terms of physiological maturation, clinical maturation, overall
survival, frequency of procedures and cost. The goal of our study is to establish a solid foundation for such an
RCT. First, we will compare the two UAB cohorts in term of short term AVF outcomes (physiological maturation
at 6 weeks and clinical maturation at 6 months) and long-term vascular access outcomes (secondary patency
and frequency of interventions after maturation), and costs of access management. This analysis will also
provide critical information required to perform the necessary power calculations for an RCT. Second, we will
pilot an RCT of endo-AVFs vs surgical AVFs, to determine the feasibility of patient recruitment, randomization,
and retention at UAB. Finally, we will utilize the USRDS database to compare the outcomes of endo-AVFs and
surgical AVFs in a national cohort, and to calculate the overall cost of access management with each technique.
 My ultimate goal is to become an independent patient-oriented clinical investigator. A K23 mentored
career development award will provide me protected time critical to complete the research project outlined in this
proposal and gain more expertise in research methods through formal training, including completing a Masters
in Science in Public Health. The current proposal will provide critical data that will form the foundation for a future
independent research grant. My long-term objective is to develop optimal vascular access strategies to reduce
vascular access complications and their costs in hemodialysis patients."

Phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, playing fundamental roles in bone mineralization, cell signaling, and energy
metabolism. However, how Pi levels are detected is unknown, representing a significant gap in knowledge in
human biology. The bone-derived hormone FGF23 responds to elevated Pi by reducing kidney Pi reabsorption
and 1,25(OH)2D production, but Pi does not directly stimulate bone FGF23 production and the intermediate
steps between Pi excess and FGF23 synthesis have remained obscure. Recently, we identified a kidney-to-
bone signaling axis whereby kidney-derived glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), a byproduct of glycolysis, circulates
to bone and triggers FGF23 production. In preliminary data, we find that Pi administration (in fed mice) triggers
an acute increase in glycolysis and G-3-P production in the kidney, with no change observed in other organs.
Here, we advance the central hypothesis that kidney proximal tubular cell glycolysis is the mammalian
phosphate sensor, upstream of G-3-P and FGF23. Aim 1 will determine the role of glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis in Pi-stimulated G-3-P production. We will test the hypothesis that Pi-stimulated kidney G-3-P
production occurs in the fed state, but is attenuated under gluconeogenic conditions; we will examine two
physiologically relevant gluconeogenic stimuli, fasting and metabolic acidosis. In addition, we will show that
glycolysis is required for Pi-stimulated G-3-P using isotope labeling and inhibitors of glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis. Aim 2 will establish the role of glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase 1 (Gpd1), the enzyme that catalyzes G-3-P synthesis, in systemic Pi homeostasis. Using a
Gpd1 knockout animal generated in our laboratory, we will test the hypothesis that Gpd1 mediated G-3-P and
FGF23 production is required to prevent hyperphosphatemia, vascular calcification, and bone loss with chronic
dietary Pi loading; we will compare 0.6%, 1.2%, and 2% Pi diets and assess the role of Gpd1 with or without
induced hypoparathyroidism. Further, we will assess whether exogenous G-3-P can rescue the deleterious
effects of Gpd1 deficiency on Pi homeostasis. Aim 3 will demonstrate that the sodium-dependent cotransporter
Npt2a confers kidney specificity to glycolytic Pi sensing. We will test the hypothesis that Pi-stimulated
glycolysis in the kidney requires Npt2a, as assessed by 18F-FDG PET/MRI and metabolomic profiling; we will
also consider intestinal Pi uptake in a comparison of i.v. versus oral Pi administration. In vitro, we will test
whether the introduction of Npt2a to cells without basal Npt2a/c expression confers Pi-responsive glycolysis
and G-3-P production, as observed in primary human and mouse kidney proximal tubule cells. If successful,
these studies will identify a new mammalian sensor, with broad implications for human biology and disease,
and will endorse new pharmacologic targets for treating disorders of phosphate homeostasis. Finally, this
proposal will be executed by a team with a track record of collaboration, spanning expertise in kidney
metabolism, Pi and FGF23, bone biology, and metabolic imaging."

Accurate translation of the genetic information from messenger RNA to protein depends on multiple quality
control mechanisms, which collectively maintain the average levels of translational errors at 10-4 for amino acid
misincorporation (missense errors) and 10-2 for stop codon readthrough. However, increasing evidence shows
that such translational fidelity is not fixed, but is rather affected by various environmental cues and genetic factors.
Currently, we are only beginning to understand the regulatory networks leading to the fluctuation of translational
fidelity during environmental changes and the resulting physiological responses. Translational errors can lead to
reduced fitness, such as growth defects in bacteria and neurodegeneration in mammals, but may also benefit
cells under certain stress conditions. Recently, we have shown that translational error rates vary from cell to cell
in a genetically-identical bacterial population, raising the interesting question as to how fluctuation of translational
errors affects the behavior of individual cells. In my laboratory, we are interested in developing and applying new
technologies to understand the regulation and physiological roles of translational fidelity at both the population
and single-cell levels. We are using our recently developed high-throughput reporter system to screen for
conditions that alter translational fidelity, and have already identified novel environmental and genetic factors
that are critical for this process. Next, we will determine the underlying mechanisms and expand our screens.
Another research direction is to study how translational fidelity affects bacteria-host interactions, which is poorly
understood. Our recent work reveals that either decreasing or increasing translational fidelity impairs expression
of virulence genes and motility in Salmonella, suggesting that an optimal level of translational errors benefit
bacteria during host interactions. We will further determine the regulatory networks using population and single-
cell approaches. These studies will provide important insights into the roles of translational fidelity in
environmental adaption and the regulatory mechanisms."

10864964,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of death in the
world, is a chronic inflammatory disease thought to be driven at least in part by
derangements of protease-antiprotease balance. Recent discoveries have suggested
that proteases such as neutrophil elastase (NE) can be associated with exosomes
released by neutrophils (PMNs). Exosomes are nanovesicles released by the cell into
the environment. NE is enzymatically active when associated with exosomes yet it is
markedly resistant to inhibition by α-1 antitrypsin (α-1AT) in this form. Exosomal NE is
several log-fold more potent in causing COPD in mouse models than soluble NE, and
the exosomes themselves are able to traverse tissue planes and bind to structural
proteins in the lung such as type I collagen, focusing the proteolysis upon its substrate.
Importantly, exosomes derived from PMNs that are capable of causing NE-dependent
alveolar destruction in mice have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of
subjects with COPD, but not healthy controls. Because of these findings, it seems likely
that this exosome-associated form of NE may be more important to extracellular matrix
destruction (and thus COPD pathogenesis) than conventionally measured soluble NE.
This research project will quantify the PMN-derived, NE+ exosome burden within three
well-phenotyped cohorts of subjects with COPD as well as non-obstructed never
smoker and current/former smoker control subjects. Furthermore, the PMN-derived,
NE+ exosome profile of sputum and serum will be assessed to define the biomarker
utility of this process using less invasively derived specimens than BALF. These
findings will be correlated with various clinically validated measures of COPD disease
progression, symptom burden as well as disease sub-phenotype and will be correlated
with development of COPD among subjects at risk for this disease. Moreover, this
project will develop and optimize an animal model of pathogenic exosome transfer,
delineate the mechanism of NE binding to the PMN exosome surface, and advance
rational strategies designed to interrupt exosome pathogenicity. These studies will form
the foundation for the use and further study of PMN-derived, NE+ exosomes as
biomarkers of disease activity and potential therapeutic targets."
10865114,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is a highly prevalent disorder affecting 1% of the world’s population but our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that underlie epilepsy is still incomplete. Deficiency in the function of GABA reuptake
mediated by GABA transporter type 1 (GAT1), has been implicated in absence epilepsy and heterozygous
mutations in the gene SLC6A1 which encode GAT1 cause myoclonic astatic epilepsy, a generalized seizure
disorder with onset in infancy.
 Several questions remain regarding the pathophysiology of GAT1 hypofunction, including whether the
disease can be modeled in zebrafish as it can in rodents and whether the disorder is related to primary
constitutive versus secondary developmental consequences of GAT1 hypofunction. Therapeutically, a major
question is whether it is possible to identify disease-specific treatments for GABA reuptake deficiency.
 These questions represent major gaps in knowledge whose answers could inform the timing and nature of
treatment for patients with MAE and other generalized epilepsy syndromes involving GAT1 hypofunction. ​The
current proposal will close these gaps by establishing a novel zebrafish model of GAT1 hypofunction to
address questions related to the pathogenesis of the disorder and by testing whether a novel in vitro
fluorescence-mediated cell-based assay of GAT1 function can be used to identify positive modulators with
therapeutic value.​The proposed research will provide essential insights into the mechanisms of a generalized
epilepsy syndrome related to slc6a1/GAT1 hypofunction and establish platforms for future drug screening and
in vivo testing to reverse the pathophysiology of the disorder.
 The proposal under consideration combines an innovative research project with translational implications,
excellent mentorship in science and career development, and extensive institutional resources at Boston
Children’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, which should facilitate the
transition into an independent physician-scientist by the end of the award period. In sum, the proposal provides
a framework for a robust independent research program balancing mechanistic and translational investigations
of epilepsy. It is well-integrated with the research and clinical interests of the applicant, whose career goal is to
become an independent physician scientist with a focus on high-throughput biology and drug screening to
understand the mechanisms of epilepsy and to identify corresponding treatments."

10866442,"Title: Investigating the mechanisms of peroxisome homeostasis
Abstract
The overarching goal of my lab is to understand how cells make and maintain peroxisomes, a
ubiquitous membrane-bound organelle that harbors specialized metabolic reactions.
Peroxisomes are both versatile and dynamic: cells use them to adapt to their environment, and
thus can rapidly remodel their peroxisomes by altering enzyme content, morphology, and
number through peroxisome-specific autophagy and de novo biogenesis. Approximately 35 Pex
proteins are known to contribute to peroxisome formation and maintenance, yet the
mechanisms by which they act are not resolved at a molecular level. Furthermore, we are likely
missing many important players, especially in human cells, and this lack of basic mechanistic
knowledge hinders our understanding of how peroxisome contribute to human health, both in
rare, genetic Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBDs), and during the aging process. Our
approach is to use techniques in protein biochemistry and yeast cell biology to dissect the
mechanism of the Pex proteins, particularly focusing on the AAA-ATPase Pex1/Pex6. We aim
to identify the full repertoire of Pex1/Pex6’s endogenous substrates and the features that are
important for substrate selection. Since mutations in Pex1/Pex6 cause the majority of PBDs, we
are further focused on using disease-causing alleles to understand Pex1/Pex6 function in the
human cells and the cellular consequences of peroxisome stress induced by these alleles.
Finally, we have identified novel regulators of peroxisome homeostasis in human cells, and are
now exploring how peroxisome function integrates with the implicated canonical signaling
pathways. We anticipate that this research will improve our understanding of how peroxisomes
contribute to human health and disease."

10865138,"TITLE: Cultural Adaptation of a Web-Based App (myPlan Thailand) to Empower and Support Friends/Family of
Intimate Partner Violence Survivors in Thailand.
Study Section & Awarding Component Assignment Request: Fogarty International Center
ABSTRACT:
This innovative proposal will support and empower friends/family (F/F) of intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors in
Thailand, where IPV is critical and common, and survivors first and foremost seek help for abuse from their F/F. myPlan app
(www.myPlanapp.org) is a free mobile evidence-based intervention app to prevent IPV. The app was first developed in the
United States (US) and has been disseminated to high-income countries (e.g., New Zealand, Canada, Australia) and low-
income (Kenya). One new hope for improving survivors’ psychological and well-being is adapting and introducing the
myPlan app for the concerned friends/family who support survivors in Thailand.
Therefore, the propose of this longitudinal research study, Cultural Adaptation of a Web-Based App (myPlan Thailand) to
Empower and Support Friends/Family of Intimate Partner Violence Survivors in Thailand, will have two consecutive phases
with three aims: 1) To tailor the myPlan app content for concerned F/F members of Thai IPV survivors, 2) To
integrate the adapted myPlan app content for concerned F/F members of Thai IPV survivors, 3) To test the feasibility
and acceptability of the adapted myPlan app with concerned F/F members of Thai IPV survivors. Phase 1 (Year 1-2)
will achieve aim 1-2 to tailor the myPlan app with Thai survivors and friends/family. We will review current content and
conduct in-depth interviews with survivors and concerned F/F members on social norms associated with IPV, informal
support systems and the role/responsibility in helping survivors, safety strategies used by concerned F/F members and
negative consequences for both survivor and F/F member providing support. Moreover, in phase 1, the adapted content will
be pilot tested with concerned F/F members of survivors by using cognitive techniques and theater-testing methodology.
Phase 2 (Year 3-4) will achieve aim 3 to test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted myPlan app with F/F. We will
conduct a two-group RCT design with concerned F/F member randomized to receive a) the myPlan app for F/F member, or
b) standard usual-care safety planning information. Primary outcomes for F/F members include change in knowledge and
attitudes towards IPV and F/F empowerment to plan and take safety support survivor. Secondary outcomes will examine
change in F/F’ distress, frustration and consequences for supporting the survivor. This phase will also collect feasibility and
acceptability data to informed a planned R01 submission in Year 3 of the study.
The K43 application outlines a four-year plan to support a candidate who is a nursing instructor with 15 years of work in
diverse projects, settings, and disciplines; which positions her for a successful career as an independent researcher in research
field of intimate partner violence. The career development plan provides a sequence of carefully selected training and
mentoring experiences, including coursework to increase research capacity, leadership skills, mentored research leading to a
R01 proposal, peer reviewed publications, and professional networking, that will catapult this research to the next level of
research achievement. The team will be a collaboration between the Boromarajonani College of Nursing Khon Kaen
(BCNKK), Khon Kaen One Stop Crisis Center (OSCC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Notre Dame of Maryland
University (NDM), and Auckland University of Technology (AUT), New Zealand."
10865139,"Non-healing corneal injuries affect up to 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes, representing a significant cause
of vision loss in this population. Although there are treatments available to improve the symptoms of poorly-
healing corneal wounds, the only permanent solution is a corneal transplant, a procedure not readily available
worldwide. By examining changes in various proteins involved in the wound healing response at the cellular
level, I hope to understand why the corneas of diabetic patients fail to heal effectively. When an otherwise
healthy cornea is injured, cells next to the wound experience a number of changes necessary for coordinated
migration and wound closure. One change involves the activation of the purinergic receptor, P2X7, found on
the cell surface. When active, P2X7 generates a specific pattern of calcium signaling events that travel from
cell to cell through activation of the ion channel Pannexin-1. These propagated signaling events represent cell-
cell communication, and ultimately lead to re-arrangement of cytoskeletal proteins and coordinated wound
closure. Our previous studies have identified aberrant localization and activation of P2X7 in pre-type 2 diabetic
models. We have preliminary evidence that the signaling profile of wounded diabetic cells lacks the
characteristic P2X7 signaling response. This was confirmed using specific agonists to P2X7, and observing a
greatly diminished response in diabetic cells. The goal of this proposal is to uncover how the cell-cell
communication events in the P2X7 signaling cascade are regulated, how this regulation is thrown off in
diabetic systems, and how this change in regulation affects actin bundling and ultimately cell motility. My
preliminary data has identified a set of cells that we speculate are controllers or leader cells, as they initiate
communication events in neighboring cells, and propagated signaling events are greatly reduced in their
absence. Aim 1 will use a machine learning approach to investigate the presence of these leader cells in both
diabetic cell culture and corneal models. Aim 1 will also address the role of Pannexin-1 in the generation of a
unique leader cell signaling profile. Furthermore, the downstream impact of P2X7/Pannexin-1 signaling will be
assessed by using 3D electron microscopy to study actin arrangement in wounded diabetic and control
corneas. In Aim 2, the localization of P2X7 and Pannexin-1 protein and mRNA within the cells of corneal
samples will be examined. This will yield data regarding both general trends in expression between diabetic
and control groups, and differences in expression within a single sample that may explain the functional
difference between leader cells and the rest of the epithelial sheet. In addition, Aim 2 will address whether the
co-localization of P2X7 and Pannexin-1 proteins (before and after a wound) is necessary for wound repair.
Together these Aims will produce significant advances in our understanding of the regulation of the
P2X7/Pannexin-1 signaling cascade, alterations at the mRNA, protein, and functional level of this cascade in
diabetes, and downstream effects of these aberrations on the actin cytoskeleton."
10865144,"Project Summary
Mammalian auditory hair cells detect sound through deflections of stereocilia that are organized in precise
staircase-like bundles and interconnected by extracellular tip links. Sound-induced deflections modulate the
tension of tip links and convey these forces to mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channels located at
the tips of the shorter rows of stereocilia. Even at rest, there is a certain amount of tension on the tip links,
which ensures detection of the softest sounds and results in some resting amount of MET current
continuously entering the cell. We and other groups demonstrated that this resting MET current regulates
the height of transducing stereocilia, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for long-term maintenance of
the shape of stereocilia bundle. Furthermore, my recent study revealed that MET-dependent retraction of
stereocilia in mammalian auditory hair cells increases the tension within MET machinery, which could only
occur if, in contrast to the classical models, the upper end of the tip link is not freely moved by myosin
motors but instead somehow locked to the stereocilia core (Dragich et. al., in review). The proposed project
will explore a potential molecular mechanism of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that Gα-Interacting
Protein, C-terminus-3 (GIPC3) is involved in locking the upper end of the tip link to the stereocilia actin core.
Several mutations in GIPC3 have been linked to hearing loss in humans, but the exact function of this
protein in the mammalian cochlea is yet unknown. Data from our collaborator (Dr. Craig Vander Kooi) show
that GIPC3 interacts with myosin VI (MYO6) and the upper tip link density (UTLD) proteins, cadherin-23
(CDH23) and potentially myosin VIIa (MYO7a). My preliminary data also show that GIPC3 deficiency results
in the loss of resting MET current and “slipping adaptation” of the MET responses in cochlear outer hair
cells of mice carrying the p.W301X mutation in Gipc3, recapitulating a known human deafness. In this
project, we will use this Gipc3W301X mouse strain as well as a Gipc3 knockout strain to determine: (a) the
role of GIPC3 in regulating the tension within the MET machinery and adaptation in mammalian auditory
hair cells; (b) the role of GIPC3 in UTLD assembly and maintenance; and (c) the potential for restoring
wildtype MET responses in Gipc3-deficient mice. This project will not only identify the specific role of GIPC3
in mammalian auditory hair cells but also elucidate the mechanisms behind the maintenance of stereocilia
bundle structure and tensioning of the MET machinery. Approaching this project using electrophysiology,
advanced electron microscopy, and cell biology techniques will help me to develop a unique set of scientific
skills in preparation for a career as a future principal investigator in basic auditory research."
10865040,"ABSTRACT
US maternal mortality is substantially higher than that of other developed nations, with Georgia ranking second
highest among the states. Maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) are increasing in Georgia,
with the highest rates among those who are Black, publicly insured or uninsured, and deliver in safety-net
hospitals. Maternal morbidity and mortality occur on a continuum in which the accumulation and progression in
severity of events can be prevented through access to and utilization of quality health care. Georgia’s Maternal
Mortality Review Committee concludes that two-thirds of maternal deaths are preventable and attributes recent
increases to rising rates of inadequately managed chronic health conditions, mental health disorders,
substance use, and pregnancy complications in the setting of care that is often difficult to access, fragmented
and of insufficient quality. Experts emphasize that equity-centered health care approaches – which embed
transformational aspects into their design through stakeholder input and Black-led models of care that include
social support to counter stress related to racism and weathering – offer the most promise for reducing
inequities. Emerging data support that the incorporation of racially-concordant, community-based patient
navigators can enhance the cultural-competence of care while addressing discrimination, systemic racism, and
institutional barriers to quality care. To date, however, limited research has evaluated this promising strategy in
real-life settings using rigorous methods with sufficient sample size and ascertainment of morbidity and
mortality endpoints critical for determining effectiveness and motivating large-scale policy and practice change.
We posit that the integration of community-based patient navigators into maternal care will improve maternal
health outcomes through meeting social needs, lowering stress and depressive symptoms, and improving
access to and utilization of care thereby promoting better and more timely management of conditions and
reducing the occurrence and progression of complications. To test this hypothesis, we propose to perform a
pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the integration of community-based patient navigators into the
continuum of maternal care, starting prior to mid-pregnancy and continuing through one-year of birth, among
500 Black women with identified health and social needs in a safety-net hospital system to include both
outcome evaluation, to discern effectiveness in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, and process
evaluation, to enhance understanding of RCT findings. We will employ the Respectful Maternity Care and the
NIMHD Research Frameworks to rigorously evaluate maternal health outcomes in a hospital system that
primarily serves Black women with high unmet needs who experience excessive rates of adverse maternal
health outcomes via a multi-disciplinary team experienced in health services and community-based research,
equity-centered care, and with the capacity to implement a care model intervention with high fidelity and
acquire and utilize health system and patient-reported data to conduct comprehensive, high-quality evaluation."
10865855,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT CORE
The Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement
(ORE) Core serves as a bridge between ADRC scientific advances and the needs of study participants,
caregivers, and the communities we serve across two distinct geographical regions in Rochester, MN and
Jacksonville, FL. The ORE Core supports ADRC projects, related studies, and national Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Disorders initiatives. The primary aim of ORE Core is to engage, recruit, and retain ADRC study
participants from socially underserved and ethnoracially underrepresented groups who are at disproportionate
risk for Multiple Etiology Dementia and dementia-related health disparities. We will focus recruitment efforts
specifically on persons from African American/Black (AA), Hispanic/Latino (HL), and Rural Dwelling (RD)
communities (Aim 1). To accomplish this, we will implement and evaluate innovative methods of community-
based outreach, engagement, and research participation in the communities we serve (Aim 2); advance the
science of diverse recruitment by identifying barriers and evaluating solutions to enhance study enrollment (Aim
3); and engage in dementia care research evaluating novel technology-based solutions to address unmet
caregiver needs (Aim 4). We will assess structural and social determinants of health across all aims and identify
opportunities to ensure ADRC cohorts reflect the communities we study. Our success in achieving Core aims
will be facilitated through collaboration with community partners who will help us understand the needs of
community members. We will partner with ADRC Clinical, Biomarker, Genomics, Neuropathology, and
Digital Innovation Core investigators to help inform the content of educational materials and programs to meet
those needs and engage community advisors to ensure materials and programs are culturally and linguistically
appropriate."
10865856,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOMARKER CORE
The overall goal of the Biomarker Core is to collect, bank, and distribute fluid biospecimens and to generate
and share extensive biomarker datasets with the scientific community to address the heterogeneity and improve
diagnosis for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Indeed, the Mayo Clinic ADRC
continues to lead efforts to define AD/ADRD across the clinical spectrum. Biofluid biomarkers are critical to these
efforts, informing early changes in the development and progression of AD/ADRD, and supporting the etiologic
diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Synergy among the Biomarker, Clinical, Neuroimaging, and
Neuropathology Cores is also key to understanding multiple etiology dementias – the central theme of this
renewal application. In support of this goal, the Biomarker Core, together with the newly formed Genomics
Core, will systematically process, bank and distribute biospecimens from individuals with AD/ADRD, including
Lewy Body spectrum disorders and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and will measure established and
emerging AD/ADRD-related biofluid biomarkers in ADRC participants. The latter will include comparisons of
various pTau217 assays for detecting AD neuropathologic change, and the development and validation of
assays for the detection of pathological aggregates of α-synuclein associated with Lewy body disease.
Furthermore, given our recent findings that functional loss of TDP-43 causes the retention of cryptic exons (CE)
in hundreds of transcripts, some of which generate de novo CE-harboring proteins detectable in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), we will evaluate the ability of CE-proteins to serve as surrogate biomarkers of TDP-43 pathology.
Discovery of a biomarker of TDP-43 pathology would inform its contributions to the clinical variability in
AD/ADRD, support accurate antemortem diagnoses of FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau, and enable assignment of
patients with FTLD to clinical trials of investigational agents targeting TDP-43 or tau. The resources created by
the Clinical and Biomarker Cores, in concert with other Cores, will support biomarker evaluation in increasingly
diverse cohorts and underrepresented groups. Already, we have examined plasma AD biomarker profiles
(Aβ42/40, pTau181, GFAP, NfL) and their relationship to cognition and comorbidities in African American/Black
and non-Hispanic White participants. Acknowledging that structural and social determinants of health (SSDoH)
are fundamental drivers of AD/ADRD disparities, we will expand our studies and investigate the contribution of
race, additional SSDoH, and other health factors on AD/ADRD biomarkers. To accomplish these goals, the
Biomarker Core has assembled a team of investigators who have collectively undertaken comprehensive
biomarker studies evaluating the susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, prognostic and pharmacodynamic utility of
putative AD/ADRD biomarkers, and have devoted substantial effort towards biofluid banking, biomarker assay
development, and the identification of novel biomarkers."
10865065,"Aging is associated with a continuous accumulation of deleterious changes, consequential loss of function, and
development of age-related diseases. The length of time organisms live is a complex trait, influenced by genetic,
environmental and stochastic processes. Much effort has been placed at defining the genetic basis of lifespan
variation. However, common genetic variants have low effect size and are responsible only for a fraction of
human lifespan variation. On the other hand, human genomes also harbor highly damaging variants, such as
highly deleterious alleles represented by loss-of-function variants in important genes. These damaging mutations
are rare or ultra-rare, but they often have strong effect sizes. While these variants are missed by genotyping,
they can be easily detected by exome sequencing, providing an opportunity to quantify their role in age-related
diseases, mortality and longevity, if information on these phenotypes is available together with exome
sequences. We hypothesize that burden of rare damaging variants influences lifespan and that this effect can
be quantified. This would mean that long-lived individuals, especially centenarians, on average are depleted of
these mutations, whereas mid-life mortality may be associated with their increased burden. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following: (1) Quantify the impact of burden of rare damaging mutations on human
mortality and healthspan. We will examine if higher burden of damaging mutations is associated with increased
mortality and an early onset of age-related diseases. To test this possibility, we will determine if longer life is
associated with lower burden of rare variants that lead to stop or start codon gain/loss, frameshifting and splicing
aberrations. We will apply the methods we developed in preliminary studies to larger cohorts, quantifying the
role of rare mutation burden in men and women, determining their effect on the incidence of various age-related
diseases as well as on healthspan, assessing the effect of mutation frequency, and identifying genes and
pathways affected by damaging mutations. We will further determine if centenarians and other long-lived
individuals are depleted of damaging mutations, whereas earlier mortality is associated with them. (2) Examine
the association of burden of rare damaging variants with mouse lifespan. We will take advantage of genetically
heterogeneous UM-HET3 mice with the known age at death. We will sequence their exomes and determine the
effect of rare damaging mutations on longevity. As in humans, we hypothesize that burden of these variants
negatively affects mouse lifespan. Comparative analysis of human and mouse damaging mutations will allow us
to uncover common features at the level of mutations, genes and pathways. We will further characterize exomes
of mice subjected to interventions that extend lifespan. Using this dataset, we will determine if adjusting for
mutation burden offers a better statistical support for the observed effect of these interventions."
10865069,"Abstract
In this 5 year R01 grant entitled “Unraveling the superficial white matter of the primate brain: Tracer-based
histology and diffusion MRI tractography validation,” we will map superficial white matter (SWM) in the primate
cerebrum using experimental tract tracing methods. We will use this ground truth information to validate high-
resolution in vivo and ultra-high resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) based tractography in the same rhesus
macaque monkeys. The SWM is a continuous layer located between the cerebral cortex of the forebrain and the
underlying white matter association pathways. It comprises axons that interconnect cerebral cortical areas,
including U-shaped fibers (U-fibers) under the cerebral sulci. This axonal layer plays a role in a broad range of
neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease, and
knowledge of the SWM is essential for accurately interpreting dMRI-based tractography. Critically, the
fundamental connectional neuroanatomy of the SWM is largely unknown due to our inability to visualize the
specific origins, terminations, and trajectories of axons in the human brain. Our knowledge of human SWM
connectional neuroanatomy is thus derived almost exclusively from experimental tract tracing results in the non-
human primate (NHP) model, but comprehensive studies of the NHP SWM, from origin through trajectory to
termination, have not been performed. Therefore, knowledge of human SWM connectivity and organization can
be improved by invasive tract tracing studies in the NHP. The goal of the proposed research is to carry out the
first detailed neuroanatomical study of the SWM in the NHP brain, with dMRI validation in the NHP and translation
to human brains. To achieve this goal, we will use a range of histological techniques in conjunction with dMRI
scans obtained with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Connectom scanner to produce superior quality
dMRI data. We will first datamine the research literature to produce a compendium of existing knowledge of
SWM connectivity in the rhesus monkey. We will also examine the Pandya-Rosene Archive, a vast collection of
neuroanatomy cases that has formed the foundation of data on white matter connections in the NHP. We will
utilize this archive to chart the organization of the SWM in frontal brain areas. We will then use modern
histological methods, including CLARITY-based tissue clearing and neuroanatomical tract tracing, to interrogate
the structure, topography, and connectivity of the SWM, and thereby produce ground truth data. We will perform
in vivo and ex vivo dMRI in the same animals in which we perform neuroanatomical tract tracing experiments,
allowing for direct comparisons between histological and neuroimaging-based connectivity. Moreover, we will
disseminate the dMRI data to the neuroimaging community and host a competition to determine the optimal
tractography method for SWM. Finally, we will translate knowledge of SWM neuroanatomy to the human brain
using homologically based comparisons with Human Connectome Project datasets. These data will provide
ground truth of SWM connectivity and serve to improve dMRI tractography in NHP and human brains."

In the current project period, Siteman Flow Cytometry (SFC) has grown to meet the increasing needs for flow
cytometry from Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) members. SFC now offers 10 flow cytometry analyzers from 8-
27 colors and four cell sorters from 10-22 colors. All analyzers, all data workstations, and one self-service cell
sorter are available 24/7. The remaining three cell sorters are operated by proficient staff Monday through Friday,
from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, with flexibility. In the current project period, SFC has prioritized customer education
and training, especially in experiment design and process. Rather than focusing merely on the operation of
instrumentation and software, the education helps users become much more apt to achieve success the first
time when facing a new level of flow cytometry multiplexing. SFC is heavily involved in the development
partnerships with flow cytometer manufacturers, intending to reach 60 parameters for quantitative analysis using
spectral flow instrumentation and 50 parameters for cell sorting, within the next two years. These partnerships
with industry have consistently helped SFC obtained substantial pricing accommodation on new instrumentation.
This has, in turn, reduced the cost basis of the assets for SFC customers and has increased value to the users
by ensuring they have access to cutting-edge technology. SFC’s focus on and ability to maintain and repair its
own instrumentation leads to minimal down time and instant response to problems that inevitably occur in all
fluidic instrumentation. This repair and maintenance effort extends capacity and utilization and the ability to
forego several service contracts also reduces cost basis and adds value to SFC’s users."
10866464,"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR CELLULAR IMAGING (WUCCI) SHARED RESOURCE:
PROJECT SUMMARY
Elucidating the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of cancer requires a deep
understanding of how changes in tissue / cellular structure relate to loss of function. Imaging technologies have
evolved rapidly over the last decade, generating vast improvements in resolution, sensitivity, and speed, and
creating fundamentally new opportunities for studying biological processes across many orders of magnitude in
real-time in living cells and organisms. The Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI) provides
(i) reliable and affordable access to cutting-edge light and electron microscopy instrumentation, (ii) expert
guidance in imaging assay design, specimen preparation, image acquisition and analysis, (iii) educational
opportunities in the form of hands-on trainings, lunch and learn lectures, workshops and a monthly journal club
and (iv) novel imaging and analysis methodologies. As a new Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) shared
resource (SR), WUCCI will provide an integrated approach to investigate the structure and dynamic behavior of
cells and tissues in cancer-related studies. By leveraging a significant institutional investment, SCC researchers
gain instant access to a wide variety of advanced cellular microscopy tools which will serve to accelerate the
pace, expand the scope, and improve the efficiency of their research. WUCCI services meet the unique
requirements of numerous investigators over a wide range of basic and translational research, as well as attract
new investigators into the cancer research arena. Importantly, users benefit from the in-depth technical expertise
of the Director (James Fitzpatrick) and technical staff with regard to experimental design and interpretation of
data. Over the past three years, WUCCI has worked with multiple SCC researchers to implement new imaging
assays. These have included the application of two-photon intravital microscopy to longitudinally track
disseminated tumor cells in a mouse model of dormancy (Sheila Stewart [MCBP]), the development of x-ray
contrast agents to delineate metastatic tumor boundaries in murine long bones (Katherine Weilbeacher
[BCRP]), and the application of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) serial block face
imaging to acquire three-dimensional volumes of mouse gastric tissue at the nanoscale (Jason Mills [MCBP]).
In 2018, WUCCI served 235 research laboratories, 75 of which were SCC investigators whose usage
represented ~20% of the overall SR consumption. Future plans for the next project period include the acquisition
of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope recently funded by the NIH S10 program for the high-speed volumetric
imaging of living organoids and cleared tissues, as well as the implementation of the Visiopharm Oncotopix
IHC and ISH image analysis platform. We anticipate that requests for WUCCI services will continue to grow
given the need for advanced microscopic imaging and analysis in the study of cancer. Thus, WUCCI, as a new
CCSG shared resource, will provide essential services to SCC investigators throughout the next project period."
10866467,"TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAM (TIP): PROJECT SUMMARY
For more than 30 years, the immunology community at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) has
had a strong reputation for the significant breadth and depth of its contributions to the field of immunology and
its highly interactive/collaborative nature. A strategic decision was made 20 years ago to promote basic science
research in tumor immunology and establish an infrastructure to facilitate clinical translation of cancer
immunotherapies at Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) and WUSM through the creation of a Tumor Immunology
Program (TIP) as an integral component of the newly forming NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center.
This was a prescient strategic decision, and the number of SCC laboratories currently performing research
related to tumor immunology has increased significantly. Of note, there has been a concomitant increase in the
number of laboratories participating in translational tumor immunology research and the number of investigator-
initiated cancer immunotherapy clinical trials in the current project period. This increase in translational research
has been achieved through the creation of an environment that facilitates and encourages interactions and
collaborations between basic scientists and physician-scientists particularly between SCC research programs,
and where state-of-the-art resources and infrastructure are available to catalyze the translation of these basic
science research findings into novel therapeutic opportunities.
 Thus, because of the environment that was established by the SCC, the highly interactive environment now
extends across the basic immunology, tumor immunology, and cancer immunotherapy research communities.
TIP members are conducting research and discovery within four central themes: (1) developing and/or expanding
new models that recapitulate the dynamic interplay between the immune system and cancer; (2) identifying
molecules that serve as targets of the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response, and developing
strategies targeting these molecules; (3) defining the roles of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and
elsewhere in promoting or suppressing anti-tumor immune responses; and (4) translating basic immunologic
research into clinically relevant tests, interventions, and clinical trials.
 The TIP has 23 members from six departments at WUSM. The program is supported by $13.7 million in
funding, with $2.91 million from the NCI and $5.10 million from other peer-reviewed funding. During the current
project period, TIP members published 647 manuscripts, with 39% from inter-programmatic collaborations and
21% from intra-programmatic collaborations. During the current project period, TIP members initiated or
supported 256 cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. Although the accruals to these were allocated to SCC’s
disease-focused research programs (STTP, BCRP, and HDMP), TIP members facilitated accrual to these trials
(1,544 interventional treatment accruals, including 501 (32%) to investigator-initiated studies)."
10866468,"HEMATOPOIETIC DEVELOPMENT AND MALIGNANCY PROGRAM (HDMP): PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goals of the Hematopoietic Development and Malignancy Program (HDMP) are to identify basic
mechanisms regulating normal and malignant hematopoiesis, and develop innovative strategies to prevent,
stratify, and treat hematopoietic malignancies. The HDMP has 30 members from three departments at
Washington University School of Medicine. HDMP members are supported by $22.4 million direct costs in
cancer-related funding, including $5.3 million direct costs from the NCI and $4.5 million direct costs from other
peer-reviewed cancer-related funding. HDMP members published 760 papers during the current project period,
with 20% resulting from inter-programmatic collaborations, 26% from intra-programmatic collaborations, and
30% published in journals with an impact factor ≥10. HDMP members participated in 551 clinical trials involving
hematologic malignancies or stem cell transplantation, including 357 interventional trials. Basic science
translation remains a top priority for the HDMP. In the current project period, 25 investigator-initiated clinical trials
were developed from fundamental research performed (at least in part) at Siteman Cancer Center, including 22
investigator-initiated therapeutic interventional trials. Total interventional accruals were 2,961, of which 2,761
(93%) were interventional treatment. The interventional treatment accrual rate (as a function of reported
hematologic malignancy index cases) was 38% in 2018. Working groups in leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and
myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms were established to develop, review, prioritize, and
conduct translational research. Each working group is organized around three themes: cancer genomics,
development of immunotherapies, and cancer biology. The HDMP fosters collaborative translational research
and trains junior investigators through research seminars, journal clubs, work-in-progress meetings, and an
annual retreat. Program leaders have identified areas of institutional strength and developed four specific
translational aims.
Aim 1: Leverage local expertise in cancer genomics to identify key genetic and epigenetic alterations in
hematopoietic malignancies and develop their translational potential.
Aim 2: Develop fundamental discoveries in immunology into novel immunotherapies targeting
hematopoietic malignancies. A particular area of focus is the development of novel cellular immunotherapies
for hematopoietic malignancies.
Aim 3: Translate fundamental discoveries in cancer cell biology into novel strategies to treat
hematopoietic malignancies and/or improve stem cell transplantation.
Aim 4: Identify and develop junior investigators in hematopoietic malignancies."
10866469,"PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM (PCP): PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer continues to pose a major threat to public health nationally and in the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC)
catchment area. The pioneering transdisciplinary and translational research within the SCC Prevention and
Control Program (PCP) is aimed at reducing the cancer burden and spans from prevention to early detection
through survival. Adding to the robust depth and breadth of PCP expertise, research within the program spans
from the cell to society and includes basic science, large data analytics, clinical and community-based
intervention and implementation research, as well as policy research in clinical and community settings.
 Building on PCP’s impactful and practice-changing research from the past five years and based on key needs
in the SCC catchment and beyond, the PCP will address the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Reduce the impact of tobacco use and resultant cancers by conducting research across the
 continuum, from prevention to detection and cessation.
 Aim 2. Reduce cancer health disparities through rigorous research in cancer prevention and control.
 Aim 3. Advance dissemination and implementation science methods to reduce the cancer burden.
 PCP’s research priorities are responsive to and reflective of the catchment area. Cigarette smoking rates are
above average in our catchment; lung cancer rates are above the national average. Our catchment includes
racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity, and within this diversity are disparities in cancer
screening, detection, and survival. Similar to the rest of the nation, we observe delays in the implementation of
evidence-based practice across many settings. Our unique and diverse catchment includes parts of Missouri,
which has the lowest cigarette taxes in the nation and lacks Medicaid expansion, and parts of Illinois, which has
a more stringent cigarette policy and expanded Medicaid. Together this results in a microcosm in which to study
tobacco use, cancer disparities, and implementation science.
 PCP membership includes experts in diverse disciplines such as psychology, epidemiology, biostatistics,
economics, public health, clinical medicine, and basic science. The program has 38 members from eight
departments and two schools at Washington University. The PCP is supported by $8.3 million in funding, of
which $5.1M is from NCI and $2.4M is other cancer-focused peer-reviewed. In the current project period, PCP
members published 1,096 manuscripts, of which 25% and 25% represent inter- and intra-programmatic
collaborations, respectively. In 2018, the PCP had 7,355 total enrollments into clinical studies, of which 38%
were interventional. Forty percent of the interventional enrollments represented racial and ethnic minority
participants. With these assets and this record of past achievement, the PCP is poised to make substantial
impacts on public health and clinical practices and policies related to cancer control that will benefit the health of
the population."
10866471,"ONCOLOGIC IMAGING PROGRAM (OIP): PROJECT SUMMARY
The Oncologic Imaging Program (OIP) develops novel imaging agents and innovative methods for radionuclide,
MR, ultrasound, optical, and hybrid imaging technologies, including photoacoustic imaging and theranostics.
Application of artificial intelligence and informatics platforms to solve advanced oncologic imaging challenges
demonstrates the evolving nature of OIP. OIP’s major goals are to facilitate new research initiatives, expand
ongoing collaborations, mentor junior faculty, train students and fellows, and develop new methods to solve
fundamental and clinical cancer imaging needs. These goals will be achieved through intra- and inter-
programmatic activities and external partnerships. OIP’s highest priorities include developing imaging agents
and technologies for detecting, diagnosing, and treating cancer, and expanding our knowledge of animal models
used for basic cancer research. OIP activities will pursue four specific aims. (1) Develop innovative imaging
instruments and methods for diagnostic and theranostic applications and image-guided cancer therapies. (2)
Develop new molecular imaging agents and theranostics for accurate detection and, assessment of tumor-
specific properties as well as for monitoring therapeutic response to improve treatment outcomes. (3) Advance
applications of quantitative imaging (QI) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression and
treatment responses via deep learning and radiomics. (4) Educate, train, and mentor students, fellows, and junior
faculty in cancer imaging research. OIP will continue to develop strong intra- and inter-programmatic
collaborations, industry partnerships, and integrated trainee support to champion collective innovation in cancer
imaging research and clinical translation. The program currently includes 36 members from seven departments
and three schools. The extensive collaborative network of OIP members has resulted in more than $10.1 million
in current grant awards, of which $5.4 million is NCI funding and $2.5 million is other peer-reviewed funding, and
an additional $5 million in NIH S10 large instrument grant funding. OIP research is anchored by one NCI-funded
research center (Center for Multiple Myeloma Nanotherapy [U54 CA199092]), the institutionally supported
Molecular Imaging Center (continuation of previous NCI-supported ICMIC [CA094056]), three NIH-supported
Resource Centers (Gropler P41 EB025815, Marcus U24 CA204854, Shoghi U24 CA209837), two imaging
training grants (Culver T32 EB014855, Woodard T32 EB021955), and more than 1,104 publications in the
current project period of which 28% are inter-programmatic, 26% are intra-programmatic and 10% with impact
factor >10. OIP research has been accelerated by recent installation of several new instruments, including
PET/CT scanner (Siemens Vision), micro PET/CT, microPET/MR, GE SPINlab hyperpolarization unit, Oxford
Instruments PulsarTM benchtop permanent-magnet-based 1.5-T NMR spectrometer, fluorescence molecular
tomography system, multispectral optoacoustic tomography system, and IVIS-CT multimodal imaging system.
Clinical translation of new discoveries will remain the cornerstone of OIP."
10866473,"MECHANISMS OF CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM (MCBP): PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of the Mechanisms of Cancer Biology Program (MCBP) is to identify and map the complex
cellular mechanisms that drive cancer development, progression, and metastasis. To accomplish this goal,
members of the MCBP are identifying factors (biochemical and physical), signaling pathways and the cellular
basis for the communication between tumor and stromal cells that drives tumorigenesis. Together this approach
will lay the framework for the design of specific therapeutic modalities. The MCBP is organized around two
working groups termed the, (1) Cell Autonomous Cancer Drivers (CACD) and (2) Cancer Cell Nonautonomous
Drivers (CCND). Recognizing the importance of the co-morbidities associated not only with the disease but the
treatments deployed to fight it, MCBP is developing a third group referred to as Cancer Co-Morbidity Drivers
(CCMD). Together these thematic groups include individuals working to discover how cell autonomous mutations
and stromal cells, extracellular matrix structural proteins, growth factors, and cytokines interact to modulate
tumorigenesis. Further, as cancer therapies become more effective at reducing mortality, cancer survivors are
increasingly faced with therapy-induced co-morbidities that can significantly impact their quality of life. Thus,
MCBP members also focus on the mechanisms that drive therapy-induced co-morbidities. The MCBP primarily
performs basic cancer biology research and discovery, and is structured to interface with other programs within
the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) that are positioned to translate research breakthroughs into patient care,
particularly in genetics, molecular and cellular cancer biology, and functional genomics. The MCBP members
are currently developing a number of therapeutic drugs that were identified using this approach, which are
discussed in the body of the grant.
 The MCBP is dedicated to achieving the following two goals: (1) identify key molecules and pathways (i.e.,
targets) within tumor cells and the tumor-stromal interactions that regulate tumor cell proliferation, survival, and
metastasis, and develop therapeutic strategies to target these key molecules and/or pathways; and (2) develop
select inter-programmatic working groups to facilitate the translation of the results from Goal 1. Each working
group focuses on the central importance of intracellular communication within incipient tumor cells and
intercellular communication between tumor cells and the stromal microenvironment. Each member has specific
expertise and shared goals that are utilized to develop a robust research program with strong intra- and inter-
programmatic collaborations. MCBP has 40 members from 12 departments and three schools, and is supported
by $15.1 million in funding, with $4.3 million from the NCI and $7.2 million from other peer-reviewed funding
sources. MCBP members published 711 peer-reviewed papers during 2014–2018, with 142 (20%) papers in
journals with impact factors ≥10. MCBP members also engaged in extensive collaborative interactions, with 172
(24%) inter- and 108 (15%) intra-programmatic publications."
10866474,"SOLID TUMOR THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM (STTP): PROJECT SUMMARY
The Solid Tumor Therapeutics Program (STTP) is focused on discovering somatic and germline genomic
alterations that are either shared or unique across various solid tumor malignancies, and translating these
discoveries into novel therapeutics that will improve the quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Two
fundamental thematic areas (Genomics Technologies and Discovery, and Developmental Therapeutics [DT])
were organized to promote disease-specific studies in neuro, head and neck, thoracic, gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, and gynecologic oncology. The STTP is coordinated through a leadership committee, research
meetings, seminars, retreats, and other educational activities. Training for junior investigators is implemented
through a mentorship plan and is supported through NCI-funded T32 (HD007499), K12 (CA167540), and Clinical
and Translational Scientific Award (CTSA) educational programs. We identified areas of institutional strength
and developed three research aims for the next project period. Aim 1. Develop innovative therapeutic
strategies by identifying genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic (‘omic) alterations that
occur in solid tumors and by mapping their spatiotemporal evolution using preclinical models and tumor
specimens. Aim 2. Determine how genomic alterations interact with immune landscapes in solid tumor
malignancies; identifying these potential synergies will improve therapeutic outcomes. Aim 3. Explore
the relationships among germline variants and their effects on cancer susceptibility and treatment in
solid tumor malignancies, and evaluate sex-specific effects on cancer biology. These aims are designed
to elucidate the effects of genetic instabilities, DNA repair defects, and specific inhibitors on solid tumor initiation,
maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance. The STTP leadership facilitates and encourages collaborative
interactions between disease-specific investigators and translational experts to promote translational and clinical
research. These interactions are achieved through working-group meetings, focus-group meetings, seminars,
and funded programs such as the NCI U54 CA224083 PDX clinical trial network and the NCI U2C CA233303
Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center, which will construct detailed 4D atlases for breast
cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The STTP has 47 members from 13 departments at
Washington University School of Medicine. The STTP is supported by a total of $25.9 million direct costs in
cancer-related funding, $5.8 million in NCI funding, and $5.8 million in other peer-reviewed funding. STTP
members published 1,723 papers during 2014–2018, with 33% resulting from inter-programmatic collaborations
and 24% resulting from intra-programmatic collaborations. During 2014–2018, STTP members participated in
1,511 clinical trials, 56% of which were interventional trials. These trials enrolled 32,867 patients, with 6,274
enrolled in interventional trials, 4,597 in interventional treatment trials, 1,354 in institutional interventional
treatment trials, and 1,274 in early phase or first-in-human interventional treatment trials."
10866475,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
The catchment area of Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) spans 82 counties across Missouri and Illinois. The
counties exhibit significantly different levels of health coverage and overall cancer burden. The population of the
catchment is extremely diverse, with 15% of the population living in a rural area, and 29% in a Medically
Underserved Area (MUA). Minority populations in the catchment make up 20.5% of the total population.
However, a significantly higher proportion of SCC patients who are African-American live in a MUA (31.3%),
compared to White patients (25.2%). Our catchment area as a whole carries a disproportionately high cancer
burden, with increased incidence of late stage diagnoses and a high cancer mortality. In fact, a significant
percentage of SCC catchment counties fall within the highest US quartile for breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal
cancer mortality. To address the disparities and cancer burden in our catchment, SCC investigators have
developed tailored educational materials, cancer-specific community partnerships, a clinical trial participation
monitoring system, and expanded clinical services as part of SCC’s Comprehensive Outreach Strategy. SCC’s
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) component builds on this foundation with the goal to sustain
partnerships and assure that all cancer patients and communities can benefit from clinical and scientific
advances. SCC’s COE component addresses and monitors disparities among underserved populations,
specifically racial (minority), geography (rural), access to services (medically underserved areas), and their
interaction. SCC’s COE component is organized into an Internal Advisory Board (IAB); a Community Advisory
Board (CAB); a Clinical Studies Outreach (CSO) team; and six and one-half full-time equivalents staff. These
groups work together to accomplish the COE aims: (1) Monitor and evaluate the cancer burden and related
disparities in the SCC catchment; (2) Accelerate the implementation of outreach, education, and clinical
resources in collaboration with communities to reduce the cancer burden and related disparities in the SCC
catchment; and (3) Support research to reduce the cancer burden and related disparities in the SCC catchment
through: (3a) Support for community-based and health disparities research, and (3b) Continuous evaluation and
education to promote diversity in clinical trial participation. To achieve these aims, COE will build upon existing
strong community and regional partnerships that have emanated from SCC’s critical role as a provider and
research center in our catchment area. By achieving the above aims, SCC will ensure that the center is best
addressing the impact of cancer in our catchment and is developing a solid infrastructure for sustaining positive
impacts and strengthening translation of SCC research to clinical practice. Together, these aims work to reduce
the cancer burden and related disparities in SCC’s catchment."
10866476,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: PROJECT SUMMARY
Siteman Cancer Center’s (SCC’s) Siteman Investment Program (SIP) includes a portfolio of funding mechanisms
that support innovative scientific research through competitive funding opportunities; investments in our
community, catchment, and faculty; and strategic recruitment efforts to strengthen and diversify SCC’s scientific
research portfolio. SCC’s current five-year strategic plan, as well as the needs of SCC’s catchment area, provide
the foundation for all funding decisions. SCC Senior Leadership (SL) designed the SIP to align closely with their
overall vision for the center, with the highest priority placed on promotion of transdisciplinary, translational, and
collaborative research.
 Funding received from the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds component is
significantly augmented by SCC philanthropic assets to provide approximately $4 million ($4M) per year to SCC
members through the SIP Research Development Award (RDA) biannual funding opportunity. SCC SL designed
SIP RDA to include a rigorous peer-review process modeled after the NIH review process. SCC SL and SCC
Administration closely monitor program outcomes for progress and productivity, including participation by junior
investigators. Since 2015, 24 Pre-R01 awardees (42%) were junior investigators who collectively received $4.5M
in SIP RDA funding. Of those 24, 11 (46%) have already leveraged at least one external award, collectively
totaling $13.5M in directs. The SIP RDA program also includes a mentoring opportunity for unfunded applicants,
including junior faculty, to meet with the SIP RDA chair to discuss critiques and improvements at the end of the
review cycle. The success rate for resubmissions is 37%, which suggests that these meetings are valuable for
unfunded SIP RDA applicants who reapply in future funding cycles.
 From 2013–2017, SCC awarded a total of $23.6M through the SIP to investigators across all seven of SCC’s
research programs. To date, SCC faculty have leveraged $120M in direct costs ($173M total costs) in external
funding. This $120M includes 44 NCI awards ($83.5M, 70% of total leveraged) and 31 NIH and other cancer
peer-reviewed grants ($28.5M, 23% of total leveraged); thus, 93% of all dollars leveraged from the SIP come
from peer-reviewed awards. In the next project period, SCC will grow its commitment to and investment in SIP
to significantly advance cancer discovery through support of novel and collaborative research, recurring annual
investment for faculty recruitment, and by providing funding for unfunded and/or underfunded investigator-
initiated clinical trials. Funding from CCSG Developmental Funds will continue to be awarded to SCC members
through the SIP RDA program."
10866477,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) Director, Timothy Eberlein, sets the vision for SCC, creates policy, and builds
consensus prior to implementation of key decisions. He has broad authority and is the ultimate arbiter for all
scientific and administrative matters, with Senior Leadership (SL) providing critical support and advice. The SL,
chaired by the Director, is SCC’s central decision-making and internal advisory body. SL vets all SCC strategies,
priorities, policies, and budgetary decisions. SL is structured to facilitate research productivity; promote cross-
program and cross-discipline collaboration; and, leverage institutional strengths to increase SCC’s impact in the
region, nation, and field of cancer research. SL’s collective expertise and institutional influence help to foster and
further SCC’s vision and mission, while integrating research efforts and promoting transdisciplinary and
translational research relevant to the catchment area.
 Continuous evaluation of SCC progress and planning for future initiatives is accomplished with the direction
of specialized external and internal advisory committees, under the oversight of the SCC Director and SL. The
External Advisory Committee (EAC) plays an essential role, shaping SCC’s direction through an intensive annual
review and report on strengths and key opportunities for improvement. EAC reviews SCC’s leadership structure,
research programs, education and training initiatives, administration/operations, and overall scientific impact in
the catchment area. Other important committees that include members external to Washington University (WU)
are the Community Advisory Board and Patient and Family Advisory Council.
SCC relies on several internal advisory committees and working groups to fulfill key functions:
  Guide strategic planning – Joint Office of Strategic Planning, SCC Strategic Plan Steering Committee;
  Review SCC’s clinical trial portfolio, accruals, and activation – Clinical Research Committee;
  Set research program priorities – Program-Specific Leadership Committees;
  Evaluate shared resource performance, needs, and relevance to SCC member research – Shared
 Resource Review;
  Conduct peer-review of funding requests and make recommendations for funding – Siteman Investment
 Program Research Development Award mechanism; and
  Review new member applications and eligibility of existing members – SCC Membership Committee.
SCC’s access to institutional leaders reflects the Center’s prominence and priority within its parent institutions,
WU School of Medicine (WUSM) and Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH). The elevated stature of SCC within WU
and BJH affords the Director unique access to the WU Chancellor and BJC HealthCare CEO (biannual meetings)
and the BJH President and WUSM Dean (monthly meetings)."
10866478,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Clinical Trials Core (CTC) is to support SCC members in the development and conduct of
clinical research of the highest quality by providing them with access to an effective, efficient and economical
team specializing exclusively in cancer research. This allows for the coordination of robust investigator-initiated
trials (IIT), innovative industry-sponsored trials, and active participation in cooperative groups and consortia. The
CTC offers comprehensive services in protocol development, scientific review, regulatory submission, study
coordination, data collection, education, training, financial management, and quality assurance. The CTC has
experienced continued growth during the project period, with a staffing increase of 52% (256 staff members
today). This resulted from a corresponding increase in clinical trial accrual. When comparing the five-year
average from the current project period to the previous project period, interventional clinical trial accrual
increased 77% while interventional treatment clinical trial accrual increased 25%. There has also been a 30%
increase in activation of new pediatric clinical trials, a targeted area for growth within the CTC. Project growth
includes a 52% increase in the submission of new IITs managed by Protocol Development across the project
period. The CTC has pursued opportunities to reduce protocol activation timelines across all trial types, utilizing
commercial IRBs to reduce IRB approval time by 38% for industry-sponsored trials and by allowing administrative
scientific review for institutional trials that have already received scientific review committee approval at another
NCI cancer center resulting in a reduction of 14 days. In addition, the CTC employs technology to report key
performance metrics and empower investigators with real-time data related to their projects. In 2015, the CTC
launched the OnCore Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS), which facilitates submission to the PRMS,
serves as a web-based repository for documents that have received regulatory approval, houses an electronic
data capture system for institutional clinical trials readily accessible by investigators and statisticians, and tracks
key metrics including protocol- and accrual-based data regularly utilized in process improvement projects. The
implementation of the OnCore CTMS provided opportunities for enhanced real-time monitoring of clinical trial
accrual for inclusion of minority, rural, and medically underserved patients, and in 2018, SCC’s overall patient
population included 15.5% minority patients but boasted 28.1% minority accrual to interventional trials."
10848205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lack of dystrophin (dys) and disruption of the dys-associated protein complex (DAPC) at the membrane of
skeletal myofibers are widely recognized as the main cause of sarcolemma instability, leading to skeletal
muscle loss in patients affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). In addition to its structural function,
dys has been implicated in the regulation of additional downstream cellular events, including control of the
genome integrity and gene expression. Indeed, dys-deficient muscles exhibit altered profiles of histone
modifications, gene expression and non-coding RNA, as well as features of genomic instability and nuclear
abnormalities. Chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based studies have revealed that the genome is folded
into high-order chromatin interactions. Understanding the relationship between dys deficiency, dysregulated
gene expression and altered genome topology is of special interest for the complete understanding of DMD
pathogenesis and for the evaluation of the effective benefits of therapeutic approaches aimed at replacing dys
expression in DMD boys. This proposal addresses this question by exploiting state-of-the-art genome-wide
approaches (i.e. promoter capture-HiC, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and RNAseq) to detect perturbations of the
epigenetic landscape and transcriptome in DMD muscles, using two complementary experimental models –
patient iPSC-based in dish model of human DMD vivo and the mdx mouse model in vivo, by the following
Aims: Aim 1. To identify alterations in high-order chromatin interactions that regulate gene expression
in DMD muscles We will identify alterations of chromatin interactions between functional and structural
genomic elements, leading to pathogenic gene expression in human (hiPSC-derived skeletal muscles) and
mouse (mdx mice) models of DMD. Aim 2. Effect of µ-dys restoration on reversal of alterations in high-
order chromatin interactions that regulate gene expression in DMD muscles We will evaluate whether
restoration of dys expression by µ-dys reverses (partly or completely) the epigenetic and transcriptional
alterations of DMD muscles identified in Aim 1. Aim 3. Bioinformatic identification and analysis of
epigenetic and transcriptional alterations in DMD muscles We will perform an integrated bioinformatic
analysis of pcHi-C, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data to identify DMD-associated pathogenic chromatin
interactions (DMD PCI) in DMD MuSCs and myofibers, and their susceptibility to µ-dys expression. Aim 4.
Contraction-induced alterations in high-order chromatin interactions at pathogenic loci in DMD
muscles and reversibility by dys restoration We will determine the effect of muscle contraction on PCI and
gene expression at loci of pathogenic genes, within the context of dys deficiency and upon µ-dys recovery.
Understanding whether dys deficiency causes epigenetic perturbations responsible for pathogenic
transcriptional output of DMD muscles, and whether they could be reversed by µ-dys expression, will invariably
extend our knowledge on DMD pathogenesis and on the therapeutic efficacy of µ-dys based gene therapies."
10848849,"Project Summary
 The laboratory mouse plays a central role in the preclinical development of new therapeutic strategies
and through the application of transgenic technology has proven to represent a clean genetic model to test
hypotheses related to the molecular of cancer etiology. Moreover, these models are generally reliable
predictors of drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy in vivo.
 Core B proposes two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will engineer human and mouse cell lines using
CRISPR genome engineering to disrupt genes identified by each of the Projects, confirm loss of function
through robust quality control, and distribute these cell lines to the Projects for further analysis. Somatic
genome engineering will be used to generate GEMM models that have specific genes co-mutated ab initio to
test their role in treatment response, Specific Aim 2 will provide professionalized in vivo therapeutic analysis
using the models already in hand or generated in the previous aim, standardizing treatment studies between
each of the Projects.
 These Specific Aims will bring to bear multiple cutting-edge technologies used for in vivo cancer
modeling, disease monitoring by small animal imaging, pharmacodynamic analysis, and combination efficacy
studies to directly test the hypotheses generated in each of the Projects."
10849088,"PROJECT 1: SUMMARY
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a rising cause of cancer-related mortality. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), especially its aggressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a leading cause of cirrhosis
and HCC. Gene-environmental interactions underlie the development of HCC in NAFLD. The I148M variant of
the patatin-like phospholipase A-3 (PNPLA3I148M) gene is one of the best-described genetic determinants of
HCC risk across multiple etiologies of chronic liver disease, including NAFLD. The mechanisms by which
PNPLA3I148M leads to HCC are poorly understood. This gap in knowledge limits the ability to develop targeted
preventive and therapeutic strategies for those with NAFLD carrying this mutation. It is our long-term goal to
better understand the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the factors driving progression to cirrhosis and HCC and
translate this information into preventive, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. This project is a natural
evolution of our collaboration with ELEVATE program investigators and represents one of four interrelated
projects targeting aspects of metabolic inflammation as a driver of HCC in NAFLD. Building on our previous
publications and preliminary data, this project will test the central hypothesis that the PNPLA3I148M variant
promotes HCC development in the setting of NASH via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)
activation in hepatocytes and macrophages via three specific aims: 1) Define the role of hepatic S1PR2
activation in Myc activation in PNPLA3I148M-associated NASH-HCC; 2) Define the role of S1PR2 activation in
monocyte-derived macrophages as a PNPLA3I148M-related driver of inflammation, NASH progression, and
HCC; 3) Test the therapeutic effects of a Myc inhibitor and S1PR2 antagonist on PNPLA3I148M-associated
HCC. Our studies have shown that dysregulated bile acid homeostasis is closely associated with NASH-HCC
disease progression. Bile acids are important signaling molecules and play a critical role in hepatic lipid
metabolism by activating different bile acid receptors. We have also previously shown that conjugated primary
bile acid-induced activation of S1PR2 plays an important role in regulating hepatic lipid and glucose
metabolism. Our preliminary data further showed that bile acid levels and composition were significantly
changed in human NASH patients and NASH mice, especially with overexpression of PNPLA3I148M. It has been
well-established that Myc is a prototypic oncogene involved in various cancers, including HCC. Our preliminary
studies also showed that bile acid-induced activation of S1PR2 in the liver and macrophages contributes to
NASH progression. In this project, the newly developed NASH-HCC mouse models with liver-specific
overexpression of human PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M variant in our diet-induced animal model of NAFLD
(DIAMOND) will be used to test the therapeutic effects by targeting Myc and S1PR2. Completion of our
proposed studies will have a major impact by providing novel insights on mechanisms of HCC development in
NASH, especially in the context of PNPLA3I148M that will inform future therapeutic strategies."
10849089,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal disease with an alarming increase in incidence and mortality.
Obesity-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of HCC. Immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) have been approved for HCC treatment, but patients with HCC and underlying NASH (NASH-
HCC) do not respond as well to ICIs. The lack of effective treatment for advanced HCC mandates that novel
players regulating HCC be identified that might be targeted to develop effective combinatorial therapies. The
oncogene MYC plays a key role in the development and progression of HCC, including NASH-HCC, and the
MYC gene is frequently amplified in HCC patients. TATA-box binding protein associated factor 2 (TAF2) gene
shows the highest co-amplification with MYC. As yet, there are no studies analyzing the role of TAF2 in cancer,
including HCC. Our preliminary studies unravel overexpression of TAF2 in human HCC and a significantly
strong negative correlation between TAF2 expression levels and HCC patient survival. In mouse liver,
overexpression of MYC alone induced HCC with a variable degree; TAF2 alone did not induce tumors, but the
combination of TAF2 and MYC generated robust HCC, indicating that these co-amplified genes cooperate to
promote aggressive HCC. Interaction was observed between MYC and TAF2, and RNA-sequencing revealed
significant modulation of MYC-mediated gene regulation upon TAF2 overexpression. TAF2 knockdown in
human HCC cells profoundly inhibited migration and invasion, and a hepatocyte-targeted nanoparticle
delivering TAF2 siRNA inhibited mouse HCC allografts in syngeneic mice. Interestingly, knocking down TAF2
in human HCC cells conferred increased susceptibility to MYCi975, a specific MYC inhibitor that synergistically
enhances ICI efficacy. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that 1) as transcriptional regulators, MYC
and TAF2 cooperate to promote HCC by inducing a global change in transcription, 2) TAF2 is required for the
maintenance of HCC, and 3) combined inhibition of MYC and TAF2 augments ICI therapeutic efficacy, thus
serving as an efficient way to counteract HCC. These hypotheses will be interrogated by investigating the
molecular mechanism by which MYC and TAF2 promote HCC and the role of TAF2 during HCC development
and progression using a conditional TAF2 knockout mouse, and by evaluating combined inhibition of MYC and
TAF2 along with ICI as a therapeutic strategy in endogenous mouse models of HCC and NASH-HCC. This
proposal is innovative and has important mechanistic and translational significance with the potential to affect
survival for scores of patients with HCC."
10849090,"PROJECT 3: SUMMARY
Given the limited clinical benefits of the current treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there is an
urgent need for novel approaches to improve patient outcomes. This project seeks to understand the host
molecular determinants in immune surveillance and therapeutic responsiveness of HCC by focusing on the
innate pattern recognition receptor SRA/CD204 that is primarily expressed on cells of myeloid origin. In this
project, we will test the hypothesis that SRA acts as a previously unrecognized immune checkpoint on myeloid
cells by impairing immune recognition during hepatocarcinogenesis and facilitating therapeutic resistance
particularly to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data
showing increased immune-mediated regression of HCC and HCC susceptibility to anti-PD-1 therapy in the
absence of SRA. The overall goals of this project are to examine SRA-centric molecular pathways within the
myeloid cell compartment of the tumor microenvironment that promote immune tolerance and develop novel
combination strategies using therapeutic antibodies for SRA to achieve durable control of HCC. To accomplish
the objectives, we will first establish a critical role of SRA for promoting cancer-immune evasion using mouse
models of HCC including the oncogene MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis as well as experimental tools that
we have generated (e.g., an SRA conditional knockout mouse). Additionally, we will mechanistically
understand the SRA function in defining HCC responsiveness to ICI-based immunotherapy. Considering the T-
cell suppressive activity of a soluble form of SRA, we will also examine its alteration during disease
progression in mouse models and in human HCC. Lastly, we will evaluate SRA-targeting antibody blockade as
a novel means to reinvigorate immune activation that can be rationally combined with ICIs and/or targeted
therapy (e.g., MYCi975) for safe and effective HCC control. It is anticipated that successful completion of the
proposed research via synergistic collaborations with other projects of the ELEVATE P01 will help fill the
scientific gap in understanding host molecular components that can govern cancer-immune escape and
treatment resistance. Importantly, validation of blocking antibodies for SRA may lead to an innovative strategy
to reprogram the immune landscape of HCC and improve the treatment outcomes for patients."
10849091,"PROJECT 4: SUMMARY
Innovative therapeutic strategies are warranted to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the
most common malignancies worldwide with current approaches being inadequate in accomplishing the
ultimate goal of curing this aggressive cancer. The focus of our project is to address this need and develop
improved molecular medicine(s) that selectively and specifically suppress primary liver tumor(s) and stimulate
enhanced immune responses to eliminate distant metastatic tumors. MDA-7/IL-24, a unique therapeutic
cytokine (secreted protein therapeutic) discovered in our laboratory, displays multifaceted anti-tumor properties
and confirmed safety and efficacy in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced cancers following direct
administration in a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad.5-mda-7). Mechanism of action studies indicate that
MDA-7/IL-24 has profound anti-cancer activity, which occurs by direct induction of apoptosis and toxic
autophagy, inhibition of angiogenesis, enhanced recognition of cancer cells by the immune system, potent
“bystander” anti-tumor activity affecting both primary and metastatic cancers, and synergy with conventional
therapies (including radiation, chemotherapy, antibody-based therapy, and immunotherapy). Using a genetic
engineering strategy, we developed and provide proof-of-principle that the next generation of MDA-7/IL-24,
M7S/IL-24S, is superior in comparison with wild-type protein. In Aim 1, we engineered a fusion protein (IL-
24S/IL-15) with IL-24S and IL-15 to create an immuno-enhancing Fusion Superkine, FSK. Both IL-24S and IL-
24S/IL-15 will be incorporated in a cancer-selective conditionally replication-competent cancer terminator virus
(CTV) that is predicted to have superior anti-cancer attributes. In Aim 2, we will examine the efficacy of natural
killer (NK) cells expressing our modified/Fusion Superkine. Experiments will evaluate the feasibility of cell-
based therapies of HCC using these designer cytokine proteins in a single moiety, IL-24S/IL-15, which will elicit
both tumor-killing and immune modulatory effects along with NK-mediated cytotoxicity. In Aim 3, to accurately
target and deliver therapeutic payloads to the liver, we will use a novel state-of-the-art delivery strategy that
involves temporarily and non-invasively altering permeability of the liver using empty microbubbles (MBs) and
focused ultrasound (FUS) and then delivering the therapeutic in a second MB and releasing it in the liver with
FUS, i.e., the focused ultrasound double microbubble delivery (FUS-DMB) approach. Once the parameters for
efficient delivery of viruses to the liver are optimized, we will evaluate the activity of our therapeutics to treat
HCC. To improve activity of our CTV expressing FSK, a combinatorial regimen will be established with
Standard of Care or investigational drugs using multiple authentic HCC pre-clinical animal models. Successful
completion of the goals of our research offer opportunities to effectively treat HCC non-invasively.
Accomplishing these goals would result in a paradigm shift in how patients with liver cancer are clinically
managed."
10849092,"CORE 2 - MOUSE MODELS AND PATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS CORE: SUMMARY
The purpose of Core 2 is to support the research of each of the projects in the ELEVATE program project grant
(PPG) by providing access to uniform mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and high-quality
human HCC tumor tissues and patient blood samples and by providing pathological analysis of both mouse
and human tumor specimens. This Core is co-directed by two investigators who bring expertise in mouse
models of cancer (Dr. Windle) and in oncologic pathology (Dr. Idowu), and the core benefits from the
capabilities and resources available in the Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center
Transgenic/Knockout Mouse Core and the Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core, directed by Drs.
Windle and Idowu, respectively. The primary function of the Mouse Models component of Core 2 will be to
generate and provide experimental animals of three sophisticated mouse models of HCC, including 1)
DIAMOND/AAV-PNPLA3I148M mice, which develop NAFLD, NASH, and HCC in response to a high-fat/high-
sugar “Western diet”; 2) an orthotopic mouse model of HCC/NASH; 3) a Sleeping Beauty-Hydrodynamic Tail
Vein Injection (SB-HDTV) model, in which administration of plasmids encoding MYC alone or in combination
with other oncogenes results in efficient HCC formation; and 4) the DEN/CCl4 model in which treatment with a
potent hepatocarcinogen regimen results in reproducible HCC development. Because these models require a
degree of technical expertise and extensive oversight during production, centralizing their production in a core
will enhance both consistency and efficiency across the ELEVATE program. The functions of the Pathological
Analysis component of Core 2 are two-fold: 1) to provide ready access to high-quality, de-identified frozen and
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human HCC tumor specimens with accompanying demographic, clinical,
histopathological, and molecular annotation, as well as patient blood samples; and 2) to perform pathological
analysis/interpretation of both mouse and human liver and tumor samples. Centralizing the pathological
analysis will provide for consistency in pathological read-outs across projects. Through the provision of high-
quality reagents (experimental animals or human tumor and tissue specimens) and services, Core 2 will
enhance both integration across the projects as well as the rigor and reproducibility of the resulting science
generated from this PPG."

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common mental disorders. For unknown reasons, many
patients do not respond to existing treatments. Treatment guidelines and systematic reviews often recommend
CBT as the first line treatment, and then to start an SSRI adjunctively for patients who show no or only partial
response to initial CBT. A major advance and step toward personalized medicine would be to identify reliable
treatment predictors and to clarify the neuromechanism of treatment change. One promising approach toward
improving patient outcomes is to examine the key neurocircuitry of SAD that may also serve as neuromarkers
to predict treatment response. We have gathered convincing pilot data pointing to such neuromarkers to
predict response to CBT for SAD. The next translational step and our primary aim is to apply state of the art
computational psychiatry approaches to further establish the evidence of these neuromarkers, in line with
moving psychiatry toward precision medicine. This aim will be efficiently achieved by collecting multimodal data
to better elucidate key neurocircuitry in SAD compared to controls with state-of-the art neuroimaging in a well
powered sample, as well as differential treatment related changes in neural circuitry (target engagement). The
ultimate goal is to effectively treat all patients, not only a few and without knowing why, and to illuminate the
brain circuitry associated with effective treatments in order to inform psychopathology, nosology, and therapy
of common mental disorders. For these reasons, we propose to recruit a large number of patients with SAD (n
= 190) and healthy controls (n = 50) to examine differences in relevant neurocircuitries that will also be used as
neuromarkers of treatment response. Patients with SAD will first receive CBT group therapy. Those who show
no or only partial response will then receive individual and tailored CBT plus SSRI. In addition to MRI
measures, we will examine EEG and behavioral measures to determine whether there may be less expensive
correlates of neuropredictors that can be easily implemented in clinical practice. We have assembled a team of
skilled researchers with complementary expertise at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT; John D.

Ph.D.), as well as outstanding consultants in neuroimaging analysis (Northeastern University: Susan Whitfield-

10866403,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging, affecting ~5.4 million
individuals in the United States with a predicted increase to 13.8 million by 2050. This would be a substantial
burden on healthcare systems. Thus, developing new and effective treatment strategies is imperative. In this
vein, changes in metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified as hallmarks of the aging
process. The brain consumes ~20% of the body's glucose, of which ~80% is metabolized in mitochondria to
generate ATP and support brain function. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in decreased ATP production and
release of free radicals with elevated oxidative stress during aging. Mitochondrial function is mediated, in part,
by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, including oxidizing and reducing forms, i.e. NAD+ and NADH).
Unfortunately, decreases in NAD+ levels, and consequently the redox ratio (NAD+/NADH), are associated with
normal aging, especially after age 45, and also with numerous diseases such as AD. Accumulating evidence
suggests that nicotinamide riboside (NR), an orally bioavailable precursor of NAD+, can enhance mitochondrial
function and help slow or reverse these age-related abnormalities. Currently, 30+ clinical trials, including two AD
studies, are registered on clinicaltrials.gov using NR and related compounds. However, no studies to date have
investigated in vivo metabolic and bioenergetic changes associated with NR supplementation because of the
challenges in measuring NAD+/NADH, namely low concentration (<1mM) and overlapping resonances with other
metabolites. Such measurement requires dedicated, state-of-the-art imaging approaches. To that end, we have
developed novel neuroimaging approaches to measure in vivo NAD+ and NADH, as well as other markers of
mitochondrial function, including creatine kinase (CK)/ATPase activity and the antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—
a molecule essential for cellular repair that has functional ties to NAD. These technical achievements undergird
our current proposal, which aims to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms and clinical effects of NR in
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/mild AD using in vivo neuroimaging techniques. We propose a 12-
week, open-label, proof of concept study to measure the effects of oral NR (1g/day) on brain energy metabolism,
oxidative stress, and cognitive functioning in MCI/mild AD patients. This study may provide crucial information
about NAD-related molecular mechanisms in MCI/AD, and facilitate the development and refinement of this
promising treatment approach. In summary, our innovative theoretical framework, driven by our pilot data and
published literature, includes three conceptual prongs: first, MCI/mild AD is associated with excessive redox
dysregulation, oxidative stress and deficient mitochondrial function; second, these abnormalities could be
remediated by NR; and third, the downstream effects of NR would accelerate CK/ATPase activities, thereby
increasing GSH levels and, in turn, improving cognitive function. Thus, identifying the precise molecular
mechanisms involved in MCI/AD-related bioenergetic dysfunction will provide important therapeutic targets."

Inappropriate use of thyroid ultrasound (iTUS) is an important driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and
overtreatment, which involves high-risk procedures and long-term therapeutics that cause medical,
psychosocial, and financial hardships for patients. Cumulative annual cost of well-differentiated thyroid cancer
care in the U.S. has been estimated to exceed $1.5 billion and is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2030, and
the potential cost after 5 years of thyroid cancer diagnosis is $50,000 per patient. Thyroid cancer is one of the
fastest-growing cancers in the U.S, but mortality remains very low. Approximately 25% of new cases are
attributable to the identification of small thyroid cancers that are unlikely to cause harm if they were left
undiagnosed and untreated. The biggest driver of small thyroid cancer diagnosis is iTUS use in asymptomatic
people, a practice discouraged by clinical guidelines. The pervasiveness of iTUS despite recommendations
against it suggests the need for active strategies to eliminate it. The process of eliminating practices that are
not evidence-based is known as de-implementation. To date, no studies have provided a replicable and useful
way for health systems to identify their iTUS practices, and there has been no systematic evaluation of
multilevel factors driving it, such that we lack key information about targeted, acceptable, and feasible de-
implementation strategies. Without them, overuse will persist. To fill this gap, we will leverage a
multidisciplinary team with vast experience in computer phenotyping expertise, machine learning, and mixed
method research. We will also use two unique databases: the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a medical
record-linkage system that captures health care information from the entire population of 27 counties in
Minnesota and Wisconsin, and the Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) that shares a
common data model to organize data into a standard structure. There are three aims. Aim 1: Using the REP
and two PCORnet sites, to develop a replicable computer phenotype to identify patients receiving iTUS. Aim 2:
Using 4 PCORnet sities, to identify patient, clinician, and practice factors associated with iTUS in a
representative sample of healthcare practices. Aim 3: Using mixed methods, to understand factors and identify
potential strategies for iTUS de-implementation acceptable to the patient, clinician, and health system
stakeholders. This proposal is responsive to the objectives of NOT-CA-20-021 to explore de-implementation of
ineffective or low-value clinical practices along the cancer care continuum. At the end of this study, we will
have developed and validated a computer phenotype to identify iTUS across diverse settings, as well as a list
of acceptable strategies likely to decrease iTUS. These findings will be broadly disseminable and will pave the
way for studies—deployed in diverse health systems and targeting patients, clincians, and organizations—that
test the effectiveness of the de-implementation strategies identified here."

Recent development in biomarker assays measuring amyloid beta and tau for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and an
accelerated approval of anti-amyloid antibody, Lecanemab, defined a new era of AD research. However, there
are no specific fluid or imaging biomarkers for primary tauopathies including progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), making clinical trial
designs challenging. We have recently identified specific forms of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that
reflect brain tau pathology and can identify subsets of primary tauopathies from healthy control groups and other
tauopathies. In this study, we propose to define when and which tau proteoforms change during disease
progression in familial and sporadic primary tauopathies. If successful, this study will facilitate accurate diagnosis
of primary tauopathies, determining clinical trial eligibility, evaluating drug efficacies, and developing treatment
based on underlying neuropathology in primary tauopathies. If successful, this study will start to realize personal
medicine for primary tauopathies and bridge the knowledge gap between AD research."
10864026,"Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is an early-onset, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease that
impacts the central and peripheral nervous systems. Pathologically, GAN is characterized by the
disorganization and aggregation of intermediate filaments (IF). Formed from self-assembling subunits, the IF
network spans the cell from the nucleus to the periphery. In GAN, many cell types show abnormalities in the
organization of IF, but neurons clearly bear the brunt of the pathology. Axons swell with the accumulation of
neuronal IF, and degenerate to cause the neurological symptoms of GAN. The gene mutated in GAN encodes
gigaxonin, a protein that belongs to the BTB/Kelch family of E3 ligase-like adaptor proteins. These proteins
typically play a role in ubiquitin-proteasome mediated protein degradation. Based on our own data that GAN
degrades neuronal IFs, we hypothesize that neurofilament aggregation creates steric roadblocks in neurites
that interfere with intracellular transport of organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes, resulting in
downstream pathology. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest gigaxonin plays a direct role in autophagy
via degradation of other substrates. We hypothesize that the disruption of this critical process exacerbates
GAN neuropathology by dysregulation of protein and organellar quality control. This proposal comprehensively
tests these models; thus the overall goal of our research is to understand the cellular pathogenesis of GAN
with a view to inspiring novel treatment strategies."

Few interventions targeting single food groups have demonstrated long-term health success. The Mediterranean
Diet dietary pattern has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause of
death in the US. Dietary behaviors established in childhood track into adulthood, suggesting that healthful dietary
behaviors should be established during childhood. Children living in low-income households are at greater risk
of CVD and generally have less healthful diets, indicating a need for interventions to help them adopt more
healthful dietary practices. Parents are the gatekeepers of the home food environment and influence children’s
dietary behaviors through parenting practices around food (i.e., modeling of eating behaviors, home availability).
Foods prepared and eaten at home have been associated with better diet quality. Cooking skills have been
associated with home meal preparation, and children enjoy cooking with their parents. Encouraging parents to
involve their child in home food preparation and using healthful food parenting practices may be an effective way
to help children adopt a healthful dietary pattern. However, to promote behavior change, interventions should be
convenient, enjoyable, and personally relevant. Since Internet use and access are prevalent, including among
families with lower incomes, the proposed research will build on our previous research with parent/child dyads
from low-income households to develop an online cooking education intervention that promotes the
Mediterranean dietary pattern and healthful food parenting practices. We will assess its feasibility, acceptability,
and preliminary efficacy with 44 parent/child dyads. The results of this study have the potential to enhance child
cardiovascular health and inform the design of digital interventions promoting sustainable dietary behaviors in
at-risk children."
10863861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most cellular behaviors and functions rely on cell signaling. A direct approach to detect this event is to record
cellular electrical potentials that are associated with various ionic kinetics during signal processing. It has been
shown that a wide range of high profile diseases, such as epilepsy, episodic ataxia, Alzheimer's, and
Parkinson's, may result from dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. Although
qualitative knowledge of the motions of these ions has been well studied, a quantitative understanding is still
missing because of the lack of tools that would allow high-spatiotemporal-resolution sampling of ion motions
inside cells. My group is dedicated to developing a soft electronic interface for cells and tissues. This synthetic
electronic interface will have similar mechanical properties to the biology, and can organically fuse with the
target cells and tissues, which will not only result in higher signal to noise ratio but also longer recording time
than conventional rigid and bulky recording systems. This five-year project aims to develop an innovative
cellular interface that is composed of an array of highly sensitive three-dimensional field effect transistor (FET)-
based sensors on a stretchable substrate. We use this innovative cellular interface to test the hypothesis that
ionic kinetics, including the speeds of ionic diffusion through ion channels in the cell membrane, ion drift driven
by ion pumps, and inter-cellular signal propagation, entail crucial quantitative information associated with
disorders of electrogenic cells, such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and electrically excitable endocrine cells.
The sensors can simultaneously record different positions of a single cell or among different cells in a cellular
network, thus enabling us to measure and calculate the time- or speed-related kinetic factors of the ions (i.e.,
the time at which the ions move in or out of the cell membrane and the speed at which they do, respectively).
Also, using an FET design, we can amplify the recorded signal directly at the targeting location, realizing as
much as ten-fold signal amplification. Furthermore, we can differentiate the specific ionic species that are
actively functioning inside and outside of the cells by coating the surfaces of the FET sensors with phospholipid
bilayers that have the corresponding ion channels, allowing the specific ions to permeate the cell membrane,
which would result in a change in electrical potential that could be recorded by the FET sensors. The
information acquired will help gain new insights in cellular communications, with profound implications for brain
sciences, cardiac physiology, and clinical practices.

10864818,"SUMMARY
Tumors are complex systems composed of genetically and transcriptionally heterogeneous cells, and this
heterogeneity has been implicated as a cause of drug resistance and overall mortality. Understanding intra-
tumor heterogeneity is therefore likely to have widespread impact, both fundamental and clinical. The advent of
single-cell RNA-Seq has led to the detection of transcriptionally distinct states among cancer cells across a
wide range of tumor types and stages. However, the field lacks robust computational and experimental
technologies to functionally identify and characterize these cancer cell states. In this project, we take a gene
module-centric view to define cell states in a rigorous and widely applicable manner. We will validate the
importance of each cell state using human samples and the zebrafish melanoma model, which has exceptional
capabilities for imaging and perturbation of cell states throughout tumor progression and metastasis. To
systematically characterize these cell states experimentally, we propose methods to assay their
interdependencies within the tumor and with elements of the microenvironment. Our genetically engineered
zebrafish will mark each cancer cell state with a fluorescent reporter and an ablation cassette, providing a
flexible experimental platform to study and perturb each cell state. The reporter will enable us to sort cancer
cell states and study them individually, with a particular emphasis on their plasticity. By systematically
disrupting cancer cell states, we will further elucidate their individual contributions to tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis. Using a spatial transcriptomics approach and integrating with single-cell RNA-seq
data, we will map cancer cell states in relation to their microenvironment to screen for putative interactions.
Finally, we will directly test predicted interactions between specific cancer cell states and the immune
compartment using T cell-deficient fish. Throughout our three Aims, we adopt a systems biology workflow that
iteratively cycles through modes of observations, perturbations, and refinement of our model of the functional
role of cancer cell states during tumor progression. Our proposal collectively integrates the complementary
expertise of the White and Yanai labs and sets out to significantly improve our understanding of intratumoral
heterogeneity through the lens of cancer cell states."

This proposal describes a 5-year research and career development plan that will enable Dr. Jarish Cohen to
achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded physician-scientist studying how regulatory T
cells (Tregs) protect cutaneous epithelial stem cells during development, homeostasis, and disease. Currently,
very little is known about the mechanisms skin-resident immune cells use to safeguard cutaneous epithelial stem
cells in inflammatory dermatoses and alopecias. The proposed research will focus on uncovering the
mechanisms by which Tregs protect hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) from attack by autoreactive T cells. Dr. Cohen
has generated a novel experimental in vivo model of Treg-mediated protection of HFSC from autoimmune attack,
that closely resembles a highly morbid form of human scarring alopecia. Additionally, he has pioneered a highly
innovative topical technique to delete genes specifically in skin-resident Tregs, which will allow him to resolve
organ-specific mechanisms of Treg-mediated immunoprotection of stem cells. In Aim 1, Dr. Cohen will elucidate
the spatial and temporal kinetics of Treg-mediated HFSC protection and dissect the mechanism of skin Treg
localization to the HFSC niche. Aim 2 will focus on elucidation of the distinct mechanisms that Tregs in the skin
and lymph nodes employ to safeguard against HFSC destruction. In Aim 3, Dr. Cohen will leverage
comprehensive transcriptomic and cutting-edge imaging technologies to identify molecules and pathways of
Treg dysfunction and altered patterns of Treg localization in human scarring alopecias. The aggregate data will
provide a major advancement in our understanding of how Tregs promote immune tolerance of epithelial stem
cells and have the potential to identify novel therapeutic strategies to treat human dermatoses.
During his post-doctoral work and as a Clinical Instructor in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
Dermatopathology Service, Dr. Cohen has strategically sought out additional training and mentorship in
cutaneous immunology. Under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Rosenblum, M.D., Ph.D., an expert in skin Treg
biology, the candidate, co-mentors (Drs. Jason Cyster, Ph.D., and Ophir Klein, M.D., Ph.D.), and scientific
advisors (Drs. Boris Bastian, M.D., Ph.D., and Abul Abbas M.D., Ph.D.) have developed a career development
plan for Dr. Cohen to gain additional experience in state of the art immunology and cutting-edge imaging
techniques, biostatistics, epithelial stem cell biology, and scientific communication. To enhance Dr. Cohen's
training, a multidisciplinary advisory committee consisting of mentors, scientific advisors, and Dr. Jayanta
Debnath, M.D., chair of the UCSF Department of Pathology, will meet biannually to review his progress and
support his career development. The proposed training program draws on the combined resources of the
Rosenblum Laboratory, the UCSF Immunology Training Program, and the UCSF Departments of Dermatology
and Pathology. This will provide an ideal setting for Dr. Cohen's transition to an independent investigator."
10864055,"Project Summary
Vascular adaptation after birth is dependent on closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA), a fetal vascular shunt
connecting the pulmonary artery and aorta. Failure of DA closure results in persistent patency of the DA (PDA),
a common disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the most vulnerable infants. Current
pharmacological treatments for PDA are limited and only focus on a single therapeutic pathway –
cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. However, recent data reveal complex networks of
genes and druggable pathways involved in the vasodilatory-to-vasoconstrictive shift that drives postnatal DA
closure. Efforts to identify new DA-selective vasoconstrictors overlook the possibility that ongoing vasodilatory
stimuli perpetuate DA relaxation and inhibit its closure. Because critically ill preterm newborns are exposed to
multiple medications during the time that DA closure takes place, we postulate that pharmacologic agents used
in the neonatal ICU prevent DA closure and contribute to PDA.
The DA of prematurely-born infants is developmentally primed to respond to vasodilatory signals. Our prior
studies using mouse models and human data show that drugs frequently used in preterm infants have
unexpected vasodilatory effects on the DA, including specific antibiotics, antacids, and diuretics. These data
suggest that drug-induced DA relaxation is a modifiable contributor to PDA, but this has not been systematically
evaluated. We therefore hypothesize that drugs commonly used in the NICU have an adverse effect on
closure of the premature DA and that specific drug combinations act synergistically to impair postnatal
DA closure. Mouse and human tissues will be used to test this hypothesis in three Aims: 1) Determine whether
drugs in the neonatal pharmacopeia prevent the initial phase of DA closure - smooth muscle constriction - that
leads to physiologic closure of the DA lumen; 2) Determine whether drugs in the neonatal pharmacopeia impair
the second phase of DA closure - fibromuscular remodeling - that leads to permanent sealing of the constricted
DA; 3) Identify drug combinations that interact to adversely affect either phase of DA closure. Drug effects will
be examined using primary (in vitro) high throughput screening (HTS) of preterm mouse DA smooth muscle
cells. A series of secondary screening assays will prioritize single- and synergistic combinations of hits based
on potency/efficacy, DA-selectivity, and toxicity for further study of their ex vivo and in vivo vasoactive effects on
the DA. A novel ex vivo mouse DA-reopening assay will be used to screen for drugs of interest. The effect of hit
DA-vasodilatory compounds will be examined on ex vivo human neonatal DA segments and in a large national
database of preterm infants. These studies have high translational potential and will definitively identify which
drugs or drug combinations pose increased risks for PDA in preterm infants, providing an innovative approach
to enhance conservative PDA management efforts in the NICU."
10864056,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%.
Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if
they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued
IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a
compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the
arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular
remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the
contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional
indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include
inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses
in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes,
leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA
growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may
create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may
naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be
investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew
consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is
significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different
patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose
a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize
IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with
the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling
within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3)
Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease
progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging
biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet
need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it
will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while
implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of
cerebrovascular changes"

There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple
brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and
seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of
brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures,
and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and
deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of
water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the
neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result
and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic
edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative
ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal
seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been
described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long-
term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results
in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs)
move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis
is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema.
We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement
into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of
cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging
techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different
transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while
altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel
deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover
fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during
early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on
neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema,
which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are
associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke."

This proposal investigates statistical models for developing mobile health (mHealth) measures using patient
generated health data (PGHD) with high complexity and temporality. The emergence of mHealth technologies
and computational tools are rapidly expanding their use in research and clinical settings, and engaging patients
in self-management. mHealth technology further allows integration of multifarious data streams to improve
outcome measurement and prediction to aid clinical decision making. To maximize their actionability, however,
there is a need to investigate novel approaches for design, development and evaluation of mHealth-based
measures. We ground our investigation in chronic pelvic pain (CPP) as the disease model, a prevalent,
complex disorder with high societal burden and quality of life (QoL) impact. There is substantial heterogeneity
between patients and day-to-day variations in how CPP unfolds. Therefore, mHealth methods are particularly
valuable for capturing the complex disease scenarios. There are no CPP-specific self-reported measures to
assess disease status or treatment response. We propose to investigate models that can handle the inherent
challenges of PGHD to derive ecologically valid and actionable self-tracking measures for patient outcomes in
health settings. The Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Investigate “critical windows of tracking” for
mHealth-based disease outcome measurement. We will enroll 90 participants undergoing 12 weeks of
physical therapy treatment for their CPP to use a mHealth app for tracking their symptoms, daily function, and
medications. We will triangulate these data with clinician assessments and passive data on sleep and activity
to build distributed lag models (DLMs) to identify predictors that can be used for outcome monitoring. Specific
Specific Aim 2. Investigate a functional data analytic framework grounded in CPP to develop self-
tracking pain and QoL measures. We will enroll 180 CPP patients to track their disease symptoms through a
mHealth app and wear activity monitors for 3 months. Through a series of supervised and unsupervised
models leveraging functional data analytic methods, we will identify variables to inform the design of the
composite pain and QoL measures. Aim 2a. Design and develop a multidimensional self-tracking pain
measure. We will build estimation models where the unit of observation is a set of curves (i.e., pain location,
severity, type) over time, leveraging functional data analytic methods. Aim 2b. Design and develop a flexible
self-tracking QoL measure. We will assess the relative predictive ability of individual items on CPP symptoms
to derive a CPP-specific QoL measure that can be used at the day- vs week-level. Exploratory Aim 2: We will
assess disease specificity of the models by comparing output from a non-CPP control group. Flexible, non-
parametric data approaches allow maximizing the features of the available mHealth technology, which can aid
in robust models to inform design of mHealth-based disease measures. Proposed work addresses the gap in
mHealth evidence-base to improve the application and translation of efficacious mHealth assessments."
10864834,"Summary. There is a dearth of information in any system about how developmental experiences have lasting
influence on behavioral patterns. However, the multitude of examples of experiences directing typical, atypical,
and therapeutic neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans and research animals indicates that the
mechanisms by which experience-dependent plasticity modifies maturational programs in behaviorally-relevant
brain circuits have broad implications. Why does our neurobiological understanding lag behind the behavioral
evidence? Perhaps it is because linking juvenile experiences with adult behaviors requires a careful tracking of
several timescales: from moment-to moment changes that occur rapidly with each relevant experience, to
longer timeframes that take into account accumulated experiences, and the sustained backdrop of experience-
independent maturational progression with which these experience-dependent changes intersect. No one
measure or methodology can capture these dynamics. This is a large challenge, one that necessitates a
research model that has strong, established experience-behavior links across development. The zebra finch
songbird is such a model. In these birds, juvenile song experience has relevant and life-long consequences on
adult patterns of social behavior in both males and females, in males, the structure of the song he sings his
entire adult life and in females, her song and mate preferences; mate pairs stay together their entire lives.
Song processing requires the higher-order association components of the auditory forebrain in males and
females. Generally, it is obvious that epigenetic and molecular regulation of transcription and translation are at
the core of neural plasticity, both maturational and experience-dependent, but it is not yet totally clear in any
system how these mechanisms operate in concert to encode experiences during maturational stages such that
they emerge as stable behaviors months and years later. Our published and preliminary data lead to our
central hypothesis, that the specific mechanisms operating within the male and female juvenile auditory
forebrain, while controlled by the same broad epigenetic and molecular regulatory processes, are distinct. To
reduce the gap between observations of experience-behavior links and the mechanisms that mediate these
connections, we have two current goals, 1) establish that adult behavior in both sexes is influenced by
epigenetic and molecular processes as a result of accumulated and acute juvenile song experiences, 2)
determine the extent to which specific mediators of cell structure and function are unique in juvenile male and
female auditory forebrains. We will achieve these goals in three aims, which 1) test the role of histone H3
acetylation in gating the strength of juvenile song experiences on adult patterns of behavior and the regulatory
transcription factors that may coordinate that link, 2) identify the “first wave” of epigenetic and molecular
responses to hearing song that initiate neural remodeling, and 3) determine the extent to which molecular
control of transcription and translation known to be necessary for adult behaviors differs by sex."

The indigenous microbiota plays a critical role in the health of their host by contributing to an ecosystem (the
microbiome) that reflects a stable environment shaped by the host and the resident microbes. Normal resident
microbes contribute to homeostatic functions including fostering immune system maturation, protecting against
pathogen invasion and assisting digestion of food. Conversely, many age-associated conditions such as
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes have been associated with abnormal
host-microbe interactions. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop therapeutic strategies and tactics that
permit us to foster beneficial host-microbe interactions and improve disease outcomes in older adults. In order
to accomplish this goal, we need to understand how the microbiota changes over the lifespan of the individual
and how this alters host function. The specific objective of this proposal is to understand how age-related
changes in the microbiota alters susceptibility to outcomes of infection with the pathogen Clostridioides difficile.
C. difficile infection (CDI) following disruption of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic administration causes
significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly patients are more susceptible to CDI and are at increased risk of
developing disease-related complications following infection. We hypothesize that changes in the microbiota and
host related to aging underlie the increased susceptibility to CDI that contributes to worse outcome of infection
in older adults. We will test our hypothesis with 3 specific aims conducted in a robust animal model of CDI. 1)
Compare and contrast the structure and function of the microbiome over the age range of mice. 2) Determine
the role that the microbiome has on shaping host immune responses related to age using CDI as a model disease
condition. 3) Investigate the possibility of manipulating the host and the indigenous microbiota to alter health and
disease. In this proposal, we intend to perform detailed investigations on the effects of aging on the microbiome
and the outcome of C. difficile infection. We will leverage a murine model of CDI for these studies. The results
of these studies should provide important insights on the relationship between advancing age, the host and the
microbiota that could improve our ability to deal with CDI and other conditions that are influenced by the
microbiota over the lifespan."

In 2012, Promega introduced NanoLuc, an ATP-independent marine luciferase mutant exhibiting a high photon
production rate in the presence of a synthetic luciferin analog, furimazine. However, NanoLuc has several
unfavorable features, including low tissue penetration of its blue emission, and limited substrate solubility and
stability. Recent studies (including our efforts) have partially addressed these issues, but there are remaining
key hurdles that prevent a broader adoption of NanoLuc-derived bioluminescence systems for in vivo animal
imaging.
The overall objective of this 4-year R01 project is to develop next-generation ATP-independent luciferases,
luciferins, and bioluminescent calcium indicators to greatly facilitate imaging experiments in small animals.
Leveraging our strong preliminary results and sustained research interests and expertise in the relevant areas,
we will pursue the following three Specific Aims:
1. Develop shelf-stable and water-soluble luciferins.
2. Develop further red-shifted luciferase-luciferin pairs.
3. Engineer next-generation bioluminescent calcium indicators with enhanced physiological responsiveness.
The outcomes of this project will be bioluminescent tools to facilitate imaging studies in animal models. These
fundamental research tools will further catalyze an extensive array of biological and biomedical studies."
10825157,"The incretin receptors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide receptor (GIPR), are therapeutic Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) targets. Incretins bind to their
respective receptors on beta () cells to activate adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and generate cAMP, the second
messenger necessary to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Although GIPR and GLP-1R are Gs-
coupled GPCRs that share the same downstream signaling cascades, I discovered that they elicit profoundly
different kinetics of cAMP generation in primary  cells. The mechanisms underlying the difference between
GIPR and GLP-1R signaling are unknown. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the signaling and trafficking
between GIPR and GLP-1R in primary  cells has not been performed. This knowledge gap prompts the need
to improve our understanding of incretin signaling towards more effective T2D treatments. Details of the kinetics
of incretin-induced cAMP responses and how they are affected by GPCR trafficking and the nutrient stimulated
Ca2+ responses, are not well established. By imaging genetically encoded cAMP sensors expressed in  cells, I
have identified differences in the cAMP kinetics of  cells to GIP and GLP-1 stimulation. I propose that these
stark differences connect to differences in receptor trafficking and may explain in part the known differences in
effectiveness between both incretins. Furthermore, I also discovered that incretin-mediated cAMP production is
paradoxically inhibited by Ca2+ induced by glucose and other stimuli, suggesting a dynamic interaction between
Ca2+ and Ca2+-regulated ACs that shapes the kinetics of cAMP formation and determines the  cell insulin
secretory response to nutrient and incretin co-stimulation. My overarching hypothesis is that receptor trafficking,
-Arrestin preferences, and the interplay between Ca2+ and ACs underlie dynamic cAMP kinetics of  cells in
response to nutrient and incretin co-stimulation. I will test this hypothesis in two separate aims that converge on
the functional imaging of primary  cells. In Aim 1, I will quantify trafficking of SNAP-tag incretin receptors co-
expressed with a genetically encoded cAMP sensor in HEK293 cells and primary mouse  cells to determine
how incretin receptor trafficking influences cAMP responses. I will also assess changes in incretin-mediated
cAMP responses in the absence of -Arrestins. In Aim 2 I will multiplex genetically encoded cAMP and Ca2+
sensors to determine the interplay between cAMP and Ca2+ across hundreds of  cells in islets that lack key
ACs. These approaches are innovative as they leverage novel transgenic mouse that expresses endogenous
SNAP-tag GLP-1R in every  cell in islets. Separately, I can quantify cAMP and Ca2+ dynamics in the same cells
using genetically encoded spectrally compatible fluorescent sensors. These proposed aims are significant as
they will provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics that dictate how different
incretins achieve insulin release under nutrient stimulation. This understanding carries significant weight in the
development of improved incretin dual agonists to treat T2DM and improve patient outcomes."
10825161,"Pancreatic islet crosstalk is essential to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Central to this crosstalk are the
somatostatin (Sst)-secreting delta cells, which serve to regulate the activity of insulin-secreting beta and
glucagon-secreting alpha cells. Crosstalk between beta and delta cells is of particular importance as it is often
lost or dysregulated in diseases characterized by dysglycemia like diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism
(CHI). It is well established that insulin and Sst secretion are coordinated, but there is no consensus on the
mechanism of this coordination. Published data demonstrating a 30 second lag between insulin and Sst secretion
coupled with our previously published observation that the beta cell hormone Urocortin 3 stimulates delta cell
Sst secretion illustrate the importance of paracrine coordination of beta-delta cell secretion. However, an
alternative and potentially parallel mechanism is gap junction coupling. Preliminary data using the calcium
reporter GCaMP6s simultaneously expressed in beta and delta cells demonstrates that delta cell response to
high glucose is profoundly heterogenous compared to beta cells, with both beta cell coordinated and
uncoordinated calcium oscillations observed in the majority of delta cells. Based on these data delta cells can
be subdivided into 7 distinct subpopulations suggesting that a single mechanism may be insufficient to fully
describe beta-delta cell coordination. This has informed the hypothesis that delta cells coordinate with beta cells
predominantly via paracrine signaling with a minor subpopulation of highly synchronous delta cells showing
calcium behaviors consistent with gap junction coupling. The mechanism(s) of crosstalk between beta and delta
cells will be addressed in two aims. Aim 1 will focus on how gap junction coupling could contribute to coordinating
a small subpopulation of highly synchronous delta cells. Aim 2 will focus on the role paracrine signaling plays in
coordinating the majority of delta cells with beta cells during glucose stimulation. To assess the extent of gap
junction coupling in Aim 1 the whole cell patch clamp technique will be used to deliver small gap junction
permeable tracers into beta and delta cells within intact islets. To investigate the role of gap junction coupling
between beta cells and this small subset of highly synchronous delta cells live cell Ca2+ imaging will be followed
by post-hoc immunohistochemical staining of Cx36. To address the predominant role of paracrine signaling in
coordinated delta and beta cell activity in Aim 2, inhibitors of secretion will be used while assessing changes in
the level of coordination between beta and delta cells via Ca2+ imaging. These approaches are innovative by: 1)
connecting heterogeneous delta cell behavior to underlying mechanisms of coordination in response to glucose
stimulation in intact islets. 2) resolving the predominant mechanism(s) of coordination between beta and delta
cells. These aims are significant as they will definitively establish the mechanism(s) by which beta and delta cells
communicate to coordinate their activity in response to high glucose, paving the way for the development of
novel therapeutics aimed at re-establishing healthy islet crosstalk in diseases like diabetes and CHI."

 The link between prostate cancer (PCa) risk and alcohol consumption has long been debated. We recently
found in an extensive assessment of the epidemiologic data that, since the onset of the PSA testing era, most
studies indicate alcohol consumption is strongly associated with PCa risk. Despite this epidemiologic support,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms linking alcohol to PCa risk, progression, and mortality. Dr.
Petrosyan introduced the concept of ""onco-Golgi,"" where the Golgi becomes fragmented, resulting in altered
glycosylation and trafficking of glycoproteins. Additionally, this Golgi disorganization is linked to activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. This results in increased plasma
membrane (PM) expression of αv integrins abnormally glycosylated by Golgi glycosyltransferase, N-
acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (MGAT5). Importantly, these MGAT5-modified integrins form clusters with
pentameric Galectin-3, resulting in increased retention on the PM. This, in turn, modulates tumor cell behavior,
including adhesion and migration, which promotes prostate tumor dissemination to lymph nodes and distant
organs. We have found that ethanol (EtOH) treatment aggravates Golgi disorganization and PCa tissues from
heavy alcoholics have higher MGAT5 expression and PM Integrin αv levels. We propose that EtOH promotes
PCa lethality by increasing Integrin αv-mediated PCa progression. Altered glycosylation of Integrin αv in the onco-
Golgi is expected to be exacerbated by alcohol's disorganizing effect on Golgi. Preliminary data demonstrate a
positive correlation between the number of Golgi fragments and the PM intensity of Integrin αv in EtOH-treated
docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Importantly, we have found that PCa Golgi disorganization is autophagy-driven
and that the autophagy inhibitor, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), restores the compact Golgi in advanced PCa cells.
We have also shown that ATF6-mediated ER stress results in expression of underglycosylated, high-Mannose
(high-Man) integrins to the PM through ER-PM junctions. Depletion of ATF6 decreases the amount of high-Man
integrins on the PM and in ER-PM junctions, as well as reduces the total number of ER-PM communications.
We have demonstrated the synergistic effect of Golgi restoration by HCQ and ER stress inhibition by ATF6
depletion in preventing orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis. These exciting data led us to expect that similar
combination treatments will decrease the pro-metastatic effects of EtOH administration. We have observed
rescued Golgi morphology in cells treated with both EtOH and HCQ, suggesting that Golgiphagy, blocked by
HCQ, is involved in EtOH-induced Golgi disorganization. Additionally, HCQ restores the level of PM Integrin αv
to that of control cells. We expect that combined HCQ treatment and ATF6 depletion will effectively attenuate
the effects of EtOH on PCa aggressiveness and metastasis. Overall, these data will shed light on the previously
unknown mechanism of alcohol-promoted prostate tumor growth and metastasis and provide a potentially
effective therapeutic strategy."
10825911,"Abstract: Measuring Racial Equity and Institutional Racism in Primary Care (EQUIP)
 Disparities in healthcare quality and health outcomes for Black patients compared to White patients
have been demonstrated across a range of diseases even after accounting for access to care. In addition,
studies document poorer health outcomes for Black compared to White patients who receive care within the
same practice setting, highlighting the role of healthcare systems and organizations as contributors to
disparities. Yet, there are no validated measures of healthcare practice-level determinants of health disparities.
 Racism is a fundamental cause of inequities in health. A large body of research has focused on the
influence of interpersonal racism and more recently structural racism on health outcomes for Black individuals.
In this application, we focus on another level of racism--practice-level institutional racism. Based on a review of
the literature and stakeholder engagement, we define practice-level institutional racism as structures,
practices, policies, processes, and norms within a healthcare setting which create or reinforce healthcare
inequities between White and Black or other minoritized patients. Factors such as racial diversity of providers,
standardized processes to facilitate evidence-based care, and equity-focused quality improvement have been
proposed as important to practice-based efforts to address disparities. However, to-date, the domains of
practice-level institutional racism have not been clearly defined, and no validated measures of the concept
exist.
 The goals of this research are to develop a measure to: (1) identify equity-promoting processes and
practice-level institutional racism, and (2) determine its association with variation in Black-White disparities in
health outcomes across practice settings. Because high quality primary care results in better health outcomes
and reduced disparities, we propose a collaboration with primary care practice-based research networks
(PBRNs) across the Southeast. We will use the infrastructure of PBRNs to conduct in-depth interviews with
patients, providers, and clinic leaders and access electronic health record data (EHR) for patients across
approximately 100 clinics to achieve the following Specific Aims: (1) Identify practice-level structures,
processes, policies, and norms that may either promote equity or create and reinforce inequities in health
outcomes between Non-Hispanic Black and White patients. (2) Design, pre-test, and determine the
psychometric properties of the practice-level EQUIP Measure. (3) Explore the modifying effects of institutional
racism and equity-promoting practices as measured by EQUIP on the relationship between area-level
structural racism (residential-segregation, racial inequities in income, etc.) and health outcomes (cancer
screening, blood pressure control, etc.) for Black patients. This proposal to develop a validated measure of
practice-level equity and institutional racism is a necessary first step to expand research on the effectiveness
of practice-level interventions to promote health equity."
10826166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is an unmet critical need for techniques that achieve noninvasive molecular diagnosis of brain tumors.
Our group is addressing this unmet need by introducing and developing the focused ultrasound (FUS)-enabled
blood-based liquid biopsy technique, which we call sonobiopsy. NIH/NIBIB support (R01EB030102, funding
period 8/1/2020–4/30/2024) allowed us to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of sonobiopsy in mouse and
pig models of glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. We also developed a clinical
sonobiopsy device by integrating a single-element FUS transducer with a neuronavigation system. These
breakthroughs led to our first-in-human clinical study, which demonstrated the initial feasibility and safety of
sonobiopsy in patients with glioblastoma. In much the same way that MRI transformed the diagnostic capabilities
of neurologic disease by providing anatomic and functional information, sonobiopsy has the potential to provide
equally important and complementary molecular information about the brain that is not currently available.
Sonobiopsy will be a platform technology that can be applied to the diagnosis and monitoring of various
neurological diseases. The objective of this renewal application is to develop and validate a next-generation
FUS device called sonocap, which will radically advance the clinical translation of sonobiopsy and enable its
broad adoption. The sonocap device is patient-friendly, easily manufactured, accurate in tumor targeting, and
safe. We will achieve this objective through two specific aims: Aim 1 will design and construct the wearable
sonocap, and Aim 2 will validate the performance and safety of the sonocap in non-human primates (NHPs).
The proposed sonocap is significant because it is a breakthrough FUS device that enhances our technical
capability in interfacing with the brain using ultrasound, addresses a critical barrier to advancing the clinical
translation of sonobiopsy, and improves the clinical practice in the diagnosis and monitoring of brain diseases
through sonobiopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has expertise in ultrasound engineering, wearable device
design, NHP research, and neurosurgery, and will advance sonocap through the development phase and into
future clinical trials. This study has three main innovations: (1) sonobiopsy is a groundbreaking approach for
interrogating the brain; (2) the wearable sonocap significantly departs from the status quo in the design of clinical
FUS devices; (3) the proposed approach for developing the sonocap combines human head phantom testing
and NHP validation. The project outcomes are expected to significantly impact the medical ultrasound field by
driving the development of wearable FUS devices, collecting essential large animal data required for clinical
translation, and ultimately achieving personalized patient care through noninvasive molecular diagnosis of brain
tumors."
10933021,"Project Summary:
The most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormality is a deletion of 4977 base pairs
called the common deletion (CD), associated with mitochondrial pathologies and widespread in
aging. The CD primarily manifests in the brain and muscles when deleted molecules exceed
60% of total copies, known as heteroplasmy. However, the mechanisms that cause harmful
deletions and why neuronal and muscle cells are particularly vulnerable to CD remain unclear.
Major obstacles to studying the CD is the lack of tools to manipulate mtDNA and the inability to
generate the CD in a controlled manner. Here, we developed a series of methodologies to
overcome these barriers. Specifically, we generated an inducible quasi-dimeric TALEN that
generates the CD in isogenic settings and at defined heteroplasmy states. With this tool, we will
establish low, medium, and high levels of CD heteroplasmy in embryonic stem cells that we will
then differentiate into muscle, neuronal, and fibroblast cells and elucidate the consequence of
this harmful deletion in a cell-type-specific manner and its impact on cellular aging. Furthermore,
we will explore the cell-type-specific distribution of CD, Identifying the pathways that sustain
mutant mtDNA propagation in post-mitotic cells while promoting its elimination in dividing cells.
Combining novel genetic tools with extensive experience in genome stability will resolve the
long-standing mystery of preferential mutant mtDNA propagation in post-mitotic cells and have
significant implications for numerous mitochondrial pathologies and aging."
10929410,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Survival across species hinges on an animal’s ability to switch ongoing behaviors to optimize goals, such as
obtaining rewards, in dynamic environments. This process of adapting behaviors based on changes in
environmental contingencies, commonly referred to as behavioral flexibility, is impaired across many
neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A key
element of adaptive reward computations is reward prediction error (RPE) signals, which reflect the discrepancy
between obtained and expected rewards. The lateral habenula (LHb) plays a well-established role in signaling
RPE and has recently been more broadly implicated in adjusting choice behavior in response to changes in
reward contingencies. This suggests the LHb as a potential target for therapeutic intervention for diseases
characterized by inflexible behavior. However, the LHb is also involved in a diverse range of emotional and
motivational behaviors including stress, fear, aversion, aggression, and social and parental behavior. Therefore,
developing treatments that behavioral flexibility without risking a cascade of side effects first requires identifying
specific LHb subpopulations underlying flexible behavior.
In this proposal, we use cell-type-specific approaches to monitor and manipulate a genetically-defined neuronal
subpopulation found to preferentially signal RPE to determine how LHb RPE signals facilitate flexible behavior.
In our first aim, we will identify the neuronal coding mechanism used to encode reward prediction error in the
LHb. In our second aim, we will determine how these signals contribute to flexible reward-guided decision making.
Together these experiments will reveal the functional role of LHb RPE signaling in flexible behavior, which will
provide more refined insight into potential targets for tailored treatment of disorders characterized by inflexible
behavior."
10862187,"Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) poses a complex therapeutic dilemma for patients and oncologists alike, made
worse by the epidemic increase in new cases associated with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
OPC incidence in the Veteran population is increasing at a rate 3 times greater than the general US population
and survival lags the US population by >20% due to a disproportionate burden of aggressive, treatment-resistant
disease. These factors combine to make rapid development of precision oncology approaches to OPC a
categorical imperative for the VHA. In order to safely match treatment intensity to OPC biology, biomarkers of
treatment response must be developed and tailored to US Veterans with OPC. Using artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) approaches over the last 5 years we have shown the ability to discriminate risk of
recurrence following treatment in OPC, with a sensitivity and specificity which surpasses that of conventional
stratification approaches. We hypothesize that ML models based on multidimensional data (pathomic and
radiomic) and standard clinical-pathologic features can be integrated to generate a robust risk
stratification algorithm for Veterans with OPC that can be rapidly deployed across the VHA for
optimization of treatment algorithms.
 We will develop a predictive algorithm of chemo-radiation response in Veterans with OPC (Aim 1).
We will use a 1,000 OPC patient cohort from 6 tertiary VHA institutions and the VA Hub for Computer Vision and
Machine Learning in Precision Oncology (CoMPL) to curate, categorize, and integrate multidimensional data
inputs of Veterans with OPC suitable for machine learning to develop the Artificial Intelligence for Risk
Stratification of Oropharyngeal Carcinoma (AIROC) algorithm. AIROC will be designed to predict response to
conventional chemo-radiation with a sensitivity of >95% and a specificity of >95%. We will further refine AIROC
to maximize sensitivity and specificity on a secondary 400 OPC patient cohort generated from completed
cooperative group trials. We will then validate the predictive potential of AIROC in a prospective cohort of
Veterans with OPC (Aim 2). AIROC will be utilized to make a priori predictions of chemo-radiation response in
a blinded fashion for Veterans with OPC slated for curative intent chemo-radiation using locoregional recurrence
as the primary outcome measure. AIROC will be considered accurate if it correctly predicts response in 99% of
low-risk patients and 90% of high-risk patients.
Impact and Criteria for Success. AIROC will represent a unique chemo-radiation response algorithm built using
clinically generated data readily available across the VHA that can be easily deployed across VHA facilities. In
addition, the multimodal dataset will become the gold standard database for OPC in the VHA and the US broadly
and will serve as a valuable hub for future discovery and validation within the cooperative group clinical trial
network."
10839419,"Obesity is associated with a 35% to 40% increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and poor survival
outcomes. One feature of obese adipose tissue is the excess extracellular matrix (ECM)
deposition/remodeling in the form of fibrosis. However, function and regulation of obesity-related ECM
deposition/remodeling in cancer progression largely remain to be determined. We recently identified
Hsp47, a chaperone protein facilitating collagen secretion, as a hub of the ECM transcription network.
Our new data showed that Hsp47 was highly expressed in adipose tissue. Importantly, increased Hsp47
expression in human and mouse adipose tissues was significantly associated with obesity
development. We found that adipocyte-specific deletion of Hsp47 was sufficient to suppress high fat
diet (HFD)-induced obese and mammary tumor growth, which is accompanied by reduced collagen
deposition/alignment and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue. The overall objective of this
proposal is to define the mechanism by which adipocyte Hsp47 promotes obese-related fibrosis and
breast cancer progression and to explore the value of Hsp47 as a potential target to suppress obesity-
associated cancer progression. Using unbiased proteomics analysis, we identified asporin as a new
target of Hsp47 in adipocytes. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that
Hsp47 induces obesity-related fibrosis by facilitating asporin secretion in adipocytes, and subsequently
enhances adipocyte plasticity and breast cancer progression. Following aims are proposed to test our
hypothesis: Aim 1. Elucidate the molecular mechanism by which adipocyte Hsp47 induces obesity- and

10839323,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a global public health crisis with unknown triggers and no disease modifying
therapies. Effective treatments likely must be initiated in the early phases of biological disease, well before
brain reserves of the neural substrates of cognition are depleted leading to overt clinical symptoms. These
‘preclinical’ periods and their triggering events, therefore, are highly significant areas of study. Traumatic brain
injury (TBI), the leading cause of death and disability in younger individuals (under age 45) worldwide, is also
the best-established epigenetic risk factor for AD. Once thought to be a monophasic injury, TBI is now known
to initiate a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative process that leads through unknown
pathological mediators to dementing illnesses including AD, ADRDs, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE). Synapse loss is a common, early finding in AD, and the strongest pathological correlate of AD-induced
dementia—even stronger than amyloid plaques or tau neurofibrillary tangles. Synaptic injury is also implicated
in TBI in humans and in animal models. Synapses are challenging to study due to their extremely small size and
admixture with the extraordinarily complex subcellular milieu of mammalian neuropil. We developed an
innovative, widely accessible super-resolution imaging and image analysis platform called SEQUIN (Synaptic
Evaluation and QUantification by Imaging Nanostructure) to enable routine monitoring of synaptic health in
animal models and in humans. Our preliminary data demonstrate that delayed cortical synapse loss occurs
after diffuse, closed head, mild TBI in a mouse model, suggesting that synaptic neurodegeneration may lead to
neurological disability following TBI and sensitize the brain to subsequent AD-related synapse loss, hastening
the onset of dementia. We will characterize synaptic neurodegeneration resulting from mild TBI over the
lifespan, and determine its ability to predict neuropsychological and behavioral outcomes. We will then assess
complement activation—a component of the innate immune system that drives synapse loss in AD and is
maladaptively activated after mild TBI— as a mechanism of synaptic neurodegeneration. We will determine
whether targeting the complement pathway can improve synaptic health and improve behavioral outcomes
using genetic and clinically-translatable pharmacological interventions. Finally, we will assess the impact of
mild TBI on synaptic neurodegeneration related to amyloidosis and tauopathy, classic AD-related
neuropathological and biochemical processes. We will determine whether complement inhibition can prevent
TBI-induced potentiation of neurodegeneration in mouse models of these processes. These studies are
expected to reveal intervenable links between early brain injury and long-term neurodegeneration relevant to
the individuals at greater risk of AD and related brain disorders due to an earlier TBI. They will also further
establish innovative synaptic imaging tools (SEQUIN) that will empower routine synaptic analysis in this and
related fields."
10839326,"Abstract
 It is widely accepted that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily achieved by cell-type-specific
presence of transcription factors (TFs), which bind to cognate DNA sequences. TFs then initiate changes in
higher-order chromatin structures by recruiting chromatin modifiers, including histone-modifying enzymes.
Unlike TFs, chromatin modifiers tend to be ubiquitously expressed. Among the plethora of chromatin
modifications, regulators of histone methylation are more frequently mutated in neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDDs) such as intellectual disabilities (IDs) and autism. Why is the brain so sensitive to dysregulation of
histone methylation? Is methyl-histone regulation in neurons unique? Investigation of a limited number of cell
types, cancer-cell lines, and embryonic stem cells has hampered our ability to address these questions.
 The overarching goal of my research group is to contribute to the understanding of how methyl-histone
regulations underlie normal and pathological brain functions. Our focus is on the LSD1-PHF21A histone-
demethylation complex, which involves neuron-specific alternative splicing. LSD1 is a histone demethylase for
histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me). PHF21A was the first-discovered “zero reader,” which recognizes unmethylated
H3K4 (H3K4me0), the reaction product of canonical LSD1 (LSD1-c). Both LSD1 and PHF21A
haploinsufficiencies lead to NDDs, suggesting their importance in brain development. The neuronal LSD1
isoform (LSD1-n), which carries an alternative exon in its catalytic domain, was reported to have distinct
substrate specificity. However, the specific lysine(s) targeted by LSD1-n remains controversial. The goal of this
proposal is to determine the roles of the neuronal LSD1-PHF21A complex. Our preliminary study showed that
PHF21A also carries an alternative exon right upstream of the H3K4me0-recognizing PHD finger. This region
of PHF21A contains an AT-hook motif, which directly binds to DNA; we found that the alternative exon disrupts
the AT-hook, hence the DNA binding, but not H3K4me0 binding. These observations raise an exciting
possibility that the neuronal PHF21A isoform (PHF21A-n) recognizes nucleosomes in a distinct manner
compared to canonical PHF21A (PHF21A-c), thereby cooperating with LSD1-n to generate the neuronal
transcriptome for normal brain development.
 We propose testing the hypothesis using multidisciplinary approaches encompassing cell biology,
biochemistry, and structural biology. The research plan was developed to provide both mechanistic insights
into the regulation of histone modifications and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of
neurodevelopment disorders, which could lead to novel approaches for brain-specific therapeutic targets."
10839437,"Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life.
Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with
epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures.
Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain
activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of
generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic
neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel
electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform
EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for
pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record
broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure
calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their
output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton
microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity
with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with
EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to
create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This
information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop
predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within
thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted
single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre-
seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or
optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure
incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive
signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold.
Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic
approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control."

The objective for our Integrated Regional Training Program in Environmental Health Sciences continues to be
to recruit and train scientists in the Environmental Health Sciences (EHS). Primary goals are: 1) Recruit a
diverse cohort of trainees; 2) Individualize transdisciplinary, experiential learning employing Individual
Development Plans (IDP) for each trainee to provide structured scientific, professional and career development
in the environmental health sciences; 3) Train the next generation of scientists to be leaders in environmental
health sciences (EHS). Renewal funding is requested to support 6 pre-doctoral trainees and 3 post-doctoral
trainees. We have a strong pool of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral applicants, who are evaluated and selected by
the Co-Directors and our Internal Advisory Committee. Our recruitment process is designed to attract the best
and brightest while also attaining diversity in our training cohort by attracting trainees from underrepresented
and disadvantaged groups in STEM. The outcome of our training program will be to matriculate trainees with
the skills, experience, and ethics to address a wide range of complex, critical, and rapidly evolving problems in
EHS. Our regional, transdisciplinary training program will extend our nearly 50 yr. tradition of excellence in
collaborative EHS research and training between Oregon State University (OSU), Oregon Health Sciences
University (OHSU) and Pacific Northwest National Labs (PNNL). The major evolutions of our training
program include: implementation of Individual Development Plans (IDPs) as the foundational framework for
our training program; reduction in didactic coursework; new mentors and research topics; and short
externships to further promote interdisciplinary training and professional development in real-world potential
employment environments. IDPs provide the framework for flexible, individualized professional development
and experiential training needs in the context of rapidly evolving and emerging challenges in EHS. Trainees
will acquire the core competencies to be successful throughout their careers. Major strengths of our program
continue to be our highly productive and collaborative training faculty; our existing highly successful
multidisciplinary training program; and the unique collaborative training environment provided by OSU,
OHSU and PNNL and supplemented by new regional training partners in the academic, regulatory, and private
sectors. Our evolving mentor cohort includes 30 continuing and new faculty mentors, offering a wide diversity
of training topics in EHS: molecular toxicology, environmental chemistry, ecotoxicology, systems toxicology,
hazard identification, exposure biology, epidemiology, developmental toxicology, nanotoxicology,
computational and predictive toxicology, microbiome/environment interactions, neuro/behavioral toxicology,
inter-individual susceptibility, metal toxicology, metabolism, diet-environment interactions and translational
data sciences. Our former trainees continue to make major contributions in the academic, public, and federal
sectors demonstrating the effectiveness of our training program."
10839351,"Depressed patients inadequately responsive to medication and psychotherapy often live with serious
difficulties in psychosocial functioning; thus, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an important,
alternative, FDA approved therapy. During typical rTMS therapy, clinicians place a stimulation coil on the
patient's scalp that focally modulates the underlying cortical areas. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex region
(DLPFC) is the most established target for treating depression; however, clinicians miss this target in a third of
patients and treatment fails, likely contributing to the relatively low remission rate of 31%. The reason for errors
in targeting the DLPFC is that clinicians typically do not have access to MR image-guidance to identify the
underlying brain regions they target. Instead they use the current standard-of-care method to identify the
stimulation location that uses scalp landmarks and moves a fixed distance over the scalp. A new, promising
alternative scalp targeting approach based on EEG electrode placement, the Beam F3 accurately targeted the
DLPFC in 92% of Veterans from our pilot data (n=12). Our collaborator has adopted the Beam F3 as his
clinical standard and showed improved depression severity and changes in associated functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Other labs also, have indirect evidence that the Beam F3 scalp targeting
approach places the rTMS stimulation coil near an fMRI identified optimal subregion within the DLPFC that
involves control over emotional distraction and reactivity. The overall aim of the current proposal is to test the
feasibility of accurately reaching this fMRI based optimal subregion using the Beam F3 scalp-based targeting
approach. We further hypothesize that, since psychosocial functioning is related to cognitive control that
accurate stimulation of this fMRI region could also lead to improved psychosocial functioning (i.e. reduced
functional limitations and improved quality of life). Our plan is to collect fMRI and MRI's with markers identifying
where clinicians place the Beam F3 location in depressed Veterans. Our strategy is to test whether the Beam
F3 rule places the coil close enough (i.e. within the spatial resolution of rTMS) to reach an optimal DLPFC
subregion in 95% of Veterans. In Aim 1 we propose to use image-guidance to test with high precision how
accurately the Beam F3 targets this optimal, fMRI defined, brain region. In Aim 2 we demonstrate the accuracy
of the Beam F3 in rTMS clinic patients where treaters typically deviate from scalp rules to accommodate
patient comfort since frontal stimulation causes facial twitches and painful cranial nerve stimulation in some
scalp locations. To address clinical importance of our choice of brain targets, in our clinic-based sample we will
evaluate whether spatial deviations from the optimal brain target correlate with improvements in psychosocial
functioning on a composite score of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 and
the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey of quality of life. We will perform several additional analyses on the
acquired data. We will use precise image-guidance and directly compare in the same patients the accuracy of
the Beam F3 scalp targeting to that of the clinical standard to provide clinicians with compelling evidence of
which approach is more accurate. If we discover a systematic deviation in the Beam F3 rule, we can identify
how to adapt it to improve accuracy. Results from this proposal will improve the implementation of rTMS
therapy for depressed Veterans. We will disseminate our findings through our clinical rTMS VA training to
improve targeting accuracy at VA clinics nationwide. Our vision is that this image-guidance approach to
validation of scalp-based targets will serve as a model for the development of new brain-informed scalp targets
and will guide innovative large scale clinical trials to study the relationship between brain predictors, changes,
and clinically meaningful outcomes. The tools developed in this proposal can thus enable large-scale
collaborations between VA rTMS clinics that can identify brain and scalp targets treat dysfunction in Veterans
they find clinically meaningful."
10839455,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project will build a new kidney biopsy cohort to characterize the molecular, morphometric, and metabolic
features of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) over the modern clinical course of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Landmark
kidney biopsy studies have enhanced our understanding of DKD pathogenesis. However, advances in
continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery have changed diabetes management and the
clinical course of DKD in T1D. Moreover, innovation in molecular methods to interrogate kidney tissue, such as
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), allows characterization of DKD at a resolution not previously
possible. Based on published work and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that perturbed kidney energetics
and hypoxia are central metabolic pathways in the development of DKD in T1D. We will test this hypothesis by
creating a unique new longitudinal kidney biopsy cohort (N=100) spanning the critical duration of T1D over
which DKD initiates and progresses (5-30 years) and leveraging our existing vanguard biopsy cohort (N=30).
Normative kidney biopsy data will be provided from our existing cohort of healthy controls (N=20), the Kidney
Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), and additional living kidney donor biopsies. We will implement state-of-
the-art molecular (scRNA-seq) and morphometric interrogation of kidney tissue and rigorous metabolic
phenotyping. Specifically, we aim to: (1) define differences in kidney energetics and hypoxia over the course of
T1D; (2) test associations of the transcriptomic signatures of hypoxia with the structural lesions and clinical
manifestations of progressive DKD; and (3) explore the mechanistic correlates of perturbed kidney energetics
and hypoxia within a subset of participants with T1D with repeat kidney biopsies. This work will help define the
role of perturbed energetics and hypoxia in DKD as well as risk factors for and consequences of kidney
hypoxia in T1D. This study will also generate a valuable repository of data, biosamples, and kidney tissue for
further analysis of DKD in T1D, made publicly available through the KPMP platform."
10839456,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The goal of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award is to support the applicant in developing the critical skills necessary to become an expert in
increasing access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) at touchpoints for care that
individuals with OUD are likely to frequent. The proposed research focuses on NIDA's priority area of addressing
real-world complexities by developing implementation strategies to improve treatment continuity after
hospitalization in patients with OUD. Hospitalizations related to OUD and its complications have increased
dramatically over the last few decades, leading to high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Hospitals are
increasingly recognized as critical touchpoints for engaging individuals with OUD in treatment, and randomized
controlled trials support the efficacy of initiating medications for OUD (MOUD) in acute care settings to increase
treatment engagement following discharge. However, hospital-initiated treatment is insufficient if patients do not
continue care in the community. Despite the robust literature on care transitions after hospital discharge for
patients with other chronic conditions, there is limited evidence about the best strategies to optimize care
engagement for patients with OUD after hospitalization. We need effective, scalable strategies for linking patients
with OUD from acute care to ongoing treatment, including continuation of MOUDs. The research objective of this
proposal is to develop and pilot test strategies to facilitate transitions of care for patients with OUD from the
hospital to the community. The specific aims are: (1) Use a mixed-methods approach to identify determinants of
effective care transitions for patients with OUD from acute care to outpatient treatment at the patient, provider,
and system level, (2) Partner with hospital and community stakeholders and use implementation mapping to
develop a multicomponent, modular toolkit to facilitate transitions from acute care to community addressing multi-
level barriers, and (3) Conduct a pilot trial of the care transition toolkit. The primary outcome will be treatment
engagement at 30 days, and secondary outcomes will include MOUD and substance use, service use, feasibility,
acceptability and patient satisfaction. The mentorship team brings together experts in health services research,
implementation science, and care delivery interventions for OUD as well as stakeholder advisors from hospital
and community settings. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award builds on Dr. Lowenstein's
experience as a clinician and researcher and extends it with five key training goals: 1) Measuring outcomes for
OUD-related care across systems, 2) Advanced qualitative inquiry, 3) Implementing health systems change, and
5) Manuscript and grant writing. With successful completion of this project, training activities, and mentorship
from a team of experienced investigators, Dr. Lowenstein will be well-prepared to lead an independent research
agenda designed to improve care and outcomes for people with OUD."

physician scientist with a focus on reducing and eliminating inequities in serious illness. This project builds on
her previous work investigating disparities in communication and palliative care, and examining associations
between socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and healthcare utilization at the end of life. Dr. Brown will attain
expertise in research methods in health disparities and social determinants of health, creating and maintaining
a cohort, advanced qualitative research methods, and refinement and implementation of a pilot randomized trial.
This will occur through an integrated career development plan consisting of coursework, mentorship from highly
accomplished and skilled independent researchers, and protected time to gain practical research experience.
 Environment: The University of Washington (UW) provides a rich academic environment and a broad range
of educational and research resources including: the UW Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep
Medicine Clinical Research Training Track, which provides a collegial and collaborative environment; the Cambia
Palliative Care Center of Excellence; the School of Public Health; and the Institute of Translational Health
Sciences. Dr. Brown has assembled a mentoring team with expertise in outcomes and social epidemiology,
strong records of funding and publication, and success in training early-investigators.
 Research: This proposal outlines a mixed methods study with the following goals: 1) understand the
associations between perceived discrimination, mistrust, communication, and healthcare intensity at the end of
life; 2) elicit perspectives of marginalized patients who endorse experiencing healthcare discrimination and how
this affects patient-clinician communication and healthcare decision-making during serious illness; and 3)
perform a pilot randomized trial of an intervention to improve resilience and facilitate communication skills in
patients who endorse experiencing discrimination from healthcare professionals. Dr. Brown will create and
maintain a prospective cohort of patients with serious illness to investigate the relationships between perceived
discrimination, mistrust, communication, and healthcare outcomes. Next, she will conduct semi-structured
interviews with a sub-group of patients from this cohort and use modified grounded theory methods to understand
patients' perspectives of the role of discrimination on communication and decision-making. Lastly, she will
perform a pilot randomized trial of an established intervention (Promoting Resilience in Stress Management) to
improve resilience and help facilitate goal-making and communication skills in patients who have experienced
healthcare discrimination. Understanding how perceived discrimination affects communication and decision-
making in serious illness will help contribute toward reducing inequities in the care of minorities with serious
illness and other vulnerable patient populations."
10864006,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Meiotic studies of human fetal ovaries we conducted for over a decade have generated the largest
available human female meiotic database. This unique resource includes matched maternal/fetal
biospecimens for each sample collected from 2008 to 2017, a period of rapid changes in both the
spectrum and levels of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) contaminants. The proposed studies
will test the hypothesis that the high meiotic error rate in the human female is driven by both an
innate propensity to error (e.g., due to the protracted nature of female meiosis and differences in
cell cycle control) and environmental factors. We postulate that environmentally-induced effects
will be discernable because they disturb well-defined meiotic relationships. We will expand our
meiotic database for the cohort and characterize the features of a well-known cause of human
aneuploidy, recombination failure. Meiotic profiles for each case in conjunction with exposure
profiles will be used to determine if and how fetal exposure affects the early stages of female
germline development in humans. We also will obtain data on temporal changes in human
exposure to common endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) contaminants and compare the ability
of different EDCs to transit from the maternal circulation to the developing fetus."
10864007,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, and half of patients presenting with HF have
preserved (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction. However, HFpEF remains a therapeutic challenge,
given current limited understanding of causal and contributing factors, and clinical heterogeneity within HFpEF
subphenotypes. The central goal of the candidate's research work is to use clinical and translational research
approaches to better understand mechanisms and contributors to human HFpEF and its subphenotypes. One
focus in the laboratory has been to study the role of obesity, which is thought to induce a systemic pro-
inflammatory state that, in turn, drives cardiovascular dysfunction and remodeling leading to HFpEF.
 The candidate is a heart failure cardiologist with a research focus on HFpEF and a long-standing track
record of successful mentoring. Current work includes a multi-cohort effort to examine upstream regulators of
systemic inflammation in HFpEF. This is complemented by a prospective ongoing study examining the role of
obesity and insulin-resistance in HFpEF-associated pulmonary hypertension. The overarching goals of this
proposal are to provide the candidate with the crucial long-term support to enable the ongoing reduction from
clinical and administrative commitments, and to expand training opportunities for mentees interested in clinical
and translational patient-oriented heart failure research. This application will support the candidate in creating
unique training opportunities by leveraging ongoing funded efforts to enable new patient-oriented studies led
by mentees. In Aim 1, we will investigate sex differences in inflammatory profiles in HFpEF in order to better
understand why men and women with HFpEF display distinct disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will examine
obesity and metabolic dysfunction as determinants of right ventricular function, an important predictor of
outcomes in HFpEF. These research opportunities within the candidate's multidisciplinary research program,
coupled with a vibrant scientific community and extensive educational resources at Massachusetts General
Hospital and Harvard University will create an unparalleled environment for trainees pursuing a career in
patient-oriented research. Ultimately, we hope this proposal will support the development and mentoring of
new clinical investigators in heart failure research, and lay the foundation for future investigations focused on
disease prevention and optimal therapies in HFpEF."

back pain and injuries are a widespread epidemic and due in large part to repeated patient handling activities,
including lifting, transferring, and repositioning tasks. Bed to chair and chair to toilet transfers are consistently
ranked among the most physically stressful tasks required of patients and caregivers. Mechanical transfer
assist devices were found to reduce the risk of injury to caregivers. Consequently, several states have passed
bills requiring all hospitals to establish a ‘no manual lift’ policy for staff members who interact directly with
patients to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The most commonly used lift
technologies for dependent transfers of patients include the overhead ceiling lift, the floor-based sling lift, and
the Gantry lift. While these devices allow for safer transfer of patients, they do so with shortcomings. Overhead
sling lifts require extensive installation that may not be suitable for homes or buildings with structural
deficiencies or a low ceiling. Floor-based sling lifts have several issues with caregiver manipulation and ease of
use. Gantry lifts are very difficult to move and store due to their size. Research has demonstrated that people
with mobility impairments and caregivers both desire new, powered devices for safer and more comfortable
and independent transfers.
 The AgileLife Patient Transfer and Movement System (PTS) developed and commercially deployed by
Next Health, LLC is an integration of several assistive technologies that together automate the transfer of
immobile individuals to and from a hospital bed and a wheelchair. The PTS includes a hospital bed, an

would be compatible with the AgileLife bed.
 The goals of this project will be to iteratively redesign, prototype and test the modified PTS and a
compatible group 3 power wheelchair so that the system could be be used by a greater number of people with
physical disabilities and independently. This will be accomplished by conducting focus groups to determine the
how the user interface should function for independent use; refining the design of the bed and the group 3

10862163,"GLUCOSE BINDS RBPs TO REGULATE EPIDERMAL HOMEOSTASIS
 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 One in four Americans are affected by skin disease, underscoring the importance of understanding the
mechanisms underlying epidermal homeostasis. Our laboratory recently found that increases in intracellular
glucose concentrations are essential for differentiation in the epidermis, independent of glucose’s metabolic
function. In this context, glucose acts to promote or dissociate specific protein multimers. RNA-binding proteins
(RBPs) are required for the control of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Using CRISPR-FlowFISH and
glucose pull-down MS techniques, we have identified RBPs as the primary glucose binding proteins that control
epidermal differentiation. Among these RBPs, DDX21 was validated as a key regulator of glucose-mediated
RNA and protein interactions needed to maintain normal skin homeostasis. Additionally, we have discovered
other RBPs that bind glucose and are essential for epidermal differentiation. The objective of this K01 application
is to characterize these essential glucose binding proteins in epidermis. This research will provide further insights
into the non-metabolic roles of glucose in epidermal differentiation and will uncover mechanisms of RBP function
that are regulated by direct glucose binding.
 In Aim I, we will define the mechanism for glucose-mediated regulation of DDX50 in facilitating epidermal
differentiation. Our preliminary data supports the notion that glucose plays a critical role in regulating DDX50 in
this context. Specifically, in Aim IA, we will assess the ability of glucose to enable the formation of the DDX50-
RNA-STAU1 complex and investigate how the function of the complex is regulated by glucose. In Aim IB, we will
explore alternative models to understand how glucose regulates DDX50's function in epidermal differentiation.
 In Aim II, we will test our hypothesis that glucose plays a role in directing NSUN2 and other RBPs to control
epidermal homeostasis. Our preliminary data suggests that glucose facilitates S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)
binding to NSUN2, which promotes epidermal differentiation. We have also identified 51 additional RBPs with
glucose-binding affinity that are also essential for epidermal differentiation. In Aim IIA, we will focus on testing
the specific role of glucose in regulating NSUN2 in epidermal differentiation. In Aim IIB, we will evaluate the role
of glucose in regulating additional RBPs involved in epidermal differentiation.
 My background is in proteomics, molecular biology, RBP biology and skin differentiation. Over the course of
the training period and within the environment of Stanford’s Department of Dermatology, I plan to acquire
expertise in (1) statistics, (2) bioinformatics, (3) genomics. This training will enable me to develop a more
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying glucose regulation in epithelial tissue, which is a
key area of interest in my research. Ultimately, this research plan will prepare me for an independent career as
an academic scientist focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of skin biology."

Susceptibility to alcoholism has a clear genetic component. The VCU-ARC and its collaborators seeks to better
understand ethanol-responsive genes by studying cross-species genetic correlates. These efforts have
generated several ethanol-responsive gene candidates such as Clic4, GSK3B, and slo1. The Rodent
Behavioral Core (Core 2) will expand these efforts by studying the consequences of manipulating these (and
newly identified) candidate genes in a rodent behavioral battery that models specific aspects of acute ethanol
sensitivity, consumption, and seeking behavior. Core 2 will use conditional genetically modified mice or viral
transgene delivery to mouse or rat brain. Core 2 may also use environmental modulations to investigate gene x
environment interactions on ethanol response behaviors. The intent of Core 2 is to correlate expression levels
of an ethanol-responsive candidate gene to a particular behavioral outcome in order to gain a deeper
understanding of the genetic basis of alcoholism. The results of Core 2 will provide valuable insight into the
genetic basis of the complex behavioral and neurobiological adaptations that develop as a consequence of
either acute or repeated ethanol exposure. This new knowledge will aid in the development of interventions for
the prevention and/or treatment of ethanol abuse and alcoholism."
10864965,"Respiratory and gastrointestinal complaints are among the most common reasons why adults
are prescribed antibiotics in acute care. In recent years, multiplex molecular panels that rapidly
test for 15-25 for pathogens simultaneously, including bacteria and viruses, have entered
common use and dramatically changed clinicians’ basic approach to these conditions. The
potential advantage of multiplex panels is that, if uses properly, rapid diagnosis may facilitate
targeted antibiotic or antiviral therapy. But multiplex panels are “shotgun” tests that frequently
produce false positives. When implemented without consideration of unintended consequences,
their use can either have no impact or lead to inappropriate antibiotics. This study will address a
gap in the literature by identifying when multiplex panel tests can change clinical management
or benefit the patient and designing interventions to nudge testing in those situations.
The proposed studies will promote patient safety and reduce misdiagnosis through diagnostic
stewardship, an emerging model for infectious diseases care that uses “nudge” interventions to
encourage evidence-based testing. Aim 1 will define high- and low-value use of multiplex panel
testing by examining clinical outcomes after testing among patients seen in acute care at 200
hospitals contributing to the Premier Healthcare Database. Aim 2 will develop electronic health
record-based interventions to nudge better testing practices in acute care based on qualitative
input from frontline clinicians. Aim 3 will be a quasi-experimental trial of diagnostic stewardship
interventions at two hospitals in the University of Maryland System. Other system hospitals will
be concurrent controls. This research will lead to the first large-scale trial evaluating diagnostic
stewardship of multiplex molecular panel tests in acute care.

10865085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vocalization (i.e., cry) is the first and most intense behavior manifestation in the life of a neonate. Neonates
vocalize when isolated from their primary caregivers, attracting their attention to receive comfort, care, and
nutrition. In humans, atypical cry behavior is symptomatic of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism
and Angelman syndrome. However, how the immature neonatal brain controls vocal behavior is a fascinating
question in developmental neurobiology that remains unsolved. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neural
circuits that transiently modulate the emission of vocalizations in neonatal mammals. The hypothalamus is a
region in the bottom of the mammalian brain suggested to mediate vocalization based on experiments using
electric stimulation of this brain region. In the hypothalamus, there is a region called the arcuate nucleus, which
contains two populations of neurons that produce either Agouti-related peptide (Agrp) or Proopiomelanocortin
(POMC). Our preliminary experiments suggest these two populations of neurons exert a modulatory role in the
emission of neonatal vocalizations. Thus, in this proposal, we will use state-of-the-art approaches in circuit
neurosciences applied to the neonatal brain to investigate the mechanistic details involved in the control of
neonatal vocal behavior by Agrp and POMC neurons. At its conclusion, this project will reveal novel neuronal
circuits that control precise behavior outputs in the developing mammalian brain. This project will also shed
new light on how vocal behavior dynamically changes during early postnatal life. In addition to illuminating
fundamental principles of behavior control early in life, the mechanistic insights revealed in this project might
also aid the understanding of impaired vocal behavior in several neurodevelopmental diseases."
10865089,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The design and implementation of improved therapies for vascular diseases are dependent on a better
understanding of the basic physiological processes involved. Such processes are biologically complex, with
elements at the molecular, cellular, organ system, and integrative levels. Research into the pathophysiology of
vascular diseases and their treatments will be strengthened by training vascular surgeon-scientists in
investigative methods allowing them to develop and maintain state-of-the-art laboratory skills and pursue novel
strategies for cure and prevention. The goal of the University of Florida - Interdisciplinary Training for Vascular
Surgeon Scientists (ITVSS) Program is to provide the training required for success as future academic surgeons
and scientists in the field of vascular surgery. Graduates of our training program will be prepared to join an
academic surgical faculty, conduct independent research, compete for grant funding, and provide translational
surgical expertise at their institutions.
 At the core of our program are the following specific aims: 1) provide a 2-year integrated training program for
four surgery residents and/or fellows to create a career pathway for conducting mechanistic and clinically
relevant translational research in vascular disease; 2) implement a training program that promotes a learning
cycle of concrete experiences, active experimentation, reflective observation, and abstract conceptualization; 3)
closely monitor and track trainee-related experiences and outcomes that will serve as a foundation for evaluating
the current status of the program and for making continuous quality improvements; 4) create a culture for
professional excellence based on enhancing rigor, reproducibility and transparency in research and establishing
a career trajectory as leaders in the surgical delivery of vascular care; and 5) maintain the research-focused,
career trajectory developed during the fellowship by promoting a culture of scholarly activity, foster interaction
among the ITVSS trainees, mentors, and Directors during the completion of clinical training.
 Unique aspects of the ITVSS Program include: 1) a high-density of NIH-funded surgeon-scientists providing
the necessary training environment and role models; 2) use of a team mentoring approach, where each trainee
has an identified research and clinical mentor; 3) trainee engagement in an “Immersive Training Experience”
that is outside of their research focus area, to provide the foundation for conducting team-based, multi-
disciplinary research; 4) support by a robust vascular research portfolio that offers trainees high-quality
experiences in basic, translational, outcomes, and clinical research; and 5) institutional backing that provides
administrative and supplemental financial resources to maximize the training experience."
10865091,"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice
Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology
impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested
the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an
information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal
network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching
hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial
information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating
this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1,
I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within
large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these
oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory
encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine
learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity.
Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies
on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ
chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with
the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology.
Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired
spatial information processing in AD mouse models.
 The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive
impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award
will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding
my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will
help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed
studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a
competitive, independent research career at a major research university."
10865095,"Title: Resetting the Clock on HIV associated COPD
PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this proposal is identifying the role of aberrant circadian-coupled gene expression
linking HIV and lung inflammation as a fundamental starting point to understand the pathophysiological
mechanism in HIV associated COPD. People living with HIV demonstrate increased lung inflammation and
incidence of COPD even when compensated for smoking status. Disruption of the lung molecular clock has been
implicated in increased lung inflammation observed in COPD and smokers. SIRT1 is a principal circadian
deacetylase that serves as a critical link between core clock function and inflammatory responses in the lung.
HIV Tat, an immediate early protein of HIV that is secreted extracellularly, upregulates miR-142-5p in primary
bronchial epithelial cells. This upregulation results in suppression of SIRT1 and circadian disruption of core clock
genes BMAL1 and PER2. Likewise, cigarette smoking has also been shown to suppress SIRT1/BMAL1 pathway
and dysregulate the lung molecular clock with consequent increase in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. A
significant proportion of people living with HIV smoke tobacco/cigarettes, possibly exacerbating their lung
molecular clock dysfunction. This could be one of the core mechanisms that results in COPD exacerbations in
HIV smokers. Therefore, determining the role of lung molecular clock dysfunction in HIV associated lung
inflammation and COPD is the goal of this proposal. Resetting the molecular clock could thus help reduce
underlying inflammation and/or arrest the lung function decline observed in HIV smokers. We propose three
aims. Aim 1 determine that lung molecular clock is dysregulated by HIV Tat and identify the mechanism involved
and its impact on inflammation. Aim 2 will test the role of miR-142-5p/SIRT1/BMAL1 axis in lung molecular clock
dysfunction in HIV smokers/non smokers and in transgenic mouse models. Aim 3 will test clinically feasible
strategies with established potential to neutralize HIV Tat and reset the lung molecular clock in vitro and in
transgenic molecular clock mouse models in vivo. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms by which
HIV disrupts the lung molecular clock will provide therapeutic targets for HIV-associated COPD."
10865033,"Project summary
In metazoan, the presence of double-stranded (ds)DNA in the cytosol signals serious problems, which range
from radiation damage to pathogen invasion. The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense
against cytosolic dsDNA by initiating inflammatory signaling pathways. Cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways are
integral to host defense against numerous pathogens, and their malfunctions also result in various human
maladies.
Our research program is poised to resolve several long-standing mechanistic questions in understanding how
cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways are activated and regulated at the molecular level. We will also test new
concepts as to how these sensors might be stigmatized as autoantigens, and explore the mechanical forces
that drive and regulate their higher order assemblies. Our approaches include X-ray crystallography, rigorous
biochemical measurements, cell-based assays, electron microscopy, and single molecule methods.
Here, we will determine how cGAS coordinates different nucleotide substrates and metal co-factors at the
active site to specifically generate 2'-5'/3'-5' linked cyclic G/AMP. We will also investigate how dimerization is
allosterically coupled to activation. We will then determine how cGAS and ALR sensors selectively recognize
and signal through dsDNA. Next, we will test the role of phase-separation/transition in the normal and aberrant
activities of cytosolic dsDNA sensors. Finally, we will delineate mechanical forces and structural mechanisms
that underpin the activation and regulation of cytosolic dsDNA sensors. The molecular insights resulting from
the proposed studies will provide a foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies that target various
human diseases caused by dysregulated cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways."
10865072,"Abstract/ Project Summary: Despite the widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), the HIV
epidemic continues to impact racial and ethnic minority populations disproportionately. Although Black/African
American persons account for 13% of the U.S. population, they account for 41% of new HIV diagnoses and
experience the lowest rates of retention in HIV care and viral suppression (VS) compared to other racial/ethnic
groups. Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) likely contribute to racial disparities in HIV outcomes.
Although the outpatient setting is a vitally important aspect of care provision for PLWH, there are limited data
on the impact of intra-organizational SRD on HIV outcomes. Longitudinal engagement in HIV care is needed
for sustained VS, decreased community transmission of HIV. The organizational social context (OSC) includes
organizational culture (organizational norms and values that drive quality of care), organizational climate
(perception of the culture and how it impacts personal well-being), and workers' attitudes. Using a
randomized controlled trial, we will implement ARC (Accessibility, Responsiveness, Continuity) to
improve organizational behavior and reduce racial disparities in HIV outcomes for PLWH. ARC is an
evidence-based intervention that uses three strategies (ARC principles, ARC component tools, and ARC
mental models) to create OSCs that support the implementation of interventions to improve patient outcomes.
Clinics will be randomized to ARC (n = 2) or standard of care (SOC; n= 2). Those assigned to ARC will
address SRD occurring at the organizational level affecting care, including referral and treatment patterns for
PLWH. A pre-implementation period will be followed by ARC and ARC-associated implementation strategies
for 36 months and then a 12-month post-implementation period where we will continue to measure HIV
outcomes in both arms. We will compare HIV outcomes, namely VS and retention in care, and intermediate
outcomes, such as linkage to mental health treatment and staff turn-over in clinics assigned to ARC and SOC.
We will also evaluate whether individual (self-efficacy, perceived discrimination) and organizational factors
(OSC and cohesion of OSC measures) mediate the relationship between ARC, intermediate, and HIV
outcomes. In preparation to the RCT, we will evaluate baseline OSC measures across 12 HIV clinics in
Philadelphia and determine aspects of the OSC associated with VS and retention in care in a multi-level model
adjusting for neighborhood SRD, patient-level factors, and clustering of patients nested in clinics and
neighborhoods. We will then test the effectiveness of ARC in improving a primary outcome of VS and
secondary outcome of retention in care at the end of the implementation period. We will examine the
acceptability, sustainability, and cost of implementing ARC in outpatient HIV care. This research will advance
understanding of the impact of SRD on HIV treatment outcomes and health services research and the
implementation of a disseminable evidence-based practice aimed at reducing SRD."
10865075,"Project Summary/Abstract
The University of California, Berkeley (UCB) is a world-class research institution with a large number of
biomedical science undergraduates who are underrepresented minority, are first-generation college students,
come from low-socio-economic backgrounds or are disabled. The overarching goal of the UCB MARC program
is to prepare highly motivated students from these underrepresented (UR) groups to apply and succeed in Ph.D.
programs, helping to address the nation's need for a diverse scientific workforce. The program will address
barriers that deter UR students from pursuing research careers using three strategies. First, the program will
place students in labs run by PIs known for their scientific rigor and undergraduate mentoring skills. Second, the
program will provide a series of scientific and professional development workshops, journal clubs and research
seminars that will enhance the trainees' written and oral communication skills, their ability to ask important
scientific questions and to design rigorous experiments to address these questions, and to critically evaluate the
scientific findings. Third, the program will build a cohort of students and mentors who will support each other and
help the trainees achieve their career goals. Together, these strategies will enhance the self-efficacy and science
identity of the trainees and produce a group of gritty and rigorous young scientists with promising futures. The
program will engage evaluation and assessment tools to ensure that these strategies are successful in achieving
the its goals and to provide the flexibility to improve the program as it evolves.
The program will support UR junior and senior students with an intention to pursue a Ph.D. in the biomedical
sciences. Over the course of this five-year grant, we propose to support 78 MARC Scholars. Our goal is to have
>75% of MARC Scholars to matriculate into Ph.D. programs within two years of graduation from UCB. The
proposed MARC Program will also serve as a model for programs seeking to increase diversity and support the
success of undergraduate students from UR groups in research careers and share best practices with programs
that have overlapping goals."

and clinical trials on ADRC participants through a harmonized multimodality neuroimaging program at the
MCR and MCF sites, designed to support the overarching theme of the ADRC: “Multiple Etiology
Dementias.” The Neuroimaging Core will provide innovative technology and resources for understanding
the pathologic processes contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment through multimodal
imaging, for individualized imaging biomarker-based diagnosis considering sex as a biological variable,
ethnicity, race, additional structural and social determinants of health, and genetic-risk. The aims of the
Neuroimaging Core include: 1) Establish and maintain a harmonized MRI, DaTscan SPECT, β-amyloid,
tau, and FDG PET imaging program for Mayo Clinic ADRC MCR and MCF sites, and operate a
standardized quality control, image processing, and data analysis program for the ADRC cohorts including
the African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino Cohorts in MCF; 2) Support imaging studies, share ATN
and other imaging biomarker data on multiple dementia etiologies (AD, Lewy bodies, vascular) with the

10865859,"PROJECT SUMMARY – GENOMICS CORE
The Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and its related activities resulted in seminal
contributions to the genomics of AD and related disorders (ADRD) since 1990. These include identification of
AD genetic risk factors using endophenotype approach, discovery of familial mutations that cause frontotemporal
lobar degeneration (FTLD) and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) of AD, Lewy body spectrum disorders (LBD) and FTLD/ALS. Mayo Clinic ADRC contributes to systems
biology studies which integrate multi-omics and patient endophenotypes to discover novel therapeutic targets
and biomarkers for ADRD and molecular underpinnings for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and
dementia (VCID). These studies are conducted under the NIH-NIA consortia, AMP-AD, M2OVE-AD, Resilience-
AD, and CLEAR-AD in which Dr. Nilüfer Ertekin-Taner, the Director of the proposed ADRC Genomics Core,
serves as PI. Mayo Clinic ADRC samples are widely shared internally or externally. These samples undergo
characterizations including screening for disease/risk variants providing study inclusion criteria. These extensive
core-type activities continued with piecemeal funding for >15 years, given lack of a Mayo Clinic ADRC Genomics
Core. This proposal aims to establish a Genomics Core with the overarching objectives to a) centralize and
standardize these activities to meet the needs of Mayo Clinic ADRC and external investigators and b) support
innovative studies leveraging the rich collection of samples to discover genomic basis of the Multiple Etiology
Dementias. We expect the proposed Genomics Core to successfully streamline the genomic sample
management (Aim 1) and their multi-omics molecular characterizations (Aim 2); to determine the association
between these multi-omics measures and the exposome (Aim 3) and to share these outcomes broadly (Aim 4).
Our diverse Core Leadership and all aims are aligned with the PEDP. Our aims are to: Manage samples for
genomic analysis: We will standardize and centralize the DNA/RNA extraction, QC, internal/external distribution
and data management of the samples. Perform systematic multi-omics molecular profiling of Mayo Clinic ADRC
samples: We will perform genomic characterizations of samples from all ADRC participants including AD, FTLD
and LBD spectrum diagnoses using both existing (GWAS/WGS) and new molecular data (RNA/methylation).
Determine the association of exposome and multi-omics measures: Exposome including but not limited to
structural and social determinants of health (SSDoH) will be curated and included in innovative analyses. Share
data, algorithms, and summary outcomes with the ADRC and the research community: This will be accomplished
by collaborations with the NACC and NIA-approved data repository AD-Knowledge Portal. In summary, the
proposed ADRC Genomics Core will oversee the essential functions of genomics sample management, multi-
omics data generation, integration of these with exposome variables and widespread data sharing to support the
goals of the Mayo Clinic ADRC and the research community."

(NAIP), a multidisciplinary team of clinician-scientists, data engineers, cloud engineers, software engineers,
informaticists, statistical programmers, and translational operations specialists. The Digital Innovation Core will
also partner with existing and emerging investigator-initiated projects and research programs in the ADRC to
support their digital health technology needs. The Digital Innovation Core is set to accomplish its objectives by
developing and maintaining a comprehensive technological infrastructure, delivering specialized assistance to
researchers, and initiating concerted efforts with other Cores within the ADRC. The Core will also prioritize the
development of training programs and educational resources, execute rigorous evaluations of digital health
technologies, and distribute its findings and achievements throughout the broader AD/ADRD research
community. With an underlying focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the Digital Innovation Core, through
its commitment to fostering digital innovation, will catalyze significant progress in understanding, diagnosing, and
treating dementias AD/ADRD. The subsequent impact of these advancements will not only enhance clinical
research and patient care but will also significantly improve the quality of life for those affected by these

Research Plan:
This project proposes to investigate a novel role for the cytokine IL-33 in neonatal lung injury. Dr. Eldredge will
use a unique combination of hyperoxia to model evolving BPD in mice and airway samples from human BPD
patients to complete the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Determine the rolesof monocyte/macrophage and epithelial cell specific IL-33 signaling in HILI.
Aim 2. Determine whether monocyte and/or epithelial cell-derived IL-33 signaling contributes to BPD
pathogenesis.
These studies will yield important information about IL-33/ST2 signaling as a novel inflammatory pathway in
BPD. Results will determine how IL-33 signaling and crosstalk in monocytes/macrophages and epithelial cells
affect the neonatal immune response to hyperoxia-induced lung injury. These studies will also determine if IL-
33, its receptor ST2, or the downstream growth factor amphiregulin may be important BPD biomarkers, and
whether modulation of IL-33 signaling may be a future therapy for these fragile infants. This translational

10848983,"Our purpose in TR&D1 is to develop and validate novel translatable molecular imaging and theranostic agents
to detect and promote an immune reactive tumor microenvironment (TME) that will be integrated into the
research of multiple collaborative and service projects. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have provided some of the
most exciting treatment outcomes for some cancers, but for nearly 80% of cancers the promise of cancer
immunotherapy (CIT) has not been realized. Cancers have complex TMEs with an altered extracellular matrix,
hypoxia and acidic extracelluar pH (pHe) that present a formidable barrier to immune cell infiltration and cancer
cell killing. Non-invasive translatable imaging methods that provide spatio-temporal information on mechanisms
that create barriers to CIT and provide novel theranostic strategies to improve the outcome of CIT are urgently
needed to accelerate progress in this field. During the previous funding period we have made significant
advances in multimodal imaging of the TME and siRNA theranostics that we have built upon and combined with
our expertise in PET/MR imaging, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), theranostics and CIT to design
three aims that will identify a TME hostile to CIT, and provide novel theranostic approaches to overcome such
an environment to facilitate CIT. We have focused on breast and pancreatic preclinical cancer models in these
studies as these cancers have limited response to CIT. In Aim 1 we will develop novel PET and CEST MRI
probes based on decorin to expand our understand of the spatio-temporal dynamics between collagen 1,
decorin, hypoxia, pHe, and immune checkpoint PD-L1/PD-1 expression in syngeneic models of pancreatic and
breast cancer using multimodal imaging. In Aim 2 we will develop and validate multi-modality
imaging/multiplexed siRNA theranostics of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the spleen and tumor
to create an immune reactive TME in these tumor models. In Aim 3 we will develop hypoxia targeted NPs to
deliver siRNA or PX-478 to downregulate HIF-1 in tumors to understand the effects of HIF-1 downregulation
on PD-L1/PD-1 expression. The reagents and resources developed in the three aims will be incorporated in a
push pull mechanism by the CPs and by the SPs to collectively advance progress in CIT."
10848984,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TR&D 2
Cancer can rarely be eradicated with single-agent therapy. More information than is capable of being carried by
one small molecule is often required. We can synthesize nanomedicines engineered to perform multiple tasks
in sequence, leveraging the tumor milieu for initiation of these tasks. For instance, we now have the ability to
design technology meaningful for management of a variety of cancers, including colorectal (CRC), melanoma
and even pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most insidious and lethal malignancies. Here
we will develop platform technology to enable treatment of those cancers whether localized or metastatic. The
goal will be to reprogram malignant cells and the related tumor microenvironment (TME) to eradicate tumor in
situ. The nanoparticle (NP) that we will ultimately produce will be optimized with respect to the key properties of
targetability (pharmacokinetics), payload delivery and efficacy. It will be a combination of two separate platforms
optimized for other purposes and previously leveraged for other malignancies. The first platform involves use of
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), which will be utilized to test two different targeting moieties and a
therapeutic agent, TLY012, while the second uses a poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE) structure, and is designed
to deliver nucleic acids intracellularly, including for reprogramming the TME. We will use these two different
platforms, and the corresponding experience and new preliminary data, to develop a hybrid particle that
combines the best properties of each. Aims 1 and 2 will be dedicated primarily to the synthesis and testing of
the MSN, which are adept at presenting cell surface molecules and delivering therapeutics upon target
engagement. Aim 3 will involve development of the PBAE NPs for theranostic intracellular delivery of plasmid,
including encoding an immunostimulatory cytokine, while the final aim will be concerned with synthesis, testing
and optimization of the combination NP, designed to overcome both extracellular and intracellular bottlenecks.
We will focus on CRC, which is the second deadliest cancer, melanoma, and PDAC, the third deadliest cancer.
There is a variety of phenotypes associated with PDAC, in particular, which can be primarily cystic, mucinous,
or can be fenced in behind a desmoplastic stroma. We are excited to pursue PDAC because we have shown
that TLY012 can reprogram the TME to decrease desmoplasia and increase cytotoxic T cell infiltration."
10848985,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TR&D 3
Others and we have shown that inflammation underlies the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders,
extending from neuropsychiatric disease to infection and cancer. Within the central nervous system (CNS),
neuro-inflammation is a contributing factor, if not the elemental process, behind such disparate entities as
cognitive impairment due to mild, repetitive traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, dementia due to
Alzheimer’s disease, HIV-related cognitive impairment and the neurological sequelae of Long Covid.
Nevertheless, quantitative, non-invasive and specific tools for measurement of neuro-inflammation remain
elusive. Specificity is required because inflammation may create or combat disease, depending on the cells
involved and their temporal appearance at the site of putative injury. In the periphery, inflammation plays a
similarly important role in promoting or fighting cancer. In the tumor microenvironment (TME) different
populations of cells, of which the innate and adaptive immune responses are comprised, enter and leave as part
of a continual struggle between the host and his/her malignancy. That balance has recently been tilted toward
the host in many cases, most notably through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, they and other
immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines, antibody-drug conjugates and CAR T cells, are ineffective in the majority
of patients to whom they are administered, and can be associated with significant adverse effects. Better
understanding of inflammation in these varied contexts, i.e., the cells involved, when and to what extent, will
enable design of superior agents to support the salutary aspects and reprogramming of the TME, where needed.
Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is one way by which the TME might be reprogrammed. Because of the
[177Lu]PSMA-617 expanded access program in the US, sufficient data are accumulating to enable appropriate
patient selection, dosing regimens and prognosis for patients undergoing this effective new therapy for PSMA-
expressing cancers. Across four aims we will: (1) synthesize and test 18F-labeled agents for CSF1R; (2) test and
validate [18F]FNDP in preclinical models and patients with Long Covid, the latter in collaboration with CP2; (3)
develop a new “pan-cancer” theranostic targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and prostate-specific
membrane antigen (PSMA); and, (4) use data from a clinically available PSMA theranostic to develop a program
to enable personalized radiopharmaceutical therapy and prognosis."
10848986,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most widely used type of cells in stem cell therapy, with over 1,000
registered clinical trials primarily focused on immunosuppression of inflammatory disease. “MSCs” are often
termed “medicinal stem cells”, as they secrete multiple beneficial factors in the form of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) that have trophic homing properties for sites of inflammation. However, the use of MSCs is limited by
complex regulatory issues and logistics, low cell viability, and high costs. The field of cell therapy has now
been shifting to the production of EVs as a “cell-free” alternative. Similar to tracking whole cells, it will be
imperative to be able to track the biodistribution of these therapeutic EVs in vivo in order to interpret and
improve therapeutic outcome. We propose to develop two types of labeled MSC-derived EV formulations and
will compare their in vivo imaging (MRI and MPI) and therapeutic properties to unmodified, naïve EVs, that we
hypothesize may still be trackable with CEST MRI by virtue of their mannose-rich membrane composition.
Based upon the existing clinical trials using MSCs in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), we will evaluate our MSC-EV formulations in vivo using an experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model and a superoxide dismutase-decificient transgenic ALS mouse
model. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: AIM 1: To develop magnetically labeled MSC-EVs
as a bimodal negative MRI contrast agent and magnetic particle imaging (MPI) tracer. We will use
electroporation to load EVs with superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs). Unlike with MRI, the number of MSC-
SPIO-EVs can be quantified with MPI. AIM 2: To develop gadolinium-labeled MSC-EVs as positive MRI
contrast agent. We will use lipophilic gadolinium chelates and lipid insertion techniques to render EVs with
paramagnetic membranes. AIM 3: To develop unlabeled MSC-EVs as diaCEST MRI contrast agent. We will
take advantage of the natural expression of high-mannose type N glycans on EV membranes which provide
contrast on mannose-weighted CEST MRI, without the need of further vesicle manipulation. AIM 4: To track
the in vivo distribution and therapeutic outcome of labeled and unlabeled EVs in a mouse models of EAE and
ALS. This will serve as an internal JHU validation study. We will investigate various administration routes and
use standard behavioral scoring tests to correlate the diagnostic and therapeutic outcome measures of our
nanotheranostic approach. We will compare and validate all three MSC-EV imaging strategies in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, and EV functionality. Upon proper synthesis, characterization, and in vivo validation, we
will disseminate our SPIO-MSC-EVs, Gd-MSC-EVs, and unlabeled EVs to the CPS, SPs, and beyond."
10848987,"TRAINING AND DISSEMINATION SUMMARY
We consider the NCBIB to be primarily about dissemination of our technology. The most important kind of
dissemination is training that we can provide not only to individuals in the molecular imaging community, but also
to those involved in the allied health sciences and other areas of STEM. We have significantly enhanced both
the training and dissemination aspects of the NCBIB in this renewal application. In terms of training, we intend
to reach out more actively to students in the community, including those underrepresented in STEM. We will
leverage the fact that we have ties to several historically black colleges and universities in the area. A second
innovation in education and training is to link our NCBIB to two other imaging-centric NCBIBs, one at Washington
University and the other at Harvard/MGH, whereby we will not only share reagents but also speakers at our
webinars and symposia. We will co-sponsor more educational activities than in the past, having recently
established formal ties to programs at the annual meeting of the World Molecular Imaging Society. Dissemination
has been enhanced through closer ties to large pharma and equipment manufacturers, as well as through
founding our own start-up companies, one dedicated to molecular imaging and theranostic agents and the other
to developing artificial intelligence solutions to issues in molecular imaging and therapy. That latter company, an
outgrowth from the Informatics Core in the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging at Johns Hopkins,
will help to produce software that can be downloaded from our website by interested parties. We have come to
recognize that by partnering with industry we can perform or be involved in the kinds of studies necessary to
advance a product to FDA approval, and its attendant widespread dissemination. Education in entrepreneurship
is another new aspect to this core. The aforementioned activities will occur in concert with the usual means of
dissemination, including publication in peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, invited lectures and other media.
Because we generate clinical agents, we will also provide materials, protocols and IND cross-references when
requested, and through material transfer agreements, if necessary. We have also learned the importance of one-
on-one training, with the leaders of this core contributing many hours in this fashion, not only for disseminating
our domain expertise but also as a recruitment tool to the NCBIB."
10849086,"OVERALL: SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary malignancy of hepatocytes, is a diagnosis with bleak outcomes.
With the alarming rise in global obesity incidence, obesity-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is
becoming a leading cause of HCC. HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is
unresectable. The most effective FDA-approved treatment for advanced non-resectable HCC is a combination
of anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) and anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) antibodies, providing an overall response rate of
27%. Apart from immunotherapy, systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, such as sorafenib or
lenvatinib) provides only a modest (~3 months) increase in overall survival and causes drug resistance within
six months. Recent studies document that immunotherapy may be less effective in patients with NASH-HCC
than in HCC patients with viral hepatitis. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop novel and effective
modalities of treatment for advanced HCC. This P01 proposal ExpLoiting theErapeutic VulnerAbilities in
hepaTocEllular carcinoma (ELEVATE), which involves four projects, an administrative core (Core 1), a
mouse model and pathological analysis core (Core 2), and a biostatistics and bioinformatics core (Core 3;
BBC), aims to interrogate molecular changes in HCC and exploit them to develop combinatorial treatment
approaches especially targeted to NASH-HCC. The overall objectives include interrogation of molecular
mechanisms regulating NASH-HCC and the development of novel combinatorial treatment approaches based
on the identified molecular abnormalities, evaluation of approaches that improve efficacy of approved
immunotherapy using an authentic NASH-HCC mouse model, and development and evaluation of novel
approaches that engage the immune system to counteract HCC (inflammatory and NASH-HCC). To achieve
this objective, this P01 comprises experts, with an established history of highly integrated interaction, in HCC
biology and mouse modeling, liver physiology and pathology, medicinal chemistry, cancer immunotherapy,
pathological diagnosis, nanoparticle delivery, and bioinformatics and biostatistics. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of HCC
pathogenesis and novel therapeutics and generate translationally relevant data from pre-clinical models having
the potential to radically transform the management of HCC patients facilitating prolonged survival. Thus, this
innovative P01 grant has high mechanistic and translational significance. ELEVATE brings together the
expertise of a highly integrated team providing synergistic outcomes that may not be delivered by each project
alone."
10849087,"CORE 1 – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: SUMMARY
The overall goal of this P01 program project grant (PPG) application, titled ELEVATE, is to evaluate novel
therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pre-clinical models, with the ultimate objective
of transitioning these approaches to Phase I/II clinical trials. To achieve this, a team of investigators with robust
expertise in HCC, mouse modeling, cancer immunotherapy, nanoparticle-based delivery, and medicinal
chemistry will continue to collaborate on four highly integrated research projects. Core 2, the Mouse Model and
Pathological Analysis Core, will provide crucial support by generating essential mouse models to investigate
gene function and evaluate therapeutic responses. Additionally, Core 2 will provide critical analysis of tissue
samples to diagnose tumorigenesis and changes in response to treatment. Core 3, the Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core (BBC), will provide biostatistical and bioinformatics support across the projects. Given the
complex interactions among the four projects and two cores, the Administrative Core (Core 1) will provide
critical support to facilitate overall integration, planning, and management of the ELEVATE program. Core 1,
the Administrative Core, will 1) provide overall research direction and program oversight by setting the
research agenda focused on novel treatment approaches for HCC; 2) deliver general administrative and fiscal
management support, which will ensure effective and efficient intra- and inter-institutional communication,
coordination, and compliance with all terms and conditions of the grant; 3) promote communication and
integration within the program, facilitate constructive review and enhancement of the research progress
through frequent and deliberate interactions with expert External and Internal Scientific Advisory Committees
(ESAC and ISAC, respectively), and create and maintain a PPG website and secure portal for enhanced
communications and data sharing/dissemination by and among the research projects; and 4) facilitate and
promote collaborative science by organizing and coordinating annual retreats and symposia on HCC. Core 1
will ensure seamless collaboration among all components of the ELEVATE program to accomplish the overall
and specific project goals."
10866524,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer (LCa) is the second most common malignancy in the US with about 222,500 new cases and
155,900 deaths each year. HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients have increased relative risk of LCa by
250% after controlling for other potential risk factors. LCa in HIV+ people under antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
diagnosed at younger ages than those in the general population. This trend in the ART era is implicitly
attributed to prolonged life span and aging of the population. The success of new approaches to control lung
tumorigenesis in the population is contingent to identify HIV-specific mechanisms that facilitate the tumor
progression and metastasis. HIV-infected T cells release a variety of immunologically active exosomes, small
vesicles of endocytic origin, to influence intercellular communication and material transfer at both local and
distant sites, thus potentially contribute to enhanced risk for tumorigenesis. Our preliminary studies have found
that exosomes secreted by HIV-infected T cells and purified from the blood of lung cancer patients of people
living with HIV (PLWH) significantly stimulated lung cancer cell proliferation. HIV-associated exosomes induced
MAP kinase ERK1/2 activation via interaction with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the toll like
receptor 3 (TLR3). Mechanistically, the HIV trans-activation response (TAR) element RNA, which exists in
excess of other HIV RNAs in exosome from HIV-infected T cells, is responsible for enhanced cancer cell
proliferation and proto-oncogene expression. We have established a bone marrow transplant (BMT) mouse
model in which lethally-irradiated FVB mice were grafted with syngeneic bone marrow cells of Tg26 HIV-
transgenic mice. Growth and metastasis of allografts LCa cells were significantly enhanced in grafted mice
containing HIV+ bone marrow cells compared with that in non-grafted control mice. However, reconstitution of
circulating immune cells and bone marrow remained the same between two groups of mice, suggesting that
TAR RNA-bearing exosomes from reconstituted HIV+ immune cells may promote LCa progression in the BMT
model. Taken together, these data lead us to hypothesize that TAR RNA-bearing exosomes from HIV-infected
immune cells promote lung cancer growth and progression and that controlling release of the exosomes or
directly targeting the TAR RNA may serve as an adjuvant for prevention and treatment of lung cancer in HIV-
infected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we will first delineate the mechanism by which HIV-1-infected T-
cell exosomes stimulate LCa growth and progression in vivo using the BMT model. The potentials for
therapeutic intervention of LCa promotion by HIV will be examined through inhibition of exosome production
and neutralization of TAR RNA. Finally, we will comprehensively examine the HIV-positive exosomal
membrane proteins for interaction with EGFR and HIV-specific cargo components in the circulation using our
novel EV-omics approach. Completion of the proposed studies will shed light on the mechanisms underlying
HIV-mediated promotion of LCa and lay a foundation for therapeutic intervention of non-AIDS-defining cancers."

The overarching goal of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to provide state-of-the-
art infrastructure, expertise, and resources to conduct cutting-edge, multidisciplinary, equitable, and
generalizable research in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, with a special focus on preclinical
biomarkers of AD and their role in predicting transition from pre-symptomatic to symptomatic stages of the
disease. The Administrative Core will set the overall research directions and priorities, oversee and coordinate
core-related activities, ensure optimal utilization of ADRC resources, and serve as a resource to expand AD
research locally, nationally, and beyond.
Under the overall scientific and administrative leadership of Sanjay Asthana, MD, the Wisconsin ADRC Director,
the Administrative Core will continue to exercise its leadership and accomplish its objectives through the activities
of four major committees. The External Advisory Committee, comprised of distinguished leaders in AD research
at institutions outside of Wisconsin and with expertise aligned with the scientific missions of the ADRC, provides
advice concerning the overall direction and performance of the Center. The Executive Committee, comprised of
the ADRC Director, Associate Director, Administrator, Core Leaders, Core Co-Leaders, and Data/informatics
Leader, meets monthly to discuss the overall function and scientific opportunities for the ADRC, review each
Core’s progress, and resolve problems within or between Cores. The Resource Distribution Committee,
composed of the ADRC Director, Associate Director, Core Leaders, Administrator, and ad hoc reviewers,
evaluates and approves requests for data, access to clinical core participants, biospecimens, and autopsy brain
tissue, and advises the Center Director concerning resource utilization priorities. The Administrative Core places
strong emphasis on wide utilization of the Wisconsin ADRC resources, but ensures distribution to support only
high-quality research while avoiding competing uses for limited biospecimens. The Developmental Project (DP)
Review Committee evaluates all the DP applications, prioritizing those from junior investigators with novel
research projects and a strong likelihood of generating pilot data and attracting external funding. Overall, the

of the Wisconsin ADRC in the renewed funding cycle."
10863180,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This CoFAR application brings together seasoned clinical and laboratory investigators in food allergy (FA) with
expertise in clinical studies and trials and translational immunologic, microbiome and metabolomic pathways.
The investigators have long track records in implementing single sites and multi-site clinical trials and
observational studies in allergic diseases, including FA, to the standards of NIH funded clinical research
networks, in conducting NIH fundamental research on disease mechanisms in FA and in training generations of
investigators in FA research.
In part A we demonstrate that we have the personnel and facilities to conduct CoFAR network-wide and Clinical
Research Center-specific research, and a great capacity to recruit subjects from all age groups and different
racial and ethnic backgrounds. We have a highly experienced team, a very solid and rich clinical research and
laboratory infrastructure, data management facility with quality control plans, and capability to upload data into
the NIAID designated repositories.
In part B our network-wide trial proposes to evaluate the safety and efficacy of microbiota transplantation therapy
(MTT) in teens with peanut allergy. Our basic and translational studies have provided critical evidence on the
role of microbiome manipulation in FA. Our cutting-edge phase I trial in adults showed very promising results.
We hypothesize that MTT with and without low dose peanut oral immunotherapy will be safe in peanut-allergic
teens, will increase their threshold dose of reactivity to peanut and will lead to immunological and microbiome
changes.
In Part C, we propose to investigate FA novel immunological biomarkers identified in our laboratories.
Specifically, RORgt+ Treg cells play a critical in mediating oral tolerance while Th2 cell-like reprogrammed
regulatory T (Treg) cells play an essential role in disease pathogenesis. The thymic stromal lymphopoietin
receptor (TSLPR) expression is predictive of Th2 cell-like reprogramming and disease promotion. Resistin-like
beta (RELMβ) is elevated in FA in inverse relationship with RORgt+ Treg cells and plays a critical role in disease
pathogenesis by promoting anaphylaxis. We hypothesize that changes in Treg cell subpopulations and markers
and RELMb play a critical in the outcome of natural tolerance or successful peanut desensitization.
This project evaluates novel microbiome therapies and mechanisms fundamental to FA and pave the way for
future intervention and biomarker driven approaches to inform future precision therapy. We address a critical
need in investigating novel therapeutic approaches and immunological pathways associated with peanut allergy.
We will contribute extensively to the CoFAR as a CoFAR-Clinical Research Center, with our infrastructure and
expertise."

10862959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is one of the most urgent prevention and treatment
challenges in public health today given its increasing prevalence, limited therapeutic options, and substantial
burden on global health care systems. Exercise-based prevention and treatment strategies for HFpEF have
historically focused on the promotion of aerobic exercise. However, given the coinciding epidemics of physical
inactivity and obesity in the U.S., and the compromised aerobic capacity and exercise intolerance in patients
with HFpEF, long-term adherence to aerobic exercise is generally poor and thus, the prevention and treatment
of HFpEF remains a major public health challenge. Thus, aligned with NHLBI research priorities for HFpEF,
research is critically needed to: (1) identify optimal strategies for improving adherence to exercise in the
prevention and treatment of HFpEF; and (2) examine biological pathways linking exercise to HFpEF. In the
proposed project, Dr. McDonough, an exercise science and public health researcher, will examine the isolated
role of resistance exercise in the prevention and treatment of HFpEF with examination of potential biological
intermediates. With the exceptional mentorship team he has assembled, comprised of prolific epidemiologists,
physician scientists, and methodologists, and the resources available to him through the University of Minnesota,
this Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity will support Dr. McDonough in filling critical
training gaps and conducting the research necessary to launch his career as an independent investigator utilizing
cohort studies to inform his future clinical trials in the treatment and secondary prevention of HFpEF. To prepare
him for this role, a multifaceted training plan including coursework, mentorship, and research is proposed in: (1)
the analysis of longitudinal data from cohort studies using a variety of multivariable regression modeling
approaches; (2) the pathophysiology and epidemiology of HFpEF and how to safely implement exercise training
in patients with HFpEF; (3) advanced clinical trial methods and statistical analyses; and (4) advanced
epidemiologic statistical modeling of pathways and mediators. The expertise Dr. McDonough develops through
this training plan will be essential for conducting the proposed research. During the mentored K99 phase, he will
leverage NHLBI cohort studies to elucidate the independent role of resistance exercise in HFpEF primary and
secondary prevention (Aims 1-3). In the independent R00 phase, Dr. McDonough will conduct an independent
feasibility clinical trial examining the effect of resistance exercise on liver fat and subsequent functional capacity,
quality of life, and intervention adherence in HFpEF patients (Aim 4). Findings from this project will provide the
requisite preliminary data to support an NIH R01 grant proposal examining novel exercise therapies for improving
hospitalization, mortality, and physical activity outcomes in HFpEF patients, in line with NHLBI, AHA, and ACC
research priorities. In turn, Dr. McDonough will be well-positioned for a successful transition to an independent
research career at an R1 institution while helping to enhance diversity in the biomedical research enterprise."
10860476,"Abstract – Molecular basis of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity and
signaling bias
The complement system is a vital part of the immune system, involved in promoting inflammation and clearance
of pathogens. Dysregulation of this system has been linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders,
neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complement
activation and signaling is crucial for therapeutic development. This study aims to investigate the molecular basis
of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity, and signaling bias. As part of our
studies, we will obtain valuable insights through structural determination and characterization of these receptors,
revealing unique binding pocket topologies and details of receptor activation, and signaling. The specific aims of
the study are: 1) elucidating the mechanisms of receptor activation and beta-arrestin recruitment, 2) identifying
molecular determinants of signaling bias and receptor selectivity, and 3) investigating immune response
regulation and antagonism of complement receptors. The research strategy involves cryo-electron microscopy,
signaling assays, and structural and biochemical techniques. The significance of this work lies in its potential to
advance our understanding of complement receptor biology, provide frameworks for drug design, and offer new
insights into immunomodulatory roles of these receptors. The findings could lead to the development of novel
compounds and contribute to the understanding of complement receptor functions in physiology and disease
contexts. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of any GPCR subfamily to date
and aims to address long-standing questions regarding ligand selectivity, signaling bias, regulation, and
antagonism. The results will have implications for the development of tool compounds and therapeutic
interventions targeting complement receptors and have the potential to impact a wide range of diseases
associated with complement system dysfunction."
10864042,"Project Summary
In contrast to the cardiomyocytes (CMs) from lower vertebrates, adult mammalian CMs possess very limited
regenerative potential as a result of cell cycle exit. Interestingly, neonatal mice retain cardiac regenerative
capacity, which is lost by postnatal day 7. We have recently shown that 1-day-old pigs can also regenerate lost
myocardium in response to myocardial infarction (MI). This regeneration is mediated by the proliferation of
preexisting CMs, which does not occur when CMs permanently exit the cell cycle. Mechanisms underlying the
injury-mounted regenerative response especially in large mammals are not fully understood. However,
investigating underlying mechanisms is likely to identify novel targets for future therapeutic interventions.
Recent studies in fish and rodents emphasized the critical importance of vascularization and autonomic
innervation of the regenerating myocardium in zebrafish and neonatal mouse hearts. Besides their function to
provide nutrients, transport metabolites and enable adaptation to stress, it is unknown whether vascular and
neuronal cells, via paracrine interactions, also promote CM proliferation. Intriguingly, our preliminary data
support the idea that soluble factors, e.g., cytokines, secreted from vascular endothelial cells and peripheral
sympathetic neurons significantly stimulate cell cycle activity of co-cultured human induced pluripotent stem
cells-derived CMs, suggesting a critical role of nonmyocyte-CM interactions in modulating CM proliferation in
hearts of larger mammals post injury. In this project, we will exploit the established high regenerative capacity
of the neonatal pig heart model to experimentally address the role of nonmyocytes in injury-induced cardiac
regeneration in large mammals. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to define the role of early
revascularization in injury-mounted cardiac regeneration. We will test the hypothesis that early
revascularization is essential for cardiac regeneration in neonatal pigs, and determine whether angiogenesis
promotes cardiac regeneration through the release of pro-myogenic factors from endothelial and/or smooth
muscle cells and/or via de novo formation of functional vessels for maintenance of CM viability. Aim 2 is to
delineate the role of autonomic innervation in injury-mounted cardiac regeneration. We will test the
hypothesis that innervation is essential for post injury cardiac regeneration in neonatal pigs, and determine if
biomaterial-mediated epicardial delivery of angiogenic and neurotrophic factors enhances cardiac regeneration
in neonatal pigs post MI."
10864044,"Project summary: Development of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells is paramount for the control of viral
infections, such as influenza. The complete identification of extracellular factors promoting memory CD8+ T
cells will favor the better design of CD8+ T cell-inducing immunizations and antiviral therapies. Notably, we
have found that one of these factors, extracellular ATP (eATP) – via its receptor P2RX7 - promotes the
generation and long-term survival of virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells, both in the circulation (central
memory cells – TCM) and in barrier tissues (resident memory cells – TRM) in response to systemic viral infection.
These findings highlight an unanticipated role for the “danger signal” eATP for the promotion of antiviral
immunity. However, there still are gaps on the understanding of how P2RX7 promotes memory CD8+ T cell
long-term survival. This is especially true for the TRM pool, which is relevant both in the context of both systemic
and tissue-localized infections. In Aim 1, we will build up on preliminary studies suggesting that P2RX7
upregulation in a subset of memory precursors favor the development of long-lived TRM cells. We are especially
interested in understanding how preferential upregulation of P2RX7 at such an early stage of the immune
response affects TRM cell survival long after this time window. In Aim 2, we propose to address how P2RX7
expression promotes TRM cell longevity in the context of influenza infection. Our preliminary data suggests that,
despite initial seeding of the lung is mostly independent of P2RX7 (and expression of P2RX7 itself is low),
influenza-specific lung TRM cells that survive the numerical decay typical of this infection express high levels of
P2RX7, and need this receptor to maintain. We will perform experiments to understand (a) the origin of
P2RX7-expressing long-lived flu-specific lung TRM cells, and (b) how manipulating P2RX7 expression and its
potential upstream regulation promote better survival of lung TRM cells and their protective ability against
secondary influenza challenge. Overall, we will test the hypothesis that, in response to multiple viral infections,
expression of the eATP sensor P2RX7 selects memory CD8+ T cells for long-term survival in barrier tissues.
These studies will establish how dynamic regulation of this eATP sensor promotes the longevity of memory
CD8+ T cells in distinct infection and inflammatory contexts. They will also serve as a proof-of-concept for
potential future experimental setups aiming to boost the protective ability of memory CD8+ T cells to influenza,
a disease of high medical relevance."

 The Department of Neurology, including the Division of Child Neurology, and the Center for Clinical
Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB) at the University of Pennsylvania propose to continue and enhance an
innovative, rigorous, and successful two- to three-year research training program for clinicians in both adult
and pediatric neurologic clinical epidemiology research.
 The training program focuses on mentored research with an experienced investigator that involves didactic
training and the planning, design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of an independent neurologic clinical
research project, all intended to be the next step in a trainee’s academic career preparing him/her for a career
as an independently funded researcher. Trainees matriculate in the Master of Science in Clinical
Epidemiology (MSCE) program. Didactic coursework consists of required courses in epidemiology and
biostatistics, the basic sciences of high-quality clinical research, methodology in neurologic clinical
epidemiology, advanced epidemiology, protocol development, sophisticated biostatistics, and elective courses
relevant to the trainees’ methodologic interests. The training program is enhanced by journal clubs and clinical
research conferences led by faculty; instruction in the responsible conduct of research; and a professional
development series. The program will: 1) train clinicians to be rigorous and independent academic
investigators able to use the range of approaches available in epidemiology to address research issues in
neurology; 2) provide closely mentored research experiences with faculty preceptors in clinical epidemiology
and neurologic medicine; and 3) strengthen the links between traditional epidemiology and neurology. The
program aims to recruit a diverse group of trainees and provide them with an inclusive and supportive
environment that enables them to reach their full potential.
 Strengths of the proposed program are: 1) the long history of successful research training programs in adult
and pediatric neurology using the structure provided by the CCEB, including this training program; 2) the
collaborative links that have been forged among faculty with interests in clinical research in neurology; 3) the
comprehensive course offerings and research programs that are available to trainees; and 4) an extensive set
of experienced and multidisciplinary faculty mentors with successful training records. The training program also
brings together dozens of trainees from across all disciplines in medicine, which provides an ideal environment
for collaborative learning and growth. The program recognizes the importance of addressing issues of health
disparities and aims to train investigators who are equipped to address these challenges. Finally, The University
of Pennsylvania and the Perelman School of Medicine promote an academic environment in which basic,
clinical, and translational research are encouraged and viewed as attractive career paths for physicians."

 While cancer is known for its heterogeneity, with distinct subtypes observed within each organ system, the
source of this heterogeneity, and the relationship between subtype definition and clinical outcomes, remain
contested. Studies in animal models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) suggest that the cell-of-origin of individual tumors has a strong influence on subtype, defined
transcriptionally, and tumor aggressiveness, defined by survival and metastatic potential. In particular, mouse
PDAC derived from exocrine acinar cells predominantly expresses a “classical” subtype signature, and is slower
to develop than duct-derived tumors, while mouse HCC derived from hepatocytes is more aggressive than that
derived from hepatocyte precursor cells. The tools for lineage-tracing and genetic manipulation used in mouse
studies cannot be applied to human patients, however, leaving an important knowledge gap regarding the
cell of origin of human PDAC and HCC and its influence on tumor subtype and clinical outcomes.
 To address these gaps, we propose a study focusing on the cell-of-origin concept in PDAC and HCC. We
have observed that non-random somatic mutations in highly-expressed genes of normal cells create a
""lineage mark"" in tumor cells, serving as permanent traces of the cell of origin. We hypothesize that cell-of-
origin can serve as a novel biomarker in PDAC and HCC, with potential implications for patient stratification and
treatment decisions. In Aim 1, we will establish a sequencing-based paradigm for relating the cell-of-origin in
human PDAC to tumor subtype and clinical behavior. By leveraging existing whole genome sequencing (WGS)
and RNA-seq data, as well as applying an innovative targeted deep-sequencing approach to locally-collected
samples, we will validate and expand our findings of indels in acinar-specific genes associated with PDAC. The
wet-lab/dry-lab pipeline developed in this aim will be directly applicable to prospectively-collected human
samples. Aim 2 aims to determine the timing and spatial specificity of cell-of-origin mutations in HCC. By
analyzing existing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, we will identify de novo indels in liver-expressed
genes. This analysis will shed light on the timing of lineage-specific indel mutations during the transition from
normal liver tissue to HCC, and can be applied to PDAC and other cancers, as scRNA-seq analysis increasingly
enters the clinic. Overall, this research has significant implications for improving patient outcomes and lays the
foundation for future investigations into the mechanisms underlying PDAC and HCC development in humans."

In the United States, 42% of the population is obese, and this obesity predisposes individuals for several
diseases including type 2 diabetes which affects 29 million Americans. One established mechanism for the
causal relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes is the development of lipotoxicity, a state where excess
lipids build-up to cause increased ectopic lipid droplets, elevated plasma lipids, and subsequently, decreased
cellular insulin signaling. These plasma lipids that are increased with lipotoxicity include acylcarnitines, a key
intermediate in fatty acid oxidation. Acylcarnitines are an established biomarker of type 2 diabetes, hepatocellular
carcinoma, and cardiovascular disease, and are known to cause insulin resistance. Despite the known
importance of plasma acylcarnitines in the development of insulin resistance, we do not know how they are
imported into cells, how this uptake is regulated, or how imported acylcarnitines are metabolized once they enter
the cell from the circulatory system.
In this proposal we examine the regulation of acylcarnitine uptake by transporters we have identified through a
CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Through targeted knockout of these transporters, we will conduct cell culture experiments
to highlight the precise molecular pathways through which acylcarnitines enter the cell and signal for insulin
sensitivity. We will also explore tissue specific loss of acylcarnitines in mouse models to determine the
contribution of plasma acylcarnitine uptake on whole-body energy expenditure, glucose regulation, and plasma
lipid pools. Finally, we will determine how these transporters for plasma acylcarnitines are regulated in cell
culture and tissue samples from mice to establish potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic
disease.
The proposed work will address long-standing questions on the molecular regulation of plasma acylcarnitine
import, metabolism of acylcarnitines after entry into the cell, and the regulation of insulin sensitivity by
acylcarnitines. In terms of translatability, this work will generate a mechanistic understanding of how plasma
acylcarnitine abundance is controlled and how plasma acylcarnitines impact disease vulnerability to enable the
identification of new targets for the pharmacological treatment of obesity and diabetes."

The first synapse of the visual system—between photoreceptors and bipolar cells—is critical to visual processing
but displays abnormal specificity and maintenance in the setting of photoreceptor dysfunction. Functional
restoration, for example with gene or cell-based therapies, will depend upon a greater understanding of altered
synaptic connectivity in human retinal disease. The human retinal organoid system permits the detailed study
of synaptic development and maintenance in retinal tissue in a scalable and experimentally accessible fashion.
The proposed experiments will use human retinal organoids to address the hypothesis that rod bipolar cell (RBC)
dendrites initially form non-specific contacts with rods and cones, which then become increasingly specific during
development, and that synaptic promiscuity in retinal diseases represents a recapitulation of these non-specific
interactions in early retinal development. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 determines
the long-term developmental stages of photoreceptor-bipolar cell synaptogenesis and specifically examines
whether rod-RBC synaptic specificity is achieved by pruning inappropriate contacts. Aim 2 investigates the
short-term dynamics of RBC synaptogenesis in live organoids using a CRISPR-engineered fluorescent reporter
line to ascertain whether exploratory dendrite behavior facilitates synaptic specificity. Aim 3 examines the role
of glutamate release in synapse formation, maintenance, and specificity as mediated by Cav1.4, the presynaptic
calcium channel implicated in X-linked congenital stationary night blindness. The proposed work will provide
opportunities to make significant advances in understanding synaptic wiring in human retinal tissue, thus
establishing this system to identify molecular targets that maintain or restore synaptic connectivity. This
application constitutes the foundation of my career development award (K08) as an academic pediatric retina
specialist with very high motivation and institutional support to develop an independent laboratory research
program in pediatric retinal disease. In pursuit of these aims, I will be mentored by renowned scientists at
Children's Hospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern California, as I gain the necessary skills in human
retinal organoid techniques, retinal and synaptic neuroscience, and live cell imaging to achieve independence
through R01 funding. Ultimately, my work will explore for the first time human retinal synaptic connectivity during
development and establish a research program focused on restoring these connections in the human disease
state."
10864036,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe, relapsing IgG-mediated autoimmune disease targeting the
central nervous system (CNS), inducing inflammation and preferential demyelination of optic nerve and
spinal cord. Most patients experience severe impairments. IgG autoantibodies specific for the astrocytic
aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel are the primary cause of the disease pathophysiology. However,
little is known about the mechanisms driving NMO lesion progression following the binding of IgG to the
astrocyte membrane on entering the CNS. Our proposed project will investigate the potential
contribution of microglia, the resident immune cell of the CNS, to the evolving NMO lesion. We have
developed an informative mouse model of NMO. NMO-IgG is infused intrathecally. Our preliminary
results show significant motor dysfunction, astrocyte activation, and a unique pattern of early microglial
convergence on astrocytes. Prevention of microglial activity suppressed development of motor
dysfunction. In sum, these data clearly indicate astrocyte-microglia communication as an early event
after NMO-IgG enters the CNS.
Aim 1, will investigate the mechanisms underlying astrocyte-microglia crosstalk; Aim 2, will assess the
contribution of microglia to NMO pathogenesis, and Aim 3 will utilize novel genetic tools to manipulate
microglial activity as a potential therapeutic approach to NMO management.
The research we propose represents the first attempt to investigate the specific contribution of microglia
to NMO pathogenesis. The results should clarify the importance of astrocyte-microglia crosstalk and its
underlying mechanisms in NMO. The study will not only improve understanding of neuroimmune
interaction in NMO but will potentially establish that microglia are a pertinent target for NMO therapy."

Cell migration is essential for many physiological processes including embryonic development, wound healing,
and immune responses. Cells achieve efficient directional migration through two major steps: front-and-back
polarization and re-arrangement of interactions between the cell and extracellular matrix (ECM). Cells adhere to
the ECM using actin-based multiprotein complexes called focal adhesions (FAs) with which the cells exert forces
to push or pull themselves to migrate, while long-term polarity is maintained by another cytoskeletal component,
microtubules (MTs). Therefore, efficient cell polarity and migration are achieved by coordinated regulation of
actin, MTs, and FAs. However, it remains unknown if there is a central regulator that orchestrates these
seemingly distinct subcellular organizations. Our lab has recently found that cells lacking α-tubulin
acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), the sole mediator of MT acetylation, display defects in FAs as well as in front-and-
back polarity. In addition, preliminary data also showed that cells with an αTAT1 knockout (KO) migrate faster
compared to control cells during random migration assays. We hypothesize that MT acetylation is a master
regulator of cell migration by dynamically remodeling molecular constituents and their activity at the F-actin and
MT cytoskeletons and FAs. To test this hypothesis, I will combine live-cell, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy
with pharmacological and genetic perturbations to elucidate how acetylated MT affects single and collective
migration (Aim 1), and to reveal molecular mechanisms regulating the front-and-back polarity (Aim 2) and FAs
dynamics (Aim 3) in a MT acetylation dependent manner.
In Aim 1, I will characterize the role of acetylated MTs in cell migration by performing single and collective
migration assays under different levels of MT acetylation and quantifying migration characteristics such as
velocity, directionality, and wound closure rate. Actin polymerization in the front defines the leading edge of a
migrating cell; this reaction is regulated by spatially restricted activities of Rho family GTPases. Therefore, to
investigate the role of acetylated MT in cell polarization (Aim 2), I will use time-lapse fluorescence microscopy
to measure the dynamics of MTs and F-actins and quantify the activity of Rho GTPases using FRET sensors. In
Aim 3, I will elucidate how MT acetylation modulates biophysical properties of FAs in migrating cells by
examining the expression level and localization of FA proteins and measuring FA dynamics using optogenetics
and live-cell fluorescence imaging. In addition, I will quantify the force exerted using traction force microscopy in
cells with three different conditions where the extent of MT acetylation is varied (normal, none, or elevated).
Together this proposal will illuminate a role of acetylated MTs as a regulator of directed cell migration by
concertedly regulating front-and-back polarity and FAs dynamics."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play essential roles in the central regulation
of energy and glucose homeostasis. BDNF signaling greatly influences many aspects of neuronal function,
including survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity and transmission. Deficits in BDNF function have been
linked to over feeding and severe obesity in humans and mice. Accordingly, we showed that mice with BDNF
depletion in the brain (BDNF2L/2LCk-cre) exhibit increased food intake, obesity, insulin resistance and
dyslipidemia. Diminished a2d-1 (Cacna2d1) function in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre
mice contributes to the metabolic alterations that they exhibit. In support, viral-mediated rescue of deficient
a2d-1 expression in the VMH of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice mitigated their hyperphagia and obesity. Importantly, it
dramatically improved hepatic lipid accumulation and normalized deficits in glycemic control even though
rescued mutants remained significantly heavier than wild type controls. Furthermore, a2d-1 knock down in the
adult VMH resulted in susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO). a2d-1 serves as a receptor for astrocyte-
derived thrombospondins (TSP) to mediate excitatory synapse assembly. Electrophysiological analysis
indicates that the metabolic effects of a2d-1 are related changes in the excitatory tone onto VMH neurons,
implicating thrombospondin signaling. This project will test the hypothesis that TSP/a2d-1 signaling in the
VMH facilitates synaptic remodeling during conditions of positive energy balance to increase the excitatory
drive onto neurons mediating energy, glucose and lipid homeostasis. Aim 1 will determine how gain or loss
of a2d-1 function in the adult VMH affects metabolic function and mechanisms activated by a2d-1 that prevent
hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance during obesogenic conditions. Aim 2 will examine the effects of gain
or loss of astrocytic TSP function in the adult VMH in the regulation of metabolic function and whether these
effects are a2d-1-dependent. Aim 3 will determine whether a2d-1 and TSP mediates the effects of caloric
status on the excitatory synaptic physiology and activity of VMH neurons. Finally, Aim 4 will map the
connectivity of VMH a2d-1+ neurons, examine their responses to caloric signals in vivo and the effects of
stimulating or inhibiting these cells on metabolic function. Findings from this project will inform novel
mechanisms facilitating metabolic health in individuals who are persistently overweight and new targets for
the treatment of metabolic dysfunction. Importantly, they have the potential to inform pathological
mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in individuals administered the anti-epileptic and anti-
nociceptive drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind and inhibit a2d-1."

The cascading effects of prelingual hearing loss and subsequent cochlear implantation on the development of
children’s psychosocial (emotional, behavioral, and social) adjustment are not fully understood. The specific
objective of this research project is to identify how stress appraisal and coping responses, supported by
neurocognitive (language and executive functioning) skills, predict psychosocial risk or resilience in prelingually
deaf, early-implanted cochlear implant (CI) users. We hypothesize that prelingual hearing loss exposes
children to a unique and multifaceted set of stressors, which taxes and depletes limited-capacity resources
such as language and executive functioning skills, leading to maladaptive stress appraisal and coping
responses, and individual differences in psychosocial adjustment. Two specific aims are proposed to
accomplish our research objective and provide novel theoretical and clinical contributions to the field of
cognitive hearing science: In Specific Aim 1, a cross-sectional design will be used to determine the relationship
between children’s hearing history (CI vs. NH) and individual level stress appraisal/coping responses and the
extent to which that relationship is mediated by neurocognitive (language and EF) skills. In Specific Aim 2, a
prospective longitudinal design will be used to predict variability in psychosocial outcomes in CI users by
identifying the extent to which stress appraisal/coping responses mediate the longitudinal relationship between
neurocognitive (language and EF) skills and psychosocial adjustment. This will be the first research project to
systematically examine the effects of pediatric hearing loss and neurocognitive (language and executive
functioning) skills on individual-level stress appraisal, coping responses, and downstream psychosocial
adjustment in pediatric CI users. Findings from the proposed project offer both theoretical and clinical
implications for the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of at-risk psychosocial outcomes in pediatric
CI users by providing a developmental understanding of how underlying mechanisms of risk and resilience are
associated with variability in psychosocial adjustment."
10824127,"Post-translational modifications of histones, including methylation, are critical for regulating gene expression and
maintaining homeostasis. In neurons, dysregulation of histone methylation is associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). SET Domain Containing 2, histone
lysine methyltransferase (SETD2) that methylates histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) and is the primary
methyltransferase for trimethylating H3K36 in human (H3K36me3). SETD2 is unique among histone
methyltransferase in that it directly binds RNA Pol ll and deposits H3K36me3 co-transcriptionally. H3K36me3
primarily involved in transcriptional regulation but can also regulate alternative splicing. Haploinsufficiency of
SETD2 is responsible for Sotos-like overgrowth syndrome, characterized by obesity, macrocephaly, intellectual
disability, autism, and epilepsy. SETD2 is also considered a “high confidence” ASD-risk gene in the SFARI gene
database (https://gene.sfari.org/). Little is known of the role of SETD2 in the brain. There is also little known of
the role of histone methylation, specifically H3K36me3, in postnatal developing brain. To address these gaps in
knowledge, I made a mouse with conditional deletion of Setd2 postnatally (~P8) in excitatory forebrain neurons
using the BAC-CaMKIIα Cre line. Acute slices of somatosensory neocortex from young, 3rd postnatal week,
Setd2 heterozygous mice (SetD2 cHet) have increased circuit excitability, as measured by the duration and
power of persistent activity, or UP, states. We find the same “long UP state” phenotype in the mouse model of
Fragile X Syndrome (Fmr1 KO), the most common monogenic cause of ASD. In both Setd2 cHet and Fmr1 KO
long duration UP states are rescued by a negative allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
(mGluR5), as well as protein synthesis inhibitors. This suggests hyperactivation of the mGluR5 signaling
pathway to protein synthesis with Setd2 deletion and a point of convergence of these two ASD-risk genes. Fmr1
encodes Fragile X mRNA ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein, that regulates translation of
mRNAs associated with ASD. I hypothesize that loss of SETD2 leads to altered expression of FMRP and/or
alternative splicing of genes that are also regulated by FMRP at the translation level. Specifically, I
hypothesize that these commonly regulated genes may encode components of protein synthesis
machinery, proteins that regulate synaptic, neuronal and circuit function and/or mGluR5, its interacting
partners or effectors. To test this hypothesis. in Aim 1 I will identify genes with altered H3K36me3 marks,
expression and splicing in Setd2 cHet cortex and determine their overlap with FMRP regulated mRNAs, or
pathways. In Aim 2, I will test candidate mGluR5-regulated, neuronal and synaptic mechanisms for circuit
hyperexcitability in Setd2 cHet mice. In Aim 3, I will determine if there are altered mGluR5 complexes and
signaling to protein synthesis in the Setd2 cHet. Results are expected to reveal novel and convergent
mechanisms by which Fmr1 and Setd2 regulate circuit function and aid in the understanding of autism etiology."

This is a proposal for the renewal of our Pediatric Injury Research Training Program. Our goal is to create and
sustain a corps of interdisciplinary-trained investigators who will conduct rigorous research on ways to reduce
the toll from injuries. Injuries are the most common cause of death and acquired disability during childhood and
adolescence, and addressing this key public health problem is part of the core mission of NICHD. This
application and our training program uniquely addresses pediatric injury (scientific focus) and includes
a health equity lens. This remains the only comprehensive pediatric injury research training program in
the nation that addresses injury and violence of all types.
The specific aims of this training program are to: (1) Recruit and train 2 outstanding post-doctoral fellows
annually for a two year program from a national applicant pool with attention to diversity in clinical and academic
backgrounds, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity and gender. (2) Provide trainees with a well-balanced
curriculum in injury control and theory along with methodologic skills in research and an introduction to
non-clinical disciplines important to interdisciplinary research. (3) Foster a learning environment with highly
engaged mentors who provide practical and relevant research experience and serve as role models for the
trainee as teachers, researchers, and clinicians, and can assist the fellow with placement beyond the trainee
program to support career development. There are 5 components to the training: (1) Formal didactic courses to
fill gaps in prior academic training to conduct research in injury control and to provide exposure to disciplines
relevant to injury research. These have been adjusted to better meet the needs of our fellows, and to include
education on health disparities and equity. (2). Attendance at fellowship-focused seminars including weekly small
group research seminars, a 12-week Biomedical Integrity in Research Seminar Series, formal training in scientific
writing, and formal training in grant writing. (3). Provide fellows with the opportunity to present their work at two
national meetings annually focused on a discipline in their primary research area, providing ability to network
with other injury researchers. (4). In depth research training in an active, on-going research program at one of
the training units with mentoring from an interdisciplinary group of faculty at the UW and its collaborating sites.
(5). Development and implementation of research projects in injury research, supervised by one or more of the
core faculty mentors, to achieve these goals: (1) To develop the research skills necessary to initiate a career as
an independent investigator in injury control research. (2) To become expert in a focused area of pediatric injury
control research and begin to develop a trajectory of research on which to build a successful career as an
extramurally funded investigator."

 The UAB STEP-UP Coordinating Center will select motivated, promising undergraduate students who
have completed at least their freshman year and provide them with the organizational, academic and research
skills and experience needed to be competitive for graduate and professional education. UAB STEP-UP will
collaborate with our current partner organizations including HBCUs across Alabama and Atlanta University
Center schools to engage and recruit traditionally underrepresented students. Elements of the program include
intensive mentored research experiences for 10 weeks during the two summers (30 hours/week) enhanced by
virtual group learning activities in research and career planning (10 hours/week), and followed by virtual
research education activities during the academic year following Years 1 and 2. This is followed by virtual
maintenance to maintain interest in NIDDK research and to keep Trainees connected to the program. During
this program, trainees will develop working relationships with academic researchers and will be involved with
the processes and products of cutting-edge research. Our team mentoring approach includes Academic
Mentors, along with Personal Advocates and Career Coaches to provide additional professional support to the
Trainees. Expanding the mentor network to include these components will promote a deeper and varied

Despite increasingly aggressive standard of care treatments, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a poor
prognosis that has remained unchanged for decades, and this represents a fundamental unmet medical need.
Progress in immunotherapy across a broad range of tumor types provides hope that immunological approaches,
including CAR T cell therapy, may improve outcomes for patients with GBM. This is supported by the ability of
CD19-targeted CAR T cells to eliminate B cell malignancies in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as
early clinical experiences showing safety and disease-modifying activity of CAR T cells in GBM. One major
challenge for GBM immunotherapies is the phenotypic heterogeneity of GBM tumors coupled with the scarcity
of targetable tumor-associated antigens. As an approach to address this challenge we have developed a novel
CAR that exploits the selective and broad GBM-binding properties of chlorotoxin (CLTX). CLTX is a 36-amino
acid peptide component of scorpion venom that binds specifically to GBM and other tumors with minimal cross-
reactivity to non-malignant cells. Previous early phase clinical trials have established safety of CLTX when used
as a GBM-targeting peptide for imaging and radiotherapy. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that CLTX-CAR
T cells mediate potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, with no observable effector activity against normal
human cells or when adoptively transferred into cross-reactive mouse models. We now aim, in this proposal, to
clinically test the hypothesis that CLTX-CAR T cells will be safe and mediate antitumor effects when
locoregionally delivered to the CNS in patients with GBM. Aim 1 will evaluate the feasibility, safety and response
rates of CLTX-CAR T cells in patients with recurrent GBM in a phase 1 clinical trial. CLTX-CAR T cells will be
delivered locoregionally via intratumoral [ICT] and intracerebroventricular [ICV] catheters. Aim 2 will assess
CAR-mediated immunological changes associated with response and resistance. Taking advantage of our
catheter-based locoregional delivery strategy that allows sampling of the CSF throughout treatment, we will
monitor surrogate markers of CAR T cell activity, including CAR T cell persistence and changes in inflammatory
cytokines and endogenous immune subsets. We will also compare the intrinsic characteristics across different
autologous CAR T cell products with clinical response. Aim 3 will investigate pathways of GBM tumor resistance
and CAR-induced tumor evolution pre- and post-therapy, investigating antigen escape pathways and adaptive
immunosuppressive mechanisms to CAR T treatment. The innovative use of scorpion-derived CLTX for tumor
targeting would be the first example of a natural peptide−based CAR in the clinic, potentially expanding CAR
designs beyond antibody- and ligand-based targeting domains. CLTX-CAR T cell targeting of a wide range of
GBM cells within individual tumors is significant in that it will expand our armamentarium and potentially help to
limit antigen escape and enhance tumor eradication, thereby improving outcomes for patients with GBM."

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among
women in the United States. With effective treatments and advancements in technology, the proportion of
women who survive breast cancer five years and beyond is increasing. Despite the continued progress in
survival, black women experience suboptimal five-year breast cancer specific survival, adverse cancer
treatment effects (pain and swelling from lymphedema), and quality of life (QOL). Most interventions targeting
physical activity (PA) have shown to improve QOL in predominantly white cancer survivors. There are critical
gaps in our understanding of PA and QOL among post treatment black women with a history of breast cancer.
First, there is not enough evidence to establish whether the effect of PA on QOL is smaller or larger in black
women compared to white women. Second, there are limited descriptions of QOL concerns and experiences in
relation to PA among black women. This study will address these issues in the following aims by: 1)
investigating the effect of PA on social wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and body image among post treatment
black and white breast cancer survivors with lymphedema in the Women In Steady Exercise Research
(WISER) Survivor Trial, 2) describing the QOL experiences and concerns in relation to PA among black
women with a history of breast cancer in Pennsylvania using semi structured interviews and a narrative
approach, and 3) assessing the association between PA, social, emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical
wellbeing among black women with a history of breast cancer without lymphedema in the Black Women’s
Health Study. The long term objective of this fellowship is to understand this association to increase the
potential for medical and health professionals to recommend the use and promote the importance of PA to
improve QOL among black women. Another long term objective of this fellowship is to increase awareness on
the factors that influence QOL and PA, individual perceptions and descriptions of QOL, and unique QOL
concerns and experiences to help improve QOL among black women breast cancer survivors who have worse
health outcomes. This fellowship will help to inform clinical practice, refine exercise programs, promote the
development of behavioral interventions, and advance scientific knowledge on QOL and PA among black
women."

Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are the major regulators of oxidative stress and
therefore the first line of defense to protect organisms against metabolic- and
environmentally-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human mitochondrial
manganese SOD (MnSOD) expression is modulated to prevent ROS-based damage,
promote redox homeostasis, and maintain proper cell signaling. Our research goal is to
understand the molecular basis of how MnSOD uses coupled proton-electron transfers
to dismute superoxide. For this, the 3D arrangement of all atoms is needed, most
importantly the position of protons. Our recent technical advancements with neutron
crystallography at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have overcome the limitations of X-
ray crystallography – revealing proton positions with high detail while also allowing
control of the metal electronic state. In this research project, MnSOD neutron maps will
reveal the proton relays to the active site metal and the protonation states of metal-
bound ligands. The scientific hypothesis for this study is that MnSOD transfers protons
from a small group of water molecules via partially solvent-exposed amino acids to the
nearly completely buried manganese for the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen
peroxide and molecular oxygen via cyclic metal redox reactions. The specific aims are
to characterize the electron-coupled proton relays of MnSOD by investigating the proton
environment of (1) the resting states of the reduced and oxidized manganese active

enzyme. Spectroscopy on crystals will be performed to help design/understand
crystallographic experiments, and computational chemistry studies on neutron derived

interest to those in the fields of structural biology, antioxidants, and metallo-enzymology
and of interest to biologists in general."
10823892,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein biologics constitute an important class of therapeutics owing to their high specificity, bioactivity and
potential for tunability. Cytokine (CK) proteins applied as biotherapeutics show great promise for several disease
indications, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis C infection. However, major barriers preventing
the advancement and widespread clinical use of CKs to address critical public health needs include: (I)
tendencies to cause systemic immune activation as a result of their on-target, off-tumor effects (ii) rapid
proteolytic degradation and clearance by the kidneys as small proteins (<20 KDa) with short half-lives in
circulation and (iii) frequent and high dosing leading to undesirable “peak-and-valley” pharmacokinetic (PK)
profile which result in (iv) reduced therapeutic efficacy, dose-limiting toxicities and reduce patient compliance.
New strategies are urgently needed for simultaneously targeting tumor antigens to build specificity and
localization while also tuning half-life. A multi-functionalized CK with tunable properties could lead to the next
generation of clinical biologics. Existing approaches to extend half-life such as the attachment of polyethylene
glycol moieties (PEG), tend to elicit undesired immunogenicity and new tools are required solve this defining
challenge. Pearl Bio’s proprietary synthetic biology platform technology is built on three core technologies:
Genomically Recoded Organisms (GROs), engineered orthogonal translation systems (OTS), and tethered
ribosomes for production of novel proteins incorporating synthetic amino acids (sAAs) including novel sAAs
previously inaccessible for precise functionalization. In proposed studies, we will leverage this platform to
demonstrate the tunability of CK half-life as well as tumor-targeting through precise and multi-site incorporation
and functionalization of sAAs with fatty acid groups. Specifically, we will (1) Demonstrate multisite incorporation
of sAAs into IL-15, (2a) Perform efficient lipidation and purification of synthetic IL-15 biologics with fatty acid for
tuning half-life, (2b) Enable tumor-targeting functionalization using engineered antibody/nanobody (multiple
instances if desired) and (3) Measure immunogenicity, bioactivity and albumin/tumor-antigen binding of these
IL-15 variants in vitro. In summary, during Phase 1 we will develop multi-site fatty acid functionalization of
cytokines and perform in vitro testing for bioactivity and immunogenicity. In Phase 2 studies, albumin and tumor
targeting capabilities would be combined to create a multi-functionalized CK with tunable half-life and tumor
specificity. Phase 2 in vivo studies will be used to test half-life tuning, tumor homing and efficacy of the multi-
functionalized CKs for further therapeutic development. We envision that this project could establish the basis
for entirely novel and programmable protein biologics with utility across a broad range of disease indications."
10827524,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Research: Periodontitis (gum disease) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases worldwide,
affecting nearly 50% of adults (65 million people) in the US alone. Untreated, it can destroy the tissues that
support the teeth, eventually resulting in tooth loss. The cause of periodontitis is linked to the outgrowth of
multiple, rather than individual, pathogens in the oral microbiota. For instance, co-detection of Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) with Filifactor alocis is a much greater predictor of future tissue destruction than
detection of Aa alone. However, how Aa and F. alocis interact to elicit pathology while evading host immunity
remains poorly understood. Microbiota-host interactions are often mediated by microbial metabolites, and a
major metabolite of F. alocis is hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas highly enriched in periodontitis. Based on my
preliminary data, I hypothesize that F. alocis-derived sulfide triggers an immunological cascade that drives tissue
destruction while constructing a niche for Aa to proliferate via sulfide-resistant anaerobic respiration. Of note,
inexpensive, non-toxic drugs already exist that selectively inhibit anaerobic respiration (tungstate) or sequester
sulfide (bismuth). To test my hypothesis and the therapeutic value of these drugs, I will dissect how F. alocis-
derived sulfide impacts Aa (Aim 1) and the oral immune system (Aim 2) in complementary mouse models: thigh
abscess, which allows for precise control over composition of the infecting community, and ligature-induced
periodontitis, which allows for the assessment of oral immune responses. Through these Aims, I will potentially
establish innovative therapies targeted against microbiota-host interactions that promote periodontal disease.
 Career Goals: My overarching goal as an independent investigator is to integrate the fields of oral
microbiology and immunology as a strategy to gain novel insight into the etiology of periodontitis. To achieve this
goal, I require additional training and knowledge in oral immunology as well as professional development in skills
essential for leading a successful laboratory. Career Development Plan and Environment: My mentor Y.
Belkaid, a renowned expert in microbiota-host interactions, is an investigator in the NIH Intramural Research
Program, one of the largest research centers in the world. In this unique environment, I will directly benefit from
the numerous resources in place to support my research project and career development, including microbiome
and immunology core facilities, frequent seminars and opportunities to engage colleagues/mentors, and regular
workshops on grant-writing, mentoring, and laboratory management. Furthermore, I have assembled a
mentoring team who will complement my expertise in Aa and the abscess model by closely overseeing my
training in the ligature model (NIDCR-based co-mentor N. Moutsopoulos) and F. alocis (collaborators R. Lamont
and H. Fletcher) as well as my transition to independence. By the end of my training plan, I will be well-positioned
to launch a productive independent career at the intersection of oral microbiology and immunology."

 State Manufactured Food Regulatory Programs
Project Summary/Abstract
The mission of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Food and Drug Branch (FDB)
food safety program is to ensure the safety of the food supply through effective prevention,
intervention, and response programs. As a means of accomplishing this mission, FDB has
developed strong regulatory inspection, compliance, and enforcement programs, and industry
education, outreach, and training programs.
The primary objective of our proposal is to continue maintenance of California’s best practices for
a high-quality regulatory program to enhance food safety. This entails continued interagency
collaboration, cooperation, and communication; maintenance and sustainment of conformance
with the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS); and continued
strengthening of partnerships, coordination, and interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and other states’ food safety programs.
Under this proposal, we are requesting $1,350,000 in grant funds for each of the next three years
(per year: $350,000 supporting MFRPS maintenance, and $100,000 supporting dietary
supplement program development). Authorized grant funds will be used to improve and augment
current food safety program capabilities and maintain the necessary infrastructure to continue
sustainment of MFRPS.
Under MFRPS, one dedicated staff member will work as the MFRPS coordinator to maintain the
FDB food safety program’s ability to conduct high-quality inspections and investigations to reduce
the incidence of food contamination and ultimately foodborne illness associated with products
manufactured and distributed within California. Additionally, resources will be dedicated to the
development of a high-quality dietary supplement regulatory program designed to ensure that
manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from
marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded.
Grant monies will enable the FDB food safety program to improve, augment, and continue its food
regulatory program through training and development of staff to increase skills and expertise;
maintain efficiency and effectiveness of critical resources; maintain information sharing among
federal, state, and local agencies; maintain succession planning; and sustain full conformance
with MFRPS and development of a comprehensive dietary supplement program. California is the
nation’s top agricultural producing state. California’s activities are essential to the success of a
nationally integrated food safety system."
10824649,"ABSTRACT:
Infertility impacts 48 million couples worldwide and 50% of cases are due to a male factor. Non-obstructive
azoospermia (NOA) is the absence of sperm due to spermatogenic failure. Some cases are due to known
conditions (Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Y chromosome microdeletions, and hypogonadism) but many cases are
idiopathic (unexplained). Recent identification of novel monogenic causes of NOA sparks the possibility of gene
therapy as a potential treatment option. There are ethical, legal and societal concerns about gene therapy
approaches that would modify the germline and potentially be passed to progeny. Therefore, development of
gene therapy approaches for male infertility should consider the risk of germline modification and transmission.
Sertoli cells are the only testicular somatic cells that are inside the seminiferous tubules and in direct contact
with the germ cells and Sertoli cell mutations can lead to NOA in both mice and humans. I will test the feasibility
and safety of in vivo Sertoli cell gene therapy in mouse models of human NOA. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)
is an optimal vector for Sertoli cell gene therapy because there are many AAV serotypes with cell type specificity
of infection, it can have long lasting expression, it has low toxicity in the testis, and does not typically integrate
into the genome. AAV has been used to introduce a corrective Kitl gene into Sertoli cells of Kitl-/- mice that have
an NOA phenotype, restoring spermatogenesis. In humans, mutations in the KITL gene do not cause infertility.
Under separate funding, our group has been performing whole genome or whole exome sequencing to identify
genetic variants in men with NOA. I have screened those data to identify NOA-associated variants in MAP7 and
CLCN2 that are expressed by Sertoli cells and cause NOA when knocked out in mice. I will use CRISPR/Cas9
gene editing to introduce the patient variants into the orthologous regions of the mouse genome to create new
mouse models of human NOA. I will use these models to test the hypothesis that, fertility can be safely restored
by AAV-mediated Sertoli cell gene therapy and that this can be accomplished without germline modification or
transmission to progeny. To facilitate the translation of this technology toward the human clinic, I will utilize a
novel human testis organ culture technique to identify AAV serotypes that exhibit Sertoli cell specific infection in
human testicular tissue. Completion of my project will demonstrate the safety and feasibility of Sertoli cell gene
therapy using AAV vectors. I will uncover new knowledge into genetic causes of Sertoli cell dysfunction and
propose a technique that can test other aspects of AAV use in human tissue. Overall, the completion of this grant
will greatly increase my technical research skills in gene therapy and male infertility in a bench to bedside
research pipeline. This will provide a strong foundation of knowledge and skills to prepare me for a career as a
faculty and independent researcher in academia."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent neoplastic disease of the pancreas, and it is
expected to become the second leading cause of cancer related death over the next decade. PDAC has an
abysmal prognosis, with only 10% of patients surviving more than 5 years from diagnosis. Interestingly, over
90% of PDACs harbor activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene and the most common KRAS mutations
seen in PDAC are G12D, G12V, or G12R. G12D and G12V mutations are commonly found in lung and colon
cancers, however G12R mutations are largely restricted to PDAC. 15-20% of PDACs carry G12R mutations,
but the majority of preclinical animal models focus on the KrasG12D mutation, which reflects less than half of the
KRAS mutations seen in human PDAC. The preliminary data shown in this work and the overall proposal
aim to determine if KrasG12R may be functionally distinct from other KRAS driver mutations and how
this affects disease initiation and progression. As previously described by us, unlike KrasG12D, KrasG12R
mutations do not drive progression to pre-neoplastic PanIN lesions from acinar cells, instead they remain
stalled during acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and addition of a mutant p53 allele to does not accelerate
disease formation in mice. However, we have found that under two specific contexts; KrasG12R / p53MUT ductal-
derived organoids transplanted into mice and mice with a p53 mutant allele and loss of the other p53 allele
oncogenic transformation happens and results in PDAC formation. We and others have also described
decreased PI3K/AKT signaling, in KrasG12R when compared to KrasG12D.This proposed work will test the
hypothesis that cell lineage and/or cooperating genetic events in the PI3K pathway impact the
oncogenic potential of KrasG12R mutations in pancreas cancer. My proposal represents a significant
contribution to understanding the molecular underpinnings of disease initiation and progression of
KrasG12R. In the proposed studies we aim to determine if how cell-of-origin impacts disease initiation and
progression and how the immediate and sustained molecular events following KrasG12R activation affects
initiation and progression. We also aim to elucidate the role of PI3K mutations affect disease initiation and
progression in both in vitro and in vivo. To address these questions, we will use lineage tracing mouse models
that conditionally mark cells and induce mutant KrasG12R and p53 mutations in the pancreas. In addition, we will
use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technologies to make complementary organoid and in vivo models of
PIK3CA mutations and PTEN deletions that will help elucidate the role of PI3K in KrasG12R PDACs. We plan to
use different histological and molecular techniques to dissect the molecular underpinnings of KrasG12R driven
PDAC. We anticipate that a better understanding of KrasG12R and related cellular and molecular processes will
further elaborate on the KRAS heterogeneity found in PDAC, as well as provide avenues for the development
of targeted therapeutics in patient populations with varying KRAS mutations."

Development are a paired set of biennial meetings that bring together investigators studying development,
disease and evolution of the visual system. Over the years, these meetings have provided an exciting and
unique forum in which to explore the similarities and differences underlying visual system development and
function across a broad range of species. The goal of these meetings is to foster an appreciation of common
principles that mediate the construction and function of the visual system in diverse organisms, and to share the
latest exciting new ideas and findings on this topic. By including sessions that highlight emerging topics with
translational impact, such as “Retinal regeneration and repair”, “Development and dysfunction of the primate
retina” and “Retinal disease and aging”, the meeting will also expand its scope and stimulate cross-talk between
developmental biologists and investigators focused on translational aspects of vision science. The GRS
provides a unique platform for students and postdoctoral research fellows in the visual research field to share
current, unpublished research amongst their peers.
The format of the GRC and GRS meetings provides a highly interactive and stimulating venue for cross-

Aging is associated with age-related impairments in cognitive function and is the number one risk factor for a
series of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. However, aging is not isolated to the brain,
but is instead a system wide process affecting multiple tissues and organ systems. A growing body of work has
demonstrated that exposure to an aged circulatory system, which connects all organ systems that face age-
related decline, drives hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments during aging. Interestingly, there are
known age-related changes in the peripheral immune system, which constitutes an integral portion of the aging
circulatory system. T cells, a component of the adaptive immune system, are one of the immune cells most
detrimentally affected by age. In addition to a decrease in the ability to respond to infections and increases in
inflammatory cytokine secretion in the periphery, there is an emerging role posited for T cells in age-related brain
dysfunction. While studies have identified an increase in T cell infiltration into select areas of the aged brain, the
effect of age-related changes in circulating T cells on hippocampal-dependent cognitive function has not fully
been explored. Therefore, I sought to delineate the role of peripheral, aged CD8+ T cells in driving age-related
cognitive decline. Using single cell RNA sequencing, I identified age-associated CD8+ T cells, marked by
elevated expression of Granzyme K (GZMK), in spleens of cognitively impaired aged mice and young mice
exposed to an old circulatory system via heterochronic parabiosis. Interestingly, levels of secreted GZMK are
increased in the plasma of aged mice. Functionally, adoptive transfer of aged CD8+ T cells into young mice
resulted in cognitive deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, underlain by synaptic and
neuronal changes. To explore the rejuvenating potential of targeting aged CD8+ T cells, I selectively depleted
circulating CD8+ T cells in aged mice and observed amelioration of age-related impairments in learning and
memory. Interestingly, bulk RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes enriched in neurons and
endothelial cells. Consequently, this study aims to test the hypothesis that peripheral, age-associated CD8+ T
cells are drivers of cognitive impairments in the aging hippocampus. In Aim 1, I will determine the molecular and
cellular changes elicited by aged CD8+ T cells in the aged hippocampus. As depletion of circulating CD8+ T cells
is sufficient to ameliorate cognitive decline, in Aim 2, I will investigate the role of CD8+ T cell-derived factors in
promoting hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, focusing on the pro-aging effects of GZMK. This study
aims to identify molecular mechanism by which circulating aged CD8+ T cells drive cognitive impairments with
age and identify potential therapeutic targets to counter aging-associated cognitive decline and dementia-related
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s Disease."
10916292,"ABSTRACT
The audiogram is the cornerstone of clinical hearing assessment, but individual differences in speech perception,
especially in noisy environments, cannot be explained by audibility alone. People with normal hearing thresholds
often complain of difficulty understanding speech-in-noise, and listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)
show significant variability in speech perception, even when audibility is restored. Animal models of SNHL and
temporal bone histology suggest that peripheral pathology missed by the audiogram may explain some of this
variance. Outer hair cell (OHC) dysfunction elevates hearing thresholds, but inner hair cell (IHC) and auditory
nerve (AN) dysfunction may be hidden from the audiogram despite their impact on neural encoding of sound.
The presence of specific cochlear pathologies and their relative contribution to perception, however, cannot be
directly tested in humans. Instead, non-invasive biomarkers of pathology are used. Though diagnostics have
been developed for identifying hidden pathologies in people with normal hearing, an individual metric is unlikely
to be enough when SNHL results from a combination of peripheral dysfunctions. To address this gap, we use a
battery of non-invasive diagnostic tools to determine a biomarker profile for individual subjects and assess its
relationship to cochlear anatomy and speech-in-noise perception when there are varying degrees of OHC and
non-OHC dysfunctions. This proposal tests our central hypothesis that identifying subtypes of SNHL from
integration of biomarkers sensitive to both OHC and non-OHC pathologies significantly improves prediction of
suprathreshold hearing over the audiogram alone. Using a cross-species approach, three synergistic specific
aims test our hypothesis. First, we assess the differences in biomarker profiles of two chinchilla models of distinct
SNHL subtypes, OHC-only hearing loss and complex SNHL (e.g., a combination of OHC, IHC, and AN
dysfunction), to measure the effect of non-OHC pathologies when they co-occur with OHC dysfunction. Second,
we measure physiological biomarker profiles in humans with SNHL and test whether they better predict speech
understanding than the audiogram. Third, using our coordinated physiological test battery as a link between
species, we make predictions about the underlying cochlear pathology distributions in humans with complex
SNHL based on our histology from chinchillas with known exposures. Whether our hypotheses are supported or
refuted, this cross-species dataset will advance our understanding of the factors important for everyday
communication and establish a quantitative framework for developing more detailed diagnostic profiles. Greater
diagnostic precision that recognizes the multifactorial physiological underpinnings of SNHL will support
personalization of hearing healthcare and treatment, especially pharmaceutical interventions for hearing loss.
Additionally, the quantitative, cross-species, and professional training received through completion of these aims
complements my clinical training in audiology and will be foundational to my career as a translational auditory
neuroscientist."
10980499,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disease that constitutes a major health problem for Veterans.
Stress is known to be an important contributing factor to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, and this is especially
relevant to Veterans given their high prevalence of co-occurring AUD and stress-related illnesses such as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite the significance of this problem, the complex interaction between
stress and alcohol (ethanol) drinking is not fully understood. The use of animal models is critical for advancing
our understanding of underlying mechanisms and providing platforms for evaluating potential new and novel
treatment interventions for Veterans battling PTSD-AUD comorbidity. Recent work involving our established
mouse model of ethanol dependence that involves repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)
exposure led to the discovery that reduced BDNF activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is
a significant neuroadaptation associated with excessive drinking. During the current funding period, we extended
this work to show that stress facilitates and enhances this dependence-related escalation of ethanol
consumption. That is, forced swim stress (FSS) selectively enhances escalated drinking in dependent (CIE-
exposed) mice while not altering more moderate ethanol intake in nondependent mice. Additionally, stress in
combination with chronic ethanol exposure was shown to magnify deficits in BDNF expression in the prefrontal
cortex. Further, we demonstrated that direct infusion of BDNF or viral-mediated overexpression of BDNF in the
dmPFC blocked dependence (CIE)-related escalated drinking. Collectively, these data support the general tenet
that reduced BDNF activity in the dmPFC plays a significant role in the ability of stress (FSS) to enhance
escalated drinking associated with dependence. As exercise is known to elevate BDNF activity in brain, we
conducted pilot studies that have demonstrated exercise attenuates dependence-related escalated ethanol
drinking, as well as attenuating the ability of stress to further enhance excessive levels of drinking associated
with dependence. With this supportive pilot data, the proposed research plan will build and expand on this work
by examining the role of BDNF in the ability of exercise to attenuate stress-enhanced drinking in dependent
mice. Specifically, this research project is aimed at utilizing our established stress-ethanol dependence (Stress-
CIE) Drinking model to examine whether exercise attenuates stress-enhanced dependence-related excessive
drinking via BDNF-TrkB receptor signaling in the dmPFC. Proposed studies will examine whether exercise
(wheel-running) blocks stress (FSS)-enhanced escalated drinking in CIE-exposed mice, as well as attenuating
reduced BDNF expression in dmPFC that accompanies excessive drinking in the Stress-CIE Drinking model
(Aim I). Another set of studies will examine whether direct injection of the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12 into
the dmPFC blocks the ability of wheel-running to attenuate stress (FSS)-enhanced CIE-induced escalated
drinking and whether TrkB receptor knockdown in the dmPFC via siRNA infusion produces a similar effect (Aim
II). Finally, studies will examine whether systemic treatment with the flavone derivative and TrkB receptor
agonist 7,8-DHF substitutes for exercise in attenuating stress-enhanced CIE-related drinking, and/or whether
treatment with 7,8-DHF in the absence of exercise mimics the effects of exercise in the Stress-CIE Drinking
model. Additionally, studies will examine whether these exercise-like behavioral effects are due to activation
(phosphorylation) of TrkB receptors (pTrkB) and downstream signaling molecules (pERK1/2 and pAKT) in the
dmPFC (Aim III). Taken together, this proposal addresses a highly significant and clinically important research
topic that is of great relevance to Veteran’s heath care. Results from this research project will generate new
findings on mechanisms underlying a potential novel therapeutic approach that addresses a clinically relevant
health problem - the exacerbating effects of stress that lead to harmful excessive drinking associated with
alcoholism and PTSD-AUD comorbidity - an especially significant problem for our Veterans."
10928147,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Language impairment, known as aphasia, is very common after stroke and the extent to which patients
recover and respond to language therapy varies greatly. Functional MRI, including resting-state functional
connectivity, is a widely used tool to study reorganization in the brain after an acquired brain injury such as
stroke. Specifically, resting-state functional connectivity measurements can provide important information on
the connectivity and organization of functional networks in the brain and changes in that connectivity over time
(i.e., functional network plasticity). This project will make use of both static and dynamic resting-state functional
connectivity to identify relationships between the short-term (seconds to minutes) temporal dynamics of
functional network connectivity and long-term (months) functional network plasticity in people with post-stroke
aphasia. We have previously shown that baseline measures of both static functional connectivity and variability
in dynamic functional network connectivity are predictive of treatment response in people with post-stroke
aphasia. However, it is not known whether this association is mediated by differences in functional network
plasticity. For the studies proposed in this application, we will test the following hypotheses in three aims: (1)
that patients with post-stroke aphasia have altered dynamic functional connectivity compared to healthy
controls characterized by decreased temporal variability and (2) that higher baseline temporal variability of
dynamic functional connectivity (i.e., more like that of healthy controls) is related to greater treatment-induced
changes in functional network topology. For the first aim, dynamic functional connectivity will be computed from
resting state functional MRI data for 40 individuals with post-stroke aphasia and 40 healthy controls, currently
being collected as part of a larger ongoing study. Temporal variability will then be compared between the two
groups. For the second aim, the temporal variability of dynamic functional network connectivity computed from
existing resting-state functional MRI data from 30 individuals with post-stroke aphasia will be related to
changes in graph theory measures of static functional connectivity from pre- to post-treatment. For the third
aim computational modeling will be used to test the following proposed mechanism: (1) Transient
synchronization between brain regions facilitates activity dependent plasticity and (2) greater diversity of
transient connectivity configurations provides a wider range of opportunities for this facilitation of plasticity
resulting in greater treatment-induced reorganization of functional networks. The results will yield insights into
the factors and mechanisms underlying variation in language recovery after stroke and may inform the
development of new or improved tools for prognostication in these patients. These studies will be carried out in
the Center for Brain Recovery at Boston University as a part of pre-doctoral training towards a physician-
scientist career. As part of the fellowship training, emphasis is placed on hypothesis-driven experimental
design, integration of basic research with clinical practice, scientific communication, and mentoring."
10859782,"Summary
Mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), underlie a wide range of
neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder.
Despite numerous studies, why the loss of MeCP2 function results in RTT remains largely obscure, and it
represents a major challenge from both basic biological and therapeutic standpoints. Our previous studies,
based on mouse models, advanced the knowledge of the disease and the specific cell types involved in RTT
neuropathology. We showed that mutant glia, specifically astrocytes, are an integral part of RTT and that
healthy astrocytes can rescue many aspects of the disease. However, mouse models do not faithfully
represent human RTT, which is known to be more severe than in mouse models. Importantly, human
astrocytes are significantly different from mouse astrocytes in their structure, gene expression landscape,
mitochondrial physiology, energy metabolism, and susceptibility to oxidative stress and hypoxia. For this
reason, we have recently established human stem cell-based models for RTT to investigate the cellular and
molecular features of human astrocytes bearing RTT-causing mutations in MECP2. Our studies revealed
significant aberrations in mutant human astrocytes, including aberrant gene expression landscape, impaired
structural complexity, and impaired metabolic homeostasis. Importantly, we showed significant aberrations in
mitochondrial morphology and function in mutant astrocytes, suggesting that dysfunctional mitochondria likely
lie at the heart of the impaired metabolic homeostasis in mutant astrocytes. Furthermore, our preliminary data
show the presence of senescence markers in mutant astrocytes, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction
likely leads to cellular senescence in mutant astrocytes. Thus, we propose to build on our recent findings and
identify the common aberrations in gene expression in human astrocytes bearing different MECP2 mutations
with a focus on genes involved in mitochondrial function (Aim 1), investigate whether mitochondrial dysfunction
is a common and specific feature of mutant human astrocytes bearing different MECP2 mutations and whether
mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a specific type of cellular senescence in all mutant astrocytes (Aim 2).
Importantly, we will examine whether rescuing mitochondrial dysfunction and/or cellular senescence could
ameliorate the structural and functional abnormalities we identified in mutant astrocytes and thereby their
ability to properly support neurons (Aim 3).
 Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie mitochondrial dysfunction and its downstream
effects on MECP2 mutant human astrocytes, and whether rescuing mitochondrial dysfunction and/or
senescence could ameliorate the structural and functional aberrations of mutant astrocytes and consequently
restore their support to neurons, is highly important for developing therapeutic strategies for RTT."
10863916,"The opioid epidemic in the US is a public health emergency, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Medi- cations for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-injection naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone-are the most effective tools for improving outcomes and preventing overdose among persons with OUD, but engagement in MOUD, especially long-term engagement typically required for a successful outcome, is unacceptably low. Long-term engagement rates tend to be even lower in real-world settings-what NIDA has termed the research-to-practice gap. This discrepancy between trial and real-world MOUD effectiveness could be par- tially attributable to differences between clinical trial versus real-world population characteristics (e.g., in terms of psychiatric and substance use comorbidities, previous treatment experience, immigration status, etc.) if treatment effects are modified (increased/decreased) by some of these characteristics that also relate to trial participation. Moreover, without knowing the relative effectiveness of MOUDs for certain real-world target pop- ulations, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers may be tasked with decision-making with biased evidence. Thus, there is a critical need to improve the generalizability of MOUD trials. Failing to meet this need would further ossify the research-to-practice gap, resulting in suboptimal treatment of OUD overall and within key subgroups. We propose to develop design and analytic approaches, what we call a generalizability through- line, to bridge MOUD trial evidence to real-world populations. The objectives of this project are: In Aim 1), to identify and characterize clinically meaningful, interpretable subgroups of persons seeking OUD treatment in US usual-care settings who are not represented or under-represented in MOUD trials based on multiple char- acteristics simultaneously. This will move us beyond existing approaches for assessing representation that have generally been limited to considering one individual-level characteristic at a time (e.g., race/ethnicity). We will apply the approach developed in the first part of Aim 1 to trial data (3 MOUD trials from NIDA CTN) and population data (California and New Jersey Medicaid claims) to characterize under-represented subgroups. In Aim 2), to generalize MOUD effectiveness to state-specific adult Medicaid populations, thereby estimating a realistic treatment goal if treatment retention supports, incentives, and dosing practices were improved to align with those in trials. Existing approaches for predicting generalized effects rely on extrapolation for non- and under-represented subgroups, which can result in biased and/or uninformative estimates. The approach developed in the first part of Aim 2 will make several improvements to limit extrapolation and increase effi- ciency. In Aim 3), to implement the methods developed for Aims 1 and 2 in user-friendly software to facilitate the easy adoption by applied trialists, researchers, and clinicians. The proposed research is expected to make a significant contribution to improving representation among trial participants and to understanding how and to whom trial findings generalize."
10863917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas are
destroyed. T1D affects 3 million children and adults in the US with healthcare costs exceeding $15 billion.
Standard therapy with exogenous insulin is burdensome, associated with a significant danger of hypoglycemia,
and only partially efficacious in preventing long-term complications. Transplantation of allogeneic islets from
cadaveric donors in conjunction with chronic immunosuppression has been recently shown to be effective in
restoring euglycemia in clinical trials. However, the long-term future of cell replacement therapy for T1D requires
a reliable and replenishable β-cell source and elimination of the need for chronic immunosuppression. β-cells
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (SC-β cells) represent a transformative, unlimited source of insulin-
producing cells for the treatment of T1D. Despite advances in engineering functional insulin-producing SC-β
cells, significant barriers related to long-term engraftment and function without chronic immunosuppression
hinder the clinical translation of these promising cells. Furthermore, the use of encapsulation devices to protect
transplanted cells has not been successful in large animal models due to fibrotic responses and lack of direct
vascularization. Our objective is to engineer advanced biomaterial delivery technologies to (i) enhance
vascularization, survival, and engraftment of SC-β cells and (ii) protect them from rejection by the immune system
without the need for encapsulation or chronic immunosuppression. We hypothesize that synthetic hydrogels with
controlled presentation of vasculogenic and immunomodulatory signals will provide an injectable delivery vehicle
that directs SC-β cell survival, engraftment, and function without chronic immunosuppression or encapsulation.
Aim 1: Engineer injectable VEGF-delivering hydrogels to promote vascularization, survival, and function of SC-
β cells transplanted in the subcutaneous space of diabetic, immunocompromised mice. Aim 2: Evaluate our SA-
FasL-microgel technology to promote SC-β cell immune acceptance and function in diabetic, immunocompetent
humanized mice without chronic immunosuppression. Aim 3: Examine the ability of VEGF/SA-FasL
hydrogels to enhance SC-β cell survival and function in diabetic nonhuman primates with no or reduced chronic
immunosuppression in a pilot study. This highly significant and innovative strategy is fundamentally different
from ongoing work in the field in terms of engineering advanced injectable biomaterials that promote SC-β cell
vascularization, local immune acceptance, survival, and function without encapsulation in devices or systemic
immunosuppression. Furthermore, the focus on humanized murine and nonhuman primate models will
accelerate the development of an effective and broadly applicable cure for T1D."
10931151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas are
destroyed. T1D affects 3 million children and adults in the US with healthcare costs exceeding $15 billion.
Standard therapy with exogenous insulin is burdensome, associated with a significant danger of hypoglycemia,
and only partially efficacious in preventing long-term complications. Transplantation of allogeneic islets from
cadaveric donors in conjunction with chronic immunosuppression has been recently shown to be effective in
restoring euglycemia in clinical trials. However, the long-term future of cell replacement therapy for T1D requires
a reliable and replenishable β-cell source and elimination of the need for chronic immunosuppression. β-cells
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (SC-β cells) represent a transformative, unlimited source of insulin-
producing cells for the treatment of T1D. Despite advances in engineering functional insulin-producing SC-β
cells, significant barriers related to long-term engraftment and function without chronic immunosuppression
hinder the clinical translation of these promising cells. Furthermore, the use of encapsulation devices to protect
transplanted cells has not been successful in large animal models due to fibrotic responses and lack of direct
vascularization. Our objective is to engineer advanced biomaterial delivery technologies to (i) enhance
vascularization, survival, and engraftment of SC-β cells and (ii) protect them from rejection by the immune system
without the need for encapsulation or chronic immunosuppression. We hypothesize that synthetic hydrogels with
controlled presentation of vasculogenic and immunomodulatory signals will provide an injectable delivery vehicle
that directs SC-β cell survival, engraftment, and function without chronic immunosuppression or encapsulation.

We propose a new interdisciplinary skin biology training program at the University of California,
Irvine. The Program builds on a strong group of skin biology mentors affiliated with a NIAMS-funded
Skin Biology and Disease Research Core Center (UCI Skin). The goal is to develop skin biologists
that will be highly skilled in integrating bioengineering, including imaging, and computation into their
research to make discoveries in skin biology. The four trainees will be a mixture of graduate
students (three slots), including MD-PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows (one slot), including
dermatology residents pursuing postgraduate research training. The mentors include several
investigators whose work focuses on skin biology and collaborating investigators from other scientific
disciplines. Each trainee–irrespective of whether the primary mentor is a skin biologist or from an
allied field–will pursue an interdisciplinary project at the intersection of skin biology and one of two
cross-disciplines: systems biology or bioengineering/imaging. In their research activities, the
trainees will be guided through dual mentoring by a skin biologist and a mentor from a
complementary field. In addition to laboratory-based research training, the program includes lectures
in skin biology and skin diseases, a weekly Skin Club for data presentations, seminar series, retreats
and a yearly symposium. The program also offers a menu of career development activities that can
be individually tailored to each trainee based on their interests and career goals."
10839459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
If detected early, many cancers can be successfully treated, leading to a high rate of survival. Unfortunately,
cancer is often detected only at late stages since current screening technologies have insufﬁcient sensitiv-
ity and speciﬁcity at low tumor fractions. Further, screening itself is often invasive or even harmful, leading
health policy experts to recommend delaying or avoiding screening since the disadvantages may outweigh the
beneﬁt. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing presents an exciting recent possibility for highly accurate, non-
invasive cancer screening. When cells die, they often release small fragments of their DNA into the body,
and these cell-free DNA fragments temporarily circulate in the bloodstream. Thus, when cancer is present,
plasma obtained from routine blood draws contains DNA fragments from cancer cells. By performing genome
sequencing on this plasma cfDNA, it is possible to non-invasively detect and analyze cancers. However, ad-
vanced statistical methods are needed to extract the signal from the noise. The fraction of tumor-derived
cfDNA fragments is very small, on the order of 1/1000 or less for early stage cancers. The main objective
of the proposed project is to develop and test a ﬂexible suite of statistical methods for cancer detection and
analysis using cfDNA sequencing data at low tumor fractions. Our central hypothesis is that structured prob-
abilistic models of genomic signals of cancer in cfDNA data, along with careful handling of errors and biases,
will enable cancer detection and classiﬁcation with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. (Aim 1) Develop robust non-
parametric Poisson regression framework, applied to mutational signatures. The mutational processes that
lead to cancer exhibit characteristic genome-wide signatures that are naturally modeled using nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF). We generalize the Poisson NMF model to a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian
regression model with priors informed by latent cancer type/subtype, covariates, known biological structure,
and large databases of cancer genomes. (Aim 2) Develop grammar-based methods for complex models of
sequential data, applied to SCNAs. Accurate genome-wide SCNA modeling requires continuous and dis-
crete latent states, asynchronous emissions, inhomogeneous transition kernels, and informed priors based on
previously observed cancer/normal genomes. We develop a grammar and algorithms for complex sequence
models with these features. (Aim3) Develop integrated Bayesian framework for robust cancer detection from
cfDNA sequencing. We will combine the methods from Aims 1 and 2 in a hierarchical model with cancer
type/subtype as a latent variable. (Aim 4) Develop software, provide documentation, and disseminate results
to facilitate reproducibility. We will provide user-friendly open-source software, preprocessed public data, and
thorough documentation to enable reproducibility and maximize ease-of-use."
10857145,"Project Summary – Core 3
The Bioinformatics and Analysis (BIA) Core serves as a support network for all VCU Alcohol Research Center
(ARC) projects and will interact closely with each component to provide computational, statistical, and research
design expertise. The core will play a central role in the data collection, curation, annotation, management,
storage, and analysis. As such, we will first collect and curate project related data include those generated by
the VCU-ARC and those that are available from other outside sources. Examples of these internal and external
data include human association studies and expression and network analyses for mouse, worm and fly. The
collected data will be integrated via a data management system. Many statistical and bioinformatics analyses
will be performed for the identification of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) related genes, including within and
across species gene network analysis. The core will also implement methods for prioritizing genes for
additional study. The overall goal of facilitating data sharing and the application of emerging methods will be to
accelerate the understanding of AUD and related traits. To this end, a wide range of experimental data and
results related to alcohol will be used and generated by the proposed center. Collecting and integrating these
data provides the opportunity to discover patterns that would be detected when considering a single organism
or experimental design."
10857147,"Project Summary – Pilot Projects
The goals of this Pilot Project Core of the VCU Alcohol Research Center are to: 1) manage the progress and
quality control for our two designated initial pilot projects, 2) solicit and evaluate future pilot grant proposals to
further expand the scientific breadth of VCU-ARC, 3) encourage pilot grant awardees to submit proposals for
independent funding and 4) support training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows within
laboratories of funded pilot projects. Drs. Bjork and Edwards are experts in motivational and internalizing
factors that influence risk for human alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and will be the Lead and co-investigator of
Pilot Project 1, entitled “The role of neurocognition in polygenic risk for alcohol use disorder and comorbidities”.
They have proposed a novel study to integrate data on the neurocognitive performance of individuals with
severe AUD and uncover the genetic relationships leading to AUD risk. Their pilot will interface with the
longitudinal genetic studies proposed in Projects 4 and 5 (Dick and Webb) and may inform analyses in Core 3
(Bacanu). Furthermore, if successful, Pilot Project 1's work will provide solid preliminary data for future funding
applications assessing the neurocognitive and genetic contributions to risk for AUD. The second targeted pilot
will be conducted by Dr. Joel Schlosburg, an expert neuropharmacologist with expertise in drug and alcohol
use disorders, and is entitled ""Dissection of the acute and dependent responses to ethanol in rats lacking fatty
acid amide hydrolase”. Pilot Project 2 will use a newly established FAAH knockout rat on an outbred
background to test the role of FAAH on ethanol sensitivity, intake and preference. This pilot will expand the
knowledge of the impact of potential future FAAH inhibitor development for use in clinical trials, with at least
three separate such inhibitors in various phases and endpoints. These studies may also be the first to
demonstrate whether NAPE-PLD is the primary synthetic enzyme supplying fatty acid amide substrates to
FAAH. We will solicit other proposals in year 2 and fund the two best of them in years 3-4, then solicit
proposals again in year 4 to fund one in year 5. The pilot program is an important component of the VCU-ARC
that will enable us to attract new and innovative researchers to interact with Center investigators and expand
high quality alcohol research at VCU."
10857149,"Project Summary – Project 1
Over the last four years of P50 funding to the VCU Alcohol Research Center (VCU ARC), our laboratory used
Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse mice from Jackson Laboratories (http://do.jax.org) for behavioral genetics and
initial genomic studies on progressive ethanol consumption. DO mice originate from 8 progenitor mouse strains
chosen to maximize genetic diversity and utilize a breeding scheme producing a high degree of heterozygosity
for fine mapping complex traits such as ethanol consumption. As such, DO mice more faithfully mimic genetic
aspects seen with alcohol use disorder (AUD). As expected, based upon preliminary work in DO progenitor
strains, behavioral studies using a progressive ethanol consumption model (intermittent ethanol access, IEA)
on over 600 DO mice showed a broad distribution of consumption values (~0.5–38 g/kg/24h) that shifted to
significantly higher intake over the 4 week experiment. Genotyping identified 10 genome-wide significant or
suggestive QTL with LOD ≥ 6 and support intervals generally < 2 Mb. Strikingly, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for
the first week of drinking differed from those during the last week of consumption. Ongoing haplotype analysis
and integration of RNAseq data from prefrontal cortex have identified provisional candidate genes, including
two that have been implicated in human genome-wide association studies on alcohol consumption or
dependence. We hypothesize in this renewal that extension of this DO behavioral QTL and genomic data will
identify novel candidate genes and gene networks contributing to ethanol consumption behaviors in mice and
that such data will inform existing and future human genetic studies and therapeutic efforts on AUD.
Our specific aims thus describe: 1) Further expression genetics analysis in nucleus accumbens, allele specific
expression analysis, and chromatin 3D conformation analyses to identify and refine a list of positional
candidate genes for behavioral QTL associated with initial ethanol intake vs. progressive consumption; 2)
Gene network analysis of RNAseq data in both prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens across 200 DO mice
to identify networks and possible mechanisms tightly associated with consumption differing between first and
last week; and 3) Validation of candidate genes or network hubs as functioning in ethanol behaviors, including
initial or progressive ethanol consumption, using invertebrate models (collaboration with Projects 2 and 3 of
this Center proposal), rodent models (this project and Rodent Behavioral Core). Further, the work of this
project will inform and be informed by novel human genetic studies described in Projects 4 and 5. Throughout
this project, the VCU ARC Bioinformatics and Analysis Core will provide critical support for analysis of RNAseq
data and Capture-C chromatin conformation studies, and the choice of candidate genes and networks. This
novel gene discovery and network analysis effort will have major interactions with all other components of VCU
ARC and will inform the field of alcohol research with understanding of mechanisms involved in the transition to
abusive drinking, and candidate genes/mechanisms for potential targeting by future therapeutic efforts."
10857153,"Project Summary – Project 3
 The development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) results from an interaction between both environmental and
genetic factors. Studies of the impact of environment on the risk to develop AUD have, to date, focused mainly
on psychological characteristics (externalizing phenotypes, etc.) or on developmental defects associated with
prenatal or adolescent exposure to alcohol. Here, we will study the role of the dietary omega-3 fatty acid
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an environmental factor, in adults for a role in modulating the acute behavioral
response to ethanol. Our study of the alcohol-naive acute level of response (LR) is significant because this
measure is strongly correlated with the liability to develop AUD. Using two model organisms (C. elegans and
mouse), we have previously found that dietary omega-3 fatty acid levels significantly impact the acute LR to
alcohol in ethanol-naive animals. In worms, we have found specifically that EPA is essential for the
development of acute functional tolerance (AFT) to ethanol. We will use two complementary approaches to
identify the mechanisms underlying the effects of EPA on the acute behavioral response to ethanol. In Aim 1
we will identify genes whose expression is regulated in response to different EPA levels (depleted, normal
levels, above normal levels) in adult C. elegans. We will correlate gene expression changes and the time
course of the effect of dietary EPA on AFT. We will directly test the roles of prioritized candidate genes in the
development of AFT to identify the molecular pathways that are important for ethanol response behaviors and
are affected by EPA levels. In Aim 2, we will use cutting edge lipidomics to determine what lipid species are
derived from the dietary EPA. We will correlate the accumulation of EPA derived lipids to the time course of the
effects of dietary EPA on AFT. We will identify candidate lipid mediators of the development of AFT. This will
implicate molecular pathways in the machinery underlying AFT. These studies will provide novel insight into
the roles of lipids in regulating the level of response to alcohol. Determination of the nature of these roles will
enable future identification of the protein targets of ethanol, and the regulatory mechanisms affecting those
proteins, that are impacted by these lipid-dependent functions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue a successful
approach that uses the high-throughput genetic power of C. elegans to test the hypothesized roles of genes
that have been implicated by other components of the VCU-ARC in behavioral responses to ethanol."
10857155,"Project Summary – Project 4
Project 4 of the VCU Alcohol Research Center will utilize human data to accomplish two complementary goals:
(1) advancing discovery of genes involved in alcohol-related outcomes using new multivariate genomic
techniques, and (2) characterizing the risk associated with identified variants in diverse longitudinal samples, in
order to understand the spectrum of phenotypes associated with identified variants, across development, and
in conjunction with the environment. Each of these areas represent critical steps in using genetic data to
improve prevention, intervention, and treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and will lay the foundation as
we move into an era of personalized medicine. Human gene identification efforts for alcohol use disorders lag
behind other areas of psychiatry, in part due to constrained sample sizes of available AUD cases. However,
recent meta-analyses of consumption and AUD reveal significant genetic correlations with numerous other
psychiatric and behavioral traits, as well as social and demographic outcomes, and other biomedical
phenotypes. Project 4 will (Aim 1) apply new multivariate genetic methods to capitalize on genetic sharing
between alcohol use phenotypes and other psychiatric and behavioral traits in order to boost power to detect
common variants associated with alcohol use outcomes, and to characterize the latent pathways by which
genetic variants operate. Bioinformatic characterization of these identified genetic variant results through the
Bioinformatics and Analytics (BIA) core will help elucidate underlying biological risk pathways. We will then
apply results from these multivariate analyses to three complementary longitudinal datasets, consisting of both
population-based and high-risk samples, in order to (Aim 2a): map the behavioral phenotypes associated with
the genetic risk scores identified in Aim 1 across adolescence and emerging adulthood; (Aim 2b) test for
pathways of risk specific to sex and racial/ethnic background; and (Aim 2c) test for moderation of genetic risk
by key environmental factors. The project will interface with the other ARC components in multiple ways:
results from the gene discovery analyses (Aim 1) will be integrated with model organism results and
expression data (Projects 1-3) in the BAI Core to create refined polygenic risk scores for further study in Aim 2.
Project 5 will refine structural models using twin and epidemiological samples to further characterize the
multivariate nature of genetic influences on alcohol-related outcomes, to iteratively inform and extend the
multivariate analyses performed in Aim 1. Further, the genetic variants identified in Aim 1 can be advanced for
further study in animal models via the Rodent Behavior Core."
10857157,"Project Summary – Project 5
Recent advances in the study of human complex traits include 1) a growing catalog of robustly associated
common variants found using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 2) the ability to assess the
contribution of rare variation through genome sequencing studies of both whole exomes (WES) and genomes
(WGS), and 3) wide-spread cross-trait genetic correlation. For alcohol use disorder (AUD) and related
phenotypes, there is an opportunity to discover novel rare variation and understand the overall pattern of
evidence across the allele frequency spectrum including common and rare variation. One lesson from GWAS
is that most robust associations do not create protein coding changes and some robust genome-wide
significant variation does not reside in genes at all. As WES expands to include untranslated regions (UTRs)
and WGS becomes affordable, there is a significant challenge in analyzing the variation that does not impact
protein coding directly. Fortunately, there is a growing catalog of functional elements across the genome that
can be interrogated to determine which harbor variants influencing AUD. For sequencing based analyses of
rare variation, these functional elements showing enrichment can be leveraged to improve detection. As more
variants associated with AUD are discovered and the catalog of traits with genetic correlations grows,
determining how specific these variants are to AUD becomes more important. For example, do discovered loci
influence a) addiction in general, b) alcohol consumption, or c) AUD specifically or do they non-specifically
influence many physical or mental health outcomes. In addition to determining if loci, in aggregate or
individually, can be considered primary or secondary AUD risk loci, understanding the direction of causation
across traits and time is critically important to identifying opportunities for intervention. One powerful approach
to investigate causative relationships is through Mendelian Randomization analysis. The overall goal of this
project is to leverage existing twin, family, epidemiological, and molecular data in novel ways to a) discover loci
harboring rare variants that influencing AUD without new molecular data generation, b) differentiate loci that
influence common versus specific AUD liability factors, and c) understand the architecture of AUD using an
integrated and iterative approach."
10857179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Core 1 – Animal Phenotyping/Metabolism Core
The services provided in the Animal Phenotyping/Metabolism Core draw upon the expertise of many
investigators at UTSW to provide comprehensive analytical capabilities that are on par with the best facilities in
the world. We established our Animal Phenotyping/Metabolism Core more than 12 years ago and we have
continued to expand our assay capabilities to support investigators with in-depth preclinical capabilities.
The availability of standardized assays speeds the pace of our research, facilitates inter-lab comparisons of data,
and provides a common platform for the necessary close interactions between investigators of the NORC.
Animal models that allow careful characterization of the metabolic effects of obesity and that have an altered
communication axis between critical tissues and are vital to understand the pathogenesis of disease. Given the
number of phenotypic measurements, the range of target metabolites, and the number of different animal models
investigated among the NORC investigators, it is necessary to provide uniform measurements and to have
quality control guidelines in place. To facilitate the research of NORC investigators, Core 1 will provide
comprehensive, state-of-the-art measurements of multiple metabolic parameters, with measurements
involving physiological read outs that include lipid, glucose, and metabokine assays.
The technical expertise offered by the Animal Phenotyping/Metabolism Core will bring multiple benefits to NORC
investigators, including but not limited to the following:
 Centralized Core services that are more cost effective and prevent the duplication of reagents across
 NORC investigators.
 Provides consistency in various assays across laboratories.
 Provides consistent quality control measures.
 Makes available technically challenging assays, such as hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, that
 cannot be established in individual laboratories.
 Makes available equipment that is essential for nutrition and obesity research but that is too expensive
 for individual investigators to purchase (e.g. Seahorse, MRI, metabolic cages, animal CT).
 Frees investigators from routine work to focus on the intellectual challenges of the projects."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Genetics, Single-Cell Sequencing, and RNASeq Core.
The Genetics, Singe-Cell Sequencing, and RNASeq Core will provide NORC investigators with access to, and
assistance with, state-of-the-art molecular methods based on Next Generation Sequencing. Our major goal is to
make the technology accessible to NORC investigators who may not have the resources or experience to take
full advantage of these methods. We will pursue two complementary approaches. First, we will generate a
graphical user interface to provide NORC investigators with access to a database of precomputed tests for
genetic association in the Dallas Heart Study, and the Dallas Biobank. NORC Investigators will query the
database by genotype (e.g. a gene symbol or genetic marker) to identify traits associated with that gene or
marker in the DHS), or by phenotype, to identify genes and mutations that contribute to that phenotype. Data
from whole exome sequencing and whole genome microarrays is available for participants in both of these
studies and phenotype data relevant to NORC investigators has been collected. This resource will enable NORC
investigators to exploit the unique advantages of human genetics to dissect cause-effect relationships in
metabolic pathways and to identify novel components of these pathways. Second, we will assist NORC
investigators with the design and interpretation of their NGS-related experiments. Laboratory analyses will be
performed by the McDermott Center Sequencing Core. We will focus on genetics, single-cell sequencing and
RNASeq because these methods are by far the most widely requested services by investigators at UT
Southwestern. Our Specific Objectives are: 1) Assist NORC Investigators to use genetic association and
Mendelian Randomization and whole genome/exome sequencing; 2) Enable NORC investigators to use Single-
cell sequencing and provide analysis of results; and 3) Assist NORC investigators with the design and
interpretation of RNASeq analyses in a reliable, cost-effective manner."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and neurodegeneration affecting more than 5
million Americans with no current effective treatment. Several Mendelian mutations and risk variants have
been identified. We and others have shown that AD is associated with changes in brain cell proportion and
transcriptomic changes, some of them are also cell specific. Additionally, the latest genetic studies implicate
cell-specific pathogenic events that lead to disease. Pathogenic variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 affects
APP processing leading to Aβ aggregates and neuronal death. Genetic variants in TREM2 and MS4A modify
AD risk by affecting microglia activity. To fully understand and characterize the role of transposable elements
(TE) in AD pathogenesis there is a need to novel and multidisciplinary approaches. Here we will combine novel
genomic approaches in human brain tissues, direct converted neurons and iPSC-derived microglia (iMGL) to
identify cell-specific TE and downstream (chromatin accessibility, transcription) changes implicated in AD. We
will leverage a large and unique resources of human brain samples and fibroblast from individuals with
mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, as well as risk variants in TREM2, MS4A or APOE. We will also use the
direct converted neurons and iMGL, together with new genomic editing approaches to target and characterize
the mechanism by which TE contribute to disease."

New methods to study heterogeneity at cellular resolution in complex tissues are
transforming our understanding of human biology and disease. These approaches
measure differences in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein levels
across thousands to millions of cells to understand developmental trajectories of tissues,
tumors, and whole organisms. But these methods rely on measurements of static levels
of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and fail to capture dynamic biochemical activities that
underlie complex cellular functions. Instead of developing more direct readouts of
cellular function, the field has focused on inferring functional status from measurements
of mRNA abundance and chromatin accessibility in single cells. To accelerate the study
of biochemical heterogeneity among single cells, we developed functional assays as a
new modality for single-cell experiments. Instead of measuring the abundance of
molecules—i.e., levels of DNA, RNA, or protein—from single cells and predicting cell
functional states (e.g., cell cycle phase), our key innovation is to directly quantify
enzymatic activities in single cells by measuring the conversion of substrates to products
by single cell extracts in a high-throughput DNA sequencing experiment. Our approach
is compatible with existing platforms that measure gene expression in thousands to
millions of individual cells and enables many different enzymatic activities to be
measured simultaneously."
10864987,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This proposal investigates a novel idea to explain how TDP-43 protein pathology is
amplified and spread between glia and neurons after initiation of disease. TDP-43
aggregation pathology is a core feature of a suite of neurodegenerative disorders
including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We
propose and will test the hypothesis that retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses
are both activated by TDP-43 pathology and can be upstream initiators of such
pathology. We also will test the idea that these mobile elements contribute a mechanism
of inter-cellular spread that could underlie progression of disease. We will use both
Drosophila models and mammalian cell culture to test the core features of this proposed
model."
10865086,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fungal pathogens are a serious threat to human health. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe, life-
threatening disease that occurs when Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) spores are inhaled into the respiratory tract
and invade airway or lung tissue. More than 200,000 cases of invasive aspergillosis occur each year. A newly
identified risk factor for IPA in critically ill patients is influenza infection. Influenza is a common respiratory illness
that affects 5-20% of the population each year. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic interventions
for use in clinical settings to prevent morbidity and mortality from IPA. The focus of this application is to identify
cell signaling pathways that increase susceptibility to invasive fungal disease following influenza infection. Our
preliminary data support that preceding influenza inhibits neutrophil recruitment to the lung, in contrast to post-
bacterial pneumonia, and neutropenia is a key risk factor for the development of IPA. Additionally, preceding
influenza inhibits neutrophil function against secondary AF infection. Furthermore, our preliminary data
demonstrate that the pathogen recognition receptor, CD209a, is decreased in post-influenza IPA, suggesting
that preceding influenza may inhibit fungal-sensing. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
preceding influenza A infection limits innate immunity and increases susceptibility to invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis by inhibiting CD209a and reducing the host response to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection
in the lung, including neutrophil recruitment and function. Our research aims include 1) Determine whether
neutrophil recruitment and effector functions are inhibited in post-influenza IPA, and 2) Determine whether
suppression of CD209a-dependent AF sensing promotes post-influenza IPA. The proposed studies will increase
our understanding of how influenza inhibits neutrophil migration to and function within the lung in response to
subsequent AF infection (Aim1) and how the immune response to AF is initiated in the lung (Aim 2)."

Nonivasive stimulation of the brain in health and disease is an important goal of the Brain Initiative. Current
methods include Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcranial Electric Stimulation (TES) and
Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (TFUS). The mechanisms of the perturbation effects are not well
understood. We hypothesize that Transcranial Radio Frequency Stimulation (TRFS; 900 MHz to few GHz),
when using appropriate frequency, power and stimulation regimes, can offer a safe experimental and clinical
tool that can combine advantages of the existing noninvasive perturbation methods with potentially fewer side
effects. We propose to examine the membrane, single unit, circuit, and circuit modification mechanism of
TRFS.
We designed a set of experiments to examine non-thermal, electric field-induced effects of RF stimulation in
behaving rodents, with the goal of establishing safe margins of stimulation patterns and RF power for effective
driving of neuronal activity at the single neuron and circuit levels, using state-of-the-art optical and large-scale
electrophysiological and electronic techniques combined with modeling of RF effects. The first goal is to
establish safe parameters of homogeneous RF fields, which can effectively entrain cortical and subcortical
neurons with no or negligible thermal effects even after long-term exposure. Second, exclude any potential
non-thermal artifacts (such as cochlear-mediated or 'metal-in-the-brain' effects) and other periphery-mediated
effects. The third important milestone is to identify the membrane channels involved in the RF-induced field
effects. Finally, we will examine the spatially focused effects of RF stimulation by using directionally acting
antenna(s). The feasibility of the project is supported by extensive preliminary findings. Our data and know-
how will be made available to qualified researchers. TRFS will facilitate discovery science and its future human
application is expected to become invaluable in the treatment of multiple psychiatric and neurological
conditions.

10865088,"ABSTRACT
The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells
from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological
metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected
tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically
exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the
margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body
following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to
eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy;
these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely
used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are
evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide
additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin
status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of
PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate
cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs
following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical
margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily
electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be
used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic
device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status.
Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed
laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive
surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide
surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end
of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi-
center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment."
10863278,"Project Summary
 Targeted covalent inhibitors have empowered the potent and selective targeting of driver oncogenes in
cancer. Between 2011 and 2021, 16 new covalent drugs (12 with cancer indications) were approved by the
US FDA, with the recent notable example of the first KRAS inhibitor sotorasib. However, most of current
covalent drug discovery efforts are directed toward cysteines, which is the least abundant amino acid in the
proteome (2%). Meanwhile, about 6% of mutants in cancer lead to serines. While some of these mutations
directly contribute to oncogenic signaling (e.g. KRAS G12S), others confer clinical resistance to existing drugs
(e.g. EGFR C797S, BTK C481S). To date, direct engagement of these mutant serines have not be achieved.
Methods to selectively engage amino acids beyond cysteine are highly desirable, as they will bridge the gap
between the prevalence of serine-acquiring mutations in human cancer and the lack of chemical tools to target
them.
 This project aims to develop new chemistry that enables the covalent engagement of serine residues,
especially those acquired in cancer such as EGFR(C797S) (Aim 1) and BTK C481S (Aim 2). Successful
targeting of these proteins will provide new avenues for targeted cancer therapy. The chemistry developed in
this project will also serve as a platform for the discovery of new covalent ligands for currently “undruggable”
cancer targets (Aim 3)."
10865041,"ABSTRACT
In randomized clinical trials and observational studies, multivariate outcomes are increasingly used as co-
primary endpoints to study complex diseases or clinical outcomes comprised of co-morbidities. Some modern
studies also collect large-scale genetics or image data for the potential of individualized risk prediction and
precision medicine development. Moreover, the precise event times for non-fatal events are sometimes
unobservable because the event status can only be determined at intermittent assessment times. The non-
fatal events may also be censored by fatal events (i.e., death) which results in semi-competing risks data. The
complex multivariate survival outcome together with large-scale covariates pose great analytical challenges for
such studies. Inspired by the challenges and opportunities met in our motivating studies for two bilateral
diseases, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Acute Otitis Media (AOM), as well as the wealthy data
from the hormone therapy trial in Women Health Initiative (WHI) and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI), the broad aim of this proposal is to develop new statistical and machine learning methods and
computational tools for analyzing such data. First, we will develop a class of semiparametric copula models
that flexibly joint model the multivariate survival data without ad-hoc data simplification. A rigorous goodness-
of-fit test will be proposed for model diagnostics. Next, using the top risk factors identified from the
semiparametric copula model as inputs, we will develop a multivariate survival deep neural network to predict
individualized disease risk proﬁles over time, which are critical for personalized disease prevention and clinical
management. Then, based on fundamental multiple testing principles, we propose a novel simultaneous
inference procedure to identify and infer subgroups with enhanced treatment efficacy under our proposed
copula framework. Finally, we will develop a meta-learner framework to estimate individualized treatment
effects and to give treatment recommendation rules. The novel methodology will be immediately applied to the
ongoing AMD, AOM and AD research at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as the data from WHI and ADNI to
facilitate novel analyses for identifying risk factors and assessing treatment effects on disease progression,
recurrence, or prevention. The methodology advances will be applicable to a broad range of studies with
similar data features. In summary, the successful completion of the project will lead to a comprehensive
methodological framework with ready-to-use software packages, which have the potential to fundamentally
improve the current practice in analyzing such studies, and thus to enhance the discovery of disease risk
factors, improve the prediction of disease progression profiles, and increase the success of precision medicine."
10865043,"The overarching goal of this R01 is to develop non immunosuppressive strategies to prevent and treat
gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD, which remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality from allogeneic hematopoietic
cell transplantation (HCT). We have uncovered an exciting, previously unknown role for metabolic aberrations in
allo-reactive T cell target tissues, the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in regulating the severity of GI GVHD. Our
preliminary data identified a profound defect in mitochondrial complex II (MC II), specifically reduction of its
component, succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA), in IECs that contributed to severity of GI GVHD. These studies
have identified a key role for SDHA in bulk IECs, which is made up of a number of distinct subsets. Emerging data
in the recent years suggest that quantitative loss of only a few key IEC subsets, specifically Lgr5+ intestinal stem
cell (ISCs) is a critical features of severe GI GVHD. But the ISC intrinsic pathways that are critical for their function
and maintenance remain unknown. Our new preliminary data demonstrate that the mitochondrial metabolic defect,
reduction of SDHA component of the mitochondrial complex II (MC II), in the bulk IECs, is observed in the ISC
subsets. In this project, we will build on these exciting and seminal preliminary observations and explore the role
of mitochondrial metabolic and bioenergetics functions in the biology of ISCs and its contribution to mitigating the
severity of GI GVHD. Specifically, we will test the central hypothesis that host Lgr5+ ISCs cell autonomous
deficiency of mitochondrial complex II component, SDHA amplifies GI GVHD. The specific aims are:
Specific Aim (SA) 1: To determine the functional relevance of mitochondrial complex II component (SDHA) in
host Lgr5+ ISCs to GI GVHD.
SA 2: Determine the impact of mitochondrial complex II SDHA deficiency on the biology of Lgr5+ ISC.
If successful, our proposal will provide seminal insights into fundamental biology of ISCs, provide novel targets to
mitigate T cell mediated target organ damage without adding more immune suppression and thus have potential
implications not only for allo-HCT but also for autoimmunity, solid organ transplantation and T cell mediated
therapies."
10865046,"ABSTRACT
Villi are finger-like projection that line the lumen of the small intestine. Villi play a critical role in nutrient uptake
by increasing the intestinal absorptive surface area by several orders of magnitude. Loss of this absorptive
surface through villus atrophy causes major digestive complications and nutrient malabsorption. Abnormalities
in villi are found in many gastrointestinal maladies, such as inflammatory bowel and celiac diseases, and are
also side effects of radiation, chemotherapy, and infection. Degenerated villi can sometimes fully reform, yet in
other situations regeneration is impaired, resulting in persistent villus atrophy and patient suffering.
Villi emerge during development from an initially flat intestinal surface. The mechanisms underlying villus
formation and repair remain poorly described, and an understanding of these processes is essential to develop
new therapies. The long term goal of this proposal is to build an understanding of the molecules and forces that
sculpt the villus during development and regeneration so as to improve strategies for growing and regenerating
the intestine for human patients. Recent data from our labs suggest that the mesenchyme plays a central role in
sculpting the architecture of the villus. Specifically, our preliminary data implicate a specialized population of self-
organizing sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells that condense immediately below the forming villus as the source
of the physical forces necessary to pattern and fold the overlying epithelium into villi. We investigated the
molecular mechanisms leading to condensation of these cells using single cell RNAseq and found they also
express a unique transcriptional program. This program has an unusual overlap with genes regulating Ca2+
mediated contractility in smooth muscle cells but without expressing smooth muscle actin. We provide evidence
that inhibition of key proteins in this program results in a loss of mesenchymal condensation and villus
evagination. Guided by these preliminary data, we propose to test two hypotheses related to the complementary
physical and molecular aspects of villus formation. We combine quantitative measurements and computational
modeling to test the hypothesis that the formation of villus condensates occurs analogously to phase separation
phenomena studied extensively by physicists and material scientists, and that condensates exert physical forces
on the overlying epithelium initiating its folding. We then test the hypothesis that Endothelin released from the
epithelium triggers increased calcium signaling in the subepithelial mesenchyme, which are synchronized
through gap junctions to drive cell contractility leading to phase separation and condensation.
This project has major implications for our fundamental understanding of the developmental of the gut and for
tissue engineering of intestinal tissue, as we do not know how mammalian intestinal villi are built. Thus, these
findings will be impactful because they provide a new mechanistic blueprint for this process that incorporates
both signals and forces. These findings will also lay the groundwork for future studies of regeneration: we find
that in adults, the sub-epithelial mesenchyme retains expression of many of these molecular features. Further,
these features are upregulated following injury."

10866387,"Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the leading cause of birth defect-associated illness and death.
Neurodevelopmental delays and disabilities are the most frequent and significant consequence for CHD
survivors. Efforts to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes have primarily focused on surgical techniques,
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) strategies and pharmacologic therapies without much success. Exposure to
industrial chemicals in the health care environment are increasingly being recognized as harmful, and maybe a
mechanism for these poor outcomes in CHD. Cyclohexanone, is a hazardous organic industrial solvent used
principally in health care as a joining compound in the fabrication of plastic medical devices. Cyclohexanone has
been shown to leach from IV infusion sets and the CPB circuit and in animal studies, with significant
cardiovascular effects. Therefore, our hypothesis is that cyclohexanone derived from medical plastics is
associated with adverse cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental outcomes in congenital cardiac surgery. We
now have significant and compelling pilot data in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery that there is a) substantial
cyclohexanone exposure from IV infusions and CPB and b) with adjusted analysis, cyclohexanone levels were
significantly associated with adverse post-operative cardiovascular outcomes, and worse 12 month
neurodevelopmental outcomes, thus supporting our hypothesis. Our long-term goal is to develop new prevention
strategies and more precise treatments to improve outcomes for neonates undergoing surgery with CPB. We
will approach this hypothesis using samples and outcomes from the discovery cohort: the completed NHLBI
multicenter Trial NCT01579513, entitled “Corticosteroid Therapy in Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary
Bypass (MP trial)”, Eric Graham, PI (n=190, randomized to MP (methylprednisolone) therapy or placebo) and
the completed external validation cohort the University of Toronto, “Clinical Assessment of Thrombosis in
Children After Heart Surgery: The CATCH Study” (NCT01435473), Brian McCrindle and Cedric Manlhiot (PIs)
(N=327, <5 years old) and a neonatal cardiac surgery from the University of Michigan (N=59), Mark Russell, PI.
With the following Specific Aims we propose to: Aim 1) Determine if serum perioperative cyclohexanone levels
are associated with perioperative morbidity, mortality, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim 2) Determine
cyclohexanone exposure sources and removal using zeolite molecular sieves. Finally, Aim 3) Determine
cyclohexanone neural toxicity, blood brain barrier and learning/memory effects. These Aims describe a paradigm
shift in the mechanism of reduced neonatal heart surgery outcomes. Innovation includes discovery of the novel
role of the industrial organic solvent contaminant cyclohexanone from medical plastic fabrication on neonatal
cardiac surgery clinical outcomes and methods for removal. Reduction of organic solvent exposure from medical
plastics offers an immediate and actionable means to improve neonatal cardiac surgical outcomes."
10858197,"Project Summary/Abstract
The project aims to enable scientists from various biomedical disciplines to make informed, evidence-based
decisions on the reuse of archived organelle genomes. It aims to give scientists the computational means to
evaluate data quality among the thousands of mitochondrial and plastid genomes stored on the sequence
database GenBank. Organelle genomes archived on GenBank are retrieved and employed in many
biomedical investigations, including on human genetics, microbiology, environmental health, toxicology,
and forensics. However, many studies ignore that a considerable proportion of mitochondrial and plastid
genomes on GenBank exhibit signs of incorrect genome assembly, incomplete sequence annotation, or
both. Indications of low data quality are even found among organellar genome records with reference
genome status. Hence, new computational methods are needed to assess the data quality of GenBank-
archived organelle genomes so that only accurate and reliable genome records are selected and integrated
into new analyses. The proposed project develops such methods. It generates novel software tools that
enable scientists to assess GenBank-archived organelle genomes from various eukaryotic lineages in
an automated, standardized fashion. The new tools enable users to evaluate, quantify, and visualize
those aspects of organellar genome records on GenBank that are applicable across all such records and
indicative of their genome accuracy and completeness. A total of four software tools are developed. Tool
#1 automatically links organellar genome records to their short-read data in the database SRA. Tool #2
assesses the quality of organelle genomes by measuring sequencing coverage and sequencing evenness.
Tool #3 assesses genome quality by comparing the genome sequence of a given record to its de novo re-
assembly under modern assemblers. Tool #4 assesses genome quality by contrasting the gene annotations
of a given record to those of closely related individuals or species. Quality assessments at different scales
are enabled by implementing features that support the integration of each tool into automated analysis
pipelines. The tools are tested on large and diverse sets of GenBank-archived organelle genomes, including
a data set of thousands of human mitochondrial genomes. Each tool is written in a common scripting
language and distributed as an open-source application to encourage wide reuse by other scientists. As a
result, the project expands the existing computational toolkit for organelle genomics and allows scientists
across different biomedical disciplines to use quality metrics to decide which mitochondrial and plastid
genomes on GenBank to reuse. Taking place at a predominantly undergraduate institution, the project
actively includes student researchers with the goal of training them in genome assembly, annotation, and
bioinformatics tool development."
10880624,"Summary
 Disruption of gene regulation is a major causal factor in heritable disease, developmental disorders,
and oncogenesis. While chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Tn5-
transposase based tagging (Cut&Tag) enable analysis of transcription factor binding and epigenetic state
profiling in bulk tissue samples and tumor biopsies, they produce only population average signals. Yet
regulatory networks and perturbations are heterogeneous between cell classes and types. Single-cell
technologies can overcome the challenge of cellular heterogeneity and provide deeper insight into cell
type-specific gene regulatory programs in healthy, diseased, and cancerous tissues. In prior work, we
developed a single-cell joint assay of histone modification and RNA expression (Paired-Tag), enabling
cell-type-stratified epigenetic profiling from bulk samples. This technology has attracted customers in
both academic and nonprofit research. In the proposed study, we will develop automated protocols and
effect laboratory informatics systems to establish a Paired-Tag services laboratory, we will refine our
protocol to improve experimental throughput and reduce cost, and we will develop a Paired-Tag “TF”
protocol for profiling transcription factor binding profiles. If successful, the research would enable next-
generation multi-omic analysis of tumor or disease samples at comparable cost to single-omic
technologies."
10860542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Interpretating large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets is challenging, particularly for researchers
lacking computational training. Enrichment analysis bridges gene-level changes to biological pathways,
thereby unraveling the complexity of biological systems. Even though dozens of tools are available,
there is still a critical barrier for bench scientists to conduct enrichment analysis interactively, rigorously,
and reproducibly. To complement existing tools, we developed a prototype for ShinyGO, a web-based
tool for overrepresentation analysis using lists of genes or proteins.
 ShinyGO supports gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for over 14,000 organisms, making it
versatile and widely applicable. Its database also encompasses KEGG, Reactome, protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network, transcription factor target genes, and microRNA target genes, among others.
With its dynamic visualization capabilities, ShinyGO depicts enrichment results and unique gene
features like gene length and genomic distribution, enabling a multi-faceted investigation of gene
regulation. Due to its user-friendly design, robust functionalities, and regularly updated databases,
ShinyGO has become an indispensable resource for many researchers, evident by more than a
thousand citations in the last three years.
 As a side project, however, ShinyGO has not been properly developed, debugged, or documented. Its
extensive database was gathered and maintained with NIH funding for another bioinformatics tool, iDEP,
which expires in 2024. Our goal for this project is to fully develop ShinyGO, enhance its functionality,
improve reproducibility, and broaden the database. Aim 1 focuses on refactoring using a modular
framework that makes it available as an R package. We will add a host of new features, including the
analysis of multiple gene sets, the generation of R code that can reproduce analyses, provenance
monitoring, knowledge graph-based visualization, additional analytical functions, and a ChatGPT-based
chatbot for user support. Aim 2 mainly involves testing, documentation, and user outreach. Aim 3 is
dedicated to updating and expanding the massive database, which will be made openly accessible.
 This project will transform the ShinyGO prototype into a rigorous, robust, and widely applicable tool. It
will enhance our capacity to interpret 'omics' data accurately and effortlessly, further facilitating
discoveries in various biological and medical research fields. This work will have a substantial impact
on thousands of researchers, especially those with limited resources."
10860000,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Recently released “Born Too Soon” by WHO and many other global organizations (May 2023) reported 152
million preterm births (PTB) worldwide in the past decade, with 15 million neonatal deaths due to prematurity
complications. Current interventions are insufficient to reduce the rates of PTB that involve both the fetus and
the mother as patients; however, interventions are restricted to the maternal uterine tissues and do not address
the fetal inflammatory response, which is one of the major triggers of labor at term and preterm. To address
drug delivery to the fetus and to reduce the fetal and maternal inflammatory response, we have successfully
developed and tested extracellular vesicle (EVs; exosomes) mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-10 (eIL-10). This approach improves IL-10’s half-life in the body and avoids its intraamniotic
administration for effectiveness. Our laboratory has engineered EVs by electroporation to contain the natural
anti-inflammatory protein IL-10. Engineered EVs retain their normal characteristics and cargo functionally
active IL-10 and show the following: (1) In vitro efficacy to reduce NF-kB activation and inflammatory cytokine
production in vitro in feto-maternal cells, (2) successful transplacental delivery of eIL-10 to delay PTB by over
72 hours in LPS-induced PTB in mouse models with a reduction in histologic chorioamnionitis and fetal and
maternal systemic inflammatory response, and (4) eIL-10 did not cause long term immunosuppression in the
neonates or mothers. Several unanswered questions remain before advancing eIL-10 to clinical trials. We will
test the hypothesis that eIL-10 is safe, stable, and specific in reducing feto-maternal inflammation to delay PTB
without any prenatal or postnatal complications. We will test the hypothesis using the following aims: SA# 1:
Determine PK/PD, toxicity, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes associated with eIL-10 in pregnant mouse
models. SA#2: Determine the toxicity and PK/PD in non-pregnant and pregnant nonhuman primate models. In
addition, using a 3rd aim, the reproducibility of animal model data of eIL-10 will be tested. We will use a highly
innovative humanized microphysiologic model of the feto-maternal interface that contains interconnected fetal

This K23, Patient Entered Data for Clinical Decision Support to Personalize Pediatric Asthma Management, aims
to improve asthma management through enhanced, automated implementation of pediatric asthma guidelines.
The immediate goal is to gain skills and further training to understand methods to deliver effective clinical infor-
matics tools for asthma management. The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of
Pediatric Pulmonology at UCLA and a clinical informaticist. The candidate has assembled a nationally recog-
nized and experienced mentorship team to provide guidance and expertise in qualitative research, data integra-
tion, and implementation science. The training plan combines directed coursework to strengthen skills in these
areas; and tutorials with qualitative and health service implementation experts to gain the requisite insight and
hands-on experience needed for this project. Career training includes professional development seminars, key
scientific meetings, and coursework on grant writing to optimize future independent research funding.
The proposed research addresses the challenge practitioners have – and are currently unable to meet – to
incorporate the complex National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) asthma guideline ele-
ments in their asthma management plan. This study leverages patient entered data (via a patient portal) to create
a comprehensive, automatically generated guideline-adherent clinical decision support (CDS) tool. In combina-
tion with this patient-collected data, the CDS tool will use information from the individual’s electronic health record
(EHR) to recommend a pediatric asthma management plan to the healthcare practitioner at the point of care.
Critically, this study advances asthma management in the EHR by incorporating patient-reported data into the
information gathering workflow. Previous use of patient portals in decision-making has had low uptake, partially
due to usability issues and clinical workflow integration. Existing clinical decision support systems are often of
narrow scope and do not incorporate the entirety of guideline elements, including psychosocial and environmen-
tal factors. As such, the specific aims for this research are: 1) to develop and iteratively refine a user-friendly
patient portal interface and evaluate its ability to capture key elements of the NAEPP guideline; 2) to develop a
comprehensive CDS tool that integrates patient entered data; and 3) to pilot the CDS tool’s ability to capture
guideline elements in the clinical setting. By understanding qualitative and user experience design during the
development phases, we plan to launch a CDS tool that integrates seamlessly into end user tasks (both patient
and practitioner), helping practitioners execute a comprehensive asthma management plan for children in the
outpatient setting. An R01 application, planned to be submitted in Year 4 of this award, will evaluate the impact
of this patient portal/CDS tool using an RCT design."

People of African ancestry are 7X more likely to develop overgrowth of scar tissue, or keloids, compared people
of European ancestry. Fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and excessive scar formation is dictated by an individual’s
ancestral background. Ancestry, quantified in our work through three components of self-identification, genetic
ancestry, and sociocultural experiences, informs wound healing. While it is known that ancestry influences
clinical wound healing, we do not understand how ancestry influences cell function or cell to cell communication
in the wound response. Understanding ancestral contributions to cellular function is critical to interrogate wound
healing differences. We hypothesize that ancestry informs differences in cellular response in wound
healing. The overall goal of our research program is to leverage biomaterial models to interrogate ancestral
contributions in wound healing. In this work, we will interrogate monocyte innate immune cells and CD34+
progenitor stem cells. Our proposed research program will answer three key questions: 1) How does ancestry
influence cellular physiology? Preliminary work in our group demonstrates gene expression differences in
isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells comparing self-identified African vs. European descendants. To
identify ancestral components beyond self-identification, we will interrogate genetic ancestry and sociocultural
factors to quantify ancestry. To determine how each ancestral component influences cell function, we will
conduct RNA sequencing and proteomic methodologies in tandem with mechanistic inhibitors to assess cell
function differences in monocytes and progenitor stem cells. 2) How does ancestry influence cellular
phenotype? While African ancestry is correlated with elevated scar formation, previous clinical studies do not
provide mechanistic insights into cellular phenotype that occurs within wound sites. To address this limitation,
we will leverage biomaterials and soluble factors to mimic wound extracellular matrix environments. To determine
how ancestral components influences the cell phenotype, monocyte and progenitor stem cell responses following
culture into the biomaterial microenvironments will be quantified. 3) How does ancestry correlate with the
cellular response in wound healing? Wound responses necessitate cell to cell communication. We will utilize
biomaterial models of cell-cell interaction and simulate wounding through oxidative stress injury. We will assess
how ancestry influences cell to cell communication in these wound environments via genetic and secretome
expression. This ESI-MIRA will enable my group to measure the influence of ancestry on wound healing through
manipulation of biomaterial platforms. Ultimately, the vision for my lab’s research is to discern the impact
of ancestry on wound healing differences and leverage biomaterial models to investigate health
disparities in healing."

1 Motivation
 Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Stroke survivors now constitute
around 3% of the over-20 population, with 50% of stroke-affected subjects left with impaired propulsion
on the paretic side, resulting in asymmetric movement and compromised balance [1]. The hemiparetic
gait observed in many individuals post-stroke is slower and more metabolically expensive than in healthy
individuals [2–6], and is a primary contributor to reduced community participation and quality of life [7–11].
Contemporary approaches to gait training are based on repetitive therapy often conducted on treadmills [12],
with variants including the combination of human or robotic assistance [13], body weight support [14], and
functional electrical stimulation [15].
 Robotic intervention enables systematic and accurate modulation of joint-level variables, such as assis-
tance torques and joint angles/velocities. Robotics is an intriguing tool for gait training, but the capability
of using robots as tools to support locomotor learning for rehabilitation purposes has not yet been fully
demonstrated. Earlier implementations of robot-aided gait rehabilitation provided non-convincing or nega-
tive results [13, 16], as extensively quantiﬁed in a meta-analysis [17]. Currently, the effects of robot-aided
gait training in stroke have yet to exceed those achieved with conventional therapy methods [17].
 We speculate that such limitations are mostly imputable to the controllers used for robot-aided gait train-
ing. The majority of robotic devices, designed speciﬁcally to rehabilitate gait, utilize one of the various
controller forms (e.g., force control, position control, or impedance control), and controller update methods
(e.g., assist-as-needed control, inter-limb coordination, or ﬁnite state machine), to ultimately promote spe-
ciﬁc features of gait kinematics [18]. The limited efﬁcacy of these methods could be due to their lack of
targeting speciﬁc functional mechanisms of gait, which are only partially described by joint kinematics.
 From an extremely reductionist perspective, walking is pushing ones' center of mass in a desired direction
while not falling. Fundamentally, walking involves three main sub-tasks: propulsion, limb advancement, and
balance [19]. Of these components, limb advancement may be based on kinematic control, but is the least
energetically demanding. Instead, the sub-tasks of propulsion and balance require precise neuromuscular
coordination, and speciﬁcally mediation of the interaction forces between the walker and ground. Despite
their fundamental importance, there have been very little efforts in rehabilitation robotics in developing
robot-aided methods to study and/or train propulsion and balance in post-stroke rehabilitation.

 300,000 Americans suffer paralysis from spinal cord axon injury. Glia permit axon regeneration by
clearing debris, partly through autophagy. Inappropriate release of glial debris can inhibit axon regeneration. To
treat axon injuries, it is essential to understand mechanisms of glial recovery after axon injury, permitting glia to
facilitate axon regeneration. Larval fly sensory neurons are a genetically-tractable model for axon regeneration
in the mammalian peripheral nervous system, with regrowth dependent on wrapping glia. In my postdoctoral
experiments, I have discovered that fly sensory glia release large exopher-like vesicles (ELVs) (~3 µm) at the
injury site, a phenomenon previously undescribed in glia. Glia also display membrane damage and subsequent
repair at the injury site, and loss of wound healing pathway components results in diminished axon regeneration.
These data suggest that glia may adapt to the stress of axon injury through ELV release and membrane repair.
Exophers, large (~3 µm) vesicles so far documented in C. elegans neurons and mouse cardiomyocytes,
sequester oxidatively-stressed mitochondria for release. In mice, the autophagic pathway is required to produce
exophers. My preliminary experiments in fly larvae showed loss of an essential autophagy regulator results in
smaller glial ELVs and reduced axon regeneration. Together, these data suggest that the wound healing and
autophagic pathways are important for glial ELV production and axon regeneration. As previous work in exophers
revealed modes of stress recovery, understanding the origins of fly glial ELVs could uncover novel mechanisms
of glial recovery from the stress of axotomy, likely necessary for glia to facilitate axon regeneration. This
proposal aims to define the origins of this novel glial ELV response and its effects on axon regeneration.
 Aim1 of this proposal will identify the cell responsible for autophagy-mediated glial ELV release and axon
regeneration by utilizing glial- and neuronal-specific RNAi knock-downs. Furthermore, Aim1 will use electron
microscopy and fluorescent reporters to determine if ELVs isolate stressed mitochondria, akin to exophers, in an
autophagy-dependent manner. Aim 2 of this proposal will identify the cell-responsible for wound-healing
mediated axon regeneration, interactions between wound-healing and autophagic pathways, and effects of the
wound-healing pathway and extrinsic signals on glial ELV release. This will be achieved via glial- and neuronal-
specific RNAi knock-down constructs for components of the wound healing pathway, antibody staining for wound
healing components, and a genetic system to simulate axotomy without physical injury. This proposal will uncover
novel mechanisms of glial recovery and glial facilitation of axon regeneration. These studies may help inform
and improve methods to drive human axon regeneration in the CNS and PNS, aligning with the mission of
NINDS. With the expertise of the Song lab and my postdoctoral advisory team, I will gain a comprehensive
understanding of the relevant cell biology fields and necessary technical skills, uniquely positioning me to tackle
my scientific proposal. I will expand these projects in my own research group as an independent investigator."

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has emerged as a critically important and tractable non-human
primate (NHP) model for neuroscience research accommodating genetic manipulation and directed breeding.
Several barriers to the adoption of marmoset models by the neuroscience community exist, including a small
census size in the United States (fewer than 2,500 animals), poor communication about resource availability, a
poor understanding of the strengths and limitations of marmosets in research, and a lack of a formal structure
for coordinating the sharing of information and resources related to marmoset research.
In this application, we propose to establish a Marmoset Coordinating Center (MCC) as part of the NIH Brain
Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative that will address these limitations
by building upon our experience in NHP informatics and marmoset research. As the foundation for the MCC, we
will build a new informatics framework for coordinating marmoset research based on the LabKey data
management system. This infrastructure will be derived from the existing LabKey system in place at multiple
National Primate Research Centers, and which has been optimized for NHP research, including marmosets,
over years of production. This informatics system will be initialized with basic statistics on the marmoset
laboratory populations provided by participating centers, making pre-recorded, individual-level information that
is already recorded more broadly available to the neuroscience community. Demographic and genetic
information will be shared and discussed among participating centers, to coordinate marmoset colony
management in line with American Zoological Association practice guidelines.
Once operational, the MCC will be comprised of two parts: 1) a web-based portal to provide access to the
marmoset data resources stored in LabKey, as well as background content on marmoset biology and
neuroscience; 2) a concierge comprised of MCC staff and augmented by a scientific advisory board of marmoset
neuroscience experts. The website will provide summaries of existing marmoset neuroscience projects, and
allow interested investigators to search animal inventory and request animals. The concierge will be available to
answer basic questions about the Center and the use of marmosets in neuroscience. Together, the data and
human resources of the MCC will provide an essential portal into marmoset neuroscience research through
collaboration, service agreement, or animal transfer."

Leveraging neuroinflammation to improve treatment outcomes for patients with glioblastoma is challenging
because the hypoxic tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), mostly comprised of immuno-suppressive
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), remains incompletely quantified and therapeutically modulated. The
long-term goal is to accelerate the development of clinically meaningful imaging technologies as a way to
advance therapeutic approaches for patients with deadly brain malignancies. The overall objective in this
application is to use novel iron nanoparticle enhanced 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET/MRI derived Segregation
and Extravascular Localization of Ferumoxytol Imaging (SELFI) hypoxic fraction to quantitatively determine
how hypoxia and TAM based neuroinflammation relate to treatment sensitivity. The central hypothesis is that
therapeutic modulation of TAMs, as monitored by SELFI Hypoxic Fraction, ameliorates hypoxic TIME
immunosuppression leading to improved treatment outcomes. The rationale for the proposed research is that
quantitative elucidation of how the hypoxic TIME relates to treatment outcomes is likely to provide a strong
scientific framework whereby new TAM based therapeutic strategies can be developed. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define a biologically specific imaging measure of the immuno-
suppressive hypoxic TIME; and 2) Determine the effect of TAM modulators on the TIME of glioblastoma. Under
the first aim, SELFI hypoxic fraction will be optimized and biologically validated in a cohort of 27 patients with
IDH wild type glioblastoma needing surgical intervention for the diagnosis of treatment outcome. Additionally,
the diagnostic and prognostic performance will be determined through longitudinal assessment of the hypoxic
TIME in a prospective phase II clinical trial of 50 adult patients with newly diagnosed IDH wild type
glioblastoma scheduled for standard therapy. For the second aim, syngeneic and patient derived xenograft
intracerebral glioblastoma rodent models will be used to determine the cytotoxicity and neuroinflammatory
capability of concurrent TAM modulation and activation. Additionally, the TIME alterations responsible for
treatment efficacy will be defined. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's
opinion, because the SELFI hypoxic fraction is likely to provide a new method for quantifying treatment
outcomes. This capability is likely to directly monitor biological features of efficacious therapeutic TAM
modulation. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve upon standard gadolinium-
enhanced MRI and provide strong evidence-based proof of principle for further development and clinical trials
of therapeutically induced TAM based neuroinflammation. We foresee future clinical trials using the SELFI
Hypoxic Fraction to specifically monitor the neuroinflammatory effects of novel immunotherapeutic techniques."

Axons form connections between neurons over great distances in the brain and body, hence are vulnerable to
damage and stress. This project studies an evolutionarily conserved stress response pathway that becomes
activated in multiple scenarios of axonal damage and stress. The pathway, governed by the dileucine zipper
kinase DLK, known as Wallenda (Wnd) in Drosophila, engages structural plasticity mechanisms in neurons
that allow circuits to adapt to axon damage. These responses include axonal regeneration, neuronal death,
and, newly discovered in this project, synapse loss. The long-term goals of this project are (1) to understand
the mechanisms that lead to DLK signaling activation, and (2) to understand the cellular pathways that are
regulated by DLK. The project combines studies in both Drosophila and mice, focusing on motoneuron (MN)
responses to peripheral nerve injury (PNI). For the first goal, Aim 1 tests a hypothesis that DLK/Wnd signaling
is restrained by the presence of an intact synaptic connection, hence becomes activated following synapse
loss. The experiments build upon observations in complementary paradigms of synapse loss at Drosophila
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse: (a) injuries to branched axons demonstrate that only complete
removal of all efferent connections are capable of activating Wnd signaling; (b) multiple cytoskeletal mutations
that lead to retraction and degeneration of NMJ synapses also lead to Wnd signaling activation. The proposed
experiments will distinguish how synaptic interactions intersect with the process of axonal transport to control
the activation of Wnd. Aim 2 studies the downstream responses regulated by DLK that enable structural
plasticity, and focuses on new phenotypes for DLK in the mouse spinal cord: the loss of synaptic inputs on the
cell bodies of axotomized MNs (termed `synaptic stripping') is dependent upon DLK function in MNs. In
addition, the recruitment of activated microglia to the MN cell body, which precedes the synapse loss, requires
DLK function in axotomized MNs. Aim 2 will test a hypothesis that DLK signaling gates the secretion of
molecular signals that recruit specific responses in microglia to facilitate synapse loss. The experiments will
evaluate the requirement of candidate secreted and immune molecules that were identified from a RiboTag
translational profiling approach to be strong targets of DLK regulation in axotomized MNs. The experiments will
also identify the microglial responses gated by DLK in axotomized MNs through single cell RNA-seq of isolated
microglia. Taken together, this work is expected to shed new light on neuron-microglial interactions relevant to
nervous system injury, and mechanisms structural plasticity and synapse loss through the specific lens of a
specific axonal damage signaling pathway."

Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is a granulomatous vasculitis of the aorta and its major branch vessels that
causes blindness, stroke and aortic aneurysm and serves as an informative model system of immune-mediated
vaso-occlusive disease. Previous work supported by this award has implicated the spontaneous failure of the
PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in driving excessive T cell immunity that manifests as autoimmune disease of
the three-layered large elastic arteries.
Recent work has extended the immune checkpoint deficiencies in GCA patients to the inhibitory CD155/CD96
checkpoint, raising the intriguing possibility that a common abnormality in inhibitory signaling unleashes
autoimmunity in blood vessels. We found that macrophages (Mφ) from GCA patients lacked surface expression
of the inhibitory checkpoint ligands CD155 and PD-L1, enabling the unopposed expansion of pathogenic CD4+
T cells. Lack of negative signals delivered by CD155low Mφ licensed CD4+CD96+ T cells to become tissue
invasive and differentiate into IL-9 producing effector cells. Gain-of function and loss-of-function experiments
identified IL9 as a key regulator in vessel wall inflammation, linking the breach of self-tolerance to the CD155-
CD96-IL9 pathway. In subcellular mapping studies of GCA Mφ, the CD155 and PD-L1 protein were retained on
the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER stress induced retention of the ligands, providing
important clues towards the underlying molecular abnormalities. These data strongly support a “lost inhibition
model” as the core abnormality in GCA.
Here, we propose that GCA is a syndrome of immune checkpoint failure, and that vascular inflammation
is a result of insufficient containment of antigen-reactive immune responses. Our data assign the
primary defect to antigen-presenting cells which retain inhibitory checkpoint ligands in the ER.
Unrestrained CD4+ T cells invade the vessel wall and misdifferentiate into vasculitogenic effector cells.
To pursue this hypothesis, we will define molecular and functional abnormalities in CD155low PD-L1low Mφ;
investigate the impact of ER stress on the Mφ transcriptome and proteome and map the molecular defects
causing disruption of CD155 intracellular trafficking (Aim 1). Aim 2 will examine the impact of CD155low PD-
L1low Mφ on T cell differentiation and functional commitment. Specifically, we will identify CD4+ T cell populations
that escape from containment in the absence of CD155 and PD-L1 signaling, define their phenotypic and
functional specification through CITE-Seq and examine their disease relevance in the human artery-NSG model
system of GCA. This proposal aims to leverage understanding of inhibitory immune checkpoints to build new
paradigms for the diagnosis and therapy of autoimmune vascular inflammation."

 The mechanisms underlying how rewards are learned, and how they translate into behavior have been
a subject of interest to researchers and scientists since Pavlov’s classical conditioning experiments in the
1890s. Recently, Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) have
emerged as key modulators of reward learning, and potential therapeutic targets for addressing addiction,
depression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown that GABA neurons in the VTA
undergo a form of experience-dependent plasticity that involves the downregulation of the anion transporter,
KCC2. This reduction of KCC2 levels has been found to increase the excitability of GABA neurons by
decreasing the efficacy of GABAA receptor function. In the context of drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, this
mechanism has been studied in great detail. For instance, exposure to nicotine and stress has shown to
induce KCC2 downregulation in the VTA, which in turn, enhances the formation of reward-seeking behaviors.
The impact of this mechanism on specific reward-related pathways and its contribution to naturalistic reward
learning, however, remains unknown.
 To investigate this matter, I propose to characterize the expression of KCC2 throughout the course of
cue-reward associative learning, and determine whether its downregulation is limited to a specific circuit (Aim
1). My preliminary evidence demonstrates that KCC2 downregulation shifts lateral VTA GABA neurons towards
excitability at critical time points during reward learning. More precisely, KCC2 downregulation transiently
impacts inhibitory inputs to lateral projecting VTA DA neurons, which are known to play a significant role in
reward learning. Subsequently, I seek to understand how a collection of inhibitory neurons undergoing this form
of synaptic plasticity can influence the lateral VTA at the network level (Aim 2). To this end, I will combine
multi-unit tetrode recordings with pharmacological and genetic approaches to examine neural network activity
during reward learning. My preliminary data shows that KCC2-mediated plasticity drives increased
synchronized activity between VTA GABA neurons.
 This multidisciplinary proposal will investigate whether circuit-specific modifications in KCC2 serve as
an innate mechanism during reward learning that allows the brain to establish enduring associations between
contextual cues and appetitive stimuli. The findings from this proposal will guide new therapeutic avenues for
neuropsychiatric disorders with deficits in reward learning."

Code-switching (alternation between language in a single utterance) is a common phenomenon observed
among bilingual children with typical and atypical language, including children with developmental language
disorder (DLD). Code-switching requires the speaker to integrate morphosyntactic features in both languages;
therefore, language proficiency and social factors are important factors to consider when analyzing code-
switching patterns. Current research on code-switching in children with DLD is limited by methodological
issues, including problems with coding approaches, elicitation tasks, and accounting for children's language
development. To address these issues, this proposed study will use a comprehensive coding method and a
conversational elicitation task to examine code-switching patterns in bilingual children with and without DLD.
The study will consider two perspectives, linguistic and sociolinguistic, to understand how language ability
interacts with this phenomenon. The study will involve a Diapix task with three different interlocutors (English-
only, Spanish-only, and bilingual Spanish-English). The conversations will be recorded, transcribed, and
coded. This study aligns with the National Institute of Health's (NIH) vision and mission statement of seeking
fundamental knowledge to advance diagnostic practices for clinicians working with bilingual Spanish-English
speaking children globally. Ultimately, this project aims to provide essential and innovative research in the area
of bilingual language disorder, while also training a promising new investigator in ethical, methodological, and
substantive research practices."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent and debilitating, and development of improved treatments is limited
in part by insufficient understanding of the mechanism of disease remission. In turn, efforts to elucidate
mechanisms have been challenging due to disease heterogeneity and limited effectiveness of treatments, which
require weeks-to-months to induce remission. In this application, we propose to focus on applying a novel
neurostimulation strategy to participants with TRD. We recently developed a form of repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation that induces remission in 90% of individuals with severe, treatment resistant MDD in 1-5
days which we called Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT). This methodology
provides a new tool to begin exploring the network-level mechanisms of MDD remission. Following SAINT, fc
significantly decreases default mode network (DMN)-subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC) which is correlated
with change in clinical scales. In this application, we propose to target the L-DLPFC-sgACC target with active
(n=50) versus sham (n=50) SAINT and determine if active SAINT (Aim 1) attenuates sgACC-DMN connectivity
and (Aim 2) significantly reduces symptoms of depression. Decreases in fc may underlie reductions in
depression; thus, we will relate reductions in these potential moderators to identify the best symptom targets.
Completion of this proposal will further establish a safe, effective, and non-invasive device-based treatment for
TRD along with the iterative neural circuitry changes at each daily dose of stimulation that summate to produce
the clinical effect."

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a major public health concern, causing chronic symptoms in significant
numbers of people, and increasing the risk for adverse long-term health outcomes. Prognostic models for
predicting recovery following SRC are limited, and identifying potential modifiable factors is critical for
understanding mechanism and ultimately personalizing treatment. One such potential factor is cytomegalovirus
(CMV), a common neurotropic herpesvirus, that is reactivated by inflammation and has been implicated as a
pathological co-factor in multiple inflammatory diseases. Given that SRC results in an acute inflammatory
response, this application proposes to investigate the role of CMV in the physiological and clinical outcomes
following SRC. To ensure a well-powered and rigorous assessment of our hypotheses, we propose leveraging
an existing cohort of athletes enrolled in the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE)
Consortium. Participants (191 athletes with SRC, 151 contact controls, and 155 non-contact controls)
previously completed MRI scans, clinical assessments, and blood draws at baseline (pre-injury), 24 hours
post-injury, when asymptomatic, and 7 days following unrestricted return to play. Through these baseline and
follow-up assessments of brain structure and function, blood-based biomarkers, and clinical phenotypes this
study aims to test the hypothesis that CMV serostatus moderates SRC outcomes. The major outcomes include
microstructural changes on diffusion MRI, cortical thickness, and resting state functional connectivity (Aim 1),
circulating measures of neural injury and inflammation (Aim 2), and severity and duration of post-injury
symptoms and cognitive performance (Aim 3). Additionally, the study will use multivariate biclustering to
identify subgroups of participants with distinct physiological and clinical trajectories (exploratory Aim 4). Within
each aim, the study will also explore the role of two additional common, neurotropic herpesviruses, i.e., herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), which have recently been implicated in Alzheimer’s
disease and multiple sclerosis, respectively. The information gathered from this research will advance our
understanding of the complex biopsychosocial forces shaping response to and recovery from SRC, potentially
improving the precision medicine approach to the assessment and management of patients with SRC and
opening a new avenue of treatment given the existence of well-tolerated anti-CMV medications."

CRISPRs (Clustered, Regularly, Interspersed, Palindromic Repeats) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas)
are essential components of adaptive immune systems in bacteria and archaea that provide sequence-specific
protection from viruses and other genetic parasites. CRISPR systems are phylogenetically and functionally
diverse. Most of the work on CRISPR systems has focused on a subset of systems that function as RNA-
guided endonucleases that exclusively bind and cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). In all CRISPR
subtypes, this RNA guide is derived from the CRISPR loci transcripts and serves as a genetic memory of past
infections. The work in this application focuses on determining the structure and function of a unique type III
CRISPR system that includes Cas genes that contain domain fusions bearing strong homology to known toxins
(HEPN and RelE) and an antitoxin (MntA). Unlike most CRISPR systems, that target DNA, type III CRISPR
systems are unique in their utilization of multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complexes to bind and destroy RNA
that is complementary to the CRISPR-RNA guide. In addition to targeting RNA, type III CRISPR systems
encode a specialized surveillance complex subunit called Cas10. Target recognition by type III triggers
polymerase-cyclase activity in the palm domain of the Cas10 subunit which amplifies the immune response by
selectively converting ≈4,000 ATP molecules into cyclic oligoadenylates that function as immune signaling
molecules. Using computational methods, the Wiedenheft lab has recently identified a unique subclass of type
III-B CRISPRs distributed across three phyla. These type III-B systems have co-opted elements of toxin-
antitoxin systems and the immune cassette includes an additional toxin that I predict is regulated by cyclic
oligoadenylate signaling. I hypothesize that these type III-B CRISPR-toxin-antitoxin defense systems rely
on CRISPR RNA-guided recognition of invading RNA to activate a multipronged cell death response. In
Aim 1, I will use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of the type III-B surveillance complexes in
various states of activation. These structures will provide critical mechanistic insight that explains how different
elements of the immune response are regulated by the effector complex. In Aim2, I will determine the
mechanisms by which specialized toxins stall viral infections via a CRISPR-controlled collapse of translation.
Collectively, these experiments and the associated training objectives outlined in this application will clarify
CRISPR-mediated mechanisms that regulate cell death in response to viral infection."

 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, multisystem disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes the CFTR epithelial anion channel. CFTR
works in balance with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) to maintain hydration of the airway surface.
Perturbations of this system in CF result in dehydrated airway mucus, defective mucociliary clearance, and lung
infection that accounts for the majority of CF morbidity and mortality. Recently approved CFTR-modulator drugs
have revolutionized the treatment of people with CF who have the most common pathogenic CFTR variants.
However, approximately 10% of people with CF have class I CFTR variants, including variants caused by
premature termination codons (PTCs), which result in no CFTR mRNA or protein. These people with CF are
ineligible for CFTR modulators. There is an unmet need for innovative therapies to treat these individuals.
 The recently developed thalidomide derivative CC-90009 is a small-molecule drug currently in Phase 1
clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia. Studies in our lab demonstrated that CC-90009 both rescues class I
CFTR PTC variants and unexpectedly also reduces ENaC activity in primary human airway epithelial cells. These
promising dual effects are predicted to help restore mucus hydration and improve mucociliary clearance in CF.
However, much remains unknown about CC-90009, including whether it restores pathologically decreased PTC-
CFTR airway surface layer height and mucus hydration in CF, the mechanism by which it reduces ENaC activity,
and its effects in animal models of CF. Given these knowledge gaps, the specific aims for this proposal are to:
 1) Interrogate the functional consequences and mechanism of CC-90009’s impact on ENaC activity
 2) Evaluate CC-90009’s effects in animal models of CF to gauge its potential translational utility
 Completing these aims with guidance from my scientific and medical mentors in UNC’s Marsico Lung
Institute will provide a rich opportunity to master a suite of innovative basic and translational biomedical research
techniques. Collectively, this work will position me for a career as a physician-scientist invested in better
understanding respiratory cell biology and disease. The results will also further our understanding of the
therapeutic potential of thalidomide-derivative drugs and therapies directed at novel molecular pathways to treat

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common dementia, currently affects ~6.7 million individuals in the U.S. alone
and is expected to grow to 13 million by the year 2050. A major component of its devastation is the progressive
loss of the patient’s ability to form memories. Treatments for rescuing memory function in AD patients do not
exist, due in part to insufficient research performed to characterize the activity of memory-supporting neural
circuits compromised by the disease. The effort to develop memory-restorative therapeutics that intervene in
neural circuits requires investigation of which circuit-level functions are impacted during pathophysiological
progression, and how they relate to memory performance. Neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) act as a gateway
for sensory inputs feeding into the hippocampus. This EC-hippocampus circuit is critical for memory formation
and retrieval. Inside the EC, the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is a primary site of atrophy and activity loss in the
early phases of AD. Despite its significance to AD pathophysiology, it remains unclear what type of activity is
lost in the LEC of AD patients or animal models. Our laboratory’s pioneering previous research has developed
exciting preliminary results that suggest a path forward. We have found in healthy rats that LEC neurons develop
reward-associated spike representations during associative learning. Recently, using optogenetic circuit
analyses, we found in healthy wild type (WT) mice that (i) LEC layer 2a neurons categorize rewarded vs.
unrewarded sensory cues when mice are performing associative learning, and (ii) this categorization activity is
facilitated by dopamine inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LEC. Our overall hypothesis is that
dysfunction of LEC neuronal activity for memory encoding causes associative memory impairment in APP knock-
in mice. To test this hypothesis, we will (Aim 1) determine cell types that show activity dysfunction in the LEC,
(Aim 2) determine if dysfunction of LEC dopamine causes associative memory impairment, and (Aim 3)
determine if LEC 20-40Hz oscillation deficit underlies associative memory impairment. The project is expected
to yield advances toward the development of therapeutics to rescue memory function in the LEC."

 Rural counties, particularly in Appalachia, are battling fast-growing outbreaks of HIV and have been
labeled by the CDC as vulnerable to growing transmission rates due to widespread injection drug use. One of
the most promising mechanisms for reducing HIV transmission in these communities is the use of
buprenorphine, which treats opioid use disorder and also reduces behaviors that increase HIV risk. Despite the
potential benefit of buprenorphine, health care professionals (HCPs) in rural areas of the United States are
much less likely to have received the training and federal waiver necessary to prescribe this medication.
Stigma toward patients who use drugs is an accepted barrier to substance use treatment, but it also impacts
health care professionals, especially rural primary care prescribers such as physicians, nurse practitioners, and
physicians assistants who are on the front lines of the opioid crisis. We have shown in previous studies that
stigma is a primary reason why fewer rural health care professionals are willing to work with patients with OUD.
Stigma and negative attitudes toward patients with OUD, fortunately, are modifiable but require training
interventions that are both effective and feasible to implement in rural practice settings. Previous interventions
have been used with health care professionals successfully to reduce stigma, but they have not been tailored
for medications for opioid use, such as buprenorphine, or for the rural primary care setting. We propose to
adapt an existing brief stigma-reduction training intervention to the rural primary care setting to increase
buprenorphine prescribing and implement a randomized, pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability
among rural primary care providers. Our specific aims are to: 1) Examine HCP knowledge and attitudes about
OUD to understand their reluctance to prescribe MOUD and manage patients with OUD. 2) Develop a
prototype narrative-based stigma reduction intervention and tailor it to the rural primary care setting using HCP
feedback and 3) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a stigma-reduction intervention in a pilot study in a
diverse group of rural HCPs across 6 primary care clinics. The primary pilot trial outcomes are feasibility,
acceptability, appropriateness, and adoption, measured among a cohort of HCPs who do not currently
prescribe buprenorphine at full capacity. We will also measure additional stigma outcomes such as attitudes
towards patients with OUD and harm reduction. We will use in-depth interviews to further assess perceptions
of the intervention and finalize it for use in a follow-up cluster randomized controlled trial. This developmental
trial will produce a brief stigma reduction training intervention that is acceptable and feasible to implement in
rural primary care clinics. The long-term goal is to establish a brief stigma-reduction training intervention that is
modifiable for different practice settings and effective at increasing buprenorphine prescribing in underserved
communities."
10864047,"Project Summary
 Lung cancer is a devastating disease that remains the top cause of cancer mortality. Despite recent
advances, the majority of patients with lung cancer lack effective therapeutic options, underscoring the dire need
for additional treatment approaches. Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in subunits of the
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex including SMARCA4 and ARID1A in non-small cell lung cancer with a
frequency of up to 33% in advanced stage disease, making it the most frequently mutated complex in lung
cancer. We recently demonstrated that Smarca4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor in mice and cooperates
with p53 loss and Kras activation. Importantly, SMARCA4 mutant cancer cells have heightened sensitivity to
inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by a novel small molecule, IACS-10759. Mechanistically, we
showed that SMARCA4-deficient cells have a blunted transcriptional response to energy stress creating a
therapeutically relevant vulnerability.
 Taking these observations together, we hypothesize that OXPHOS inhibition using IACS-10759 is an
attractive therapeutic strategy for lung cancers with mutations in the SWI/SNF complex. The major objectives of
the proposed study are to discover the mechanistic basis of the metabolic rewiring in SWI/SNF mutants and
provide preclinical evidence to guide future clinical study of IACS-10759 in patients with SWI/SNF mutant lung
cancer. Due to the unique microenvironment of lung cancer including high local oxygen tension, it is imperative
to study therapeutic agents targeting metabolism orthotopically. Hence, we will test efficacy of IACS-10759 in
GEM models of lung cancer. Further, PDX models have emerged as powerful tools to help guide treatment
strategies. Thus, we propose to determine the potential of OXPHOS inhibition in various SWI/SNF mutant PDX
model systems. While our preliminary data indicates that IACS-10759 treatment leads to tumor growth inhibition,
synergistic combination strategies are expected to be even superior in efficacy. Thus, we propose to identify
optimal combination agents that synergize with IACS-10759 by using a chemo-genetic screen. Here, we will use
CRISPR-Cas9 and a custom designed library of guide RNAs against genes targeted by FDA approved drugs
(FDAome). We will validate the results of the screen by performing one-on-one drug combination studies in vivo.
Finally, our preliminary data suggests that SMARCA2 is required for expression of PGC1α, a master
transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS, in SMARCA4 mutant cells. We know from
our published work that PGC1α is essential in SMARCA4 deficient cells. Thus we hypothesize that SMARCA2
is a survival factor and a major driver of metabolic rewiring in SMARCA4 deficient cells in a PGC1α dependent
manner. In conclusion, our study is expected to provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic dysregulation of
SWI/SNF mutant lung cancers and lay the foundation for future clinical development of the OXPHOS inhibitors
as therapeutics."
10922872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are at high risk for poor psychosocial and quality of life outcomes.
One way cancer may confer risk is through compromising social support, a robust predictor of psychosocial wellbeing.
AYAs highly value support from family, friends, and other AYA patients. However, many AYAs with cancer feel
isolated and report that their relationships are strained during their treatment, resulting in long term social support
deficiencies. Despite established demand, few programs targeting AYA social support needs exist. Those that do
lack theoretical bases or developmental tailoring. The current study uses a novel approach to address these
needs by adapting an evidence-based, multicomponent supportive care program to target social relationship
coping efficacy (SRCE). Defined as one’s perceived ability to maintain or enhance close relationships in the
context of illness, SRCE is a new construct with a strong theoretical basis that is well aligned with AYAs’
developmental needs. Bolstering SRCE will enable AYAs to manage cancer-related relational challenges and
seek and maintain supportive relationships, thereby buffering the negative impact of cancer on perceived
support. Moreover, targeting SRCE within the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) program, a
skill based AYA resilience intervention with a history of successful adaptation, will enable the success of this
work and potential for later dissemination. Building on preliminary data and following the Obesity-Related
Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for behavioral intervention development, the first phase of this study
(K99, 2 years) aims to refine the PRISM+SRCE adaptation. Specifically, the goals of this phase are to (1)
iteratively refine SRCE component content using AYA (n≥12) stakeholder feedback; (2) refine practical aspects
of the combined PRISM+SRCE program including delivery, training, and fidelity monitoring using AYA (n=15)
and PRISM interventionist (n=3) stakeholder feedback; and (3) develop a final intervention manual and delivery
protocol. Additionally, K99 activities will provide applied opportunities to complement the learning goals of a
promising early career behavioral scientist, including developing expertise in qualitative research methods and
training in conceptual and practical aspects of clinical trial design and conduct. The second, independent phase
of this study (R00, 3 years) aims to establish proof-of-concept of this adaptation. Through a two-site randomized-
controlled trial of N=100 AYAs newly diagnosed with cancer, the goals of this phase are to (1) establish feasibility
and acceptability of the PRISM+SRCE program; and, (2) explore whether PRISM+SRCE improves psychosocial
outcomes compared to usual care. Findings from this study will critically inform a subsequent (R01-funded)
Phase III efficacy trial of this adaptation. This project fulfills the objectives of RFA-CA-20-057 in the Cancer
Control Science area by aiming to enhance an applied behavioral intervention to improve AYA quality of life. If
successful, this adaptation will both improve AYA social outcomes and bolster the overall impact of the PRISM
program, thus creating a promising paradigm for comprehensively addressing AYA psychosocial needs."

Spinal cord injuries (SCI) disrupt the communication pathways in the spinal cord, leading to paralysis, primarily
affecting the corticospinal tract (CST) responsible for voluntary movements. Unfortunately, damaged CST
axons have limited regrowth capacity due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Efforts to address intrinsic factors
have focused on targeting proteins like PTEN, which inhibits neuronal growth. In addition, there has been a
focus on targeting extrinsic molecules such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) through
chondroitiase ABC (chABC) digestion, which hinder axon growth. Despite progress in individually targeting
these factors, overall growth remains limited, posing a significant challenge. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-
based delivery of growth-promoting molecules has shown promise, but permanent expression can have off-
target effects. Our recent findings demonstrated that permanent AAV-driven PTEN deletion resulted in
significant functional recovery after SCI, albeit with pathophysiology at 2 months post-SCI.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective therapeutic strategies for SCI by evaluating controlled
PTEN deletion and CSPGs degradation in promoting axon regeneration and functional recovery. The following
three specific aims are proposed: 1) Temporal evaluation of PTEN knockdown after SCI without development
of pathophysiologies; 2) Determine the role of CST in PTEN-deletion induced recovery of function; 3) Examine
the role of CSPGs in growth impairment of PTEN deleted axons. For the first aim, our approach involves
regulating PTEN deletion using a regulatory system within our AAVs. This system enables the activation of
PTEN deletion in the presence of an inducer drug, enabling us to pinpoint the crucial temporal window for CST
regeneration while avoiding the development of pathophysiologies. In the second aim, our approach is to
interrupt PTEN-deleted CSTs to assess the extent to which CST regeneration contributes to the observed
recovery of function in PTEN-deleted mice after SCI. Lastly, for the third aim, our approach entails testing
whether CSPGs are the main impediment for the growth of PTEN-deleted axons by temporally regulating the
digestion of CSPGs using chondroitinase ABC (chABC). The proposed studies are innovative as they aim to
determine the optimal timing for PTEN deletion to maximize regeneration while avoiding adverse effects,
investigate the mechanistic link between PTEN deletion in the CST and functional recovery, and examine the
role of CSPGs in inhibiting axonal growth of PTEN-deleted axons. This project is significant as it addresses the
critical challenge of limited axon regeneration following spinal cord injury and seeks to identify effective
strategies for promoting functional recovery. The completion of the proposed research will establish new
knowledge and approaches to enhance axon regeneration and improve outcomes for individuals with SCI."
10837382,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends algorithms to implement ART regimens, to monitor efficacy
by viral load (VL) testing, and for overall HIV management of people living with HIV (PLH). In many locations,
this means infrequent VL testing (e.g., annually), and elevated VL typically results in counseling and retesting
after several months. Persistent high VL may qualify PLH for drug resistance (DR) testing to differentiate between
adherence problems and HIVDR (e.g., in South Africa, eligible for DR testing only after 2 years of failure). This
approach can lead to long periods when viremic PLH can spread HIV that could also have DR. DTG-based
therapies are a breakthrough in treatment, with low cost and high barrier to resistance, however real-world
studies have begun to find emerging DTG resistance. Infrequent VL testing, and delayed or inaccessible DR
testing, greatly increase the opportunity to spread DR HIV, which could undermine the effectiveness and
longevity of DTG-based therapies. To address this gap, WHO is drafting a Target Product Profile (TPP) that calls
for a test that can “determine the need to switch ART (i.e., distinguish between lack of DR suggesting non-
adherence, and presence of DR as the reason for treatment failure)”. Such a test should prevent unnecessary
switching of patients with treatment failure due to adherence and prevent prolonged viremia in people with DR.
To address this need we plan to develop the following:
Aim 1: Rapid, low-cost HIV RNA isolation from a large volume of whole blood.
Aim 2: Rapid, low-cost HIV viral load test.
Aim 3: Rapid, low-cost reflex point-mutation test for HIV drug resistance.
Aim 4: Simplified library preparation for efficient semi-centralized nanopore sequencing."

The UC Irvine Vision Science Training Program (VSTP) is specifically designed to train PhD and MD/PhD
candidates who will advance research on the causes, diagnosis, progression and treatment of human visual
impairments. The goals of this multidisciplinary, inter-departmental training program are to (i) provide high
quality research training in basic sciences disciplines that are relevant to vision research and (ii) provide
opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborative and translational research so that our trainees can skillfully
function in an interactive research environment and draw clinical correlates from their basic findings. A strength
of our program will be that all trainees will receive mentoring that is both discipline-specific, i.e. departmental
and thematic, i.e. within and across four broad visual sciences areas that encompass the VSTP; (a) Anterior
segment and ocular surface, (b) Metabolism & visual processing, (c) Retina and retinal diseases, and (d) Lens.
Through our program’s progressive design, trainees will first participate in didactic training to establish a strong
foundation in cell and molecular biology, followed by additional didactic training in the biochemistry and
molecular biology of all major components of the eye and visual processing. They will then acquire advanced
understanding in an area of specialization via advanced courses and thesis research, which are organized
according to the four research themes described above. The VSTP leverages UC Irvine’s robust vision science
community, bringing together an outstanding group of clinicians and scientists with strong track records of
vision research and mentoring. By leveraging these strengths, the VSTP is uniquely poised to produce vision
scientists that can creatively apply contemporary research approaches toward understanding problems in
vision and ophthalmology."

10862047,"Background: In the modern era of drug development, drug manufacturers are regularly introducing novel
medications that require a wide range of resources that may increase the burden for Veterans seeking care.
The VHA must consider how to provide high-quality care in the context of competing resources, the
incremental benefit of novel medications over established treatments, and the needs of Veterans. There is a
critical need and opportunity to optimize treatment with established medications to maximize their benefit and
provide high-quality care considering competing VHA resources and Veterans’ needs. Significance: This
challenge is exemplified in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a costly and debilitating lifelong
disease with rising resource needs. IBD represents an ideal proof-of-concept and real-world example on which
to conduct research to address: 1. Patient-centered treatment optimization by putting VA Data to Work for
Veterans using novel AI/ML methods, 2. Pre-implementation strategies for adoption, and 3. Optimal
approaches to healthcare utilization (e.g., access to care) using the VA as a Learning Healthcare System–All
of which are VA HSR&D Priorities, updated 3/2023. Innovation & Impact: IBD consists of Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis (UC) and affects nearly 3 million Americans and ~80,000 Veterans. This study addresses
several key gaps in the care of Veterans with IBD by: Adapting and validating prediction models for optimizing
thiopurines; Assessing the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine
Learning (ML)-enabled decision-support systems (AEDS) for thiopurine optimization in the VHA; and
Evaluating the impact of an AEDS-optimized thiopurine treatment policy on clinical outcomes. Ultimately, an
AEDS for thiopurine optimization in Veterans will provide a pragmatic and objective guide for providers to
choose to continue, stop, or modify the course of an IBD therapy to produce optimal outcomes while
maximizing resources in IBD. Specific Aims: Using learning health system framework, we will: Aim 1: Adapt
and validate AI/ML-based models to predict inadequate immunosuppression in Veterans with IBD using real-
world data from the VHA EHR (Data-to-Knowledge). Aim 2: Assess the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of
AEDS for thiopurine optimization in Veterans with IBD (Knowledge-to-Practice). Aim 3: To evaluate an AEDS-
based treatment policy vs. usual care on clinical outcomes (Practice-to-Data). Methodology: In Aim 1, we will
retrospectively identify all Veterans with a diagnosis of IBD on thiopurines in the last 10 years from the VHA
Corporate Data Warehouse. We will adapt and externally validate our previous model among Veterans with
moderate-severe UC on thiopurine monotherapy and internally validate a new model for Veterans with IBD on
combination therapy (thiopurines + anti-TNF biologics). We will use AI/ML-based techniques to assess the
performance characteristics of these models and leverage statistical techniques to address imprecise
measurements in the outcome. In Aim 2, we will elicit behavioral, technological, and systems facilitators and
barriers to successful implementation of AEDS via semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (e.g.,
Veterans, providers, facility leadership, Community Veterans Engagement Board members) using the Unified
Theory of User Acceptance. Findings will be fed back to key health system stakeholders. In Aim 3, we will use
reinforcement learning in an off-policy evaluation comparing an AEDS-based treatment policy vs. usual care on
risk of non-remission and subsequent clinical outcomes (IBD-related steroid use, hospitalizations, surgeries) in
Veterans. Next Steps/Implementation: This study is necessary to develop appropriate pragmatic trials that
inform IBD treatment guidelines and increase adoption of AEDS-guided thiopurine optimization in the VHA. As
a next step, we will apply for an IIR to deploy a prospective pragmatic trial evaluating the effectiveness of
AEDS-guided medication optimization vs. traditional approaches. Ultimately, this work will serve as a template
for positioning AEDS strategies at the point of care to improve health outcomes and access for Veterans."
10863894,"Culture and amplification-free bacterial sepsis diagnosis
Summary
Sepsis is a life-threatening complication of an infection that requires immediate treatment. The identification of
the causative microorganism utilizing processes based on blood culture is a keystone of sepsis diagnosis.
However, blood culture takes one to five days to provide results. Here, we propose the development of a culture
and amplification-free assay to detect and identify bacteria in one hour directly on whole blood. The new assay
will enable physicians to provide therapy targeting the causative organism days earlier than the current
standards.
The new assay will be based on Single MOLecule Tethering (SMOLT), a novel sample preparation and
amplification-free molecular detection method developed at Scanogen. The work proposed in this application
will build on the achievements of an ongoing project aimed at developing an assay to detect fungi in whole blood.
The SMOLT-Bacteria assay proposed in this application will identify the species, genus or order of the causative
organism in approximately 90% of bloodstream infections. The new system will be easy-to-use, fully automated,
and capable of rapid detection in whole blood without blood culture. Despite the urgent clinical need, there is
only one FDA approved culture-free molecular assay for sepsis diagnosis. In comparison to this test, the SMOLT-
Bacteria assay will be 4 times faster, 6 times less expensive, and thanks to its higher multiplexing capability, it
will detect and identify the causative pathogen in twice the number of patients.
In our preliminary results, we developed a multiplex assay capable of detecting bacteria directly in whole blood.
We demonstrated that the assay is highly specific and sensitive with a limit of detection (LOD) between 1-10
CFU/mL, depending on the species, which is as good as the only FDA-approved test. In this project, we will
complete the development of the assay protocol by including new probes and optimizing the overall assay (Aim
1). We will test the manual protocol and develop a fully integrated disposable cartridge and instrument (Aim 2).
Finally, we will evaluate the assay in pilot analytical and clinical validation studies (Aim 3). We will work with a
multidisciplinary team that includes experts in assay development and instrument development, including the
former Vice President of Engineering at Becton Dickinson, experts in microbiology, sepsis diagnosis and
treatment from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pittsburgh, as well as engineers from Key
Technologies. After completing this project, we will further optimize the system for usability and manufacturability
and conduct analytical and clinical studies for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If
successful, the new automated assay can become part of the standard procedure for the diagnosis of patients
with sepsis and improve patients’ outcomes by dramatically reducing the time to targeted antimicrobial therapy."
10862247,"Background: There is a paucity of reliable, household-level data on evictions. We have no data on how
many Veterans are evicted each year, whether they regain housing or not after eviction, or the costs to VA of
rehousing evicted Veterans and treating eviction-related health conditions. If we knew these costs to be
substantial, we could better budget for programs, such as the Supportive Services for Veteran Families
(SSVF), that are designed to reduce housing insecurity.
Significance: We will acquire the names and addresses on all eviction filings starting in 2013 from Minnesota,
Indiana, Cook County (Chicago), IL and the Puget Sound (Seattle) region of Washington State. We will match
these filings by name and address to VA clinical and housing databases. This offers three major opportunities
for VA. First, it allows VA researchers to estimate the effects of eviction on health and housing outcomes and
VA costs. Knowing the costs of evictions informs the level of effort the VA should apply to mitigate those costs.
Second, it provides an opportunity to intervene proactively to prevent homelessness because the eviction data
can be extracted monthly. Third, because eviction data covers all Veterans and not just those receiving VA
care, it provides an opportunity for VA to proactively reach all enrolled Veterans, including non-VA users who
might not be aware of the housing, health, and social assistance available to them at VA.
Innovation and Impact: This is the first VA study to: carefully match evicted persons to non-evicted persons
at the time of eviction to minimize risks of reverse causation and confounding; estimate the probability of
homelessness following an eviction; comprehensively estimate the effect of evictions on health and healthcare
costs; pilot-test a system to identify Veterans before they become housing insecure that does not rely on a
Veteran having a healthcare visit with a housing screen; and use newly released data on the socioeconomic
status of Veterans from the USVETS database. If successful, we will be able to proactively contact Veterans
and refer them to VA housing services before they become homeless. We will also better understand the costs
of evictions to Veterans and VHA.
Specific Aims:
 1. Aim 1: Estimate the effect of evictions on Veterans’ health, housing outcomes and costs.
 Hypotheses: a) Veterans who were evicted were more likely to experience subsequent homelessness,
 have increased need for physical and mental health services, and to generate more costs to the VA
 than Veterans who were not evicted.; b) Black and Hispanic Veterans were more likely to face eviction
 than were white Veterans.
2. Aim 2: Conduct a prospective survey of evicted and non-evicted Veterans to estimate the association
 between evictions and patient reported outcomes:
 Hypothesis: Veterans who were evicted will have less favorable patient reported outcomes than
 Veterans who were not evicted.
3. Aim 3: Design and pilot test an intervention to proactively reach out to Puget Sound Veterans with court
 fillings for eviction. Primary outcomes: a) requests for information on housing assistance from Veterans
 who received outreach, and b) acceptability of the pilot intervention by Veteran users and VA staff.
Methodology: Aim 1 is retrospective statistical analyses of housing and health databases. Aim 2 conducts a
survey of evicted and non-evicted Veterans. Aim 3 conducts qualitive interviews with newly evicted Veterans,
holds a human centered design workshop to create the intervention, and pilot-tests the intervention.
Next Steps/Implementation: We ultimately hope to widely implement the intervention(s) designed and pilot-
tested in Aim 3 in order to better reach Veterans facing eviction and help prevent Veteran homelessness."
10862382,"DART.3―Revolutionizing Neuropsychiatric Treatment through
Noninvasive, Programmable Cell-Type-Specific Neuropharmacology
ABSTRACT
Neuropharmacology is central to the treatment of brain disorders, and new tools are needed to untangle
how canonical drug-receptor interactions are transformed by brain circuits to impact complex behavioral
states. DART (drugs acutely restricted by tethering) offers a new path forward, by making it possible to
deliver clinical drugs to one cell type at a time, observe ensuing behaviors and cellular dynamics, and
reconstruct mechanisms from parts to the whole. Since its debut, we have worked closely with a growing
user base to refine and deploy the technology. In particular, the second-generation DART.2 offers
thousandfold cellular specificity, histology tracers of target engagement, and a catalog of antagonists,
agonists, and allosteric modulators of several receptors. Here, we propose to advance the technology in
three new domains of innovation with DART.3. Aim 1 enables noninvasive, whole-body delivery for precise
drug engagement. Aim 2 broadens the therapeutic range to Nicotinic and 5-HT2A receptors and cellular
locales. Aim 3 provides two kinds of programmable rapid reversibility. Our priorities in technical innovation
reflect the most pressing gaps identified by our community of collaborators. Understanding complex animal
behavior is our standard. Thus, we characterize tools in behaving animals, develop robust systems of rigor
and reproducibility, and invest in our user base by providing reagent distribution, training and support
through frequent interactions. These priorities are empowering a thriving and intellectually diverse
neuroscience community to transform how we study the brain."
10857151,"Project Summary – Project 2
 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) imposes a substantial burden on society with far-reaching health
consequences. The identification of novel genes and genetic pathways that influence alcohol-related behaviors
will facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions for AUD. In this project my laboratory will use
the Drosophila (fruit fly) model to investigate genes and genetic pathways that have novel influences on
ethanol-related behavior. Molecular-genetic information from this project should ultimately lead to better
diagnosis, risk determination and treatment of AUD in humans.
 A major focus for this project will be to explore the role of the MADS-box transcription factor Mef2 family in
ethanol-related behavior. Our preliminary studies implicate a MEF2 family member in the subjective response
to ethanol (SRE) in humans and also show that the sole fly ortholog Mef2 is required for normal ethanol
sedation. Our data suggest that altered ethanol sedation in humans might underlie changes in SRE and that
changes in both sedation and SRE might be driven by genetic variance in MEF2 genes. Our results also
support the hypothesis that a deeper understanding of the Mef2 family of genes could lead to important
insights regarding behavioral responses to ethanol, SRE and potentially AUD.
 Another major focus of this project will be to continue using the fly as an experimental platform for
investigating the role of other candidate genes in ethanol behavior prioritized by our Bioinformatics and

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic regulatory process that restricts expression of specific genes to one
parental allele. Understanding genomic imprint regulation during early development has significant medical and
societal implications, including for medically assisted reproduction, which is associated with rare imprinting
disorders. However, significant knowledge gaps exist for the regulation of genomic imprinting during
preimplantation development. While DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs) plays a critical role in
embryos as an inherited silencing mark, the specific mechanisms that establish and/or maintain an active
transcription compartment at the unmethylated ICR, permitting long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcription and
in turn, repressive function across an imprinted domain, remain unclear. To address these gaps, we performed
an innovative, RNA interference screen for epigenetic regulators of the Kcnq1ot1 imprinted domain (as a
model domain) in mouse extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cells. We identified 41 candidates, including
chromatin remodelers, activators and repressors. Our investigation of one candidate, nucleoporin (NUP) 107,
led to the discovery of a novel NUP107 and NUP153 mechanism of imprinted domain regulation. Here, we
hypothesize that NUP107 and NUP153 function as a nuclear scaffold for promoting an active transcription
compartment at ICRs in zygotes by recruiting chromatin remodelers and activators for lncRNA transcription,
which in turn, leads to allelic silencing of neighboring genes. In Aim 1, we will examine the postfertilization role
of NUP107 and NUP153 at the Kcnq1ot1 ICR by assessing physical interactions between these proteins, the
Kcnq1ot1 domain and its lncRNA in late 1-cell to blastocyst-stage embryos. Wildtype embryos will be
compared to embryos with NUP107 or NUP153 degradation, 2 maternal genomes (parthenotes) or 2 paternal-
like genomes (maternal Dnmt3a/3b null). Next, we will assess genomic localization of NUP107 and NUP153,
as well as chromatin state, using ultralow-input CUT&RUN in these embryos. To further define their function at
imprinted domains, ChIP-seq with NUP107 and NUP153 antibodies and RNA-seq will be conducted on control,
Nup107- and Nup153-depleted XEN cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the function of chromatin remodelers,
SMARCA5 and SMARCC2, and activators, KAT2A and TAF6L, in generating active transcription
compartments at ICRs. Using candidate depletion in XEN cells, we will ascertain the role of these proteins on
Kcnq1ot1 lncRNA expression and its localization at the domain, open/active chromatin formation, allelic
repression of neighboring genes in the Kcnq1ot1 domain, as well as their function at other imprinted domains.
Next, we will analyze NUP107 and NUP153’s ability to recruit these chromatin remodelers and activators to
carry out their function at ICRs. Finally, we will assess the role of SMARCA5, SMARCC2, TAF6L and KAT2A
in establishing active transcription at ICRs in preimplantation embryos. This work will lead to the discovery of
novel mechanisms of imprinted domain regulation during early development."
10865011,"This is a renewal application from the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), in conjunction with two neighboring institutions (the Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Institute, the Salk Institute), for a 5-year renewal of the Medical Student Training in Aging Research (MSTAR) program, in response to the RFA-AG-20-008. Over the past 15 years we have trained 239 students from across the country, including 66% from ethnic minority groups, with 14% from URM and 59% women. 30% eligible students from the most recent funding period published at least one peer-reviewed article and 74% students gave a poster presentation. After graduation, all our trainees have continued residency in major programs; several are pursuing academic careers in aging research including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and geriatrics. The proposed program is designed to expand the pipeline of new physician investigators in the field of aging, especially ADRD. It will provide full-time support for 8-12 consecutive weeks of research and clinical training during summer, provided by faculty to 18 medical students per year from across the country. We will make special efforts to recruit medical students from underrepresented racial or ethnic minority groups, trainees with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. All trainees will spend the summer in San Diego, working under the supervision of some of the finest molecular, translational, and clinical scientists with outstanding track records of NIA- and other federal funding and of research training of medical students. A primary focus of our program will be on aging well in the context of age-associated disorders and disabilities with a major emphasis on prevention, identification, and management of cognitive impairment and ADRD. Strengths of our faculty range from basic and molecular biology to clinical, epidemiologic, and therapeutic research on aging and age-related disorders, especially ADRD and other diseases associated with cognitive impairment like cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and depression. The most important aspects of this program will be hands-on research experience and development of a long-term mentoring relationship. In addition, a combination of didactics and clinical exposure to geriatrics especially patients with ADRD, will reinforce the skills learned in the direct research experience. The trainees will give an oral presentation at a workshop at UCSD held in early August, with the goal of presenting a formal poster at the annual meeting of the American Geriatrics Society and developing a publishable manuscript within a year. An Executive Committee will oversee the recruitment and training of the students. There will be a rigorous and extensive evaluation of the program by trainees, participating faculty, and other stakeholders including long-term follow-up. A website will be used to facilitate continued communication among the trainees and their mentors."
10865013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) is an aging-associated condition that confers increased
risk of progression to hematologic disorder and a decreased overall survival rate. The incidence of CHIP
increases substantially with advancing age, present in 10-15% of individuals aged 70 years or older. CHIP is a
significant health concern as the proportion of individuals ≥ 65 years old in the United States is expected to
increase from 15% of the population in 2014 to 24% by the year 2060. CHIP is caused by somatic mutations
that confer a selective advantage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their progeny, which can be easily
detected using next-generation sequencing. However, there are currently no methods to identify individuals in
which CHIP will progress to hematologic disorder, and no therapies to prevent this progression. The long-term
goal of this research is to develop novel strategies to extend healthy hematopoietic function during aging and
prevent aging-associated hematologic disorders. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the
aging-associated cellular and molecular alterations that promote the expansion of CHIP-mutant clones and
their progression to hematologic disorder. The rationale is that the underlying mechanisms will be prime,
modifiable targets for detection and mitigation of high-risk CHIP. Preliminary data describe a technically
innovative mouse model in which the timing of CHIP development and progression can be strictly controlled.
This is the only model to date that recapitulates in vivo CHIP progression as it occurs in humans. Using this
model, the aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment was shown to accelerate CHIP expansion and
progression, and correlated with an age-related increase in the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
the BM microenvironment. These data support the central hypothesis that alterations in the aged BM
microenvironment increase the selective advantage of CHIP-mutant HSCs and their progeny causing CHIP
expansion and progression. This project will use cellular and molecular biological approaches in aged mice to
achieve the following specific aims: AIM 1. Discover pathogenic somatic mutation(s) selected for by an aged
BM microenvironment during CHIP expansion and progression; AIM 2. Delineate the mechanisms by which the
aged BM microenvironment accelerates CHIP expansion and progression; and AIM 3. Determine the extent to
which chronic inflammation causes CHIP expansion and progression. The proposed research is conceptually
innovative because it is the first to define the important role of the aged BM microenvironment in causing CHIP
expansion and progression. This study is significant because it will define the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that underlie progression of CHIP to hematologic disorder and provide a fundamental basis for
the development of biomarkers to predict high-risk CHIP and novel prophylactic therapies to mitigate CHIP
progression."

My laboratory is pursuing the genetic basis of recently evolved human traits that are not observed in
chimpanzees, or other great apes. We are working towards this goal by identifying and functionally
characterizing the fastest evolving regions in the human genome. While this line of research has
been pursued before, the studies have always focused on the 5% of the genome that shows strong
cross-species sequence constraint in non-human mammals, and is therefore clearly functional.
However, we now know there are many functional regions that do not show strong cross-species
constraint across diverse mammals. It is also true that many phenotypic transitions seen on the
branch to humans, such as brain expansion and upright posture, are also seen in other mammalian
lineages. For example, dolphins and elephants have larger brains than humans. Lemurs and
macropods (e.g. kangaroos) also have a spine that is generally perpendicular to the ground. For
these reasons, we hypothesize that many genomic elements underlying human adaptations and
disease risks will not be restricted to the 5% of the genome showing strong cross-species
conservation in other mammals. My laboratory is therefore venturing into the other 95% of the human
genome, in search of regions that have rapidly changed in humans, but may also vary among other
species. This has caused us to be faced with the problems that originally restricted researchers to the
5% of mammalian genomes that is highly constrained. How do we identify which of our 2089 regions
are functional, and how do we know if the sequence changes on the human lineage change their
function? This is a common disconnect in genomics research: a computational screen has generated
thousands of interesting mutations, whether it be fast evolving regions in humans, or haplotypes from
genome-wide association studies, but making mouse models for in depth study of these mutations
can only be done for one to ten mutations. This results in a disconnect of two orders of magnitude
between the mutations we can identify for further analysis and those we can further analyze. The vast
majority of the 2089 fastest evolving regions in the human genome are located outside of
protein-coding exons and are likely regulating the spatial and temporal expression of genes during
development. While there are high-throughput methods for testing enhancer activity in cell lines, the
cell type of activity is not usually known beforehand, and cell lines do not capture the complexity of
cell types transiently present during development. To address this problem for our own work, and with
the intention of it being adopted by other groups, we are developing a method to assay the gene
regulatory potential of thousands of DNA segments in developing tissue and at single cell resolution."

We recently found that the Gac DNA-binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease bacterium,
functions as a transcriptional repressor of the essential ospC gene. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses of a
gac mutant revealed that Gac impacts levels of transcripts of several other virulence-associated proteins,
including the alternative sigma factors RpoN and RpoS. Prior studies demonstrated that RpoN is required for
expression of RpoS, and both are required for mammalian infection. The planned studies will further
investigate the functions of Gac in the Lyme disease spirochete, including its impacts on mammalian and tick
infection and molecular characterization of Gac's impacts on rpoN expression. Results of these studies will
provide important insights on regulatory mechanisms that control virulence of the Lyme disease spirochete and
help identify key components for development of improved, specific antibacterials."

The proposed research in the FIC K43 application, “COMParative ASSessment of p16/Ki-67 DUal Staining
Technology in women living with HIV (COMPASS-DUST)” is the first in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) that aims to
evaluate the performance of p16/Ki-67 dual staining technology (DUST) in cervical cancer screening among
women living with HIV (WLHIV). In Aim 1 and 2, using an intra-participant comparative study design, we will
enrol n=300 sexually active WLHIV aged 25–65 years at two accredited adult HIV treatment centres in Lagos,
Nigeria to compare the performance of DUST to the currently used screening methods (Pap smear, hr-HPV
DNA, or VIA testing) in detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3). In Aim 3, we will use a
prospective cohort study design to enrol WLHIV (n=60) who are diagnosed as having low-grade CIN (CIN1) for
a 6-monthly follow-up for 2 years to detect persistent CIN1 and progression of CIN1 to CIN2/3. The findings of
this study will be of great public health significance for 2 reasons. First, they may provide evidence of the
existence of a better performance screening method for the primary and triage detection of CIN2/3 in WLHIV.
Secondly, we may demonstrate that this high-performance test can improve the long-term predictive accuracy
of screening by extending the intervals between evaluations and thus decrease the overall cost and increase
screening uptake in WLHIV.
This application will build on the candidate’s background experience and the expertise of his team of mentors

10866507,"Project Summary
Understanding the conformational dynamics of proteins and their binding partners is crucial to predicting and
designing their function. Molecular simulations are suitable for this task, but remain challenging for ligand
binding systems where dissociation occurs on very slow time scales. We are developing new Markov state
model (MSM) approaches, which describe conformational dynamics as a network of transitions between
metastable states, to address this challenge. Multi-scale Markov models (MEMMs) offer a robust framework
for building variationally optimal models of dynamics on long time scales, from ensembles of short trajectories
sampled in biased thermodynamic ensembles, to predict ligand binding affinities, rates and mechanisms.
 During the coronavirus pandemic, our group used the distributed computing platform Folding@home (FAH)
to perform virtual screening of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors by utilizing expanded-ensemble (EE)
simulations, in which multiple alchemical intermediates can be sampled in a single simulation, to estimate
binding free energies. This has inspired us to combine EE and MSM methods that can leverage the power of
FAH to make fundamental advances in virtual screening and molecular design, in three specific aims:
 Our first aim is to improve EE methods for computing ligand binding free energies. In collaboration with the
Shirts Lab, we seek to understand and ameliorate convergence issues, and explore and unify related
approaches. We will investigate how well EE estimates of free energies of mutations can be used with MEMMs
to predict changes in protein folding stability and rates. Finally, we will work with the Karanicolas Lab to
determine the extent to which EE-calculated ABFEs on FAH can be used alongside advanced machine
learning classifiers to discover both active and potent inhibitors from structure-based virtual screening studies.
 Our second aim is to develop a combined metadynamics (metaD) + MEMM approach for modeling binding
reactions. We will develop and test two different strategies in which metaD is used to derive negative potentials
of mean force along binding reaction coordinates that can be used as bias potentials for constructing multi-
ensemble Markov models (MEMMs) of ligand binding. We will test these methods in toy binding systems, and
small ligands of L99A lysozyme. Finally, we will apply metaD+MEMMs to predict affinities, rates and
mechanisms of the macrolide natural product carolacton binding to FolD and its known drug-resistant mutants.
 Our third aim is to examine the extent to which solution-state preorganization determines binding affinity,
and whether simulation-based modeling can use this idea quantitatively for computational design. For a
corpus of 105 cyclic peptides with published affinities, EE+MSM approaches will test the validity of a two-step
conformational selection model. The results of this work will guide the design, testing and optimization of cyclic
peptide binders to disrupt dimerization of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a collaboration with the Rongsheng
Wang Lab at Temple, to find new diagnostics/therapeutics for cancer metastasis."
10866508,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have killed 1 in 20 people worldwide. Influenza A virus (IAV)
infections usually do not cause such severe disease for the ~30 million infected every year in the United States
alone (2014-2015). However, there are broad differences in IAV susceptibility and severity, with outcomes from
asymptomatic infections (~16%) to death (0.2% in 2014-2015). These differences arise from the complex
interplay of exposure, environment, IAV genetics, and host factors.
 A crucial host factor that contributes to heterogeneity of IAV infection is sex. For children and older
individuals, males are more likely to experience severe disease, while females of child-bearing age have greater
severity. As there is strong evidence for 1) the importance of sex in IAV infection, 2) gene expression differences
between males and females, and 3) human genetic variation impacting infectious disease in general and
specifically IAV infection, synthesis of these three areas may provide crucial mechanistic insight. We hypothesize
that sex differences in gene expression are a major driver of heterogeneity in IAV infection. To elucidate these
differences, this project will integrate cutting-edge approaches to identify sex-specific differences in transcript
abundance and splicing that regulate IAV burden and host response in human cells, IAV challenge volunteers,
and natural populations. Further, we will define the genotype x sex interactions that form the mechanistic basis
for how genetic diversity contributes to sex differences in IAV infection.
 To achieve these goals, we have unique datasets of IAV infection heterogeneity in cells from dozens of
male and female donors, in nasal curettage and peripheral blood from human IAV challenge subjects, and
biobanked samples of natural IAV infection with outcomes ranging from mild infection to death. Computational
analyses of these datasets will define 1) sex differences in gene expression that correlate with IAV burden and
symptom severity and 2) human SNPs that regulate sex-biased gene expression and flu severity. The
transcriptional profiles from these datasets will be used to generate sex-specific biomarkers of IAV infection
severity using machine learning approaches. Finally, we will experimentally determine whether the identified
sex-biased genes and SNPs regulate IAV burden and host response in cellular models of infection. All results
will be available through an easy-to-use web database for exploring this rich dataset as a launchpad for further
mechanistic and clinical studies.
 This project will develop and apply computational methods to generate a high-resolution analysis of how
sex and genes interact to impact IAV infection. Understanding the genetic basis for sex differences in IAV
infection could lead to new diagnostic approaches in identifying at-risk individuals and novel therapeutic
strategies."
10866509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over the past 40 years, specialist physicians have supplanted primary care as the most frequently seen
clinicians for older adults in the US. This shift towards specialty care is driven by advancing medical technology
and increased “subspecialization,” whereby specialist physicians focus on narrower and narrower clinical
areas. Subspecialization has grown markedly: in 1980, the American Board of Medical Specialties had 28
specialty boards, with an additional 28 certified subspecialties. By 2020, 40 specialty boards encompassed 147
separate subspecialties. While subspecialists bring greater clinical expertise, too much subspecialization could
lead to inequitable access, overtreatment, overdiagnosis or fragmentation of care. There is little empirical
evidence on the implications of growing subspecialization for the health of older Americans.
 A major obstacle to filling these evidence gaps is the lack of meaningful measures of subspecialization
at the physician level. Existing physician directories, like the one used by Medicare, contain in-depth specialty
data, but are also highly inaccurate. For example, Medicare data identify only 17% of board-certified advanced
heart failure specialists in the US. Other specialties have similar data gaps. To understand how access to
subspecialists influences access to specific advanced treatments and clinical outcomes, it is necessary to
better define the hundreds of types of subspecialty care being provided to patients.
 We propose to characterize subspecialization in the US and assess its implications for the health and
health care of older adults. Using comprehensive data from Medicare, we will develop novel methods to
classify physician subspecialists by their observed practice patterns, focusing on 3 key specialties in the care
of older adults (cardiology, medical oncology and general surgery) as “tracer” disciplines to fill evidence gaps in
subspecialty care that can inform policy. Specifically, we will:
1) Use community detection algorithms, a common tool in network science, to identify subspecialists based on
 their practice patterns (as measured by services provided, drug treatments, and patient diagnoses).
2) Identify patient, health system and geographic factors associated with subspecialty supply and access.
3) Using quasi-experimental methods, measure the impact of access to subspecialist care on health outcomes
 and utilization in the three key specialties.
 These Aims will provide novel evidence to guide health policy, including improved methods to
accurately measure subspecialist supply, guide health insurers and policymakers for applications such as
determining adequacy of specialist coverage in insurance design (e.g., Medicare Advantage), identify
populations with shortages in subspecialist access, and guide telemedicine development. Without this
evidence, clinical advances may not reach older adults who could benefit the most."

 We have conducted the largest prospective comparative study of laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH), a
minimally invasive procedure ablating the amygdalo-hippocampal complex (AHC) versus selective and standard
open resection (OR) epilepsy surgery (N=425+). We demonstrated that SLAH is superior to OR in 1-year
cognitive outcomes in adults (including episodic verbal memory & perceptual (semantic) recognition or name
retrieval of objects/faces), while achieving comparable seizure control. We will extend our analysis
longitudinally in an unprecedented manner (5-10 year outcome) leveraging this unique cohort of well-studied
patients including neuropsychological (NP), structural and functional neuroimaging and seizure outcomes.
 We have also amassed a large sample of cases involving stereotactic laser ablation [SLA] of non-AHC
structures. The heterogeneity of these SLA cases and the focal nature of the laser ablation surgical zones create
an amazing opportunity for lesion-behavioral analyses. We will expand our neuroimaging analyses to include
rigorous voxel lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) and novel methods of connectivity modeling with diffusion
tensor imaging and resting state fMRI. We will focus on the neural circuitry responsible for declarative memory
and language, while determining the optimal surgical zones to produce the best long-term cognitive and seizure
outcomes. VLSM allows us to determine which temporal lobe regions are critical for specific cognitive
functions, while connectivity analyses will reveal the interconnectedness of these regions in the individual
patient (allowing us to determine the relative risk of decline at the patient level).
 Our preliminary findings indicate that: 1) SLAH patients exhibit unexpected improvement in multiple
cognitive functions, which is unparalleled in their OR counterparts, and 2) SLA procedures sparing the AHC
and broader medial TL regions frequently lead to severe decline in verbal memory/naming, particularly in
cases of focal ablations of the language dominant temporal pole or fusiform gyrus. This suggests that verbal
declarative memory depends upon a broad network extending beyond the AHC, which is a paradigm shift for
surgical planning (i.e., regions thought to be expendable during surgical approach are actually critical to
function). This knowledge is fundamentally important from mechanistic and clinical translational points of
view, and our data and planned analyses provide a unique and feasible way to draw robust conclusions on these
long-standing knowledge gaps. Our data raise pivotal questions about existing declarative memory models and
the mechanism of recovery underlying the superior cognitive outcomes in many SLAH/SLA cases (e.g.,
functional sparing vs. reorganization), which we will address in this renewal by following our patients over
time. Finally, while more epilepsy centers are employing SLA due to its improved cognitive outcomes, ultimate
clinical adoption rests on seizure control, making it critical to determine SLAH efficacy over a longer time span."
10858369,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Oropharyngeal swallowing disorders (a.k.a. dysphagia) are among the most common and dangerous
manifestations of many neurologic conditions. Critically, dysphagia in neurologic diseases (i.e., neurogenic
dysphagia) is often associated with highly negative health and quality of life outcomes. Despite this, optimal
management for neurogenic dysphagia has yet to be established. Behavioral treatments in the form of head/neck
exercises appear promising in improving swallowing in small-scale studies but typically require the use of
adjunctive biofeedback. Further, two significant clinical-research gaps remain: a) to date biofeedback as adjunct
to swallow therapy has not been systematically examined in the context of neurogenic dysphagia, and b) current
swallowing biofeedback devices are large and/or expensive and thus not widely available. Hence, despite its
promise, biofeedback-facilitated dysphagia treatment remains underused and understudied, limiting access to
important swallowing rehabilitation services with potentially detrimental effects. To address these gaps, we
developed and validated a cost-effective wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback sensor
technology (i-Phagia), optimized to record muscle activity from the head/neck and provide biofeedback to
patients and adherence data to clinicians. In this proposal the objective is to conduct a large-scale randomized
clinical trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of sEMG biofeedback (using i-Phagia) as adjunct to a standardized
swallow therapy protocol delivered both in-person and via telehealth compared to a standard of care (SOC)
approach on swallow outcomes in patients with chronic stroke or Parkinson’s disease (PD), i.e., two common
neurogenic dysphagia populations. Our long-term goal is to improve neurogenic dysphagia management through
the development of evidence-based and accessible treatments. The aims of this study are to: 1) compare the
safety, satisfaction, and efficacy of sEMG biofeedback as adjunct to in-person swallow treatment and a standard-
of-care approach in improving swallow outcomes for patients with chronic stroke or PD and dysphagia; 2)
compare the safety, satisfaction, and efficacy of sEMG biofeedback as adjunct to in-person vs. telehealth
swallow treatment in improving swallow outcomes for patients with chronic stroke or PD and dysphagia, and 3)
examine the role of clinical data (such as diagnosis, disease severity, age, stimulability, and neuromuscular
activity at baseline) on treatment responsiveness. We will achieve the aims by conducting an RCT of 180 people
with stroke or PD and dysphagia randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (in-person i-Phagia, remote
i-Phagia, and SOC). Upon study completion, we will have established the efficacy of sEMG biofeedback-
facilitated swallow therapy for both in-person and telehealth service delivery in two neurogenic dysphagia
populations, and we will have started to identify variables determining response to treatment. Our findings will
have high potential to fill a critical gap in the rehabilitation of millions of patients with neurogenic dysphagia, while
informing future work on larger effectiveness trials and tele-rehabilitation of this debilitating condition."

Despite an equal hypertension treatment rate between Blacks and Whites (79.7% vs. 79.1%), racial/ethnic
disparities in blood pressure (BP) control persist with lower rates in Blacks (39.2%), Hispanics (40.0%), Asians
(37.8%), compared to Whites (49.1%). Blacks in the Southeastern US were 27% less likely to achieve BP
control while they were 69% more likely to receive treatment. Existing studies point towards individual risk
factors and lack of healthcare access and insurance as potential causes for these disparities; however, even
after accounting for these factors, racial disparities in BP control persist. The reasons for this inequality are yet
to be fully understood. Additionally, BP control rates remain low (44%–57%) among treated hypertensives
while clinical trials have demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (ranging from 80-90%) can be achieved
with currently available therapies by strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a
higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and
use of fewer or less effective drugs. Despite this, in a national survey, antihypertensive therapy was intensified
in only 22-40% of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and 43% of physicians did not initiate drug therapy
unless systolic BP reached ≥160 mmHg. The 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines advocate evidence-
based medication selection and titration, however, the role of provider concordance to these guidelines and its
impact on racial/ethnic disparity in BP control remains unexplored. Furthermore, conclusions from studies
regarding compliance with older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to
evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up, laboratory assessments, drug
side effects, and contraindications. We propose to address these limitations and use an objective and validated
measurement of concordance to treatment guidelines. We will utilize data from the Stakeholders, Technology,
and Research Clinical Research Network (STAR CRN) – a database of ~14 million racially diverse patients
from the Southeastern US, to evaluate: 1) the extent of racial disparity in hypertension treatment based on the
AHA/ACC 2017 guidelines in the southeastern US; 2) investigate the patient, physician, clinic, and geo-social
factors that predict racial/ethnic disparity in the treatment of hypertension according to recommended
guidelines; and 3) ascertain if racial disparity in BP control can be attributed to providers' lack of adherence to
treatment guidelines. Moreover, we aim to conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians and patients to gather
information on the reasons for providers' deviation from the guidelines and recommendations on improving
compliance with the guidelines. Our findings will offer valuable insights into the factors contributing to racial
disparities in the treatment of hypertension according to recommended guidelines, and the role of providers'
hypertension treatment practices on racial disparity in BP control in the Southeastern US, thereby informing
future interventions for promoting BP control and health equity."

Systems Engineering (ISE) department, this program trains OS students with focus areas in aging workers,
data analysis, new technologies, and the integration of safety with process improvement. Students in this
program have come from a variety of undergraduate degrees and, based on their training, have been
successful in obtaining employment as skilled practitioners. This program is now set to expand by proposing
additional training for OS PhD students. Building upon the successful OS program, the proposed OHP PhD
training program will not only serve a national and regional training need but will also enhance the
interdisciplinary training provided to the current OS program, creating a hub for Total Worker Health® training
and research. The primary goal of the expanded program is to train the next generation of researchers and
practitioners capable of addressing NIOSH’s goals presented in the National Total Worker Health® Agenda.
The proposed OHP training program housed in the Department of Psychology builds upon the existing doctoral
program and provides a rigorous and focused interdisciplinary curriculum consisting of core courses in OHP, I-
O, and Health Psychology, comprehensive quantitative training, and expanded OHP electives in the
Departments of Social and Public Health and ISE. The proposed OHP training program also leverages the
exceptional psychophysiological training and internal applied research opportunities available at Ohio
University, unique components compared to other OHP training programs currently offered nationally. Synergy
between the existing OS and new OHP training areas is also designed to maximize the benefits to students
who may find themselves working collaboratively in their careers. Faculty and key personnel in the program
are well-qualified to provide the proposed training and the environment is well-suited to the proposed
interdisciplinary training mission."

The prevalence of hypertension in Black people in the US is among the highest in the world. Louisiana is in the
epicenter of hypertension and cardiovascular disease health disparities. The overall objective of the proposed
study is to test the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of a church wellness coordinator (CWC)-
led multifaceted intervention compared to enhanced usual care on hypertension control in Black communities.
A cluster randomized trial with an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design will be utilized to: 1. test the
clinical effectiveness of the multifaceted implementation strategy on blood pressure (BP) control; 2. assess the
implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and cost-effectiveness) of the
intervention; 3. study the sustainability of this multifaceted implementation strategy for clinical effectiveness
and implementation outcomes in a 6-month post-intervention follow-up study; and 4. examine the community-
wide impact of the intervention on mean BP and hypertension control. The Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation, and Sustainment framework has been used to guide the development of the multifaceted
implementation strategy. We have established a partnership with Black churches and assessed the needs,
barriers, and facilitators of hypertension control in Black community members, church leaders, CWCs, and
healthcare providers. The intervention is developed using a community-based participatory research approach
and is rooted in church-based wellness programs developed by and for Black church congregations. The
evidence-based interventions include community-based BP screening, lifestyle modifications, and
antihypertensive medication treatment. The CWCs are community health workers who will be trained on BP
screening, hypertension care coordination, and health coaching. They will conduct community-based BP
screening, coordinate care for patients with hypertension, assist patients with home BP monitoring, deliver
discounted and free antihypertensive medications to patients, and conduct health coaching on lifestyle
changes and medication adherence. Participation of faith-based organizations, Federally Qualified Health
Centers and other primary care organizations, community pharmacies, and local health departments will
strengthen this community intervention program. We will recruit 40 Black churches in New Orleans and 30
eligible community members from each church. We will randomly assign 20 churches to the CWC-led
multifaceted intervention and 20 to enhanced usual care. The multifaceted intervention program and enhanced
usual care will last for 18 months. The primary clinical effectiveness outcome is the proportion of individuals
with BP control (<130/80 mmHg) at 18 months and the primary implementation outcome is fidelity to the
multifaceted intervention. The proposed cluster randomized trial has 90% statistical power to detect an
absolute difference of 15% in the primary effectiveness outcome. This study will generate evidence on an
effective, scalable, and sustainable strategy for eliminating hypertension disparities in Black communities."

have been linked to changes in the composition of microbes in our gut. Moreover, the ability of our gut to exclude
toxic microbial components from our bloodstream (so-called gut barrier function) deteriorates with increasing
age and results in inflammation which, in-turn, can accelerate aging and promote various chronic diseases. Our
long-term goal is to identify bacteria with anti-aging, anti-inflammatory or other beneficial effects on human health
and to understand their mechanism of action. So far, we have discovered that Parabacteroides distasonis (Pd),
a normal gut bacterium, lowers inflammation and strengthens gut barrier function in mice. Furthermore, Pd
increased lifespan and slowed age-relator loss of vigor when fed to fruit flies. The objectives of this application
are to determine whether Pd can extend lifespan and healthspan in mice, understand the importance of a protein
involved in maintaining gut barrier function called ZO-1, and finally to identify the active factor of Pd and its target
molecule. We hypothesize that gut barrier function deteriorates during aging due to loss of ZO-1 expression,
resulting in leakage of bacterial toxins into the bloodstream, inflammation and loss of function. Furthermore,
specific gut bacteria, such as Pd, can be exploited to prevent or slow age-related gut barrier dysfunction, thereby
reducing inflammation and preserving health. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) determine if Pd can
increase lifespan and healthspan in mice; 1a) understand how proteins involved in gut barrier maintenance are
altered by aging and Pd exposure; 2) determine whether altering ZO-1 expression in the colon affects lifespan
and healthspan in mice; 3) identify the active factor of Pd; 3a) identify the mouse target of Pd and 4) determine
the mechanism of fruit fly lifespan extension by Pd. The aims of this study will be addressed by conducting
several inter-related experiments in cells, mice and fruit flies. Firstly, we will compare the lifespan, gut barrier
function, inflammation and various measures of health throughout life, of mice fed diet with or without with added
Pd. Next, we will compare the same readouts between mice with normal, deleted and high ZO-1 expression in
the intestine. Importantly, mice will be subjected to a battery of tests to assess their frailty and cognitive
health – including several measures of memory and brain inflammation that have direct relevance to
Alzheimer’s disease and its Related Dementias (ADRD). To identify the active factor of Pd, we will identify
additional species of bacteria that are able to increase gut barrier function (via ZO-1) and find the genes they
have in common with Pd. These will then be mutated or transferred to other bacteria one by one. Finally, we will
delete the pyd gene, the fly version of ZO-1, and compare the lifespan and age-related loss of vigor to normal
flies in the presence of absence of Pd. Determining whether Pd can extend lifespan and healthspan in mice, as
well as identifying its active factor, will pave the way for this bacterium, or its active factor, to be utilized in
therapies to extend the healthy lifespan and establish ZO-1 as a target for such therapies."

 Pain in the United States is common and costly, with over 1 in 3 individuals being afflicted, causing an
economic burden approaching $600 billion annually. Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread chronic
pain and co-morbid symptoms of psychological disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive symptoms
are particularly distressing and one of the most disabling aspects reported by patients. Neuroimaging
techniques, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have
identified central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms affecting the brain in these individuals, contributing to
their ongoing pain. Objective cognitive impairments and subjective complaints have been consistently identified
in FM; however, there remains a common discrepancy between subjective and objective findings in the
literature and there is scarce information as to the relationship with observed CNS mechanisms. Therefore, a
more comprehensive evaluation of this issue is needed. Furthermore, there remains a lack of sensitive clinical
biomarkers pertaining to the nature of cognitive complaints in FM, the development of which is a vital next step
towards effective interventions. To date, no study has systematically sought to understand cognitive
dysfunction in FM by combining neuropsychological assessments, patient-reported measures, and
neurophysiological (EEG) aspects. This empirical gap highlights a timely opportunity to understand and
address a potential avenue for thorough understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of cognitive symptoms in FM.
 The proposed project and closely aligned training plan will fill this empirical gap by comparing subjective and
objective cognitive assessments between individuals with FM and healthy controls. We will also use EEG to
evaluate the neurophysiological features underlying cognitive dysfunction in FM and relationships with clinical
outcomes using a cognitive paradigm shown to be sensitive to preclinical cognitive impairments. We will build
from the robust framework of the Michigan Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center and an ongoing NCCIH-
funded R01 to the primary mentor, Dr. DaSilva, to recruit a well characterized study sample and add a
thorough examination of cognition. Specifically, we will use a cross-sectional design to assess subjective and
objective cognitive functioning as well as the influence of co-morbid symptoms in FM on the relationship
between objective and subjective elements (Aim 1). We will also utilize EEG to identify neural biomarkers of
cognitive dysfunction based on performance on a memory task (Aim 2). Finally, as an exploratory aim (Aim 3)
we will analyze fMRI data in a subset of the FM sample to evaluate the relationship between brain responses
to pain and cognitive symptoms. The proposed training in FM, application of statistics to self-report measures,
neuroimaging, and training in interventional approaches to guide future research (i.e., neuromodulation) will
create the ideal foundation for the candidate to excel as an independent researcher and become a leading
expert in the field, advancing our knowledge of cognitive symptoms in chronic pain conditions."

 The World Health Organization predicts that cancer diagnoses will increase to 22 million per year within
the next two decades, with a corresponding 70% rise in cancer-related deaths. Liquid biopsy-based functional
tests using blood and bone marrow will be crucial for advancing cancer precision medicine and complementing
molecular genetic evaluation. Multiparameter high throughput flow and imaging platforms offer enhanced
sensitivity for capture of clinically important cellular processes, and are being developed to measure therapeutic
modulation of target protein signaling pathways. However, the success of these novel assays will depend on
uniform standards for processing liquid biopsies across academic institutions, hospitals, and commercial entities.
Currently, there is a lack of data on how pre-analytical factors, involved in the collection, and storage/retrieval of
liquid specimens impact functional protein-based and live cell-dependent functional assay readouts. Therefore,
pre-analytical data is critically needed to standardize workflows and support reliable clinical assay results and
interpretation.
 Our group at the Knight Cancer Institute has collected and analyzed blood and bone marrow specimens
from over 2,500 leukemia patients, resulting in the world's largest functional genomic dataset of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patient samples. Although basic SOPs for processing and storing leukemia samples for use in
functional assays have been deployed, evaluation of the impact of pre-analytical variability on assay results has
not been performed. The goal of this U01 project is to characterize the pre-analytical steps involved in blood and
bone marrow biopsy sample handling and storage/retrieval for functional assay reporting. The project focuses
on the downstream impact of pre-analytical sample handling variability in novel, clinically relevant functional
assays, namely: High Throughput-Drug Sensitivity (HT-DS), Multi-parameter High Throughput Flow (MHT-flow)
and Single Cell-Multiplexed Protein Imaging (SC-MPI) assays. Our project aims to establish pre-analytical
sample processing guidelines to enable maximal reproducibility for functional testing outcomes, and to evaluate
the feasibility and impact of applying these guidelines in collaboration with other organizations. To that end, our
proposal includes implementation and evaluation of optimized SOPs by a collaborative, interdisciplinary network
that integrates clinical researchers with academic and private sector scientists.
 Overall, the goal is to establish pre-analytical workflow guidelines that optimize phenotypic cell identity
and protein-based readouts for functional platform tests that are currently being used in drug therapeutic
development and precision medicine clinical trials. The results of this work will help establish well-defined
workflows critical for the successful and uniform adoption of functional platform testing across national clinical
sites, as well as industry, and will broadly impact the growing number of new functional tests in development and
clinical translation in areas such as immuno-oncology, early detection, and measurable residual disease."
10862318,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epigenetic perturbations in cancer are widely recognized but poorly understood. A detailed understanding of
how latent epigenetic information contributes to tumorigenesis would enable us to stratify risk among
vulnerable patients, classify tumors based on epigenetic state, and better target therapeutic approaches.
Animal models of early-onset epigenetic perturbation offer a unique opportunity to study the potential contribution
of epigenetic signatures to prediction of cancer risk, since epigenetic changes precede tumor initiation in these
models and can therefore be separated from secondary effects of tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we
found that epigenetic changes induced by loss of the epigenetic regulator KDM6A (UTX) in the paternal germ
line in mice result in elevated lung tumor burden in offspring even when the mutant Kdm6a allele itself is not
inherited, implying that these offspring carry silent epigenetic perturbations that predispose to cancer. These
mice are an excellent experimental model for defining signatures of epigenetic sensitization that predict cancer
risk. Our central hypothesis is that preexisting, detectable epigenetic perturbations in lung tissue interact
with genetic driver mutations to enhance lung tumorigenesis, and that the resulting tumors have a
distinct epigenetic and genetic signature. The objective of this study is to define a signature of these
preexisting epigenetic changes in the lung in a mouse model and determine if a memory of this signature can
be detected in lung tumors. Aim 1 will define the transcriptional and epigenetic phenotypes of normal lung tissue
in epigenetically sensitized mice. Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular phenotypes of epigenetically sensitized lung
tumors using both spontaneous tumors and tumors induced by activated KRAS. If both are successful, the results
of the two Aims will be compared to identify signatures of epigenetic sensitization that are present in histologically
normal tissue and that persist in tumors. We expect this work to reveal new markers for epigenetic risk of lung
tumorigenesis and define the molecular signatures associated with prior epigenetic sensitization in tumors.
Future work will determine the extent to which such signatures can be applied to human populations in the clinic."
