 During suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), chronic inflammation persists among people with HIV (PWH)
and appears to be driven by low levels of HIV replication, monocyte/macrophage activation, and other
mechanisms. This persistent inflammation has been linked to adverse neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression,
psychological stress, emotion dysfunction), neurocognitive, and medical outcomes. Cannabis, which is used
more commonly by PWH than people without HIV, appears to have anti-inflammatory effects and therefore may
have therapeutic applications for inflammation and end-organ complications. Cannabinoids exert their effects in
part via the endocannabinoid (EC) system (ECS), which includes cannabinoid receptors that are expressed on
the surface of cells of the immune and central nervous systems. Cannabinoids have demonstrated clinical
benefits for conditions like pain and nausea, but less is known about its effects on inflammation in HIV. Moreover,
the range of cannabis exposure (e.g., dose and frequency of use) that may be effective, ineffective, or unsafe
for different neuropsychiatric and medical conditions is unknown. In response to RFA-DA-20-022, this application
proposes to address key scientific gaps by examining the effects of chronic cannabis use and the role of the
ECS in persistent inflammation in PWH who are taking suppressive ART. We propose to assess 120 participants
(60 PWH on suppressive ART and 60 HIV- persons) across a spectrum of cannabis use from persons who have
never used cannabis to daily users. We will comprehensively evaluate participants with multimodal in vivo and
ex vivo assessments of the biological pathways underlying the effects of chronic cannabis use on persistent
inflammation in PWH and its corresponding impact on neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive complications. In
vivo assessments will include standardized medical, neuropsychiatric, and neurocognitive assessments,
including collection of cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Current cannabis users within this sample (n=80) will also
be assessed with novel brain imaging of microglial activation with [(18)F]FEPPA translocator protein (TSPO)
positron emission tomography. In the collected specimens, we will measure soluble (e.g., pro- and anti-
inflammatory cytokines) and cellular (e.g., HLA-DR, CD38) biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation
as well as components of the ECS (e.g., anandamide, CB2 receptors). Blood specimens will also serve as the
source for primary cell cultures for ex vivo mechanistic experiments that will assess the effects of cannabinoids,
HIV, and ART on biological pathways such as the TREM2 and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Data from all
assessments and experiments will be integrated and analyzed centrally to identify cross-cutting signals and
reduce noise from our multimodal assessments. Knowledge gained from this study will contribute to OAR
priorities (e.g., comorbidities, end organ injury) and provide valuable insight into strategies for treatment of
persistent inflammation in PWH and its health-related consequences."

The majority of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) are wrapped with compact layers of myelin sheaths
to ensure the rapid transmission of neuronal signals over long distances. As myelin thickness and sheath
length have profound effects on conduction velocity, myelination is also crucial to the precise control of
spatiotemporal activity patterns in the CNS. In the mammalian spinal cord, both descending motor and
ascending sensory pathways travel over long distances, requiring fine control of conduction speed necessary
for sensory-motor integration. Myelin disruption in the spinal cord after CNS trauma or disease, like multiple
sclerosis, causes axonal conduction failure leading to severe impairment of neurological function.
Accumulating data support the notion that neuronal activity positively regulates myelin development and also
induces adaptive myelin plasticity in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully
understood, and no molecular mediators have been identified regulating this process. Alpha2delta1 (A2d1)
subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) positively regulate the plasma membrane expression and
the biophysical properties of VGCCs, including those controlling synaptic vesicle release. Our preliminary data
suggest that A2d1 subunits positively regulate myelin development in the murine spinal cord. Building on our
promising data, the proposed study aims at dissecting the neuronal- and glial-specific mechanisms underlying
the role of A2d1 subunits in myelin development and repair. We propose a series of gain- and loss-of-function
experiments to investigate how A2d1 subunits expressed in neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells
positively regulate myelin development. Additionally, we will test whether manipulating A2d1 subunits
effectively promotes remyelination and functional recovery after demyelinating injury. Overall, this study will
shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent myelin formation and plasticity and
contribute to the design of translational research aimed at restoring myelin and neurological function after CNS
trauma and disease."
10861511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neuropathic pain (NeuP) affects 6-8% in the adult population. It leads to substantial functional impairment
and has deleterious impact on patients’ quality of life. Patients with NeuP continue to have inadequate response
to currently available pharmacotherapy options, with less than 25% achieving meaningful improvement.
Moreover, major safety concerns are associated with the use of analgesics such as opioids. There is clearly an
unmet need for new effective and safe approaches for treating neuropathic pain.
 5-HT3 receptors have emerged as a promising target in NeuP. Studies demonstrated that local intrathecal
delivery of 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron alleviates mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in animal
models of nerve injury. These compounds target 5-HT3 receptors in the CNS, which are overexpressed after
nerve injury, contributing to pain facilitation. The major challenge in achieving efficacy with systemic
administration of currently available 5-HT3 antagonists is P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated efflux that limits their
penetration to the CNS, and consequently limits their therapeutic effect in NeuP. With adequate CNS penetration,
these drugs are expected to be efficacious in relieving NeuP.
 We hypothesize that identification of CNS-active lead candidates combined with the current understanding
of mechanisms of 5-HT3 receptor inhibition gained from recent structural studies and using state-of-the-art
computational drug design approaches, will allow the design/development of novel 5-HT3 antagonists with CNS
activity and competitive intellectual property (IP) position. The goal of this R61 planning grant is to establish a
multidisciplinary and collaborative team of scientists in medicinal and computational chemistry, structural biology,
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pain biology and clinical/translational pain research to develop and
characterize lead candidates and establish the models and feasibility of determining their preclinical efficacy in
models of neuropathic pain.
 We will use molecular dynamics simulations, structure-based virtual screening and drug design to identify
and synthesize novel lead 5-HT3 antagonists (Aim 1), characterize in vitro pharmacology and in vivo
pharmacokinetics of the novel ligands (Aim 2), and determine the analgesic efficacy and abuse liability of these
ligands in rodent models (Aim 3). We expect to establish the multidisciplinary team and its workflow for drug
development and characterization, to generate the initial data for novel CNS-penetrant 5-HT3 antagonist
development in the subsequent U19 or UG3/UH3 grant mechanism."

Background: Maintaining functional status, or the ability to perform daily activities such as bathing, dressing,
and preparing meals, is central to older adults’ quality of life, health, and ability to remain independent.
Identifying functional impairments – defined as having difficulty or needing help performing these activities – is
essential for clinicians to provide optimal care to older adults, and on a population level, understanding function
can help anticipate service needs. Yet uptake of standardized measurement of functional status into routine
patient care has been slow and inconsistent due to the burden posed by current tools. The purpose of the
proposed QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative is to implement and evaluate the Patient-Aligned Care Team
(PACT) Functional Status Screening Initiative (hereafter “PACT Function Initiative”), a patient-centered, low-
burden intervention to improve measurement of functional status in VA primary care settings nationally.
Significance/Impact: Implementing routine measurement of functional status in primary care has the potential
to improve identification and management of functional impairment for older Veterans. Improved management
includes increasing access to services and supports, reducing potentially preventable acute care utilization,
and allowing Veterans to live in the least restrictive setting for as long as possible. The proposed QUERI
Partnered Evaluation Initiative is directly aligned with national VA strategic priorities including VA’s Aging in
Place and Aging and Frail Veterans initiatives (Objective 2.2) and developing Data as a Strategic Asset
(Objective 4.2) to inform evidence-based decisions.
Innovation: The PACT Function Initiative is novel because it addresses prior barriers to functional status
measurement. It incorporates Veteran and caregiver preferences while minimizing burden for primary care
teams and maximizing clinical effectiveness. Implementing this intervention will provide functional status data
that is directly actionable for patient care while creating a repository of data to inform VA strategic planning.
Specific Aims: (1) Measure clinician- and organization-level reach, adoption, implementation, and
sustainment of the PACT Function Initiative; (2) Compare the effectiveness of a standard versus enhanced
implementation bundle to improve adoption; (3) Measure patient-level clinical effectiveness of the intervention;
and (4) To inform future GEC initiatives, test the effectiveness of EHR-based frailty screening for identifying
Veterans at risk for functional impairment. We hypothesize that implementing the PACT Function Initiative will
result in increased identification and improved management of functional impairment among older Veterans
while providing key data to inform VHA strategic planning related to long-term services and supports.
Methodology: In partnership with GEC and Primary Care, we will implement and evaluate the PACT Function
Initiative using a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness cluster-randomized adaptive trial design with three
phases: pre-implementation, implementation, and sustainment. We will use the Practical, Robust
Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to guide implementation and evaluation. During pre-
implementation, we will engage stakeholders and develop local adaptations to maximize intervention-setting fit.
During implementation, we will launch a standard bundle of implementation strategies (champions, system-
level audit and feedback), identify sites with low uptake, and randomize those sites to receive continued
standard vs. enhanced strategies (technical assistance, clinician-level audit and feedback).
Next Steps/Implementation: Establishing routine, standardized measurement of functional status and frailty
among older Veterans will provide data to inform the delivery of proactive interventions to prevent and delay
the development of functional impairment and improve quality of life, health, and independence."

Research Strategy Component A-Core Surveillance
Iowa PRAMS Surveillance Project
Component A – Core Surveillance
Project Summary/Abstract
PRAMS stands for the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and is a survey sent by the Iowa
Department of Public Health (IDPH) to mothers 2-6 months after the birth of their child. Mothers who do
not respond to the mailed survey are followed up by phone. The survey asks women about their attitudes
and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy, including topics such as preconception health
behaviors, prenatal care content, smoking and drinking habits, contraceptive use, breastfeeding and the
infant’s sleep environment.
Iowa’s priorities for using PRAMS data include reducing racial disparities in maternal and infant
outcomes, and reducing infant morbidity and mortality. Iowa aims to accomplish this by improving the
planning and spacing of pregnancies, decreasing the prevalence of substance use, including tobacco and
alcohol in pregnant women and new mothers, improving rates of breastfeeding, promoting safe sleep for
infants and improving access to preconception and perinatal health services. Iowa PRAMS is partnering
with a broad range of stakeholders to transform data into actionable interventions. Partners include the
Iowa Statewide Perinatal Team, WIC, other Divisions and Bureaus within the IDPH and the University of
Iowa’s Department of Psychiatry, amongst others.
PRAMS is central to the IDPH’s mission of promoting and protecting the health of Iowans. PRAMS is
the sole data source that describes both the perinatal and postpartum periods for women who have had a
live birth. Data generated by PRAMS contributes to the IDPH’s core goals of promoting healthy
behaviors and strengthening the public health infrastructure."
10862062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pregnancy is a critical period for brain development, and drug use during this time disrupts ontogenic trajectories.
During the last decade, the use of prescription opioids during pregnancy has reached notably high rates (14-
22%) in the United States. While previous research has focused on the offspring for in utero effects of opioid
use, the impact on the mother’s postpartum mental health has been largely overlooked. Notably, drug overdoses
are one of the main preventable causes of pregnancy-related deaths, mainly occurring in this period. Here, we
will assess the neurobehavioral changes caused by prescription opioid exposure during pregnancy and their
postpartum impact on drug reward. The proposed work will focus on two key at-risk mechanisms during
pregnancy: oxytocin and dopamine. Central oxytocin signaling by paraventricular hypothalamic neurons
(PVNOXT) is halted during pregnancy and quickly re-initiated after parturition. Upon resumption of oxytocin
release, ventral tegmental area (VTA)-projecting PVNOXT neurons promote attribution of incentive value to salient
stimuli (e.g., pups). Therefore, VTA-projecting PVNOXT, which express µ-opioid receptors (µOR), represent a
substrate for the pharmacological actions of prescription opioids (such as oxycodone) during pregnancy. We
hypothesize that repeated activation of PVNOXT µOR leads to opioid tolerance and a long-term loss of inhibitory
control over PVNOXT excitability, hence exacerbating VTA oxytocin release and altering dopamine function
postpartum. We will use drug self-administration and neuroeconomic modeling to profile postpartum vulnerability
to drug abuse in dams exposed to prescription opioids during pregnancy. Additionally, we will employ fiber
photometry to examine in vivo changes in dopamine and oxytocin encoding of opioid rewards and
electrophysiological tools to characterize PVNOXT synaptic alterations. Finally, optogenetic manipulations will
address the sufficiency of the PVNOXT→VTA pathway to gate augmented postpartum reward-seeking behaviors
in opioid-naïve mice. Together, these experiments will uncover novel behavioral and neural circuit aberrations
resulting from prescription opioid exposure during pregnancy, focusing on the dam’s vulnerability to postpartum
opioid abuse. Ultimately, this research proposal seeks to uncover a potential neurobiological mechanism linking
the increased use of prescription opioids during pregnancy and the rise in postpartum overdose deaths."
10824051,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experience a high symptomatic burden, heart failure and
lethal arrhythmias. While the HCM has been recognized as a disease of the sarcomere for >30 years, the
heterogeneity of disease expression is substantial and not fully explained by these primary genetic variants.
Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) for HCM have uncovered common genetic variants as risk
alleles for HCM. Many of these are conversely protective alleles for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), supporting
the concept of polygenic regulation of contractile function. However, the mechanisms by which they exert their
effects are unknown. Here, we focus on a subset of GWAS loci that strongly implicate protein quality control as
a modifier of HCM. Three of the top 10 loci associated with HCM reside within or near genes that encode
proteins of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone network: BAG3, HSPB7, and DNAJC18. Prior
studies, and our own preliminary data, indicate that these cochaperones are involved in sarcomeric protein
maintenance. We hypothesize that risk alleles in BAG3, HSPB7 and DNAJC18 are strong genetic
modifiers of sarcomeric HCM, acting through distinct molecular mechanisms to coordinate sarcomere
protein dynamics and cardiac contractility. Our approach involves focused human genetic association
studies and functional studies in human model systems. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of risk alleles in
BAG3, HSPB7, and DNAJC18 on disease expression and clinical outcomes in patients with HCM, stratified by
sarcomere genotype and genetic similarity. Combining cases and controls from several sources, including the
Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), Penn Medicine BioBank, TOPMED and All of Us, we
will perform a case-control study to determine associations of BAG3, DNAJC18 and HSPB7 risk alleles with
HCM, a case-only analysis to determine association with clinical outcomes, and additive and epistasis
modeling to determine interaction effects. In Aim 2, the role of each co-chaperone in regulating sarcomeric
protein dynamics and contractility will be explored through genetic knockdown experiments. We will determine
effects of each variant on transcript/protein abundance and splice isoforms in cardiomyopathic human hearts.
In parallel, we will perform genome editing of each variant in human stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes
(hiPSC-CMs) and measure cellular phenotypes, including contractility. For the BAG3 coding variant,
Cys151Arg, we will use proximity labeling to determine how this variant affects BAG3 localization and its
interactome. Finally, we will use patient-derived hiPSC-CMs that have reduced levels of MyBP-C to determine
whether chaperone manipulation stabilizes wild-type MyBP-C to rescue haploinsufficiency. Successful
completion of these aims will impact the field by gaining an understanding of the clinical and biological
relevance of HSP70 risk alleles to HCM. Our team is composed of highly experienced investigators in
cardiomyopathy, cardiovascular genetics, and bioinformatics and is well poised to achieve these goals."

 A central goal in disease biology is to describe the molecular processes responsible for transformation
of a cell from a normal state into a pathological one. Compared to the rapid progresses in DNA and RNA
sequencing technologies, characterization of the final and arguably most actionable element of the central
dogma, protein, has lagged behind. The dynamic relationship between the genome of a cell and its proteome
is poorly understood, reflecting multiple layers of transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, the
complexity of the human proteome is greatly expanded by the ~400 different types of protein posttranslational
modifications (PTMs). The various PTM events, either alone or in combination (i.e., “cross-talk”), represent
powerful mechanisms to modulate the function of a protein (e.g., activity, stability and localization), the
collection of which convey information within the signaling network that underlies the complex traits in various
pathophysiological conditions. However, because of many inherent technical difficulties associated with the
analysis of protein PTMs (e.g., chemically diverse, unstable and low abundance), a complete description of the
posttranslationally modified proteome of any given cells remains a daunting task. The overarching mission of
our program is to: (1) develop cutting-edge quantitative proteomic approaches to systematically identify and
characterize novel PTMs, (2) comprehensively interrogate the signaling events regulated by phosphorylation
(mTOR pathways) and ADP-ribosylation (PARP pathways), and (3) combine these systems biology
approaches with classical biochemical, cell biology and animal experiments to decipher the molecular
underpinnings of cell growth and stress responses that are controlled by these two important pathways. To
accomplish these goals, we will leverage our preliminary results (including a large set of unique hits, reagents
and methods), and center our efforts on the following six goals. First, we will develop innovative mass
spectrometric technologies with dramatically improved performance for global, quantitative and site-specific
analysis of novel PTMs. Second, we will investigate the role of IGFBP5 (a recently identified extracellular target
of mTORC1) as a mediator of the “non-cell autonomous” function of mTORC1. Third, we will determine the role
of EGR1 (a novel hit identified from our previous MS screen) as a master regulator of the mTORC1-dependent
feedback loops. Fourth, we will generate a tissue-specific atlas of mTORC1 phosphorylation substrates, and in
doing so, interrogate non-uniform effects of this important pathway on the physiology of different tissues. Fifth,
we will develop a large-scale MS approach to site-specific characterization of the D/E-mono-ADP-ribosylated
proteome, and finally we will develop a large-scale method to measure absolute protein PARylation
stoichiometries. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive framework for the MS identification and
functional characterization of PTMs events linked to cell growth control and stress responses."
10824622,"ABSTRACT
The most common forms of nervous system injury are traumatic lesions to peripheral nerves. Although axonal
regeneration in the periphery is more robust than in the central nervous system, neuronal regeneration is often
incomplete and associated with partial or complete loss of motor and sensory function, and the development of
neuropathic pain. After injury, the distal portion of severed nerve fibers shed their myelin sheath and rapidly
disintegrate, a process called Wallerian degeneration (WD). Blood-borne immune cells rapidly enter the injured
nerve to aid repair Schwann cells (rSC) and nerve resident macrophages (Mφ) in the removal of degenerated
myelin and axon remnants. Additionally, Mφ contribute to nerve debridement by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells
(AC) that accumulate in the injured nerve, a process termed efferocytosis. Clearance of AC before they undergo
lysis is critical to prevent secondary necrosis. Moreover, efferocytosis triggers Mφ reprogramming from a pro- to
anti-inflammatory phenotype. This process has only recently been identified as a function of Mφ after sciatic
nerve injury. The receptor mechanism of Mφ efferocytosis and its importance to nerve repair remain unknown.
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of injured mouse sciatic nerve identified Mφ subpopulations
expressing low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1), a well characterized phagocytic receptor that
has been linked to Mφ efferocytosis and reprogramming in non-neural models of inflammation and injury. The
goal of this proposal is to understand whether efferocytosis is a unique function of specific Mφ subpopulations
and how it contributes to overall nerve health after injury. The central hypothesis to be tested is that
efferocytosis is a macrophage subpopulation specific function mediated by LRP1 to facilitate
macrophage reprogramming, inflammation resolution, and axon regeneration. To test this hypothesis, two
Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use a combination of FACS and scRNA-seq of phagocytic cells isolated
from injured nerves of mouse lines expressing fluorescent reporters labeling either neutrophils or myelin to
determine whether Mφ subpopulations exist that are specialized for efferocytosis or myelin phagocytosis,
respectively. Aim 2 will assess the contribution of Lrp1 to Mφ function and nerve recovery using a genetic mouse
model in which Lrp1 is conditionally ablated in monocytes and Mφ (Lrp1 cKO). Efferocytosis will be assessed by
adoptively transferring neutrophils isolated from CD45.1;tdTomato “universal donor” mice into Lrp1 cKO mice on
a CD45.2+ background. Inflammation and neural repair in the absence of Lrp1 in Mφ will be assessed using a
combination of molecular, biochemical and behavioral assays. The proposed studies are expected to reveal a
targetable mechanism in a specific Mφ population that impacts inflammation resolution, functional recovery, and
pain development after acute nerve trauma. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
immune cells contribute to neural repair may provide new avenues for treating peripheral nervous system injury
and disease."
10825355,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in both
hospital- and community-acquired infections. The appearance of multidrug-resistant strains has compounded
this problem, galvanizing efforts aimed at identifying new therapeutic targets. Staphylococcal infections are
characterized by the formation of tissue abscesses which represent the primary site of interaction between a
bacterial microcolony and the innate immune response of the host. We have discovered that the staphylococcal
abscess exhibits remarkable molecular heterogeneity, challenging efforts focused on designing therapeutics or
vaccines for the treatment and prevention of S. aureus infections. In this proposal, we will address this challenge
through the development of a cutting-edge multi-modal imaging platform that will define the molecular inventory
of the S. aureus abscess and reveal the contribution of host antimicrobials to the molecular composition of this
infectious interface.
 This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal
imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for
studying microbial communities and tissue abscesses. Our unique approach will reveal the proteins, lipids, small
molecules, and transcripts that define the staphylococcal abscess. Through genetic inactivation of critical innate
immune effectors, we will uncover how the host response to infection drives alterations in these lesions. These
experiments will test the hypotheses that exposure to environmental stresses encountered within the host have
a powerful effect on molecular abundance and distribution within the staphylococcal microcolony, and that the
molecular environment of the abscess is highly variable and changes according to the stage of abscess
development.
 Taken together, our next-generation imaging capability will (i) map molecular heterogeneity within
microbial communities in response to environmental stressors, (ii) define molecular heterogeneity in tissue
abscesses, and (iii) determine molecular profiles and discover spatio-molecular host and microbial factors that
define the lifecycle of the staphylococcal abscess. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic
intervention against this important human pathogen, and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal
will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research."
10828398,"Project Summary
The killing of target cells by therapeutic antibodies is expanding the effective treatment options for a wide
range of autoimmune diseases and cancers. Mounting evidence from mouse models, humanized mouse
systems and the analysis of human tissues, indicates that macrophages are principal effectors of therapeutic
antibodies, mediating the destruction of infected, malignant and immunologically aberrant cells. Fcγ receptors
(FcR) on the surface of macrophages bind target-cell associated monoclonal IgG class antibodies (mAbs) to
initiate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and killing of the target cell. Patient responses to
mAb therapies can vary from complete remission to minimal therapeutic effect. One poorly explored possibility
is that the variability of the ADCP response is its dependence on macrophage polarization under the influence
of immune modulation. Specifically, immunosuppressive environments alter macrophage polarization leading
to ineffective ADCP. Conversely, stimulators of interferon genes agonists (STINGa), acting through type 1
interferons (IFN-1) can dramatically potentiate ADCP and overcome immunosuppression.
Our overarching goal is to elucidate the mechanistic pathways by which macrophage activation controls FcR
function and ADCP using a systems biology approach across in vivo transcriptomics and whole genome
CRISPR screens. Identified gene-function relationships for ADCP will be validated in a novel vivo model and
translated to human macrophages and therapeutic antibodies. We hypothesize that ADCP is regulated across
major axes of macrophage polarization (M0, M1(IFNγ/LPS), M(IFN-1/STING), M2(IL4/13) and M(S)) by
gene-expression changes of yet undefined genes that modulate the A:I ratios of FcRs, their signaling machinery
and innate cellular recognition receptors. Our proposal has two innovative aims that will vastly expand
understanding of the regulation FcR-dependent ADCP. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the macrophage genes
contributing to differential FcR function and ADCP across M1, M(IFN-1/STING), M2 and M(S). This aim takes
advantage of a new CRISPR-based whole genome screening strategy to identify genes that promote and inhibit
ADCP in primary derived macrophages. Aim 2 will delineate macrophage gene regulation supporting FcR
function and ADCP in vivo. Here we will translate findings from patient data and the CRISPR screen from Aim
1 to define regulators of ADCP in vivo. Both aims will focus on clinically relevant anti-B cell (Rituximab) and
anti-T cell (CAMPATH) antibodies, and will generate findings that extend our understanding of Fc-dependent
killing mechanism of ADCP."
10828405,"Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by the presence of subjective
cognitive complaints and slow gait. MCR affects almost in 1 in 10 older adults, and has a high incidence in aging.
MCR predicts risk of both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia even after accounting for clinical
overlap with Mild Cognitive Impairment syndrome (MCI). Complex cognitive tests or laboratory assays are not
required for diagnosing MCR, increasing its clinical utility. MCR has incremental predictive validity for dementia
over its individual cognitive (cognitive complaints) and motoric (slow gait) components. Yet, the biological
underpinnings of MCR are not yet established. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to establish a
consortium of eight cohorts with ~11,000 community-dwelling older adults with clinical phenotypes,
biological/genetic, and neuroimaging data; a time and cost efficient approach to examine the biology of MCR.
Aim 1. Identify biological mechanisms underlying MCR incidence. Modifiable risk factors for incident MCR
include depressive symptoms, obesity, and low physical activity; which are correlated with each other as well as
share common biological derangements in inflammatory, oxidative stress and vascular pathways. We also linked
Alzheimer and obesity-related polygenic risk scores to prevalent MCR at cross-section. Building on these
findings, we will examine biomarkers and polygenic risk of developing incident MCR. We will test our hypotheses
primarily in individual cohorts and secondarily in a pooled sample of 8,300 individuals with biomarker data.
Aim 2. Establish neuroanatomical substrates of MCR syndrome. We linked a novel gray matter atrophy
network to MCR at cross-section in 3 of our cohorts, which was composed of areas linked primarily, but not
exclusively, to motor control. Herein, we will examine if this brain network is vulnerable early in MCR, and predicts
incident MCR. This aim will be tested primarily in individual cohorts, and secondarily in a pooled subsample of
~2,120 individuals with 3T MRIs. Furthermore, in a subset of 1,100 individuals with up to 3 serial MRIs, we will
examine longitudinal changes in this unique brain network in the context of MCR and small vessel disease.
Aim 3. Compare and contrast biology and brain substrates for MCR and MCI syndromes. We will explore
similarities and differences in new biological associations as well as known AD risk factors with MCR and MCI.
There is only partial clinical overlap between MCR and MCI. While we expect partial biological overlap, our
studies show exclusive genetic predispositions, brain pathologies and brain substrates for MCR not seen with
MCI. The MCR syndrome is not conceptualized as an alternate to MCI but complementary."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects over one billion adults and is an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, in randomized clinical trials (RCT), treatment of OSA has failed to
demonstrate a beneficial impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular (CVD) event
rates in this population. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the non-significant RCTs are not due to lack of
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectiveness but instead due to suboptimal CPAP adherence,
variability in the clinical presentation of OSA as well as the heterogeneity of treatment effect with CPAP.
Notably, no study has applied machine learning (ML) to multimodal data that extends beyond
polysomnography to identify individuals at enhanced risk for atherosclerosis progression or experiencing CVD
events. The 2021 NIH Sleep Research Plan identified critical and high-priority areas for further research,
including leveraging ML analytic approaches for big data to advance our understanding of sleep disorders and
assist in the personalization of treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to apply ML to well-characterized
datasets with multimodal data to develop separate prediction tools for predicting incident CVD events (Aim 1),
and heterogeneity of treatment effect with CPAP in OSA patients (Aim 2). We will then validate the models
using real-world electronic health records to ensure their generalizability and clinical relevance (Aim 3). This
groundbreaking proposal aims to revolutionize the management of OSA patients by developing prediction tools
using multimodal data and cutting-edge ML techniques, resulting in a more personalized approach to care that
can improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of OSA-related CVD events. These decision tools will be
readily integrated into the clinical environment, guiding treatment decisions and assisting sleep physicians in
determining which patients should avoid CPAP use and which OSA patients should be prioritized for CPAP
treatment, optimizing treatment plans and reducing healthcare costs."

 Binge drinking (defined as drinking five or more drinks on one occasion for men, and four or more drinks
for women), is highly prevalent in the US. Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the 80,000 annual deaths
attributed to excessive alcohol consumption and its economic costs exceeds $191 billion in the US. National HIV
Behavioral Surveillance data indicate that 48% of heterosexual men, 58% of men who have sex with men, and
40% of heterosexual women reported binge drinking (past 30 days). Binge drinking has been independently
associated with condomless sex and HIV infection. Binge drinking is by far the most prevalent exposure linked
to HIV infections. Current interventions for binge drinking and binge-drinking associated sexual behaviors remain
limited. Most binge drinkers have never participated in alcohol or drug treatment programs and the vast majority
of binge drinkers (90%) do not meet criteria for severe AUD. Real-time data on binge drinking and sexual
episodes around binge drinking can inform interventions and there is a great need to examine the psychosocial
factors that precede and predict these behaviors—i.e., the antecedents of binge alcohol and binge-drinking
associated sexual risk behaviors. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) is a method of collecting real-time
data about an individual’s behaviors and experiences, often administered via cell phones. EMA can capture the
contextual factors and circumstances preceding drinking behaviors, thereby providing a more nuanced
understanding of the immediate antecedents of binge drinking. Recent advances in biosensor technology include
the availability of wrist-worn monitors that can collect data on alcohol use, estimate number of drinks, and identify
binge drinking episode using transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC). Hence, real-time data from EMA and
biosensors for TAC can identifying high-risk situations and opportunities for personalized interventions. This
study will develop risk prediction models for binge drinking and binge-drinking associated sexual behavior, which
can ultimately help inform the development ecological momentary interventions (EMI) that will target high risk
periods for binge drinking and binge-drinking associated sexual behaviors.
Research Design Summary: This study, entitled “BEATS: Binge drinking Ecological Antecedents with
Transdermal alcohol monitoring Study,” will enroll 100 sexually-active adults who binge drink alcohol and assess
real-time antecedents for binge-drinking and binge-drinking associated sexual behaviors using EMA during a 30-
day follow-up. Participants will also wear a small wrist biosensor that will track alcohol consumption and measure
TAC continuously for 30 days. Data from the EMA and TAC will be analyzed using machine learning approaches
to develop algorithms that predict risk for binge drinking (Aim 1) and binge-drinking associated sexual behaviors
(Aim 2). We will also examine the feasibility and acceptability of EMA and biosensors in this population (Aim 3).
Ultimately, findings will be used to inform future EMA-informed interventions."
10828366,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The central nervous system (CNS) requires a tightly controlled environment free of various toxins and
pathogens to provide the proper chemical composition for synaptic transmission. This environment is
maintained by the `blood brain barrier' (BBB), which is composed of highly specialized blood vessels whose
endothelial cells display specialized tight junctions and unusually low rates of transcellular vesicular transport
(transcytosis). In concert with pericytes and astrocytes, this unique brain endothelial physiological barrier seals
the CNS and controls substance influx and efflux. While BBB breakdown has recently been associated to
initiation and perpetuation of various neurological disorders, an intact BBB is a major obstacle for drug delivery
to the CNS. A limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control BBB formation has hampered
our ability to manipulate the BBB in disease. Our recent discoveries changed our understanding of what
makes the BBB impermeable. The BBB is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells that lines the walls of
the brain's blood vessels. Historically, the restrictive feature of BBB has been attributed to the specialized tight
junctions between adjacent endothelial cells. However, substances can also cross the endothelial layer by
transcytosis, when material enters endocytic vesicles that are trafficked across the cell. We discovered that
transcytosis is actively inhibited in brain endothelial cells to ensure BBB integrity. Our findings suggest that
molecular pathways inhibiting transcytosis could be targeted to open the BBB for CNS therapeutics.We have
also identified over 200 BBB candidate genes that are enriched in CNS endothelial cells compared to periphery
endothelial cells. I propose to launch major new efforts leading to a major expansion in the scope of our work
in the field of BBB. I will take the next eight years to bring my lab to the next level to (1) identify the full list of
key BBB regulators in CNS endothelial cells, (2) understand what signals from non-endothelial cells maintain
and regulate BBB permeability, and (3) determine how BBB permeability dynamically changes during different
physiological and pathological conditions. We will also begin to work on translating findings from these studies
to therapies. We will use a combination of mouse genetics, imaging, molecular, cell biology, and biochemical
approaches. The experiments described here represent a major expansion in the scope of our work. Achieving
the goals outlined here could have a major impact on neurology, enabling clinicians to open the BBB for
transient delivery of drugs to the CNS, and conversely to close the BBB to slow the progression of
neurodegenerative diseases. Given the transcriptome screens we have recently performed, the model systems
we have devised, and the imaging tools we have recently developed, my lab is in a unique position to reveal
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the BBB."
10825741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ)
plaques, tau tangles, neuroimmune activation, and synaptotoxicity. Recent immunotherapies have focused on
oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ species to slow or halt symptom progression with limited success, and this remains
an active space for therapeutic development. Activation of microglial phagocytosis presents a promising strategy
to utilize an intrinsic protein quality-control mechanism to counteract the hallmark protein aggregation in AD.
Additionally, a disease-associated microglia (DAM) subpopulation appears in response to AD and several
different neurodegenerative diseases, and accelerating DAM appearance could successfully counteract Aβ
plaque pathology. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms and regulatory checkpoints promoting DAM
activation are still not completely understood. Depletion of Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) in mice is strongly associated
with increased lysosomal and phagocytic activity, but the implications of increasing these pathways in microglia
in an AD context has yet to be examined. Additionally, knockout of Nlk successfully ameliorates both protein
aggregation and behavioral deficits in a murine TDP43-associated proteinopathy model. This Nlk deletion also
induces the expression lysosomal and phagocytic genes that are also upregulated in the homeostatic microglia
to DAM transition. Given this rationale, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that depletion of microglial Nlk
in a murine model of AD will increase phagocytic degradation of Aβ, significantly improve AD phenotypes, and
induce microglia differentiation from a homeostatic state to DAM. Therefore, this proposal aims to measure AD
symptom progression using (1) histopathological markers of disease etiology and (2) behavioral paradigms
assessing cognition and working memory. Biochemical and histological analyses will identify the effect of Nlk
loss on Aβ plaque formation, levels of soluble Aβ oligomers and fibrils, microgliosis, and synapse loss.
Separately, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) will assess a conditional Nlk knockout produces
transcriptional changes required for the DAM transition. If the hypothesis is supported, activation of microglia
could present a holistic strategy for counteracting the characteristic protein aggregation in neurodegenerative
proteinopathies. This proposed project will be completed in Dr. Janghoo Lim’s lab in the Yale Departments of
Neuroscience and Department of Genetics. This unique environment will provide the skills and training in both
scRNAseq pipelines and neuro-immune interactions required to successfully complete these aims. The overall
environment at Yale University and within the Yale Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program also provides
opportunities to develop scientific communication and mentoring skills with specific efforts towards diversity,
equity, and inclusion. The proposed fellowship training will prepare the applicant to be a successful independent
researcher studying the role of glia and neuro-immune interactions in the context of neurodegeneration."
10832004,"Abstract
 Genetic mutation and non-mutational epigenetic control of gene expression that alter transcription
programs in normal and perturbed cells often lead to pathological phenotypes requiring medical attention.
Identifying the gene targets and pathways underlying these abnormalities, particularly in cancer cells, is crucial
for developing appropriate regimens for disease treatment. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of cancer cells
makes it difficult to develop a universal treatment plan that works for every patient.
 Over the past 10 years, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has emerged as a promising cancer
therapeutic target due to its broad association with active enhancers that modulate transcription programs
implicated in cancer initiation and progression, and importantly, the availability of small compound inhibitors
targeting BRD4 and its related family members that also include BRD2, BRD3, and BRDT in humans. These
bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family protein inhibitors, such as JQ1 and I-BET, show great promise in
reversing cancer phenotypes in cultured cells and animal models. Several of these compound derivatives are
now in clinical trials for treating various types of cancer and inflammatory disease, and their therapeutic targets
have been attributed mainly to the BRD4 long isoform (BRD4-L, aa 1-1362). Recently we found, by isoform-
specific knockdown and endogenous protein detection along with transgene expression, that the less abundant
BRD4 short isoform (BRD4-S, aa 1-722) is in fact oncogenic while BRD4-L is tumor-suppressive in breast
cancer cell proliferation and migration as well as in mammary tumor formation and metastasis. Our central
hypothesis is that BRD4 isoforms have opposing functions, although they do share some common properties,
in tumor development, which will be stringently tested by addressing the following three specific aims:
1. To define the biological role of BRD4-L and BRD4-S in different breast cancer cells and mouse models
2. To elucidate the mechanistic action of BRD4 isoforms and their coregulators in breast cancer subtypes
3. To identify gene targets and pathways uniquely and commonly regulated by BRD4 isoforms
 Since isoform-specific BRD4 antibodies and a new class of phospho-BRD4-targeting compounds with
molecular action distinct from the BET bromodomain inhibitors have now been successfully developed in my
lab, we are in a unique position to address pressing issues implicated in BRD4-targeted cancer therapy. Our
immediate goals are to identify cellular pathways uniquely and commonly regulated by each BRD4 isoform
using biochemical and molecular tools, synthetic chemistry, and genome-wide expression and binding profiling
to elucidate BRD4-L and BRD4-S involvement in breast cancer. Our eventual goals are to provide validated
molecular pathways and new gene targets for effective breast cancer treatment in the near future."
10859828,"Project Summary
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a life-long, serious psychiatric disorder that affects 2-3% of the
population and is associated with high personal and societal costs. Genetic factors are undoubtedly important in
the etiology in OCD, and associated loci and genes are just beginning to be discovered. Studies by us and by
others have shown that rare and ultra-rare variation, the latter including recent variation, plays an important role
in risk for OCD. In ongoing sequencing studies, we are identifying genes impacted by such variation, using
samples collected by the investigators in this application. In this proposal, we take an important new direction to
address a critical gap in OCD research by recruiting subjects of self-reported African ancestry (African-American;
AA), a group poorly represented in OCD research and not previously represented in OCD genetic research. In
fact, AA individuals with OCD are vastly underrepresented, or altogether absent, from treatment centers and
research studies, in spite of the evidence for 1) disparities in access to treatment, 2) persistent OCD due to lack
of treatment, and, 3) differences in OCD subtypes in AA populations, as well as, 4) Covid-19 pandemic amplified
mental-health disparities (including OCD and anxiety disorders). In this proposal, we will systematically
investigate the phenotypes of OCD in AA populations, and use high-throughput sequencing to identify rare single
nucleotide variation (SNV), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variation (SV) contributing to OCD
susceptibility in this population. To further our understanding of OCD in AA populations we propose the following
Specific Aims: 1) To recruit at least 1,250 African American OCD participants and compare phenotypic findings
and genetic architecture across ancestries; and, 2) to carry out genetic association studies for ultra-rare variants
in the African American cohort and across ancestries. With this new research we will accelerate our overall
objective, which is the identification of OCD genes across diverse populations, thereby facilitating our long-term
goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for OCD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to OCD and associated disorders can form the basis of studies
to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis – formulated based
on recent results – is that rare genetic variation contributes significantly to risk of OCD, with certain rare variants
conferring substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking
and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for OCD in AA populations, involving a systematic effort
to investigate OCD genetic architecture across populations. The research will increase the number of known
OCD genes, expand our knowledge of networks and pathways that are disrupted in subjects with OCD, and
determine whether recent deleterious variation differs across ancestry. These outcomes are expected to have
important positive impact, leading to a molecular understanding of OCD, identifying targets for novel
therapeutics, and aiding in gene and locus discovery across ancestries."
10861305,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Childhood brain tumor survivors are at significant risk for cognitive and social-emotional difficulties, which are
associated with reduced quality of life. With a growing survivor population, efforts to offset the burden survivors
endure following life-saving treatments are imperative. Nearly half of all childhood cancer diagnoses occur in
children under 5 years of age. Young age at diagnosis is the most consistent risk factor for cognitive late
effects due to a rapidly developing brain, and disruption to the early learning environment. Medulloblastoma is
the most common metastatic brain tumor in infants, with aggressive and lengthy treatment required for cure. A
primary goal of this research program is development of interventions that mitigate the impact of cancer and
cancer therapies on cognitive outcomes of childhood cancer survivors. Current interventions exclusively target
children 4 years and older, despite extensive evidence that influencing early cognitive development has the
potential for significant clinical impact. A caregiver educational program (CEP) has been designed to improve
understanding of the importance of the early learning environment on child brain development. This CEP can
be combined with a set of interactive neurodevelopmental games (INDG) designed for parents to play with
their children to strengthen brain pathways for specific skills, at times when each brain pathway is particularly
sensitive to life experiences. Studies have shown this CEP+INDG is effective in teaching key developmental
neuroscience concepts to caregivers, with significant associated improvement in parent-child interactions and
child problem-solving skills. Families of infants with brain tumors are an ideal target for CEP+INDG given these
children are highly vulnerable, have no research supported intervention options, and evidence for intervention
efficacy. There have been no studies investigating either intervention in children undergoing cancer treatment.
Accordingly, the specific aims of this study are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of CEP+INDG
(i.e., enrollment, completion and satisfaction rates) in infants undergoing medulloblastoma treatment; 2) To
estimate the magnitude of change in caregiver-child interactions (connection and reciprocity using validated
behavioral coding) following intervention; and 3) To estimate the magnitude of change in cognition and social-
emotional development associated with intervention. We propose a single-blind (examiner), randomized
controlled trial for infants (0-36 months) undergoing medulloblastoma treatment. Participants will be
randomized (2:1) to CEP+INDG or standard of care (SOC). One to two months after initiating chemotherapy,
caregivers in the intervention group will participate in a tailored 60 minute CEP. They will then receive 30 text
prompts over a 3 month period to access INDG on their phone; age appropriate games are selected that can
be completed in any setting. INDG records frequency and timing of game access. Both groups will complete
pre- and post-intervention/SOC assessments of caregiver-child interactions and child development. We will
recruit until 40 dyads have completed post assessments. Study results will inform a larger randomized trial."
10861363,"Objectives: The bone loss after a spinal cord injury (SCI) is particularly rapid, progressive, and severe, which
predisposes to an increased risk for fractures that results in hospitalization, increased cost, and decreased
quality of life. The rate of bone loss after SCI is at least an order of magnitude greater than that of postmeno-
pausal osteoporosis. About 25-46% of persons with SCI may have a fracture over their lifetime. Importantly, risk
of fracture may preclude upright activity-based rehabilitation and/or use of the promising exoskeleton techno-
logies (e.g., ReWalk or eLegs) and, possibly in the future, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation for ambulation
and advances in neurorepair. Despite the pressing nature of this problem, to date, there is no practical approach
to safely and efficaciously treat bone loss and fracture in Veterans with chronic SCI. This application will address
the critical need for an effective and safe therapeutic approach for paralyzed Veterans with bone fragility. Anti-
Siglec-15 antibody (Ab) can inhibit osteoclast fusion and maturation, but does not inhibit the formation of mono-
nuclear pre-osteoclasts, thus maintaining the beneficial communication between bone resorption and formation.
These unique features make Siglec-15 Ab distinct from the current anti-resorptive agents that inhibit the activity
of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which is believed to be a major factor associated with their questionable
efficacy in reversing bone loss in those with chronic SCI and the rare, but devasting, side effects of atypical
femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw. The potentially safer therapeutic profile of Siglec-15 Ab also makes
it feasible to be used for longer periods of time to treat bone loss in Veterans with chronic SCI compared to the
anti-resorptive or bone anabolic agents currently on the market. The latter agents are approved by the FDA to
be prescribed only for 1-2 years due to the safety concerns, which would limit their utility in those with chronic
SCI. We have recently demonstrated that Siglec-15 Ab (NP159) almost fully prevents the SCI-induced loss of
bone mass and preserves trabecular micro-architecture in a rat model of acute SCI. NP159 decreases osteoclast
maturation and bone resorption while increasing osteoblastogenesis to maintain bone formation, a process that
involves the regulation of microRNA (miR)-183. We also found that the targeted deletion of Siglec-15 allele
inhibits bone loss after SCI. A recent report has shown that NP159 promotes bone formation and fracture healing
in animal models. The overall goal of this project is to extend our earlier findings and further develop Siglec-15
Ab as a novel treatment option with unique anti-resorptive activity and bone anabolic properties to reverse the
marked sublesional bone loss to a clinically relevant degree and to improve skeletal integrity and fracture healing
in Veterans with chronic SCI. To achieve our goal, the following preclinical and mechanistic studies will be
conducted in a rodent model of chronic SCI: 1) To test the hypothesis that NP159 administration can significantly
restore bone mass and improve skeletal integrity/strength to address the critical needs in Veterans with chronic
SCI through miR-183-mediated potent anti-resorptive action while maintaining or, possibly, increasing bone
formation; 2) To determine whether NP159 administration can promote bone fracture healing in chronic SCI.
Significance: The blockade of Siglec-15 to preserve skeletal health after chronic SCI is original and innovative.
If efficacious, the proposed intervention can be quickly deployed in clinical trial and, ultimately, care of Veterans
with chronic SCI to improve skeletal integrity and fracture healing, and hold the promise of increasing the number
of individuals who would be eligible for rehabilitation strategies (exoskeletal-assisted walking, spinal cord
stimulation) or other modalities for gait to allow functional independence. The knowledge and insight from this
work will be applicable to other conditions of osteoporosis associated with neurologic etiologies (e.g., stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, ALS and multiple sclerosis), chronic immobilization and disuse (e.g., spaceflight), or
activity-limiting rheumatological diseases. This line of research is novel and highly relevant to the VA’s mission
to improve healthcare, function and quality of life in Veterans with SCI or other medical conditions or diseases."
10839354,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Within the United States, musculoskeletal disease affects more than half of people aged 18 and over and nearly
three out of four aged 65 and over. The impact of musculoskeletal disease will become even more pronounced
with the increase in the aging population. Mechanistic research that is integrated with clinical need is imperative
to develop new treatment approaches, yet there is a stark mismatch between funding levels in musculoskeletal
research and its financial and personal toll on our healthcare system. Our institution and the orthopaedic
community, due to a lack of integrated programs, have struggled to overcome the disconnect between
mechanistic research in musculoskeletal health and effective translation into the clinic. We developed the
MUsculoSkeletal Clinical Learning Experience (MUSCLE) T32 Transdisciplinary Training Program at UC Davis
to meet this need. The overall objective of this training program is to increase the number of biomedical scientists
trained in musculoskeletal-related research with an emphasis on understanding clinical needs and obstacles. A
novel aspect of our program is the frequent interaction and integration of premier musculoskeletal research
faculty with leading clinicians at UC Davis, coupled with co-mentorship by mechanistic and clinical scientists,
providing an elite training experience for future researchers in musculoskeletal health. The objective of the
MUSCLE T32 is to provide two years of funded, transdisciplinary, integrated research training to develop
predoctoral students into researchers capable of solving issues relevant to the understanding, prevention, and
treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. This unique and integrated format benefits from co-directorship by
mechanistic and clinical researchers alike, coordinating a select group of exemplary engineers, biologists,
materials scientists, veterinarians, and human clinicians to co-mentor our students, in combination with a
carefully designed, flexible curriculum that provides in-depth training for predoctoral students in musculoskeletal
health research. With the recruitment of 3 new participants each year, trainees will partake in several clinical
immersive experiences, where they will discuss the needs of the clinician and how research advancements can
address these challenges. Our program emphasizes fundamentals in research techniques that broaden research
training at the bench with quantitative skills, provides opportunities for public speaking and outreach, builds
proposal writing skills, provides a range of enriching extracurricular opportunities, and integrates medicine and
science/engineering throughout all years of training. Defined oversight mechanisms are in place to track the
progress of the 15 trainees throughout the program. By training in an environment and culture that gives strong
interdisciplinary support for mechanistic research and frequent clinical engagement, there is a significant
probability that the trainees will sustain an interest in musculoskeletal health research over their careers."
10839355,"Lyme disease has emerged as a major public health threat in the US. Currently, no human vaccine is available.
Although targeting tick populations with chemical acaricides is an effective way of reducing the risk of infection, the
use of acaricides has adverse health effects and raises environmental concerns. A host-targeted approach by
deploying doxycycline hyclate-laden baits to the field showed dramatic reduction of infection rates in both rodent
reservoirs and Ixodes scapularis ticks by Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. However, antibiotics such
as doxycycline are not suitable for such purpose as they are used for treating patients. Nevertheless, such proof of
concept study demonstrates that a host-targeted approach using alternative compounds is a promising approach to
eliminate spirochetes in rodent reservoir hosts and tick vectors. The bacterial second messengers, c-di-GMP and
c-di-AMP, have emerged as central regulators for bacterial physiology and are potential drug targets. Many bacteria
encode multiple copies of cyclases for the synthesis of c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP, which make it difficult to target
the pathways. Borrelia burgdorferi only has a single diguanylate cyclase Rrp1 and a single diadenylate cyclase
CdaA for c-di-AMP synthesis, which makes them attractive drug targets. As shown in the preliminary data, we found
that these two cyclic dinucleotide, one controls spirochetes’ survival in each of the two hosts in B. burgdorferi
enzootic cycle, ticks and mammals: while c-di-GMP is essential for tick colonization, c-di-AMP is indispensable for
mammalian infection. The hypothesis of this proposal is that small molecule inhibitors targeting c-di-GMP and c-di-
AMP cyclases, Rrp1 and CdaA, would eliminate B. burgdorferi in ticks and mammalian reservoirs, which can be
exploited to reduce Lyme disease incidence. The co-PI of this proposal, Dr. Herman Sintim, a Drug Discovery
Professor of Chemistry, pioneered developing inhibitors for bacterial diguanylate cyclase and diadenylate cyclase,
and his group has already reported several potent inhibitors against these cyclases of other bacteria. Accordingly,
we propose to develop a strategy to target CdaA of B. burgdorferi to eliminate in spirochetes rodent reservoirs (Aim
1), and a strategy to target Rrp1 of B. burgdorferi to eliminate spirochetes in ticks (Aim 2). We will also test a
combination of inhibitors targeting both pathways to eliminate B. burgdorferi in its enzootic cycle. The underlying
mechanisms of how c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP are employed by B. burgdorferi to survive in mammals and ticks will
also be investigate. This proposal address one of the specific Focus Areas listed in this RFA: reservoir-targeted
approaches to interrupt the natural history of infection. Upon accomplishing the proposed work, further field
experiments will be conducted using animal baits containing a combination of both inhibitors to evaluate their effects
on reducing spirochete burden in ticks and animals in nature. Such host-targeted strategy will have significant impact
on combating Lyme disease."
10839357,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an ultimately fatal disease whose only curative treatment is lung
transplant. IPF is characterized by formation of fibrotic lesions in the lung, eventually resulting in
scarring and progressive loss of lung function. Despite some newer treatments, IPF patients still have
a median survival rate of only 3-5 years once diagnosed. Clearly, new therapeutic approaches are
needed to treat this devastating disease. A promising avenue of approach is stem cell therapy. In the
past 8 years, our lab has been developing lung spheroid cells (LSCs) as a novel source of therapeutic
lung cells, and FDA approval of clinical trials with LSC treatment of patients with IPF are being pursued.
Nonetheless, stem cell-based therapy faces several important limitations. Live cells need to be
carefully preserved and processed before usage, and cell transplantation carries certain
immunogenicity and tumorigenicity risks. Importantly, live stem cells cannot be delivered to the lung
via inhalation, which is the most convenient and effective route to deliver therapeutics to the lung.
Recently, we and others have made the novel and exciting observation that many adult stem cells
exert their beneficial effects mainly through secretion of regenerative factors that go on to promote
endogenous repair. In the preliminary studies that form the basis for this application, we have
discovered that secretions from cultured LSCs are just as, if not more, effective than the LSCs
themselves in attenuating and resolving IPF in rodent models of the disease. In the quest for active
components in the LSC secretions, we found that LSCs secrete large numbers of exosomes (30-150
nm vesicles secreted by numerous cell types). We have shown that exosomes derived from LSCs
(LSC-Exo) are therapeutic and regenerative to the injured lung, suggesting these nanostructures are
largely responsible for the reparative response to LSC secretions in rodent models of IPF. It is known
that exosomes carry microRNAs (miRs) cargoes that could play important roles in cell-cell
communication and tissue repair, and indeed we found that LSC-Exo are highly enriched with miR-
30a and Let-7. In this proposed study, we plan to determine safety and efficacy as well as medium
effective dose of LSC-Exo required for lung repair in rodent models of IPF, to determine the major
recipient cells of LSC-Exo in the lung, and determine that the relevant molecular target(s) of exosomal
mediated repair and recovery. We hypothesize that key miRs withing LSC-Exo such as miR-30a and
Let-7 are mediators of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, using the data produced by scRNA-Seq we
will finally determine whether further miR enrichment in these exosomes achieves optimal lung repair.
The development of cell-free or non-living therapeutics derived from stem cells has the potential to
revolutionize current regenerative medicine practice."
10839461,"SUMMARY: In 2017, 19.7 million American adults struggled with substance use disorders, and in 2020, nearly
70,000 people died from opioid-involved overdoses. In opioid dependent individuals, environmental stress
perpetuates cravings, and relapse is associated with strong stress responses and reactivity to drug cues.
Unexpected reward and aversive stimuli affect ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron activity, and
studies neuropharmacological studies have revealed DA released from VTA in dorsal hippocampus (CA1)
regulating contextual learning. Locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) neurons may also release DA, which has
the potential to affect contextual memory and plasticity in CA1. To address how aversive and rewarding contexts
affect the opioid seeking, we must understand the neuropharmacological properties of norepinephrine (NE) and
DA in opioid-associated contextual memory. The initial process of forming memories is acquisition, while after
memories are reactivated, they are considered versatile before being reconsolidated for long term memory.
While we know noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptors have been implicated in opioid contextual processing,
yet there have not yet been clear pharmacological approaches examining endogenous monoamine release
during contextual behavior. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that DA in CA1 is primarily released from
the VTA, and only VTA-DA is necessary for, and LC-NE only enhances, memory acquisition and reconsolidation.
Aim 1A uses two-photon ex vivo imaging and optogenetics with monoamine sensors to determine
spatiotemporal properties of DA release from VTA terminals in dCA1, while Aim 1B will determine spatiotemporal
properties of NE and DA release from LC in CA1. Using ex vivo pharmacology, we will elucidate which
dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms in CA1 influence the release of DA and NE from their source
regions. Aim 2 will tests the necessity of NE and DA sources for morphine or naloxone place preference
reconsolidation and the necessity of NE and DA for preference acquisition. In Aim 2A, we will simultaneously
measure NE and DA dynamics as we pharmacologically inhibit their soma using chemogenetics to determine
the necessity of VTA and LC in memory reconsolidation of a conditioned place preference or aversion. In Aim
2B, we will test the necessity of NE and DA for memory acquisition of conditioned preference or aversion by
using CRISPR gene-editing to knockdown Dbh (NE-producing enzyme) in LC and Th (DA-producing enzyme)
in VTA. This series of in vitro and in vivo neuropharmacology experiments will elucidate monoamine sufficiency
and necessity in contextual processing to further our understanding of the influence of context in opioid seeking.
This proposal will serve as training in neuropharmacology, two-photon optical imaging, optogenetics,
chemogenetics, gene-editing, and behavioral pharmacology approaches. Ultimately, the training outlined in this
proposal will enhance my career development plan as I pursue a position as an independent, academic
researcher."
10863924,"I am a physician-scientist in psychiatry studying neural circuits involved in psychiatric illness using
animal models that enable us to record and manipulate real-time neuronal activity with single-cell resolution.
My career goal is to become an expert on developmental risk factors, microcircuit physiology, and emotional
processing. This career development award will support my work to determine the impact of early life stress
on ventral hippocampal microcircuitry and how this influences anxiety- and anhedonia-related behaviors in
adulthood. Early life stress (ELS) increases the risk of adult psychiatric illnesses, so understanding how ELS
affects the neural circuits controlling emotional behaviors would provide a mechanism for this increased
vulnerability and point towards therapeutic targets. We can model ELS in rodents by inducing fragmented
maternal care in the early postnatal period and then examine neural activity during anxiety-like and reward-
seeking behaviors in adulthood. The ventral portion of the hippocampus is directly connected to both fear
and reward circuits, and heavily involved in emotional processing. The balance between excitatory pyramidal
cells and inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus is important for controlling the flow of information to and
from other regions of these circuits. ELS alters the development of interneurons and decreases excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic density in the hippocampus. We do not yet know how ELS affects hippocampal
excitatory and inhibitory cell activity in vivo and how these changes relate to observed behavioral
differences. This proposal will address these questions through three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will test the
hypothesis that altered anxiety-like behavior and decreased reward-seeking in adult mice after ELS are
correlated with increased pyramidal cell activity in the CA1 output region of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1).
In Aim 2, I will determine the effects of ELS on PV neurons in the vCA1 during development and adulthood.
First, I will test the hypothesis that ELS decreases vCA1 PV cell activity during anxiety-like and reward
behaviors. Then, I will test the hypothesis that precocious expression of PV in the hippocampus after ELS is
associated with changes in global hippocampal neural activity in response to positive and negative stimuli. In
Aim 3, I will test the hypothesis that inhibition of vCA1 PV cell activity in normally-reared adult mice can alter
anxiety- and anhedonia-like behaviors. I will conduct this work within the New York State Psychiatric Institute
and Columbia University under the mentorship of Drs. René Hen and Kevin Bath. The training objectives of
this K08 are to become an expert in in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations in freely moving
mice, animal models for ELS and neurodevelopment, computational techniques for examining task-related
representations in neural firing, and volume microscopy imaging with immunostaining. Upon completing
these scientific aims and training objectives, I will be prepared to transition to the next phase of my career as
an independent investigator directing a research group at an academic medical center."
10864028,"For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of
their life. Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month),
people with epilepsy take anti-seizure drugs (ASD) daily, suffer ASD related side effects, and spend their lives
dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant
psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily ASD, approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have
seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their
psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting.
There is strong evidence that focal epilepsy is associated with a variable seizure risk that may enable adaptive
therapy targeting periods of high seizure probability. Periods of low seizure probability could require lower
ASD doses, reducing exposure and side effects. We propose that high seizure probability states will respond to
adaptive electrical brain stimulation (aEBS). In addition, patients could alter their activities during periods of
high seizure probability to reduce injury and manage their ASD and activities.
The hypotheses driving this proposal are that 1.) seizures can be prevented (reduced incidence) by targeted
EBS therapy during the pre-ictal state 2.) seizures are not random events, and that brain states associated with
low and high seizure probability can be reliably classified using machine learning methods applied to
physiologic signals and used to adaptively change EBS parameters. 3.) Furthermore, we propose forecasting
can be improved using multi-modal features beyond passive iEEG recordings, including active brain probing
with electrical stimulation (impedance & evoked potentials), core temperature, ECG and serum immunological
markers. Goal: Develop reliable seizure forecasting (>90% sensitivity) with few false positives (<1% time in
warning) and demonstrate modulation of seizure risk and reduction of focal seizures using aEBS."
10862256,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a permanent condition affecting every aspect of life including health, daily
activities, and participation and quality of life. Persons with SCI are at high risk of pressure injury (PrI)
throughout their lives due to loss of sensation, nerve damage and immobility. PrIs are local areas of
damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue caused by pressure and shear commonly located over
bony prominences. While most PrIs are hospital- or nursing home-acquired, in people with SCI, PrIs
typically develop in the community. Community-acquired pressure injuries (CAPrIs) are common,
devastating, and costly. This grant proposal is a type 1 hybrid stepped wedge randomized design at six
additional SCI Clinics to assess the efficacy and implementation of a decision support tool, called the
Community Acquired Pressure Injury Prevention Field Implementation Tool (CAPP-FIT) previously
developed and piloted at one site. The CAPP-FIT includes: 1) a Veteran survey to identify risks,
actions, and resources needed to prevent CAPrIs and 2) a companion Provider Report immediately
available in print or downloaded into the electronic health record listing Veteran responses to survey
items with recommended evidence-based provider actions. The Veteran survey can be completed at
home via a secured email or by using an iPad in the clinic. There are three aims in the proposal, guided
by the RE-AIM framework. Aim 1 is implementing the CAPP-FIT at the seven geographically diverse
VA SCI clinics, including workflow redesign, provider training, and evaluation of provider readiness. The
CAPP-FIT will be implemented in a staggered fashion consistent with the stepped wedge design. After
CAPP-FIT implementation, each site will determine how the CAPP-FIT will be maintained in clinical
practice to support sustainability (maintenance phase). Aim 2 assesses efficacy, assessing provider
and Veteran satisfaction in CAPrI use, new CAPrI incidence for 6 months post-initial CAPP-FIT
implementation, and overall and CAPrI-associated hospitalizations. Aim 3 assesses implementation
using RE-AIM. Reach is the proportion of providers and Veterans participating in the intervention.
Adoption is assessed by the proportion of Veteran-identified modifiable risk factors acted upon by SCI
providers, as well as a comparison of non-modifiable risk factors of participating and non-participating
VA SCI clinics. Implementation is assessed by describing completed CAPP-FITs during
implementation, describing Veteran CAPrI risk factors, and describing provider identified facilitators and
barriers to implementation. Maintenance is assessed by describing how each clinic will continue to
integrate CAPP-FIT into workflow and by describing the number of providers using the CAPP-FIT
during maintenance phase."

Patients with opioid misuse disproportionately utilize emergency health services and are at increased risk for
premature death. The timely and accurate identification of patients with opioid misuse in the Emergency
Department (ED) is critical to provide evidence-based interventions to decrease mortality. Challenges to opioid
misuse detection in the ED include provider time constraints, inconsistent screening approaches, and patient
barriers to self-reporting. Advanced analytic techniques such as machine learning and cluster analyses offer
promise in efficiently characterizing and identifying patients with opioid misuse during their ED encounter by
leveraging data within the electronic health record (EHR) and the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP).
The role of machine learning approaches utilizing multiple data sources to identify ED patients with opioid misuse
has yet to be fully explored. In aim 1, multiple machine learning algorithms using ED encounter data will be
developed for the identification of opioid misuse. Models will be systematically assessed for social biases and
mitigation strategies implemented to ensure equity in model performance. In aim 2, the inclusion of longitudinal
PDMP data for the identification of ED patients with opioid misuse will be evaluated by building models from both
data sources utilizing ensemble stacking methods. Finally, in aim 3, an unsupervised latent class analysis model
will be built to identify clinically relevant subphenotypes of ED patients with opioid misuse, describe their
characteristics, and determine patient-oriented outcomes. An innovative approach to the detection of ED patients
with opioid misuse will be pursued by rigorously testing machine learning models utilizing multiple data sources,
conducting social bias assessments prior to clinical deployment, and characterizing latent groups of patients with
opioid misuse. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (Dr. Neeraj
Chhabra) possesses a strong foundation in emergency care, medical toxicology, substance use research, and
biostatistics. Through this K23, he will further develop skills in data science to build comprehensive and scalable
models spanning multiple data domains for the identification of patients with opioid misuse. The multidisciplinary
mentorship team led by his primary mentor (Dr. Niranjan Karnik) and co-mentors (Dr. Majid Afshar, Dr. Harold
Pollack, and Dr. Gail D’Onofrio) consists of nationally renowned experts in the fields of substance use research,
machine learning, natural language processing, and clinical ethics. Through an integrated program of formal
coursework, ethics training, mentorship, and research, Dr. Chhabra will develop the skillset necessary to
complete these aims and transition to independent investigation. His proposal takes full advantage of the
combined resources provided by the affiliated institutions of Cook County Health and Rush University Medical
Center. Dr. Chhabra’s long-term goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to focus treatments and resources
towards patients with opioid misuse within the ED setting. This K23 award provides the necessary foundation to
pursue this goal and will form the basis for future R01 proposals evaluating the clinical impact of these models."

10863988,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Despite decades of research and growing public awareness, obesity affects Black children from low-income
households disproportionately. This leads to disparities in obesity, cardiovascular disease, and several other
co-morbidities in adulthood. Parents play an important role in obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention by
shaping their child’s dietary and lifestyle behaviors early in life. However, Black parents from low-income
households face numerous socioeconomic barriers. Parents from these communities seek tangible and
practical lifestyle advice that can be implemented despite these barriers. While health care providers in the
primary care setting are often tasked with providing this advice and empowering parents to implement lifestyle
behavior change, they lack efficient, effective, culturally relevant, and engaging tools that can convey the
intergenerational risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease and facilitate changes in lifestyle behaviors for all
members of the family. My long term goal as an independent researcher is to improve child health outcomes
through a career focused on reducing disparities in obesity and its comorbidities by designing family-centered,
bio-behavioral interventions that evoke motivation to change, facilitate progression to actionable steps, and
augment the maintenance of behavior change in families from low-income households and minority racial
groups. The objective of this study is to develop, assess, and evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and
preliminary efficacy of two visual communication tools, that make use of a visual image (graphical versus
illustrative) coupled with structured, culturally relevant, brief behavior change counseling, to convey CVD risk in
Black parents with obesity who have a school-age child (6-11 years) and are from a low-income household.
Specifically, this study aims to: (1) develop two visual communication tools via iterative focus groups with a)
Black parents affected by obesity and b) primary care health care providers (HCPs); (2) determine the
acceptability and feasibility of each visual communication tool during a simulated clinical encounter with Black
parents and HCPs; and (3) determine the preliminary efficacy of the two visual communication tools on
intention to change, perceived risk, knowledge of CVD risk, and short-term lifestyle behavior change in parents
affected obesity compared to a standardized CVD risk score. My career development plan includes
mentorship, formal coursework, and seminars in three focus areas: acquire skills in the development of visual
communication tools to convey disease risk in a culturally relevant way; gain expertise in the clinical application
of Motivational Interviewing through culturally relevant brief behavior change counseling; obtain competence in
designing randomized controlled trials in family-based behavior change interventions. Results from this study
will determine the most salient tool for this population which will be tested in a randomized controlled trial (R01)
to determine the effect on lifestyle change in parents and their children."

As dramatically illustrated by the CoVID-19 pandemic, endemic and epidemic infectious
diseases pose increasing global danger as the world becomes more interconnected. However,
there are relatively few institutions engaged in training infectious disease (ID) epidemiologists.
Of those that are trained, relatively few are equipped to work at the crossroads of lab science
and population-based clinical and behavioral research.
The UNC Epidemiology Department is applying for a 4th 5-year funding cycle for our Training in
ID Epidemiology (TIDE) NIAID T32. Our TIDE program occupies a unique niche in the T32
portfolio at NIAID as one of only seven training grants with an ID epidemiology focus (out of 177
active NIAID T32s). Our program has been very successful in several ways. First, with impetus
from the T32, we developed a core curriculum in ID epidemiology and made sure that all of our
trainees were exposed to interdisciplinary approaches to ID research. We have had three PhD
trainee slots per year for all 15 years, and one post-doc slot per year for the past 10 years.
Second, our trainees have been highly successful in obtaining jobs in ID epidemiology. Of the
30 trainees who have finished their training programs, 14 have academic appointments (6
tenure-track, 6 research or clinical track, 2 postdoc) and 10 are at the CDC, either in the EIS or
as full-time employees. The others (n==6) all have research-focused positions in other public
health organizations or agencies. Third, our efforts at increasing diversity over the past two
cycles have paid off: 6 of the 24 trainees in our last two funding cycles (25%) have been under-
represented minorities. We also have excellent representation of female trainees (77% to date).
For the next 5-year cycle, we are planning to continue to emphasize interdisciplinary research in
our three thematic research areas of ID microbiology, social influences on ID epidemiology, and
ID clinical research. Our pre-docs will all incorporate interdisciplinary work into their research.
Our post-docs will be required to do interdisciplinary research with co-mentors – one
epidemiologist plus one “interdisciplinary” co-mentor, with expertise in laboratory, behavioral or
clinical research aspects of infectious diseases. In addition, we plan to further strengthen our
professional development training and our outreach efforts to minority candidates.
In summary, we hope to build on the remarkable success to date of this training program by
continuing to train outstanding young infectious disease epidemiologists to meet an important
public health need."
10863991,"ABSTRACT
 Cells have a limited capacity to synthesize choline, thus cells depend
on protein transporters to import choline. Choline is used to synthesize
phosphatidylcholine, from which structural lipid components of myelin are
synthesized. Phosphatidylcholine is also metabolized to generate
phosphotidylinositols, whose phosphorylated derivatives are important
signaling lipids that regulate myelination. Choline is involved in synthesis
of the universal methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for histone
and DNA methylation, thus regulating gene expression. Considering the
position of choline at the crossroad for the biosynthesis of phospholipids
and epigenetic regulation, we have very little to no understanding of the
regulation of choline import and choline-dependent metabolism in
myelinating glial cells. Choline transporter for Schwann cells has not been
identified.
 We have identified choline-like-transporter 1 (CTL1) as an important
regulator of Schwann cell myelination. CTL1 deletion in Schwann cells
(CTL1sc-KO) results in early onset of focal hyper-myelination in the PNS.
Biochemical analysis revealed an overall decrease in choline-derived  
phospholipids in the myelin. Furthermore, CTL1 loss impaired myelin
gene expression and exhibited altered DNA modifications in Schwann cells. From these observations, we
hypothesize that CTL1 is a Schwann cell choline transporter. We also hypothesize that choline-dependent
metabolism feeds into the phospholipid signaling and epigenetic modifications that are important for
myelination. To this end, we will investigate three aspects of choline metabolism in Schwann cell myelination.
 Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that CTL1 is a Schwann cell choline transporter. MALDI-TOF and tandem
mass spectrometry will be performed to directly measure choline import into CTL1sc-KO Schwann cells.
Impact of CTL1 loss on phosphatidylcholine synthesis will also be analyzed. In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that myelin defects in CTL1sc-KO mice results from imbalance in PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3
synthesis. This is based on the observation that phosphatidylinositol contents are altered in CTL1sc-KO nerve
and the myelination defects resemble those seen in mice with dysregulated PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3
synthesis. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that CTL1 loss alters gene expression in Schwann cells by modulating
histone and DNA methylation.
 Perturbed lipid metabolism, including choline, is an underlying mechanism in many hereditary diseases
associated with PNS myelination defects. Furthermore, dietary supplement of phospholipids has been
considered as a potential therapeutic option for treating PNS neuropathies. Therefore, results from this study
will provide important insights into understanding the implication of choline metabolism in developing
therapeutic strategies to treat PNS neuropathies."

along with significant experience and knowledge in all aspects of mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis, the
goal of this Core is to support all NORC investigators to provide lipid measurements needed relevant to their
NORC research projects. The three primary objectives of the LMSC are: 1) Provide quantitative analysis of
targeted lipid classes that include fatty acids, sterols/oxysterols, bile acids, steroids, eicosanoids, and
sphingolipids; 2) Provide untargeted, relative lipidomic analysis that covers the major classes of lipids including
steryl esters, glycerolipids, phospholipids, and sphingolipids; and 3) Develop novel methods to support unique
needs of NORC investigators. The services and capabilities provided by the LMSC cover almost all aspects of
lipid analysis from extraction to analysis to data interpretation and dissemination. The LMSC has proven
capabilities from effectively handling large cohorts (clinical and research) for targeted lipid analysis to broad
exploratory work on small pilot projects."

The Career Training in the Biology of Aging training program provides graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows with a comprehensive, in-depth research training in aging biology, which emphasizes logical and
conceptual thinking, together with career-oriented mentoring designed to promote success in a diverse
professional landscape. We are requesting a continuation of 6 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral training
positions. Aging biology has a long and proud history at the University of Michigan (UM), which is consistently
ranked as one of the top Universities in the world with institutional support for aging research that is at an elite
level. The Geriatrics Center is recognized internationally for clinical, educational, and research programs, and it
provides an outstanding setting for our Training Program. The program benefits from a Claude Pepper Older
Americans Independence Center, the Ann Arbor VA GRECC (Geriatrics Research, Education, and Clinical
Center), the Michigan Biology of Cardiovascular Aging program, and the Paul F. Glenn Center for Aging
Research. Our preceptors are a diverse, highly-interactive, well-funded, and creative group that span 14
different departments/programs and four schools at UM. The popularity and success of our program is
growing, as evidenced by (i) the spread of aging “tracks” and subject matter into cognate graduate programs,
(ii) the ability of us to (every year) appoint highly-qualified trainees to each of our slots, (iii) our ability to attract
young, promising faculty members to our program, and (iv) an increasing national recognition through
individual faculty awards and institutional support (e.g., the Glenn Laboratories designation and $12m
investment from the Medical School to recruit six new faculty members in aging biology). Our program has long
emphasized hypothesis-based laboratory training through creative and impactful research, and we have
proactively enriched these experiences with successful initiatives that have enhanced diversity, provided
exposure to diverse career opportunities, promoted synergy between the pre- and post-doctoral trainees. While
continuing our successful Biogerontology Research Seminars, Biology of Aging Journal Clubs, and annual
Research Symposium, we have implemented new career-oriented initiatives, involving PhD scholars who have
succeeded in career paths distinct from traditional academics, including industry and entrepreneurship. These
additions complement new efforts in mentorship including Certificate Programs that provide enhanced training
in areas such as teaching, public policy, and translational education; integrated Individual Development Plans;
summer workshops on coding, statistical rigor, and science writing; mentorship committees for our post-
doctoral trainees and junior faculty; extensive training in the responsible conduct of research; and focused
efforts to recruit and retain a diverse trainee population. We have also developed a new faculty position on our
Advisory Board, the Diversity Liaison, which has resulted in creative, systemic initiatives that have been
measurably successful in enhancing trainee diversity."
10864974,"SUMMARY
Carbohydrate addition (glycosylation) is one of the most common posttranslational modifications of
secreted and cell surface proteins. Glycosylation is critical for normal animal development and
physiology, and mutations in genes involved in glycosylation cause more than a 100 human diseases
with diverse phenotypes. However, glycan structures are complex, and each form of glycosylation
can be found in tens to thousands of target proteins. Accordingly, understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying glycosylation disorders constitute a major challenge. One of the critical roles
played by protein glycosylation is the regulation of a cell-to-cell communication mechanism called the
Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling regulates many processes during animal development and
adult maintenance. For example, studies in mice and cell culture have shown that muscle
development and muscle repair after injury depend on Notch signaling in mammals. However,
mutations in Notch pathway components or modulators have not been reported in human patients
with muscular dystrophy. We have recently reported a consanguineous family in which several
siblings suffer from LGMD-2Z, which is a new form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. LGMD-2Z is
caused by homozygosity for a recessive mutation in a gene called POGLUT1. POGLUT1 is a
glycosyltransferase which adds O-linked glucose to a number of transmembrane and secreted
proteins, including multiple components of the Notch signaling pathway. We have previously shown
that POGLUT1 regulates Notch signaling in fruit flies and mice. Analysis of the muscle tissues and
myoblasts isolated from the above-mentioned patients provided evidence suggesting that impaired
Notch signaling plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this form of muscular dystrophy.
However, the biologically-relevant targets of POGLUT1 in the Notch pathway and other pathways in
the muscle are not known. In this proposal, we will use biochemical and cell culture assays,
proteomic profiling, mouse genetic experiments and iPS cell experiments to determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying the regulation of muscle development and maintenance by POGLUT1 and to
identify its relevant targets. We will use iPS cells from patients, along with a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
corrected version of them, for in vitro disease modeling and in vivo engraftment experiments. These
studies have the potential to provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of a muscular dystrophy
caused by abnormal glycosylation and might establish a new framework for future therapeutic
approaches for muscle diseases."
10864975,"Abstract
Since 2010, clinical medicine and public health have benefited from a rapid surge of clinical research on
chronic diseases using data from electronic health records (EHRs). However, while millions of patient records
are included in large EHR networks, they are not population-representative random samples, a constraint
which has restrained their utility for population health research. The non-representative nature of patients
represented in EHR data also poses a major challenge when performing cross-site validation of EHR-based
findings, as study findings tend to reflect the unique characteristics of populations served by specific health
care systems. We propose to perform an integrated secondary data analysis of three unique datasets: 1) the
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS, begun in 1992 and ongoing) that has nationally representative health
interview data for over 20 years, as well as biomarkers, physical assessment information, prescription drug
data, and claims linkages including Medicare D drug claims; 2) the New York University Langone Health EHR
data (NYU-CDRN, 2009 to now) including demographics, vitals, diagnoses, lab results, prescriptions and
procedures; 3) the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN) which is an EHR network that
comprises 20 NYC healthcare institutions, including the NYU-CDRN, with longitudinally linked data on over 12
million patient encounters under a Common Data Model; and 4) Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System
(VAAAHS) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), which provides an important complement to the NYC-CDRN
patient population when assessing our method’s reproducibility and generalizability for the rural patient
population in care. We will leverage these four datasets to support three strands of questions on EHR-based
risk predictions: 1) assessing its utility for population inference, 2) developing individualized absolute risk
predictions, and 3) assessing its reproducibility and cross-site validation. We will predict risk of subsequent
incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older patients (age 50 and older) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Broader use of these methods will be generally applicable to other diseases outcomes. To achieve these
objectives, our study will 1) develop and validate EHR phenotyping and diagnosis time algorithms against gold
standard chart review (Aim 1); 2) assess the population-generalizability of EHR-based risk estimation models
by comparing with cohort-based risk estimation models and develop EHR bias adjustment methods for
population inference (Aim 2); 3) develop methods for EHR-based individualized absolute risk prediction (Aim 3),
and establish the developed methods via cross-site validation (Aim 4)."
10864976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite major medical advances, cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of morbidity
and mortality worldwide. Even with aggressive risk factor control, nearly 50% of patients suffer
recurrent cardiac events and this “residual risk” has been attributed to excessive inflammation.
Recent work has demonstrated that atherosclerosis is also characterized by the failure of
inflammation resolution. The resolution program is regulated by the production of specialized
pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis)
from tissue. Advanced atherosclerotic plaques have higher numbers of apoptotic cells, larger
necrotic cores, and an imbalance of pro-inflammatory:pro-resolving mediators compared with
early lesions, all of which are suggestive of failed resolution. Strategies that boost resolution and
break the cycle of chronic inflammation promote plaque stability. Therefore, the identification of
novel targets that mediate this process is of critical importance. Our preliminary data have
identified Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase IV (CaMK4) as a central regulator of both
inflammation and resolution. Uniquely, CaMK4 appears to play an important role in the
development of innate immune memory in macrophages, which enhances their pro-
inflammatory responses to atherogenic stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that CaMK4 is a
critical mediator of immune memory and that immune training impairs resolution through a
CaMK4-dependent mechanism. We will test our hypothesis through the following aims:
Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that myeloid-CaMK4 impairs resolution as a mechanism
by which it promotes atheroprogression.
Specific Aim 2 will explore the mechanism by which CaMK4 promotes oxLDL training of
myeloid progenitors and macrophages in order to augment their inflammatory cytokine
production.
Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that targeting CaMK4 in advanced atherosclerosis can
promote regression of plaque."
10865120,"Protein misfolding arises in many neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms by which protein misfolding causes cell death and disease are poorly understood. The broad, long-term research objectives are: 1) to decipher the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration, and 2) to develop new therapies to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases through correction of cellular protein misfolding in people. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a conserved intracellular signal transduction mechanism essential for cellular protein homeostasis. The UPR activates transcriptional programs that induce chaperones, protein folding enzymes, and protein degradation pathways (proteasome and autophagy). The UPR also regulates the speed of translation to match the amount of newly synthesized polypeptides to cellular protein folding capacity. If protein misfolding persists, the UPR triggers apoptosis. The UPR may be a potential pathomechanism underlying diseases arising from protein misfolding. PERK encodes a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the UPR. In people, GWAS identified PERK as a genetic risk factor for the tauopathy neurodegenerative disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). This research investigates how PERK causes PSP in these Specific Aims. Aim 1 will investigate PERK's role in mediating
neurodegeneration caused by environmental chemical toxins that increase risk of tauopathy. PERK activity will be assessed in human stem cell-derived neurons treated with PSP-linked agents. Small molecule proteostasis agents will be tested for their efficacy in rescuing neuronal damage linked to environment agents. Aim 2 will analyze the enzymatic properties of PERK heterodimers compared to homodimers. Isogenic stem cell-derived neurons will be employed. In parallel, recombinant PERK heterodimers will be generated and characterized using small molecule heterodimerizering compounds. Aim 3 will investigate the molecular and biochemical basis for selective tau neuropathology in the brain. Postmortem human brain tissues from vulnerable and resistant brain regions will be compared for UPR activity. Genotyped brain cases will be examined to see how risk PERK allele expression affects tau neuropathology. PERK is an essential regulator of protein quality in cells, and human PERK alleles are genetic risk factors for tauopathy neurodegeneration. These studies will have a positive impact by elucidating fundamental molecular pathomechanisms of PERK signaling in PSP. These studies may also reduce the clinical burden of PSP and related tauopathy neurodegenerative diseases by development of novel therapeutic strategies based on pharmacologic regulation of cellular protein quality homeostasis."

10866610,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than six-fold over the past
three decades. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where acidic bile salts abnormally refluxate
into the esophagus, leads to the development of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), a premalignant condition that is the
main risk factor for EAC. We and others have shown that chronic exposure to acidic bile salts induces
inflammation and is associated with a dramatic increase in the burden of oxidative stress; believed to be the
main driving forces for disruption of cellular signaling mechanisms and the development of EAC. It is unknown
how tumorigenic esophageal cells escape the oxidative effects of acidic bile salts reflux and also become
resistant to currently used chemotherapeutic agents. Alterations in the redox status of reactive cysteine
residues, located within the DNA-binding domain of redox-sensitive transcription factors (TFs), can suppress
TFs’ DNA binding affinity and transcription activity. Therefore, the cellular redox capacity is paramount in
promoting activity of oncogenic transcription factors, protecting tumorigenic cells and promoting their survival
and expansion. This project builds upon collective interaction among the three projects generating several
novel preliminary findings. We have shown that AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) redox activity was required for
activation of tumorigenic transcription factors such as SOX9 in response to exposure to reflux and
chemotherapeutics. As part of scientific integration in this P01, working with Projects 2 and 3, we also found
that high levels of reactive isolevuglandins (isoLGs) protein adducts promote stability of SOX9. As a result of
these molecular events, EACs develop intrinsic and acquired resistance to standard chemotherapeutic. Based
on our preliminary results, we aim to investigate the role of APE1-reodx function in promoting SOX9 activation
in EACs. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of APE1 and isoLG adducts in regulating SOX9 stability and
activity. The functional outcome of APE1-SOX9 network is investigated in Aim 2. The clinical significance and
therapeutic potential of targeting APE1 redox activity will be determined in Aim 3. Understanding biology-
relevant molecular functions, the focus of this P01 and this project, is a key step for developing evidence-
based therapeutic approaches that are founded on the biology and molecular underpinning of EAC. Upon
completion of our work, we expect to uncover a new paradigm for understanding the biology of EAC to
facilitate the development of novel medical treatments for this deadly cancer."
10866611,"ABSTRACT/ SUMMARY
 Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the fastest rising cancers in the US. This tumor remains to be
a poorly treatable disease with surgery that is the mainstay of current therapy, carrying significant morbidity and
mortality. The EAC biology is tightly linked to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a digestive
disorder in which gastric acid and duodenal bile salts enter the esophagus causing strong tissue injury and de-
velopment of Barrett’s metaplasia (BE). BE is a precancerous condition that can progress to EAC. Yet, the
specific mechanisms underlying this tumorigenic process remain poorly understood limiting the development of
new preventive and treatment options for EAC.
 We have developed an innovative hypothesis explaining how reflux induces carcinogenic alterations in the
esophagus through protein adduction with reactive isolevuglandins and aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway. This hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data generated by animal studies and
analyses of human tissue specimens collected from patients with BE and GERD.
 In aim 1, we will define novel, previously uncharacterized mechanisms regulating the JAK/STAT signaling
by protein adduction in conditions of esophageal reflux injury. In aim 2, we will investigate the regulation of pro-
tein adducts in the esophageal niche using animal models of EAC and human clinical specimens. In aim 3, we
will test various options to inhibit protein adduction in a pro-tumorigenic environment created by chronic gas-
troesophageal reflux and investigate how it affects esophageal carcinogenesis.
 Our project is an integral part of the P01 program focused on the mechanistic studies of EAC tumorigenesis
while exploring novel cancer chemopreventive and treatment options. This cooperative study will also expand
and deepen our understanding of esophageal carcinogenesis by exploring the intersections of the iso-
levuglandins with APE1-SOX9 and SOX4 signaling networks, examined in Projects 2 and 3. Our collective
studies in this project and P01 program are expected to lay the groundwork for novel therapeutic applications."
10866612,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased 600% in the last three decades. Treatment
options, however, are limited, especially for EACs diagnosed at the late stages. Thus, identifying new
therapeutic targets is necessary to improve the overall dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. This
proposal is an integral part of a P01 Program focused on identifying mechanistic vulnerability while providing
potential therapy for EAC treatment. This application will directly address novel molecular mechanisms that
control the transition from stem cells to adenocarcinoma-initiating cells and whose inhibition has the potential
to block EAC development. Prolonged reflux where acidic bile salts abnormally refluxate into the lower
esophagus is closely associated with the incidence of Barrett’s esophagus (BE, also known as intestinal
metaplasia), an entity considered as the precursor to EAC. Studies from our lab and others have shown that
malignant transformation of stem/progenitor cells is a critical mechanism that occurs during esophageal cancer
initiation. In the case of EAC, we have identified that the novel transitional basal cells (TBCs) located at the
esophageal-gastric junction (EGJ) are able to generate Barrett’s esophagus upon Cdx2 overexpression. Our
preliminary data show that EAC develops at the EGJ following prolonged Cdx2 overexpression and bile acid
reflux. The genetic regulatory program that drives stem cell transformation and cancer maintenance, however,
remains elusive. We found that SOX4 transcription factor is highly expressed in mouse EAC models and
human EAC biopsies. Decreased levels of SOX4 protein are associated with reduced cancer growth. Using a
combination of RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and targeted RNAi screening, we identified EGFR and ELF3 as potential
downstream targets mediating SOX4 function in tumor development. Therefore, we hypothesize that SOX4 is
critical for EAC initiation and maintenance and that suppressing SOX4-centered signaling can be
utilized for therapeutic gains in EAC treatment. Our studies integrate well with other projects in this P01
and we will test the roles of APE1 redox function and isolevuglandin protein adducts in regulating SOX4. We
have designed three aims to test this hypothesis: (1) To determine the role of SOX4 in EAC development; (2)
to test the hypothesis that SOX4 transcriptionally regulates EGFR and ELF3 in EAC; and (3) to determine the
therapeutic role of SOX4 inhibition in EAC treatment. We will use multiple mouse models (e.g., SOX4 gain-
and loss-of-function) combined with organoid and patient-derived xenograft models to address these aims and
test two candidate drugs identified through an unbiased screen. Our studies will provide novel insights into the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the EAC’s initiation and progression, facilitating the
development of novel treatments of deadly EAC."

Sustained ocular hypertension in open angle glaucoma (OAG) and congenital glaucoma causes
degeneration of the optic nerve and death of retinal ganglion cells, leading to irreversible vision loss. Whilst
reducing intra-ocular pressure (IOP) using a combination of pharmacological and surgical approaches is
known to effectively prevent glaucoma progression, the therapeutic efficacy of such a strategy is critically
undermined by poor patient compliance, with fewer than 25% of patients maintaining treatment over a one-
year period. Owing to poor compliance and the need maintain a life-long daily treatment regimen,
glaucomatous patients regularly suffer bouts of uncontrolled ocular hypertension that dramatically increase
the risk of developing severe sight-threatening complications, even when diagnosed early. As a
consequence, there is a clear need to develop a long-acting therapy that lowers IOP without
requiring daily intervention. Herein we propose that IOP may be permanently and safely lowered using a
gene therapy strategy aimed at modifying cells of the cornea and aqueous humor outflow pathway (AHOP)
to synthesize and secrete prostaglandin F2α, (PGF2α), a drug that is known clinically to effectively lower IOP
in OAG patients when administered daily as an eye drop. We present robust preliminary data demonstrating
that cells of the cornea and AHOP can be effectively targeted using intracameral injection of recombinant
adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector, that expression of prostaglandin F synthase (PTGS2) and
prostaglandin F receptor (PTGFR) catalyzes de novo biosynthesis and secretion of PGF2α into the aqueous
humor, and that this causes a highly significant, dose-dependent reduction in IOP that is maintained for over
12-months in normotensive animals. In this multi-PI application, we will evaluate the feasibility, safety and
long-term therapeutic efficacy of our novel gene therapy treatment in the Pitx2+/- mouse model of congenital
glaucoma (Aim 1) and the ADAMTS10 beagle model of OAG (Aim 2). Demonstrating the ability to
permanently lower IOP in glaucomatous eyes would represent a paradigm shift in the clinical management
of glaucoma by obviating the need for adherence to a daily treatment regimen and the data generated from
this work is expected to support clinical translation and the instigation of an investigator led clinical trial. The
Ocular Gene Therapy Laboratory of the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), directed by Dr Daniel
Lipinski (contact PI/PD), and the laboratory of Dr András Komáromy (PI/PD) at the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Michigan State University (MSU) provide the perfect environment in which to complete the
proposal. Finally, our proposal addresses an emerging need identified in the NEI Publication “Vision
Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities” specifically: 1) Define the genetic architecture of glaucoma to
provide direct potential targets for therapy; 2) develop animal models that better approximate human
glaucoma and predict safety and efficacy of novel treatments."

IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RDs) are a family of related autoinflammatory diseases characterized by fibrotic
lesions comprised of CD4+ T cells and IgG4+ plasma cells, and markedly elevated oligoclonal IgG4. However,
whether IgG4 antibodies contribute to IgG4-RD pathology remains unclear. Despite the tremendous clinical
success of immunotheraputics, little is known regarding IgG4 biology relative to IgG1. Our long-term goals are
to understand the role and regulation of glycosylation to antibody biology, to ultimately modulate antibody effector
functions in vitro and in vivo. The overall objective of this application is to comprehensively dissect cytotoxic
activity of sialylated IgG4. Our central hypothesis is autoantigen-specific IgG4 in IgG4-RD is sialylated, and
contributes to the pathology Of IgG4-RD. Our approach combines characterizing IgG from the sera of IgG4-RD
and healthy patients, while examining precisely glycoengineered IgG4 in receptor binding and effector function
assays.
Our hypothesis is informed by preliminary data shown here in the Approach subsection of the Research Strategy
section. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is understanding how IgG4 mediate cytotoxic effector
function will enable new insights into IgG biology, and may lead to development of innovative antibody-based
therapies. We will test our central hypothesis and, thereby, attain the objective of this application by pursuing the
following three specific aims using a combination of biophysical experiments, and in vitro and in vivo functional
assays.
1) Define the glycosylation and FcγRs-binding profiles of total and autoantigen-specific IgG in IgG4-RD.
Hypothesis: Sialylation enables FcγR binding by IgG4.
2) Examine the effector functions of sialylated IgG4 in vitro. Hypothesis: Sialylated IgG4 mediates effector
cell-specific pro-inflammatory effector functions.
3) Determine the in vivo effector functions of sialylated IgG4. Hypothesis: Sialylated IgG4 exerts pro-
inflammatory effector functions in vivo.
This proposal is expected to have broad clinical implications, ranging from diseases where elevated IgG4 titers
are associated in the pathology or resolution, as well as to design of immunotherapeutics, and represents a
substantive departure from the status quo by underscoring the cytotoxic capacity of IgG4."

Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementia disorders are at increased risk of a motor
vehicle crash due to impairment of the cognitive and sensory functions necessary for safe driving.1 Because
there are few sources of long-term longitudinal data on dementia and motor vehicle crashes, and even fewer
that include the prodromal stage of AD related dementia called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), very little is
known about how the risk of a crash changes over the course of AD and how a crash may change the clinical
course of disease. Here, we propose to use a novel data source of Medicare insurance claims linked to licensing,
citation, and crash data for more than 1.5 million older drivers over a 13-year period to evaluate longitudinal
changes in the risk of a crash and changes in the trajectory of health, health care utilization, and long-term care
assistance following a crash, among older drivers with AD. The lack of information on the longitudinal risks and
consequences of a crash among older adults with AD represents a critical gap in the literature for two reasons.
First, research suggests that there is substantial individual variation in driving ability by stage of disease. While
some individuals demonstrate a significant increase in unsafe driving behaviors early in the course of disease,
before they are even diagnosed, others are able to drive safely with MCI through the mild to moderate stage of
AD.2 As the number of older drivers with AD grows, providers and organizations that serve older adults are
increasingly focused on developing interventions to promote “safe-mobility,” allowing older adults to drive for as
long as is safely possible. However, to be effective, interventions need to account for longitudinal changes in the
risk of a crash over time, and how these trajectories may vary across individual characteristics. Second, the
effects of a crash can have long-lasting physical, psychological and social consequences. Current studies have
identified short term effects of a crash,5 but no study has followed crash-involved-drivers with AD for long enough
to understand how the impact of a crash manifests over time. Individuals with AD are already at higher risk of
comorbidity, hospitalization, and early transition to long term care. Thus, given the rise in licensed drivers with
AD, it is critical to understand how a crash may compound these risks. A major barrier to identifying periods of
high crash risk and the contributing factors is the lack of longitudinal data on motor vehicle crashes. Instead,
most studies have evaluated individuals retrospectively at a particular stage of the disease or followed older
adults for relatively short periods of time and without knowledge of their cognitive status, making it difficult to
identify longitudinal patterns of crash risk. Here, we propose to use 13 years of Medicare claims data linked to
licensing, crash and citations for all drivers with a license in New Jersey between 2007 and 2019 to (1)
characterize the longitudinal trajectories of crash risk over time (2) identify sentinel points in these trajectories
where the risk of crash is highest and thus interventions would be most effective and (3) evaluate the impact of
a crash on the health and health care outcomes for cognitively impaired older drivers."

Aging in humans is associated with a host of brain diseases, including tumors, age related neurodegeneration,
and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In many tissues, the aging process leads to a derepression of transposable
elements (TEs) that lead to inflammation and cell senescence. Several recent studies have demonstrated that
multiple subfamilies of TEs are expressed at higher levels in postmortem AD brain than healthy controls as a
direct result of the accumulation of mis-folded Tau proteins characteristic of AD pathology. Many of the
hallmarks of AD, including neuroinflammation, heterochromatin remodeling, genomic instability, and the
recently implicated T-cell infiltration, can be triggered by the activation of TEs. However, because of the unique
epigenomic landscape of different cell types in the brain combined with the dependence of TE mobilization on
cell division and other factors, the dynamics and consequences of TE activation are likely cell-type-specific.
This study aims to characterize the activation of TEs in the brain during aging and AD and identify the
functional consequences of activated TEs at the level of individual cells across multiple cell types and to
develop the novel computational tools necessary to answer these questions. The first aim will establish the
genomic and epigenomic changes related to TEs during normal aging. This analysis will help both to determine
whether TEs are involved in the normal brain aging process and age-related neuronal decline, and to establish
the healthy controls for comparison with AD. The second aim will perform similar analysis, this time focusing on
AD and including the separation of neurons with and without accumulation of pathogenic Tau. The final aim will
measure the transcriptome at the single-cell level for all the samples profiled in the first two aims. This
sequencing will allow both the measuring gene expression related to innate and adaptive immune responses
and the identification of TE derived sequences capable of triggering those responses. The experimental tools
and sequencing technologies now exist to examine these questions, and this study is designed to determine
how TE activation impacts normal brain aging and AD. Understanding the relationship between TEs,
neuroinflammation, and AD pathology may open the door for new treatments and cures."

Candidate: Jehan Alladina, MD is a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and
Harvard Medical School (HMS). Her post-doctoral research interrogated type 2 (T2) immune pathways in
allergic asthma. Building on that work, this proposal investigates the role of T2 immunity in acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). The short-term goals of this K08 award are to provide training in murine models of
acute lung injury (ALI), longitudinal statistical modeling of patient data, and translational research. Dr.
Alladina’s long-term goal is to lead an independent research program on the host immune response in ARDS.
Training Activities: Dr. Alladina will perform the work outlined in this proposal at MGH under the mentorship
of Dr. Benjamin Medoff, an experienced mentor and expert in lung immunology; Dr. Eric Schmidt, a leading
expert in animal models of ALI and sepsis; and Dr Steven Skates, an accomplished biostatistician with
expertise in developing longitudinal algorithms to predict disease trajectory. Drs. David Christiani, Nuala
Meyer, and Anne Sperling will serve on Dr. Alladina’s advisory committee to provide further expertise in
longitudinal ARDS cohorts, molecular risk factors for ARDS, and mechanisms of lung inflammation and
resolution. Dr. Alladina will also complete didactic courses in immunology, biostatistics, and translational
research and will take advantage of the collaborative and rich intellectual environment at MGH and HMS.
Research: ARDS is the severe consequence of inflammatory lung injury and 40% of patients have progressive
disease characterized by persistent lung inflammation, fibrosis, and increased mortality. Identification of
immune regulatory pathways in ARDS, and how they change over the disease trajectory, could identify
biomarkers that predict outcomes and novel targets to prevent ARDS progression. Our preliminary animal and
human data demonstrate that T2 immunity is induced in ALI/ARDS and that IL-33, an upstream inducer of T2
inflammation, improves survival in a murine model of influenza-induced ALI. Moreover, soluble ST2 (sST2), an
endogenous inhibitor of IL-33, is associated with increased ARDS mortality and time on the ventilator. Thus, I
hypothesize that increased sST2 signaling blocks T2-mediated pro-resolution and repair pathways in ARDS,
leading to persistent pathological inflammation and fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, I will determine the causal
role of IL-33 and its endogenous inhibitor sST2 in ALI onset and resolution. I will leverage inducible transgenic
animals to manipulate IL-33 and sST2 expression early and late during ALI. I will also measure plasma and
airspace IL-33, sST2, and T2 cytokine levels in ARDS patients over time, and develop hierarchical longitudinal
models to differentiate as early as possible whether a patient will progress or recover. By leveraging murine
models and longitudinal human data, this proposal can establish both causality and relevance to human
disease. This K08 award would provide critical training for Dr. Alladina’s development as a successful
“bedside-to-bench” physician-scientist studying the immune mechanisms of ARDS progression and resolution."

Dr. Jacob Goldsmith is focused on identifying effective therapies to improve neural control of motor and
cardiovascular function in persons with SCI. He completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the McGuire
VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, where he studied electrical stimulation and testosterone (T)
treatment to improve motor and cardiovascular function, as well as for improving quality of life in persons with
chronic SCI. Since November 2022, he has worked at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY as a
postdoctoral trainee in the labs of Drs. Noam Y. Harel and Jill Wecht to learn neurophysiological assessments
and cardiovascular autonomic assessments in persons with SCI, respectively. Over his research career, Dr.
Goldsmith has displayed an extraordinary commitment to improving the health and welfare of Veterans with
SCI. He has served as first-author or co-author on an impressive list of publications given his early stage of
professional development: 20 published articles (first author on three), one first author review article, two
book chapters. In addition, he has presented at numerous regional and national conferences, as well as the
national VA Grand Rounds. The current proposal focuses on assessing the relationships between circulating T,
nerve function, and cardiovascular autonomic function in male Veterans with SCI. Hypogonadism (low T) is a
prevalent issue in men with SCI, which may exacerbate the deleterious consequences of SCI. There is evidence
that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) positively influences body composition and energy expenditure,
although there is little to no research examining the associations between endogenous T concentrations and
neural and cardiovascular autonomic function after SCI. This is particularly relevant as several lines of human
and animal research have indicated that normal T is crucial for optimal neural and cardiovascular health and
function in males. Intranasal TRT delivery represents a useful tool to quickly elevate circulating and central
nervous system T concentrations. Moreover, intranasal TRT appears to possess a reduced risk profile and may
facilitate the maintenance of fertility compared to other TRT delivery methods. However, the effects of
intranasal TRT on corticospinal excitability and cardiovascular autonomic function are unknown in any
population. The current CDA-1 proposal will examine associations between endogenous total T and its
subfractions (free and bioavailable T) and neural control of motor and cardiovascular function in male
Veterans with SCI. In addition, an Exploratory Aim will determine the acute effects of a single dose of
intranasal TRT versus placebo on corticospinal excitability and cardiovagal reflex function in men with SCI
who exhibit low T. We hypothesize that the endogenous total T and/or its subfractions will predict
corticospinal and cardiovagal function in men with SCI (Aim 1). Because the Exploratory Aim is a
pilot/feasibility study, hypothesis testing is not appropriate. However, based on the literature we do expect
increasing circulating levels of T into the high normal physiologic range will result in improved neural and
cardiovagal function. To foster his career development within VA, Dr. Goldsmith will receive hands-on
research training related to assessments of central nervous system excitability and cardiovagal reflex function,
extensive mentoring from a stellar mentorship team comprised of experts in the SCI research field, and he will
complete academic coursework, and attend and present at SCI-related research seminars. This research, career
plan, and mentorship team will provide Dr. Goldsmith with the opportunity to develop new skills necessary to
grow into an independent VA career scientist."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) contributes to 88,000 deaths per year in the United States. Although several
pharmacological treatments are available, adherence to these treatments is low and approximately 60% of
individuals relapse within 6 months. Further, these treatments modulate the brain in a relatively global fashion.
Evidence from neuroimaging studies of AUD patients has shown
that elevated cortico-striatal activity in response
to alcohol cues predicts relapse. Thus, there is an emerging interest in developing novel, neural-circuit specific
therapeutic
tools to enhance AUD treatment outcomes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one such
non-invasive, neural-circuit specific tool. Through electromagnetic induction, repetitive pulses of TMS can be
applied
to the cortex to change neural activity within a cortical circuit. Subsequently, TMS for AUD has been
developed as a strategy to reduce brain reactivity to alcohol cues within the prefrontal cortex and its downstream
targets in the striatum. I recently led an analysis of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial applying 10 days of
TMS to the medial prefrontal cortex among AUD patients. Relative to sham, individuals who received real TMS
were 3 times more likely to remain sober and experienced a reduction in average brain reactivity to alcohol cues.
Despite these positive results, there was considerable variability in that approximately 1/3 of individuals who
received real TMS relapsed to alcohol and reductions to striatal reactivity to alcohol cues were not uniform. My
NIAAA-sponsored F31 demonstrated that individual patterns of brain response to alcohol cues are highly variable
among AUD patients and often occur outside of the prefrontal cortex. Given this spatial variability, delivering TMS
to a fixed point on the scalp leads to a situation in which TMS electrical fields do not always overlap with an
indvidual’s brain response to alcohol cues. In a proof-of-concept retrospective analysis, I found that patients who
had overlap between alcohol cue-reactivity patterns and TMS electrical fields had the best clinical outcomes.
This K99/R00 proposal seeks to build upon this analysis by developing prospective functional connectivitiy -
guided TMS (fcg-TMS) clinical trials for AUD. First, using an existing dataset, we aim to characterize the spatial
topography of TMS cortical targets as defined by peak functional connectivity with the striatum during alcohol
cue presentation (Aim 1, K99 phase). Then, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of one session of functional-
connectivity guided TMS (fcg-TMS) on reducing striatal response to alcohol cues, a key biomarker of treatment
efficacy (Aim 2, K99 Phase). These K99 aims will be complemented by a training
plan that includes 4 domains:
clinical trial design, fcg-TMS, laboratory leadership, and complex modeling of relapse and brain networks in AUD.
Following these foundational trainings and experiments, Aim 3 (R00 phase) of this proposal will evaluate the
efficacy of 15 sessions of fcg-TMS clinical trial in reducing drinking, relapse rates, and striatal response to alcohol
cues. Cutting edge tools will be used to analyze the data
presented in this proposal, including prospective,
computational electrical field modeling, advanced functional connectivity analysis, and multivariate statistics."

train the next generation of scientists in patient-oriented, translational research on tuberculosis. Dr. Jason
Andrews is an infectious diseases physician-scientist who leads a research group focused on developing and
evaluating novel tools, from the laboratory to the field. He has served as a mentor to 30 students and
postdoctoral fellows and is the primary mentor for three NIH career development awards. The proposed K24
award would: 1) protect his time to mentor early career investigators in patient-oriented research, investigating
critical problems in tuberculosis diagnosis, treatment and prevention; 2) enhance his skills in mentorship
through guidance from a committee of highly successful senior mentors; and 3) provide him opportunities for
professional development, including advanced training in pharmacogenomics, translational research and
personalized medicine. These proposed activities will leverage Dr. Andrews’ long-standing research
collaborations, including three active NIH-funded clinical studies in Brazil. This award would support new
studies to: 1) evaluate electrochemiluminescence assays for Mtb antigen detection in exhaled breath
condensates as a novel approach to active case finding for TB; 2) test for human genomic polymorphisms
associated with linezolid and bedaquiline metabolism and adverse events while validating a new amplicon-
sequencing pharmacogenomic assay; and 3) evaluate a novel approach to predicting isoniazid and rifapentine
metabolism by simultaneously measuring transcription of and polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzyme
genes. Overall, this proposed K24 award would provide critical support for mentoring early career scientists
while advancing innovative tools to improve the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis."

Patient facing advanced serious illness have many complex decisions to make regarding their medical care.
The range of options spans the most aggressive life prolonging care to care that is focused mainly on comfort.
In 1997, the Death with Dignity Act was passed legalizing Medical Aid in Dying (MAiD) for the state of Oregon.
Since that time, 11 other states have passed MAiD laws and 12 others are considering similar legislation. Yet
despite the widespread access patients may have to this option, there is a paucity of research about patient’s
experiences with decision making around MAiD and how aging may affect these decisions. We also lack data
about the experiences and outcomes for caregivers, and the experiences of clinicians who are involved in the
care of patients pursuing MAiD. To address these critical gaps in our understanding, we propose to conduct a
longitudinal cohort study of patients who are pursuing MAiD from a national sample as well as their caregivers
and clinicians. Aim 1: To understand quantitative and qualitative outcomes of seriously ill older and younger
persons pursuing MAID and the patient-level factors that are associated with subsequently using MAiD. Aim 2:
To understand the quantitative and qualitative outcomes of caregivers of older and younger patients
pursuing MAiD. Aim 3: To qualitatively examine the attitudes and experiences of clinicians prescribing and
caring for patients considering MAiD.
This research is highly innovative because we will capture a national cohort of patients pre-MAiD as well as
their caregivers and follow them forward. We bring together a highly experienced and multi-disciplinary team of
investigators who have a demonstrated track record of collaboration and expertise across palliative care
research and bioethics. Without understanding the diverse perspectives of patients, caregivers, and clinicians,
we are unable to create or implement interventions to support these populations. Given the broad population
that has access to MAiD, epidemiologic, experiential, and decision-making characteristics of individuals
considering and pursuing MAiD may be critical to inform evidence-based policies and practices."
10866494,"Abstract
The concept “chromostasis” or chromatin homeostasis refers to a chromatin environment that suppresses
cellular plasticity and genome instability. Regulation of gene expression depends on histone post-translational
modifications (PTM), DNA methylation, histone variants, and effector proteins that not only influence the structure
and function of chromatin, but also affect essential processes such as DNA repair capacity, and cellular
proliferation. The histone code hypothesis predicts that crosstalk between PTMs controls direct specific and
distinct DNA-templated programs such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. Although histone PTMs can
be mutually exclusive in their functional role, they still can have a strong influence into each other. A clear
example of this is the H3K36me3-H3K27me3 axis. While H3K36me3 is associated with active transcription,
H3K27me3, which is produced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), maintains gene repression.
H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 also have an antagonistic role on DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathway
choice and consequently controls genome stability status. Furthermore, the crosstalk between these PTMs is
evident since depletion of H3K36me3 greatly influences the cellular H3K27me3 levels, and viceversa.
Nevertheless, how these two PTMs functionally interact to control gene transcription and genome stability is still
unclear. Using naturally occurring mutations in histone H3 as a model system, we will address the role of histone
methylation in chromostasis. Notably, mutations in the lysine 36 on histone H3 to a methionine (H3K36M), as
found in head and neck disorders, lead to a global reduction of H3K36me2/3 levels. The role of H3K36M and its
crosstalk with H3K27me3 and other PTMs, as well as its influence in the epigenome and maintenance of genome
stability, is poorly understood. Here we aim to understand how the balance between H3K27me3 and
H3K36me2/3 controls gene transcription and genome stability in human cells. To this end, we will determine how
H3K36M impacts the epigenetic landscape and whether rewiring the underlying epigenetic mechanisms can be
exploited to maintain genome integrity. Our new preliminary data reveals a novel connection between H3K36M,
the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2, DNA methylation, and genome instability in human cells. Moreover,
we found a novel epigenetic complex sequestered by H3K36M. Finally, our studies show that H3K27me3 levels
determine the proficiency of DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR) and sensitivity to replication-
dependent DSBs. In this proposal, we will elucidate the H3K36M-mediated mechanisms of gene regulation (aim
1), and the role of H3K36M and H3K27me3 in DNA repair and genome stability in vitro (aim 2) and in vivo (aim
3). Taken together, our studies will reveal critical epigenetic processes needed at a timely manner at the right
genes, to avoid disruptions in “chromostasis” that could cause cellular transformation and developmental
disorders. Our work will uncover fundamental molecular cues that regulate activities on chromatin that may be
amenable to therapeutic targeting."
10866368,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Transneuronal transport of neurotropic viruses is uniquely able to reveal the cellular
composition of multi-synaptic circuits. As a consequence, this technique is providing fundamental new insights
into the functional architecture of sensory, motor, cognitive and affective networks in the central nervous
system. The Center for Neuroanatomy with Neurotropic Viruses (CNNV) was created in 2004 to provide the
neuroscience community with access to the highly specialized reagents, training and facilities that are
necessary to use neurotropic viruses as transneuronal tracers.
We document in this application that the CNNV has become an essential national and international resource
for an important segment of the neuroscience community. Users of the Center are funded by 15 different
institutes of the NIH, by NSF and by private foundations as well as international research organizations. The
Center has established a strong history of providing: 1) well-characterized reagents, 2) training and guidance
in the use of the method, and 3) specialized biohazard facilities for performing experiments using neurotropic
viruses. The Center also has played a vital role in the development of new and improved transneuronal tracing
tools that permit more targeted dissection of the functional architecture of neural circuits. Furthermore, the
Center has served as a critical technical and intellectual resource for those interested in using this method.
The goal of this competitive renewal is to enable the Center to continue both its resource and research
functions."

Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) that delivers targeted cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells is typically
administered on a fixed activity basis, without personalization, in stark contrast to external beam radiotherapy.
177Lu-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) is a promising
RPT for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that was recently FDA approved as a fixed
activity treatment (7.4 GBq/cycle delivered over 6 cycles). This standardized approach fails to take advantage of
unique properties inherent to 177Lu: in addition to therapeutic beta particles, 177Lu emits gamma-rays imageable
by SPECT, allowing precise absorbed dose (AD) estimation to plan subsequent cycle/s. Additionally, pre-therapy
PSMA-PET imaging can potentially be used to predict ADs before initiating RLT. Furthermore, preliminary data
demonstrate an important finding: AD deposition per injected activity (Gy/GBq) is substantially higher in the first
cycle for tumor, while it remains relatively constant across cycles for organs, motivating consideration of
administering higher activity in the first cycle. While standard 177Lu-PSMA RLT has demonstrated a favorable
toxicity profile, the AD to critical organs such as bone marrow (BM) needs to be considered when escalating
dosage. However, BM dosimetry in mCRPC is complex because tumor infiltration of spongiosa is common.
Although the current approach to RLT has led to promising early response rates in mCRPC, the complete
response rate and overall survival remain poor; this raises the question of whether dosage escalation with
patient-specific dosimetry may be key to more optimal outcomes, and provides the rationale for our study. Our
long-term goal is to achieve durable responses with RLT in mCRPC. To advance this goal, the objectives of the
current application are to develop the tools and predictive models that will provide the capacity for dosimetry-
guided treatment, and to evaluate the feasibility of dosage escalation. For the proposed developments, except
the clinical trial, imaging data from 50 patients who are undergoing standard RLT will be used. 1) In Aim 1, a
novel method for BM dosimetry will be developed by coupling macro/micro Monte Carlo modeling with images
of lesion and marrow distribution in spongiosa, 2) in Aim 2 models will be built to predict AD from pre-therapy
quantitative 68Ga-PSMA PET, tumor AD vs. response, and normal organ/BM AD vs. toxicity using biomarkers as
covariates and 3) in Aim 3, tracer kinetic modeling will be performed with dynamic PET to determine optimal
timing of escalated dosage delivery to avoid PSMA-receptor saturation that may impede benefits of escalation.
This will be followed by a Phase I clinical trial for cycle 1 dosage escalation in 20 patients with low risk for
hematotoxicity with the primary endpoint of safety; this will identify the recommended dosage for a future Phase
II/III trial powered to evaluate efficacy. This work will have a significant impact because it will enable novel, more
patient-centered delivery of RLT, which currently lacks dosimetry-based optimization. The concepts/tools that
are developed will be applicable to all forms of RPT, a rapidly growing treatment option for various cancers."
10860565,"Floss: a novel method for oral mucosal vaccination
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel method of oral cavity mucosal vaccination. The mucosal
surfaces serve as portals of entry for a vast majority of pathogens such as influenza virus and HIV. It is
recognized that a strong immune response at both the mucosal and systemic compartments is more effective at
combating these infections than an immune response in just the systemic compartment. However, parenteral
injections do not stimulate strong mucosal immunity. To achieve this, vaccines must be delivered through the
mucosal surfaces. Furthermore, mucosal vaccinations can be painless and better accepted (of course depends
on the route) as compared to painful shots. The oral cavity is an extremely attractive route for delivering vaccines
due to it’s ease of accessibility and the relatively mild environment compared to the stomach. Within the oral
cavity, the buccal and sublingual mucosa have been extensively researched, however, poor permeability of
vaccines through these mucosal tissues has made it difficult to translate these routes to the clinic. Nonetheless,
research has shown that if vaccines are delivered through the oral cavity, immune responses can be stimulated
in the distant vaginal, respiratory, and intestinal mucosa, offering protection at all these other sites. In other
words, the oral cavity has potential to be used for vaccination against a broad range of pathogens such as
influenza and HIV. Therefore, a breakthrough in successful delivery of vaccines through the oral cavity could
have a paradigm-shifting impact on vaccinations. Here we propose that a floss can be used to target the
junctional epithelium for vaccination. The junctional epithelium is a unique epithelial tissue that has exceptionally
high permeability and provides a doorway into the mucosa. However, because it is located at the base of the
gum pocket it is harder to target. We postulate that the floss, a common dental device used by millions, could be
coated with a vaccine and used for vaccination. Our hypothesis is that floss-based vaccination through the
junctional epithelium can stimulate systemic and mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses against
different antigens. This hypothesis is backed by our strong preliminary data. The objective of this research
proposal is to build on this preliminary data and develop this novel method of vaccination into a reliable and
reproducible method of vaccination. The aims are: i) comprehensive characterization of immune response
generated through junctional epithelium immunization in mice, ii) characterization of the nature of immune
stimulation following junctional epithelium vaccination in mice, and iii) characterization of systemic and mucosal
immunity from floss-based vaccination in pigs. This new approach of vaccination will be assessed in mice and
pigs, which increases the translational potential of this work. Because the floss is needle free, it is painless and
could be self-applied. It also has potential to be distributed through postal mail, which could make vaccination
campaigns easier. Overall, this research proposes to establish a new paradigm in oral mucosal vaccination,
which has potential for significant impact on public health."
10860131,"Investigating Germline Sex Determination
Establishing sex-specific germ cell identity is critical for development of sperm and eggs and perpetuation of
the species. Cells are initially specified as primordial germ cells (PGCs), and then germline sex determination
establishes a male or female germline identity. While sex determination is understood in the somatic cells of
some animals, how germline sexual identity is established is largely unknown. In most animals, germline sex
determination is regulated by signals from the surrounding somatic gonad. However, in some animals, like
humans and Drosophila, the germ cell’s sex chromosome constitution is also important. Thus, the sex of the
soma and germline must match for proper gametogenesis to proceed. How somatic signals interface with germ
cell autonomous cues to achieve proper sex determination is also unknown.
Many aspects of germ cell identity are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The RNA binding protein Sex
lethal (Sxl) is activated in XX germ cells and is necessary and sufficient for germline sex determination in
Drosophila, but little is known about how it acts to control this process. Further, a germ cell-specific
transcriptional program must also be established in order for Sxl to influence this program in a sex-specific
manner. Lastly, Sxl in the germline must combine with signals from the soma to determine germline sexual
identity.
Recently, we have made two important discoveries that illuminate these processes. First, an important signal
from the soma that promotes male germline identity acts through the Jak/Stat pathway. As this pathway is also
used to regulate development of the somatic gonad in both sexes, Sxl acts in female germ cells to block the
Jak/Stat pathway and preserve female germline identity. Second, we have discovered a new tudor-domain
protein, Tdrd5l, that is important for male identity in the germline and is a putative target for repression by Sxl
in the female germline. Tdrd5l defines a novel germline granule, the “Tdrd5l body” and our preliminary data
indicates that Tdrd5l regulates germline gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We propose to use
Tdrd5l as a model for understanding the regulation of gene expression in the germline and to investigate the
mechanism of action of the “Tdrd5l body”."
10860017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Given the importance of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, it has been widely assumed that
the mere accumulation of mutations is the primary process to explain cancer incidence. However, cancer is
predominantly a disease of aging, with its incidence remaining low until the fourth decade of life, undergoing
exponential growth thereafter. Furthermore, cells carrying well-characterized oncogenic mutations can be found
across normal human tissues, and can persist for decades without ever developing cancer. Our current
understanding of what factors govern this decades-long latency and eventual failure in aged tissues are
extremely limited. A compelling argument to describe this is tissue integrity in terms of its structure and function,
both of which decline with age, and could explain differential fitness for cells harboring oncogenic mutations. Our
ignorance of these tissue dynamic processes stems from our inability to perform in vivo analysis over such long-
time frames in relevant mouse models. We hypothesize that chronic liver disease (CLD) can be understood as
an accelerated aging of the liver that similarly alters the fitness landscape, promoting the selection of mutated
cells that progress towards hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We focused on CTNNB1 encoding for β-catenin,
as it is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human HCC, with ~30% of patients having alterations that
render β-catenin constitutively active. However, the precise mechanisms by which β-catenin mutations drive
HCC progression remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we have performed a long-term clonal
lineage tracing of hepatocytes bearing Ctnnb1 activating mutations in both the normal and in the chronically
injured liver. By coupling this tracing system with single cell RNAseq, we discovered that in the normal liver, β-
catenin mutated hepatocytes are incapable of undertaking a single cell division, but instead last for months in
the tissue through a long process of cellular attrition and elimination, which we hypothesize is primarily attributed
to ER stress and maladaptive UPR. Strikingly, in the context of CLD, we found that tissue injury unleashed the
potential of β-catenin mutated hepatocytes to clonally expand and drive the development of HCC tumors, solving
a longstanding conundrum in the field. Importantly, using the same lineage tracing system, we found that β-
catenin mutated hepatocytes in normal livers of aged mice can similarly undergo clonal expansion as observed
in CLD. In this proposal, we will investigate the specific molecular mechanisms that result in diminished cellular
fitness of β-catenin mutated hepatocytes in the normal liver and conversely, what mechanisms are behind the
increase in cellular fitness of β-catenin mutated hepatocytes during chronic liver damage. By focusing on these
mechanisms, we expect to lay the groundwork for exploiting the vulnerabilities of β-catenin mutated hepatocytes
found in the normal liver while blocking the strengths they acquire during CLD to tackle this devastating disease."
10862021,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Persons with substantial functional disabilities--multiple limitations in activities of daily
living (ADLs)--overwhelmingly prefer to remain at home. The VA faces a crisis in providing care for such Veter-
ans, with increases in demand for long-term services and supports (LTSS) from 9.8 million older Veterans and
one million younger injured post-9/11 Veterans. VA must by law provide nursing home care for Priority 1A and
≥70% service-connected Veterans, and also provide Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for all Vet-
erans who qualify clinically. Although the law states LTSS must be provided in the least restrictive setting possi-
ble, there is evidence that HCBS is underused/ VA still spends over two-thirds of its total LTSS budget on insti-
tutional care, and GAO reports have identified persistent access barriers. Furthermore, our team found that only
50% of Veterans in Durham referred to HCBS used any services within a year. Underuse of HCBS poses a
significant clinical care problem by failing to meet Veteran preferences and needs and may accelerate disabling
events and costly institutionalization. And yet, we do not know the extent to which HCBS is underused, why it is
underused, and the consequences of current use patterns. Shedding light on this question requires knowledge
of the clinic, VAMC, and area-level factors that drive HCBS supply and demand. Evidence is thin because exist-
ing studies were limited to identifying Veteran factors predicting HCBS use. To our knowledge, no studies have
examined multi-level drivers of VA HCBS use among those referred, in particular, clinic-level drivers. Clinic struc-
ture and processes will differ and while involvement of clinic social workers is expected to be vital given their role
in making HCBS referrals, some clinics may have higher capacity for care coordination and routing of referrals.
Additionally, VAMC and area factors may constrain HCBS use through LTSS funding choices, wait list rules,
narrow networks, or workforce shortages. Homemaker home health aide (H/HHA) services will be our use case
because H/HHA is the largest HCBS program (163,639 unique users in FY22) and, like most HCBS, is delivered
through contracted providers. VA employees refer to H/HHA and care is provided by non-VA employees from
community home health agencies. A rigorous mixed methods study is needed to illuminate multi-level drivers of
H/HHA uptake and whether identified drivers reflect access supply barriers, Veteran preferences, or both. We
also need to understand impact of H/HHA on Veteran-centered outcomes, using causal inference methods. We
will address three inter-related aims: Aim 1. Identify multi-level drivers of any H/HHA uptake by 8 weeks (and 6
months) of referral compared to those with no H/HHA uptake by 8 weeks (and 6 months) among all newly referred
Veterans nationally 2017-2020. H1. Veterans w/ pre-referral exposure to outpatient clinic social workers will be
more likely to use H/HHA than Veterans with no pre-referral exposure to outpatient clinic social workers. H2.
Veterans assigned to primary care providers in clinics w/ high use of geriatric principles will be more likely to use
H/HHA than similar Veterans in other clinics. H3. Veterans at VAMCs and areas w/ favorable H/HHA climates
(more HCBS spending) will be more likely to use H/HHA than Veterans facing unfavorable climates. Aim 2.
Identify best practices that can be disseminated across VA through ~80 interviews w/ leaders, community home
health agency administrators, H/HHA coordinators, clinic staff, Veterans and caregivers about their perspectives
on structure, process, and preference factors influencing H/HHA use and timing at 3 high and 3 low-uptake sites
w/ diverse populations. Aim 3. Among Aim 1 referred Veterans, estimate the average treatment effect of earlier
(≤8 weeks) versus later (>8 weeks-6 months) versus no H/HHA use on person-centered Veteran outcomes and
VA total costs of care. H4. Earlier H/HHA use will lead to: i) delays in disabling events (injurious falls); ii) better
quality of life (more home time; less nursing home use); iii) lower total VA costs, compared to later uptake or no
uptake. This knowledge will enable our VA operational partners to define best clinic practices, optimal staffing
and network sizes, and community partnerships required to deliver H/HHA to Veterans who want and need it."
10863832,"The Boston University Rheumatology Research Training (BURRT) T32 Program is a new application
leveraging a prior two-decade history of providing outstanding training to physicians and scientists in clinical
investigation of the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.
The BURRT T32 Program will leverage numerous institutional programs and broaden the T32 faculty
mentoring pool to include new disciplines to better prepare postdoctoral T32 MD and PhD scholars for careers
in clinical research in academia and industry. The objectives of the program are to graduate 3 postdoctoral T32
scholars every 2 years in our multidisciplinary program, with an emphasis on recruiting and retaining scholars
from underrepresented in medicine (URiM) backgrounds. We will train them to succeed in becoming
independent clinical researchers in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases transitioning to their first faculty
position or research-related job outside of academia. We will provide a strong foundational Core Curriculum in
epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical research methods with project-based team mentoring and numerous
avenues for career and professional development. We will additionally provide broad multidisciplinary training,
including coursework, that provides additional training in one or more specialized tracks selected by the T32
scholar: 1) Health Disparities and Community Engagement; 2) Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Machine
Learning; 3) Behavioral Interventions and Mobile Health Technologies; 4) Implementation Sciences. The
program aims to address key areas identified through a needs assessment to better prepare post-doctoral T32
scholars for engaging in cutting-edge clinical research with more in-depth exposure to newer areas of research
disciplines and methods. Each T32 scholar will be carefully matched to an appropriate team of experienced
and funded mentors to provide expert research guidance, career guidance, and professional development,
aided by an individual development plan (IDP). We will evaluate each component of the training program
formally and comprehensively. A key foundational aspect to the program is a weekly multidisciplinary clinical
research meeting. The program additionally includes required coursework, opportunity to pursue a Master's
level degree, and attendance at a broad array of seminars and hands-on experiences in each of the Tracks,
cross-program and trans-institutional networking opportunities, industry and journal roundtables and
internships, IRB internship, journal clubs, and career counseling, among others. Trainees will develop
professional skills in writing grants, scientific manuscripts, oral presentations, and undergo training in the
responsible conduct of research, enhancing reproducibility in research, team science, and leadership and
industry collaborations. Overall, the program is designed to prepare the future leaders in rheumatic and
musculoskeletal diseases clinical research."
10863972,"Candidate: The overall goal of this K01 career development proposal is to provide me with the
research and training needed to become a leader in the field of sleep intervention and health
disparities research in American Indian (AI) populations. As my work has moved in to studying child sleep,
it is clear that sleep intervention research is severely lacking. In addition, there are no studies that have been
done in any AI community. My preliminary work on the Blackfeet reservation has shown that children do not
get enough nightly sleep. These findings helped shape the direction for this K01 proposal to develop a novel
sleep intervention grounded in cultural values to improve total sleep time (TST) in families that have children in
the K-1st grade. The K01 research and training fulfills defined missions of the NHLBI by understanding sleep
disparities and investigating factors that account for differences in a high risk, underserved AI community, and
fostering the training of an AI investigator on a trajectory to becoming an independently funded researcher. My
training will be targeted to two key areas (among others): 1) sleep and 2) training in mixed-methods research
and randomized controlled trials with mentoring from local and national content experts. I will also enhance my
understanding in two areas related to sleep: nutrition and stress/trauma. Developing and pilot-testing
community-based sleep strategies grounded in AI cultural values, in combination with my training plan, will
uniquely position me for a successful independent research career in sleep intervention research with
underserved populations. Collectively, this K01 award will position me to develop an R01 proposal.
Environment: The mentoring committee for this proposed K01 award is structured to support my research and
training in sleep, nutrition, stress, mixed-methods research, accelerometry, and using social media for
intervention delivery. Each mentor has extensive mentoring experience and content expertise in critical
aspects of the research and training proposal. The Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity
(CAIRHE) has provided me with start-up funds, office laboratory space, IT support, statistical support, and 9
months of protected research time each year. In addition, Montana State University is committed to developing
AI faculty and research with a number of institutes and centers that support health and biomedical research,
including CAIRHE (NIH P20GM104417); the Montana IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence, or
INBRE (NIH P20GM103474); the American Indian/Alaska Native Clinical and Translational Research Program
(NIH U54GM115371) among others. CAIRHE, where my office is located, provides an ideal environment for
conducting community-based participatory research in tribal communities throughout Montana with resources,
personnel, and expertise housed within the center. CAIRHE and other MSU research centers house several
senior internal researchers with extensive NIH funding records including my primary mentor and CAIRHE
director Dr. Adams. This optimal research environment will ensure that my transition into an independent
health disparities scientist is successful.
Research: Children sleep less now than ever before. Despite a growing body of literature in understanding
child sleep patterns, sleep interventions are limited. To date, there are no sleep intervention studies that have
been done in AI tribal communities. Elders and community members play a critical role in identifying culturally
adaptive solutions to address problems in tribal communities. Because of the prevalence of historical trauma
and mistrust of outsiders, I am uniquely positioned to do this work in my own tribal community. Preliminary data
of sleep patterns showed that Blackfeet children age 2-5 and age 12-15 averaged 10.15 hours and 7.5 hours
of weekday sleep. Despite this understanding, evidence-based solutions to increase TST in tribal communities
are unknown. Thus, I propose to explore traditional sleep routines coupled with asking Blackfeet families about
the current sleep environment in their home to develop a culturally specific sleep intervention with one child
and one adult dyad. I hypothesize that the sleep intervention will increase TST (primary outcome) in the dyads.
The intervention may also result in improved physical activity and diet, and decreased stress and screen time
(secondary outcomes). Data will be measured at 0 and 9 weeks and then at 3 month follow-up. This
hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Develop a culturally appropriate sleep intervention for Blackfeet families with K-1st
grade children using surveys, focus groups, interviews, community input, and evidence-based
strategies on sleep.
Specific Aim 2: Feasibility test of the 9-week sleep intervention with K-1st grade Blackfeet families.
The work proposed in these aims is designed to develop a comprehensive understanding of traditional sleep
strategies and the child sleep environment to develop and pilot-test a novel culturally appropriate sleep
intervention in the Blackfeet community. Developing culturally specific interventions to increase TST will
address two significant gaps in the literature; understanding sleep problems in AI children and pilot-testing
culturally adaptive sleep intervention strategies that will inform future research for investigators doing similar
work in AI communities and provide direction for an R01 proposal that is one of the outcomes of this work."
10932298,"Abstract
The Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRDs) are a group of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) that result from
constitutive activation and/or dysregulation of specific immune pathways. There are 130 genes identified to date
that are associated with PIRDs. Each PIRD is extremely rare and the PIRDs in general comprise approximately
5% of IEI. Patients with PIRDs often have multiple life-threatening opportunistic infections, autoinflammatory
conditions and autoimmune sequelae related to the constant activation of their immune system. Given the rarity
of each PIRD and of PIRDs in general there are little if any therapeutic interventions for these patients.
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HCT) offers a curative option for many patients with PIRDs. The high levels
of inflammatory mediators in patients with PIRDs however has made it extremely difficult to have successful
outcomes due mostly to graft failure/rejection as well as post-transplant immune complications. Patients with
PIRDs therefore have limited therapeutic options and only those that are most severely affected are considered
for cures with HCT. The BRIDGE Trial is a Phase 2 clinical trial to improve outcomes of curative therapy with
HCT for patients with a PIRD diagnosis. The protocol utilized a biomarker-guided immune suppression prophase
to dampen the inflammatory milieu prior to and during a myeloablative conditioning regimen for HCT. For patients
with PIRDs that result in perturbations of their IFNγ pathway, a prophase of emapalumab, an IFNγ neutralizing
monoclonal antibody will be incorporated prior to and during the conditioning regimen. Patients that have PIRDs
that result in dysregulation of other inflammatory pathways will receive a generalized inflammatory suppression
prophase with fludarabine and dexamethasone, similar to what is currently being used for patients with
hemoglobinopathies undergoing HCT. These targeted inflammatory suppression regimens will provide a more
balanced milieu in patients with PIRDs while they receive conditioning and enable more efficient engraftment,
balanced immune reconstitution and improved outcomes. This dataset will be pivotal to expand indications for
emaplaumab, an orphan drug approved for primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH), to bridging
therapy for curative HCT for IFNγ immune dysregulation syndromes. In aims 2 and 3 we take advantage of our
expertise in immune reconstitution and biomarker discovery studies to provide in-depth correlative biology. Our
focus will center on deep immunophenotyping of reconstituting subsets, identification of soluble biomarkers for
immune mediated complications and to identify mechanisms of how a targeted immune suppression prophase
helps provide an appropriate immune milieu during conditioning and as the hematopoietic system regenerates
after HCT. These studies will provide critical data for continued future clinical trials to provide durable cures to
patients with PIRD diagnoses."
10861607,"Food allergy is a common disease with few treatment options, and although life-threatening reactions are very
rare, the lack of predictability of reaction severity contributes to a significant negative impact on quality of life.
Studies are needed to test new therapies, identify new targets through mechanistic research, and to advance
the understanding of key clinical parameters including severity, threshold, and prognosis for allergy resolution.
There is also a need to identify and rectify disparities in access to care and representation in research, an area
in which we have made significant contributions. As a first aim, a clinical research center – NUCoFAR- will be
established at Northwestern University using the expertise of investigators at the Lurie Children’s Hospital,
Feinberg School of Medicine, and the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research. These experts will recruit
children and adults with food allergy for observational or intervention studies, as well as pregnant women and
infants for prevention studies, and carry out human studies using best practices. Since food allergy exhibits the
characteristics of a complex genetic trait, it is imperative that research aiming to understand its etiology can
leverage large, heterogeneous patient populations, beyond those available at any single
institution. Consequently, the current understanding of this complex trait can be greatly advanced by
systematically combining data across multiple clinical research centers. A standard approach for doing this is
the creation of a data commons- a single, centralized resource that supports harmonized data aggregation and
access from disparate sources, in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
principles. In a second aim, the CoFAR network will develop and populate a Food Allergy Data Commons
(FADC) that will facilitate network-wide data sharing and collaboration across numerous priority research
domains. We are partnering with leaders in the informatics field to advance this aim. NUCoFAR will work with
other CoFAR Clinical Research Centers to develop efficient data upload procedures to the FADC. This access
to standardized, structured data will allow the community of CoFAR researchers to answer critical research
questions around food allergy development, diagnosis, progression, severity, and potential for natural
tolerance. To advance the understanding of basic mechanisms of food allergy and oral tolerance, a third aim
will identify the role of T cell-B cell interactions resulting in tolerance from early allergen introduction. This
project will use biospecimens obtained by the CAN DO study, a multi-site clinical trial testing the impact of
introduction of eight allergens into the diet by nine months of age on the development of food allergy. The
contribution of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Type 2-marked memory B cells (MBC2) to the development of
allergy and tolerance to foods will be tested. By elucidating the immune mechanisms responsible for the
window of opportunity for oral tolerance development, these studies will identify novel pathways that could be
targeted therapeutically to help children and adults with established food allergy."
10861517,"The Mary H. Weiser Food Allergy Center and the closely associated Allergy and Clinical Immunology Division in
Medicine are submitting this application for a CoFAR CRC center. The Weiser Center has developed strong
programs in basic and clinical research in food allergy with over 20 faculty and $10M a year in external research
funding. It performs its research in the Davidson Endowed Food Allergy Research Laboratories and through the
University's clinical trials support Office (CTSO) its faculty perform clinical research and have participated in 13
of the most prominent trials of therapeutic development in food allergy. The Allergy Division's clinical operation
includes 18 allergists that see over 6,000 unique patents per year (60/40% pediatrics-adult) with food allergy
diagnoses. Our proposal under Subsection B involves a new diagnostic approach for food allergy.
Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) provides a potential approach to monitor physiological allergic reactions to
food during food challenges to avoid the induction of anaphylaxis. TEWL is an established measure of skin
barrier permeability that quantifies water efflux from the epidermis (units are g/m2/h). In anaphylaxis, blood
vessels dilate leading to heat and water loss, and recent data suggests that the extravasation of serum fluid and
proteins is proportional to the severity of allergic reaction. Our group has shown that real-time TEWL rises prior
to clinical evidence of anaphylaxis and correlates with biochemical markers of anaphylaxis. We hypothesize that
TEWL-based stopping rules can predict OFC reactions for any food and reduce the rate of OFC anaphylaxis
while improving OFC accuracy. We propose to initiate a multi-site clinical trial in a diverse cohort with OFC for
the major food allergens in the US to definitively assess TEWL's capacity to predict anaphylaxis during OFCs.
Finally, under Subsection C we will examine the relationship between food allergy and atopic dermatitis, two
disorders that share numerous genetic and environmental risk factors as well as pathogenic features. While the
importance of epithelial barrier dysfunction in food allergy pathogenesis has been recognized, genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified only a limited number of food allergy risk genes, and our
understanding of the shared genetic underpinnings of these disorders remains limited. We propose to access
multiple genomic databases (covering >30,000,000 variants and >750,000 distinct individuals) to test the
hypothesis that a shared permissive genetic signature involving epithelial skin barrier-related genes underpins
atopic dermatitis and food allergy predisposition. We propose to 1) Deploy the above datasets for GWAS
analyses in atopic dermatitis and food allergy separately followed by a trans-disease meta-analysis with
Mendelian Randomization studies to define novel risk loci for each disorder and the directionality of each SNP's
effects between diseases; 2) Interrogate known and newly-discovered SNPs in food allergy and atopic dermatitis
with eQTL studies to determine the character and differential degree of contribution of each SNP to each
disorder. This will help clarify the important genetic relationship between these two diseases."
10861518,"Background: Approximately 20% of Veterans smoke. Like smoking, pain is frequently reported by Veterans
and smoking is associated with concurrent pain intensity. A reciprocal biopsychosocial model of pain and
smoking is hypothesized whereby pain and smoking mutually maintain each other resulting in a cycle marked
by elevations in both. More than 50% of patients with chronic pain smoke and standard smoking cessation
interventions are largely ineffective for them – in part because pain is a trigger to smoke.
Significance: In a recently completed comparative effectiveness trial (IIR15-092), a standard smoking
cessation protocol (including pharmacotherapy) was compared to an integrated evidence-based pain and
smoking cessation intervention (PASS) among Veterans with chronic pain. At 6-month follow-up, 12% of the
patients in the PASS condition reported a 30-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking compared to 6%
in the standard protocol. The PASS condition also demonstrated a 6-month improvement in pain interference
(34% reported a 30% reduction in pain interference) compared to 19% in the standard protocol. Depressive
symptoms were found to have a significant moderating effect such that those with clinically meaningful
depression achieved a lower cessation rate relative to non-depressed (8% vs 17%). Though PASS was
significant (and promising), the intervention arm did not surpass the superiority threshold (15%) and it did not
achieve the expected 20% cessation rate. Accordingly, a more intense intervention is needed to optimize
smoking cessation among non-depressed Veterans with pain. Future efforts will then need to augment the
intervention for those who are depressed.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal augments the PASS intervention with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to
optimize the effectiveness of the intervention. IVR allows patients to interact with a computer-operated phone
system and receive personalized asynchronous feedback to reinforce PASS skill acquisition, and utilization.
Specific Aims: AIM 1: Determine whether the existing integrated pain and smoking cessation (PASS
intervention) augmented with IVR (PASS-IVR) is superior to treatment as usual (e.g., referral to standard VA
smoking cessation clinic) enhanced with pharmacotherapy tele-consult (E-TAU) at 6 (primary endpoint) and 12
months on cigarette abstinence rates among non-depressed Veterans with chronic pain.
Hypotheses 1.1: Prolonged abstinence rates and point prevalence abstinence rates will be significantly higher
among non-depressed Veterans with chronic pain who receive PASS-IVR compared with those in E-TAU.
AIM 2: Determine whether PASS-IVR is superior to E-TAU at 6 (primary endpoint) and 12 months on pain
interference.
Hypothesis 2.1: Non-depressed Veterans in PASS-IVR will report significantly lower pain interference relative
to E-TAU.
AIM 3: Examine key components of the intervention process to inform future program implementation using the
RE-AIM framework which considers intervention strengths and weaknesses with respect to Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.
Methodology: A Hybrid Type 1 randomized comparative effectiveness trial with a two-group design is
proposed. Non-depressed Veterans (N=220) who smoke and have chronic pain will be randomized to either: 1)
PASS-IVR, a telemedicine intervention that augments the existing integrated evidence-based PASS
intervention with IVR, or 2) E-TAU. Both arms receive pharmacotherapy via telemedicine clinics.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will work with our partners in the pain management and opioid prescribing
program office, primary care, mental health, and tobacco to leverage our findings and implement strategies to
optimize smoking cessation for veterans with chronic pain."

Training programs in psychiatric epidemiology are increasingly critical to advance science and develop
prevention and intervention efforts that positively affect public health. The events of 2020 brought into stark
focus the economic, geographic, educational, and racial inequalities in the US that deeply affect mental
health and wellbeing. They deepen the need to consider how the social environment and psychiatric disorders
intersect with biological determinants of health, for which new data sources and technology are rapidly
accelerating, and to plan for strengthening of public mental health infrastructure. Changes in recent years
in the incidence and prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and accelerating data collection and technological
capacity, are impacting how psychiatric research is conceptualized, research participants are recruited, and
mental health data are analyzed across research domains, and these factors will inform how mental healthcare
is delivered, accessed, and evaluated. Since 1972, the Columbia Psychiatric Epidemiology Training (PET)
program has produced productive scientists who emerge as leading voices on how to assess etiology,
epidemiology, biology, and intervention in mental health scholarship and services to respond to emerging
needs. We believe that the success of this program is due to five foundational features: 1) training in theory-
and hypothesis-driven scientific inquiry; 2) interrogation of multiple levels of causation with dynamic
interactions; 3) development and application of methods for prediction and causal inference; 4) responding to
changes in public health and mental health; and 5) training and research in ethical principles that underpin work
with disadvantaged populations such as those with mental disorders. In the next five years of our program, we
will continue to grow each of these areas through scholarship and training. Our focus has drawn scholars from
numerous disciplines to engage with our faculty, coursework, and training—scholars who then become leaders
with impact across academic and non-academic settings assessing social and biological psychiatry, service
equity and delivery, and designing and evaluating evidence-based treatments. These scholars are better
informed and their workforce better situated to significantly impact science and practice when trained to
interrogate multi-level frameworks, causal inference, and the ways in which social factors influence etiology,
diagnosis, and access to systems of care. Over the next stage of growth of the PET program, we will build upon
these foundations with additional faculty, training, and expertise. By balancing growth of historical legacies and
new intellectual resources, the PET program will be poised to prepare the next generation of scholars and
change-makers to address critical challenges among those with mental illness across the globe.
Epidemiologists trained by the PET program have the skills necessary to strengthen the public mental health
infrastructure to prepare for future global crises, including pandemics."

Metazoan genomes achieve complex gene control by uncoupling regulatory DNA elements from target
promoters and allowing regulation at a distance. Thus, a gene can be differentially expressed in different cell
types and under different environmental signals or developmental cues. How distal regulatory elements
(enhancers) target specific gene promoters, how the search process is shaped by the topology of the genome
in the nucleus and how enhancer-promoter interactions are facilitated by regulatory complexes that relay
signals to the RNA Polymerase II and control transcription activity remains a mystery. Our goal is to
understand molecular and biophysical mechanisms that enable enhancer-promoter communication in human
and other mammalian cells. Towards these goals and during the period of this award we will accomplish the
following: (i) visualize the dynamic communication of enhancers and target promoters simultaneously with the
association of regulatory complexes and gene activity, using novel single-molecule and super-resolution
approaches for non-invasive 4D imaging of structure and function of the genome in single live cells; (ii)
determine mechanisms by which different classes of architectural proteins shape genome folding, enhancer-
promoter communication and transcription kinetics; (iii) dissect the function and interdependencies of individual
constituent enhancer elements within complex regulatory landscapes controlling cell identity genes. Our results
will establish quantitative frameworks for understanding the biochemistry of transcription regulation in the
crowded environment of the nucleus and for interpreting gene regulation and genome organization using soft-
matter/polymer physics and related biophysical concepts. These conceptual leaps are needed to ultimately
understand physical chromatin organization at sub-Mb scales, the scale most relevant for regulatory genome
interactions. Our integrated structure-function approach will provide functional validation and critical tests for
gene “regulation-at-a-distance” models. The proposed studies will not only provide substantial new knowledge
on the mechanisms of promoter-enhancer communication but will also set the stage for further studies of the
interplay of genome topology/organization and gene expression regulation."
10827478,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract has become an important source for our most effective therapies to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes. This includes both surgical interventions, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), as well as pharmacological agents that mimic the effects of one or more GI hormones. Despite this, there remains a great deal unknown about the impact of the GI tract on systemic metabolism and the regulation of energy balance. 
The GI tract is uniquely situated because it must compromise between keeping out toxins and bacteria while simultaneously absorbing necessary calories and nutrients. The gut-barrier keeps host and bacteria appropriately segregated using both physical components such as tight junctions and mucus production, as well as secreted factors such as anti-microbial peptides. One such anti-microbial peptide is Reg3g (regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma) is abundantly secreted by paneth cells in the small intestine. We have spent the last 4 years carefully documenting how Reg3g regulates gut function, energy balance and glucose levels in response to VSG. 
Bariatric surgeries such as VSG greatly increase gastric emptying rates, placing an enormous burden on the intestine. This results in many intestinal adaptations, which includes increasing the prevalence and abundance of Lactobacillus as well as increasing both expression and circulating levels of Reg3g. We found that Reg3g knockout (KO) mice fail to mount many of these important adaptations, including an increase in the integrity of the gut-barrier. Importantly, these mice also fail to lose significant body fat, improve their glucose tolerance and increase their insulin secretion after VSG. Moreover, pharmacological administration of Reg3g in the periphery improved glucose tolerance, and direct administration of Reg3g in the central nervous system (CNS) reduced food intake. These results support our overarching hypothesis that Reg3g acts both within the lumen and as a circulating gut hormone to regulate energy balance and glucose levels in effective dietary, surgical and pharmacological therapies. We will test this overarching hypothesis in 3 aims: 
Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that dietary and pharmacological treatments that improve glucose regulation and increase Lactobacillus exert key beneficial effects by increasing the expression and/or circulating levels of intestinal Reg3g. Our data show that VSG increases Lactobacillus and both intestinal expression and circulating levels of Reg3g. In addition, we found that Reg3g is required for many of the positive metabolic outcomes of VSG. Both oral administration of metformin and diets high in the soluble fiber inulin also increase the abundance of Lactobacilli in the small intestine and improve glucose regulation, such as occurs with VSG. We hypothesize that these interventions will also increase Reg3g in the intestine and in circulation and that Reg3g will be essential for metformin and inulin to improve gut function, body weight and glucose regulation. We will use these interventions in WT and Reg3g KO mice to test this hypothesis. 
Specific Aim 2: To test whether intestinal microbiota and its products can produce beneficial effects on GI and metabolic function by increasing intestinal Reg3g. First, we will administer a variety of probiotics to mice and test their ability to increase Reg3g intestinal expression and circulating levels. These probiotics will include various species of Lactobacillus or a pre and probiotic combination that can also produce lactate. Then, we will determine whether their effects on gut function, energy balance and glucose regulation are dependent on Reg3g using WT and Reg3g KO mice. 
Despite the centrality of the gut for treatments of obesity and diabetes, the relationship between the intestinal microbiome, gut health and metabolic regulation is fraught with unanswered questions. This proposal hypothesizes a novel role for Reg3g as a signal that communicates the status of intestinal bacteria and the gut barrier to regulate multiple aspects of systemic metabolism. As such, the proposed work provides a new framework for understanding how the gut affects metabolic disease and opens new therapeutic approaches that might range from dietary supplements and pharmacology to surgical procedures that can harness Reg3g biology to prevent and/or treat GI and metabolic disease."

Patients retain and recall less than 10% of medical care plans correctly after 5 to 7 days leading directly to
poor comprehension, engagement, compliance, and poor health outcomes. This pervasive and detrimental
dynamic is a significant contributor to large waste in the annual US healthcare spending now exceeding $4
trillion with a conservative estimate of 25% or $1 trillion annually. On the other hand, patients often find
managing their healthcare overwhelming with complex/multiple diagnoses, specialists, and medications
prescribed by different providers with a higher impact on older adults. Typically provider visits frequently
increase with age. For a variety of reasons, aging patients generally experience an increasingly difficult time
remembering and understanding the details of what was discussed during their office visits. Adult children of
aging patients often assist and participate in their parent’s medical care but often can’t accompany them to
provider visits. Unfortunately, existing technology falls short of meeting these patients’ needs. Almost all
existing health recording tools are provider-centric and none are truly and completely patient-centric allowing
patients to record provider interactions with natural language processing (NLP) translation, searchability along
with full patient control, data mobility, education, and real-time artificial intelligence (AI) support.
Potentia Analytics Inc. proposes the development of its patient-centric health recorder app, called MyDocSaid,
to address these issues. MyDocSaid will be designed to provide patients with a secure, fast, searchable, and
extremely user-friendly technology enhancing patient recall, remembering, comprehension, and engagement in
their own health maintenance or restoration. This technology platform will also play a pivotal role in advancing
the dynamic of “shared decision-making”. At-risk populations like senior citizens could benefit from the
MyDocSaid application. Preliminary studies at Potentia Analytics show that the state-of-the-art automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and NLP models will be able to solve this problem and provide transcription,
summary, and keywords from medical conversations. To develop the back-end and AI components, Potentia
Analytics will use transfer learning to fine-tune language models for medical conversations. Demonstrating
feasibility in Phase I requires a working AI pipeline (including ASR/NLP models and knowledge graphs (KG))
that can pass usability tests in a production environment. The specific aims to accomplish this goal are: 1)
Train and implement deep learning models for ASR & NLP tasks. 2) Train/implement KGs and deep learning
models to recognize medical named entities and their relationships. 3) Integrate the data/AI pipeline.
Medical terminologies will be detected using knowledge graphs (KG) trained on medical ontologies and will
provide information about the context of the medical conversations. The fine-tuned AI models and knowledge
graphs can be used by other researchers to further advance NLP in the medical context and ontologies. The
front-end algorithms and the user interface will be designed for seamless use by elderly patients."

There is a need in the market for a true platform technology that automates the tissue
processing experience. Syntr Health Technologies has dedicated the last six years developing
the technology that can streamline tissue processing. Our FDA-cleared SyntrFuge System and
SyntrFPU360, is a platform technology that can process a variety of different tissue types such
as cancer tumors of kidney, liver, brain, and breast tissue by dissociating them into single cells
to better understand tumor tissue heterogeneity, of which the single cell analysis market is
valued at $3.3 Billion and expected to grow to $6.3 Billion by 2026. As well, our platform can be
used to microsize autologous adipose tissue to be used for reinjection back into the patient to
treat medical conditions of the aging population such as diabetic foot ulcers and knee
osteoarthritis. Syntr has successfully completed an SBIR Phase I grant where we utilized
micronized adipose tissue to heal diabetic ulcers in an animal model. This study had an
important role in developing a treatment modality that translated successfully into humans.
Preliminary human clinical data is showing significant diabetic foot ulcer wound closure within 3-
5 weeks using autologous adipose tissue processed in our platform. The diabetic foot ulcer
market is currently valued at $1.98 Billion with a CAGR of 8.2%. This high growth potential is
attributed to the increase of the diabetic population. Additionally, the use of microsized adipose
tissue is showing great promise in intra-articular injections to knee joints for the treatment of
osteoarthritis (OA). The knee OA market in North America is currently valued at $5.9 Billion and
growing at t CAGR of 8.8%. Over 88% of individuals with OA are 45 or older. The high growth
potential of this market is largely attributed to the increase of the aging population along with the
increase in obesity rates. Our platform technology for the rapid processing and/or microsizing of
tissues can disrupt these markets in a major way. The automation of this technology in this
Phase I SBIR is paramount to increase favorability in the adoption of this much needed
technology in various medical fields.."
10823410,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 To mount effective responses to specific pathogens, CD4+ T helper cells differentiate into specialized subsets
that can recognize and promote clearance of foreign pathogens. However, dysregulation of these CD4+ T helper
cells can lead to allergic and autoimmune conditions. One such subset is CD4+ T helper 2 (TH2) cells, which
normally target parasites but are often implicated in asthma, a hyperinflammatory airway disease. Therefore,
understanding the molecular mechanisms of TH2 cell regulation is a top priority for improving outcomes for
asthma and other hyperinflammatory conditions. To this end, we have identified the Ikaros Zinc Finger (IkZF)
transcription factor Eos as a candidate regulator of TH2 differentiation and function. Published work has largely
associated Eos with immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. However, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism
by which Eos propagates IL-2/STAT5 signaling within proinflammatory TH2 cells. Preliminary work from our lab
shows Eos-deficient TH2 cells generated in vitro or in an in vivo allergic asthma model have reduced gene and/or
protein expression of critical TH2 differentiation transcription factors (e.g. Gata3, Blimp-1), receptors (e.g. IL-2R⍺,
IL-4R⍺) and effector cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-13). Excitingly, in vitro and overexpression studies also reveal Eos
forms a novel complex with and promotes the tyrosine-phosphorylated activation of STAT5, suggesting a new
mechanism whereby Eos governs CD4+ T cell differentiation. Through the work in this proposal, we will determine
the T cell-intrinsic impacts of Eos on TH2 differentiation and define the molecular mechanisms by which Eos
regulates STAT5 phosphorylation and target gene binding to drive the TH2 gene program.
 The proposed studies will be completed by the applicant, Jasmine Tuazon, an MD/PhD candidate in the
laboratory of the Sponsor, Dr. Ken Oestreich. Dr. Oestreich is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Microbial Infection and Immunity (MI&I) at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, which provides an
outstanding technical and intellectual immunology research environment. Additionally, Ms. Tuazon will be
mentored by a committee of immunology experts and collaborators, including Drs. Eugene Oltz (Chair, MI&I),
Kymberly Gowdy (Assoc. Prof., Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine), and Jerry Lio (Asst.
Prof., MI&I), who all provide strong, complementary expertise to Dr. Oestreich. Training will involve the
development of conceptual and technical expertise, including pulmonary murine models, cellular and molecular
immunology techniques, and integrated -omics approaches. Through this fellowship, Ms. Tuazon will also
receive excellent professional development training in scientific communication, writing, and networking.
 Taken together, the proposed work will 1) provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of Eos in promoting
TH2 differentiation and function via IL-2/STAT5 and 2) advance Ms. Tuazon’s conceptual and technical expertise
as she pursues an independent physician-scientist research career in pulmonary immunology and epigenetics."
10823490,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Plasticity of neural circuits is a key element underlying the brain's ability to adapt to experience, and
harnessing plasticity in the brain may provide new therapeutic avenues to ameliorate the effects of early
perturbation or injury. However, our understanding of plasticity in the adult brain remains incomplete. Although
adult plasticity in the visual cortex can be selectively induced through loss of sensory input or repeated
presentation of single stimuli, the impact of more broadly enriched sensory experience is unclear. In addition,
although the role of GABAergic inhibition in developmental visual plasticity has been deeply explored, the role
of inhibitory interneurons in adult plasticity remains largely unknown. In particular, cells that express the peptide
somatostatin (SST-INs) are thought to play a critical role in shaping the feature selectivity of visual responses in
mouse visual cortex, primarily via their robust inhibition of the dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons. SST-
INs are also critical mediators of visually-evoked activity patterns that facilitate long-range transmission of visual
information. However, the functional roles of SST-INs in adult plasticity remain unclear. Our preliminary data
suggest the surprising finding that visual experience consisting of repeated presentations of varied stimuli
induces a novel form of plasticity in adult mouse primary visual cortex, leading to robust enhancement of visually
evoked activity in SST-INs. This experience-dependent plasticity is accompanied by altered visual sensitivity in
nearby excitatory neurons. To further explore this observation, we propose to combine a number of
methodological approaches, including 2-photon imaging of identified neural populations, optogenetic
manipulations, and ex vivo synaptic physiology. We will determine the visual experience required to induce this
adult plasticity, identify the underlying cellular and synaptic mechanisms, and examine the functional
consequences for cortical visual encoding and transmission. Our results will provide an unprecedented level of
insight into a novel form of plasticity in the adult cortex and identify underlying cellular- and circuit-level
mechanisms."
10823493,"Project Summary/Abstract
Type one diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune condition characterized by the progressive destruction of insulin-
producing β cells in the pancreas, leading to onset of clinical hyperglycemia and chronic dysglycemia. T1D can
be managed for decades with constant blood glucose monitoring and administration of exogenous insulin.
However, there is still no real cure to prevent or reverse onset of disease. Many current treatments have targeted
the immune system to prevent action of autoreactive lymphocytes, however concerns for patients remain over
immunosuppression. Additionally, recent literature has highlighted the level of β-cell dysfunction that also
contributes to disease pathogenesis. Therefore, treatments designed to target both β-cell health and
autoimmunity may provide the greatest potential for prevention and reversal of T1D. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a
lipid signaling molecule, possesses the capacity to modulate both the immune system and the β cells, through
the action of two receptors, EP3 and EP4. These two receptors have near equal affinity for the PGE2 ligand, but
couple to opposing intracellular pathways. Blockade of EP3 tone and enhancement of EP4 tone have previously
been demonstrated to promote β-cell proliferation and survival in both mouse and human islets ex vivo.
Additionally, in vivo, antagonism of EP3 enhances β-cell proliferation, mass, and oxidative stress responses in
a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. In the pathogenesis of T1D, β cells are exposed to high levels of oxidative
stress in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines from islet-infiltrating immune cells. This stress, along with
direct destruction by cytotoxic T cells, results in a significant loss of β-cell mass. Therefore, modulating the EP3
and EP4 receptors pathways may be able to provide β cells significant protection against this attack to prevent
loss or promote regeneration of β-cell mass. Furthermore, the primary function of PGE2 is to serve as an
immunomodulator, and it can affect immune cell phenotype and function at various stages throughout the
inflammatory response. At later stages of inflammation, sustained PGE2 production from macrophages helps
facilitate resolution of inflammation, a process which is hypothesized to be disrupted in autoimmunity. Many of
these pro-resolution activities are mediated via action of EP4, and therefore, enhancement of EP4 tone in the
islet microenvironment may also promote β-cell survival by modulating immune cell activity and allowing proper
resolution of inflammation. Ultimately, the proposed studies will elucidate whether targeting the opposing
pathways of EP3 and EP4 can serve to mitigate β-cell death by promoting pathways associated with β-cell
proliferation and survival, while simultaneously altering the islet microenvironment to favor a less
proinflammatory state. This approach may unlock a novel therapeutic strategy for treating T1D by targeting both
sides of the autoimmune equation at once."

Ebola virus (EBOV), part of the Filoviridae family, causes periodic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever and
Ebola virus disease, with case fatality rates as high as 90%. These are highly virulent and emerging zoonotic
pathogens, thus a significant threat to human health, potential agents of bioterrorism, and NIAID category A
priority pathogens. While a set of EVD clinical symptoms have been defined, the molecular mechanisms that
drive EBOV pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Despite current development of a vaccine, anti-filovirus
prophylactics and therapeutics are very limited, in part due to the paucity of information on host and viral
interactions. EBOV encodes for multifunctional proteins, including VP35. VP35 is a polymerase co-factor
necessary for both viral replication and transcription and serves as the main innate immune antagonist. Currently,
there is a major gap in our understanding of the role host factors play at critical stages in the viral replication
cycle. Our group recently conducted interactome screens for various EBOV proteins to identify key host-viral
interactions, which identified a novel interaction between a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and Ebola VP35. In
the work proposed here, I will use biochemical and structural biology tools to define the impact of ubiquitination
on VP35 function (Aim 1). In Aim 2, I will assess the impact of VP35 on the host ubiquitination machinery, with
a specific focus on type I interferon response. Ubiquitination serves powerful regulatory roles in eukaryotes, and
there is increasing evidence that viruses can antagonize the immune response by interfering with host ubiquitin-
dependent pathways, or by hijacking the host ubiquitination machinery to promote viral pathogenesis. Prior
literature and my preliminary data indicate that EBOV proteins interact with the host ubiquitination machinery. I
expect my proposed work on VP35 to determine the molecular mechanism of how this interaction impacts host-
viral dynamics. This work will also provide an experimental framework to define mechanisms by which other viral
proteins interact with the host ubiquitin machinery. My long-term career goal is to establish myself as a physician
scientist with expertise to address questions about mechanisms that drive microbial pathogenesis, and use this
knowledge to improve patient care. With the proposed studies, I will work towards this goal by uncovering and
characterizing macromolecular interactions at the host-pathogen interface. I will also enhance my experimental
skills, advance my scientific communication, and expand my teaching and mentorship skills. To accomplish this,
I have designed a training plan with an interdisciplinary team of mentors, including my sponsor Dr. Gaya
Amarasinghe with a track record of using biochemical and structural biology approaches to define key
mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. On my advising committee I also have a biochemist with expertise in post-
translational modifications (Dr. Natalie Neimi), an innate immunologist (Dr. Deborah Lenschow), a virologist and
cell biologist (Dr. Siyuan Ding), and the chair of my committee is Dr. Jennifer Philips, an infectious disease
physician scientist who will lend her expertise in host-pathogen biology as well as career guidance."
10824663,"COVID-19 has resulted in a significant burden on the human population following the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, millions have succumbed to infection due to an imbalanced
host response orchestrated by the biology of the virus. Characterization of the interactions between SARS-CoV-
2 and the infected host have revealed that the virus manipulates a small subset of signaling pathways culminating
in an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines juxtaposed to an underproduction of type I
interferons, the central antiviral defense of vertebrates. An effort to identify kinase drug targets for the treatment
of COVID-19, as kinases represent ideal druggable targets, found that the p38 family of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) are among the most highly active kinases during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
perturbation of p38 kinases inhibited both virus replication and cytokine production. Thus, p38 kinases are
promising drug targets to block both virus replication and the excessive inflammation that is a hallmark of severe
COVID-19.
 In a subsequent study, a genetic perturbation approach was used to explore the p38/MAPK-SARS-CoV-2
interface and it was determined that the β isoform of the p38 kinase is an essential host factor for virus replication.
Additionally, inhibition of p38β reduces the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N), but not viral
mRNA during infection. Contrary to the assumed pro-inflammatory activity of p38 kinases, findings suggested
p38β negatively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, p38-dependent phosphosites on
SARS-CoV-2 N were identified and mutation of these sites resulted in attenuated virus replication. Based on
these data, the overarching goal of the research proposed here is to test the hypothesize that p38β
phosphorylates both viral and host proteins to cumulatively promote SARS-CoV-2 replication and
modulate the host response.
 To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-p38β interface, Aim 1 will explore the mechanism(s) responsible
for p38β's proviral activity and ascertain the contribution of this biology to the inflammatory response observed
in the context of COVID-19. To this end, viral protein stability will be assessed with translation inhibitors and
affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish how p38β promotes the steady-state level of viral protein
during infection. In parallel, different immune agonists and genetic perturbations will be tested in Aim 2 to assess
the specificity of p38β-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and determine if altered expression
of these cytokines contributes to the proviral activity of p38β.
 By characterizing these p38β-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, the research proposed here will enhance the
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, virus-host interactions, and p38β biology in order to inform the
development of novel drug therapies critically needed for the treatment of COVID-19."

α-Actinin-4 (ACTN4) is a force-sensitive actin-binding protein that interacts with F-actin via a catch bond, which
is defined as a protein-protein interaction that strengthens under tensile force. The K255E ACTN4 variant, which
causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), exhibits ultrahigh F-actin binding affinity and is rendered
force-insensitive because it cannot catch bond with F-actin. Although actin-binding proteins have well-
established mechanosensing functions, force-dependent conformational changes in actin-binding proteins have
never been visualized. Our central hypothesis is that K255E ACTN4 binds F-actin in a constitutively strong state
that structurally resembles the force-stabilized state of wild-type ACTN4. The long-term goal of this research is
to elucidate structural mechanisms underlying deficient actin mechanosensing in hereditary podocytopathies.
This project’s immediate objective is to determine the structural basis for actin mechanosensing by ACTN4 via
in vitro force reconstitution assays, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM). In Specific Aim 1, a structural mechanism for deficient actin mechanosensing in FSGS
caused by ACTN4 mutations will be revealed via a cryo-EM structure of the force-insensitive mutant K255E
ACTN4 bound to F-actin. In Specific Aim 2, a structural mechanism for force-stabilized actin-binding by ACTN4
will be revealed via cryo-EM structures of wild-type ACTN4 bound to F-actin with and without mechanical force.
Overall, this project will: (1) advance our insights into the structural basis for actin mechanosensing by ACTN4
and lack thereof in familial FSGS, (2) provide the first structure of a catch bonding protein under force, and (3)
pioneer methods for introducing physiological mechanical forces in a manner amenable to cryo-EM. Dr. Gregory

Dr. A. James Hudspeth, MD, PhD, an expert on molecular motors and mechanotransduction who has a proven
track record of training successful physician-scientists, are co-sponsoring this proposal. The research will be
conducted at The Rockefeller University within the deeply supportive Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering
Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program. This fellowship constitutes an important career milestone for dual-degree

Iron is a critical micronutrient for hemoprotein maturation and redox signaling. Iron deficiency anemia
(IDA) is associated with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic inflammation. In all these disease
states, intravenous iron delivery is often used to replenish iron stores and improve patient outcomes. The use
of intravenous iron, however, can have harmful consequences causing patients to undergo periods of iron
overload and iron deficiency during treatment. Furthermore, each of these diseases is mediated in part by
endothelial dysfunction. Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms of iron homeostasis in the endothelium
provides a previously undefined framework for potential translation to important cardiovascular diseases. The
regulation of blood flow, a primary function of the endothelium, is reliant upon many hemoproteins, especially
hemoglobin alpha (Hba) in the microvasculature. In homeostatic conditions, Hba is expressed uniquely in the
resistance arteries and regulates the scavenging and production of nitric oxide. Hemoglobin is tightly regulated
by systemic iron homeostasis in erythrocytes, but it is not known how iron regulates Hba in endothelial cells.
Our preliminary data suggest iron is an important regulator of endothelial Hba. The central hypothesis of the
proposed studies is that the regulation of endothelial function by systemic iron homeostasis is dependent upon
intracellular iron and heme availability which work in conjunction to regulate Hba. In order to test this
hypothesis, we will use mouse models of iron overload and iron deficiency anemia. We will use endothelial
specific knockout of transferrin receptor 1 (an iron import protein) and FLVCR1a (a heme export protein) to
modulate endothelial iron and heme concentrations independent of systemic iron homeostasis. Changes in
blood flow and NO signaling will be assessed with laser speckle contrast imaging. To investigate the link
between iron import and Hba expression, we will utilize a peptide developed by our lab which increases blood
flow by disrupting the Hba/eNOS complex. Biochemical assays will be used to assess endothelial heme
concentrations and Hba maturation. The long-term goal of this project is to provide novel insights into the
mechanisms by which iron regulates endothelial function and allow us to better understand the vascular
etiologies of chronic diseases."

Extensive evidence implicates glutamatergic synapses as key pathogenic sites in neuropsychiatric disorders
(NPDs). Recently-emerging evidence has implicated ankyrin proteins, including Ankyrin-G (AnkG),
encoded by the ANK3 gene, and Ankyrin-B (AnkB), encoded by ANK2, in the biology of central nervous
system synapses. While conventionally AnkG and –B have been seen as playing roles mainly at the axon
initial segment, their functions in central glutamatergic synapses have only begun to be investigated,
including in studies initiated by our laboratory. During the previous funding period, we have made extensive
progress in understanding the regulation and interactome of AnkG at synapses and in dendrites. Our
preliminary findings broaden our understanding of the neurobiology of ankyrins, and implicate them in
several novel process, including deubiquitination and endocannabinoid signaling. In this proposal we will
use neuroproteomics, conditional knockout and reporter mice, super-resolution and in vivo two-photon
microscopy, calcium imaging, bioinformatics, and behavioral analyses, to investigate the functions of
AnkG's protein partners in dendrite and at glutamatergic synapses. We hypothesize that AnkG performs
multiple novel functions including supramolecular scaffold complex maintenance and regulation of
endocannabinoid signaling, through which it controls spiny synapse development, structure, function, as
well as circuit level network activity and behavior, in a cell type and developmental period-specific manner.
We will test this hypothesis in the following Aims: Aim 1. To investigate the impact of cell type-dependent
and developmentally-timed knock out of AnkG on brain structure, function, and behavior across
maturation. Aim 2. To investigate the impact of cell type-dependent and developmentally-timed knock out
of AnkB on brain structure, function, and behavior across maturation. Aim 3. To determine the mechanisms
and functional significance of the interaction of AnkG with DAGLĮ. The proposed studies are highly novel
and impactful, given that the synaptic functions of ankyrins are only beginning to be investigated. This
proposal will be the first to investigate the function of several recently-discovered AnkG-interacting proteins
in unexpected biological processes, using multiple cutting edge methods, and will open new avenues for
many future studies."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common group of inherited retinal disorders associated with progressive
loss of vision. RP is typically diagnosed in adulthood following the onset of night blindness and impaired
peripheral vision. Longitudinal studies of patients with RP reveal that their loss of visual acuity is significantly
slower than the deterioration of their photoreceptor function. How the visual system sustains acuity despite the
progressive loss of photoreceptors is unclear.
Our hypothesis is that flexibility within the circuits of the visual system engage with the progressive loss of visual
output to impair acuity. We will test our hypothesis by first characterizing the deficit in acuity and related functional
characteristics in visual cortex and retina in using the rhodopsin P23H/+ (rho P23H/+) mutant mouse model.
These mice have similar declines in retinal function and are a good model of human RP. Then we will evaluate
whether enhancing or reducing experience-dependent plasticity affects the trajectory of the progressive loss of
vision of rho P23H/+ mice by then characterizing the deficit in acuity and related functional characteristics in
visual cortex and retina in using the rhodopsin P23H/+ (rho P23H/+) mutant mice that also lack a gene that limits
plasticity in adult visual circuitry (nogo-66 receptor, ngr1) or that is required for visual plasticity (activity-regulated
cytoskeleton-associated protein, ARC). Mice lacking ngr1 (ngr1 -/-) display greater visual plasticity than adult
wild-type mice while mice lacking ARC (ARC -/-) exhibit reduced visual plasticity."

The primary objective of this proposal is to map human retinal ganglion cell receptive fields in vivo, at
cellular resolution, directly connecting light stimulation of individual retinal photoreceptors to both the
activity of retinal ganglion cells and the conscious percept of retinal ganglion cell (RGC)
activity. Performing this task in vivo with human subjects will have enormous implications for the study of the
neural code leaving the eye.
 There are 120 million photoreceptors in the human retina that absorb and respond to light. The human
optic nerve, however, the sole link between the retina and the brain, comprises a mere ~1 million axons. This
bottleneck shapes the neural code of the retina, which has never been completely described1,2. Past the optic
nerve, the transformation of information from the retina into a conscious percept involves neural interactions
that can usually only be studied through relatively coarse methods (such as fMRI). To understand the
organization of data leaving the eye, it will be essential to better connect the functional organization of human
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to human visual percepts.
 It is difficult to study the neural code leaving the human eye because the optic nerve is inaccessible and
dense. Psychophysics using adaptive-optics-stabilized microstimulation of the photoreceptor mosaic is one
way to probe the information being sent from eye to brain3,4. This technique allows precise control of the input
to the photosensitive layer of the retina.
 However, precise control of the inputs to the retina is not enough, since there are multiple parallel
pathways from retina to brain5. A pulse of light falling on a single cone will cause many different RGC signals
to be sent to the brain, most prominently ON and OFF of both midget and parasol, the most common RGC
types6. Disentangling the percepts–what a human subject can report as ""seen""—elicited by the different RGC
types is a difficult problem.
 In order to probe the perceptual correlates of selectively stimulated groups of RGCs, this
project will leverage perceptual desensitization with adaptive-optics-stabilized microstimuli. First a
“desensitization” stimulus will habituate several RGC pathways with single cone stimulation, and then a “probe”
stimulus will be used to target a single RGC type psychophysically, one cone at a time. In this way, a single
RGC ""perceptive field"" can be mapped and investigated. Once mapped, RGC perceptive fields can be
subsequently investigated. This work will be performed in Prof. Austin Roorda's adaptive optics psychophysics
lab at the University of California, Berkeley.
 Single cone stimuli are unusual in the ex vivo literature. To confirm that desensitization and probe
stimuli are driving the RGCs as expected, this project will also involve testing desensitization and probe stimuli
using electrophysiological techniques in primate retina. Further, the design and evaluation of single cone
pulsing light stimuli that maximally drive some RGC types over others will require ex vivo work. This pursuit
will also be a potentially clinically relevant one, since stimuli that could maximally target RGCs that are
implicated in the early stages of retinal disease, such as OFF RGCs in glaucoma7, could be used to design
future diagnostic tools. The electrophysiology work will be performed in the lab of retinal physiologist Prof.
Teresa Puthussery at UC Berkeley.
 If successful, this project could lead to novel clinical diagnostic tools for the treatment of retinal
diseases and inform the understanding of how the neural code from the eye is interpreted by the brain."

 T cell production declines with age and contributes to decreased immune function and increased
susceptibility to infections and cancers in older adults. This decline in T cell output may be due to changes in the
aged progenitor cells and/or changes in the thymic microenvironment. T cells develop from hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) and progenitors that enter the thymus, an organ known to atrophy with age. Previous studies looking
at T cell potential from aged HSCs have been limited by the assays available; determining T cell output in vivo
has relied on hematopoietic transplantation models and is confounded by the long process of engraftment and
thymic recruitment. While some in vitro models have looked at T cell output from aged HSCs and progenitors,
these methods often start with a heterogenous population of cells and produce mixed conclusions about T cell
potential. This proposal seeks to overcome these challenges by studying single, phenotypically-defined aged
and young HSCs and progenitors to determine T cell output and development. Further, we will determine whether
a pro-inflammatory signaling pathway enhanced in aging plays a role in driving reduced thymopoiesis with age.
 In this proposal, Specific Aim 1 will determine the role of HSC and progenitor age on T cell development
using our in vitro Artificial Thymic Organoid (ATO) system. The ATO fully recapitulates all stages of T cell
development from a single HSC or progenitor. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that aged stem cells exhibit
differences at early stages of T cell development and removing aged stem cells from their inflamed
microenvironment ultimately restores their ability to produce comparable T cell numbers, emphasizing the
importance of inflammatory factors in the microenvironment.
 Specific Aim 2 will evaluate a specific signaling pathway enhanced in aging and its effects on T cell
production using a novel mouse model. Levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase in the
aged bone marrow and thymus, and IL-6 may drive changes in the aged HSC pool (resulting in more myeloid-
biased HSCs) and thymic atrophy. IL-6 requires signaling through glycoprotein 130 (gp130), and our
collaborators identified a signaling modality within the gp130 receptor that produced regenerative effects in
mouse models of wound healing and osteoarthritis when inactivated. In our preliminary data, we show that these
mutant mice also have greater thymocyte numbers, prompting us to investigate whether signaling through this
specific part of the IL-6 gp130 receptor mediates reduced thymopoiesis with age.
 Our results will improve our understanding of the aging immune system and inform potential therapies
for regenerative medicine. Successful completion of these aims is a critical component of a comprehensive
training plan, in which I will gain skills in experimental design, data analysis, scientific communication, and
mentorship to grow as a future physician scientist. I will be supported by my sponsor, Dr. Gay Crooks, in a
collaborative training environment at UCLA."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Epigenetic Mechanisms and the Treatment
of Cancer, organized by Drs. Tony Kouzarides, Rab Prinjha and Marisa Bartolomei. The conference will be
held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from February 4 - 7, 2024.
This Keystone Symposia Epigenetics conference will highlight the latest advances in the understanding of
epigenetic drivers in cancer and relate this to the current epigenetic treatments of the disease. One unique
and compelling aspect of this conference will be the intersection of academia and industry. Academic
presenters will highlight basic research into epigenetic pathways of cancer (i.e., what are the drivers; how they
work; how does diet or the environment affect inheritance, susceptibility and mutation accumulation; what are
epigenetic mechanism of cancer resistance, metastasis, and tumor plasticity). Industry speakers will relate
their latest efforts to target cancer in a personalized manner, and report on emerging developments in anti-
cancer therapies currently heading to or in the clinic. Additionally, there will be an emphasis on examples
where academics/clinicians have taken their research towards the clinic, through collaborations with
pharmaceutical and biotech companies. It is anticipated that this conference will provide an opportunity for
academic, clinical and industry scientists to meet and collaborate. In addition, young investigators will have the
opportunity to learn how basic research is converted into concrete treatments for cancer patients, reinforcing
the advantage of thinking about patient benefit and industrial partnering in their research. Finally, in order to
help facilitate their career choices, there will be workshops with panelists from academia and industry reflecting
on their choices and experiences, as well as a panel on women in science."

Bacteroidales is the most abundant order of bacteria in the human gut, yet we still know little about energy
generating processes of these bacteria and how these systems support their fitness in the gut and affect host
processes. We have demonstrated that Bacteroides have a complex respiratory chain that provides
substantial energy during both anaerobic and nanaerobic growth. Our preliminary results reveal new and
unexpected complexities of the respiratory pathway, new terminal electron acceptors that we predict
contribute to bacterial and host fitness, and differences between Bacteroides species that likely impact
microbiota composition. These important features and complexities of respiration in the gut Bacteroides will
be addressed in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will study the NUO complex, likely the most important
generator of the proton gradient, which provides the energy for transport functions including TonB-
dependent import processes such as acquisition of dietary polysaccharides. Unlike most NUO enzymes,
Bacteroides has the NUO-11 variant that does not accept electrons from NADH. In this aim, we will use
genetics, biochemistry, and mouse models to conclusively identify the electron donor to NUO-11, determine
the importance of NUO and Na+/H+ antiporters in maintaining the essential proton gradient, and determine
their contributions to bacterial fitness. In Aim 2, we will study the acquisition and remodeling of the essential
respiratory component menaquinone (MK). Most Bacteroides have all the genes necessary for the de novo
synthesis of MK; however, certain Bacteroides species lack the primary men genes and must obtain and
remodel MK from dietary or microbial sources. This remodeling requires cleavage of the hydrophobic side
chain by an unknown enzyme that also is likely necessary for the synthesis of MK-4 (Vitamin K2) by humans.
We will explore unknown features of MK synthesis including identification and characterization of the enzyme
that cleaves the isoprenoid chain in the remodeling process, how species without the men operon obtain
MK precursors, and the dietary and/or microbiota sources of these precursors. In Aim 3, we will study the
NrfHA complex, expression of which is among the most upregulated during nanaerobic growth. We predict
NrfHA is an additional terminal carrier that donates electrons to both nitrite and nitric oxide (NO). We predict
NrfHA protects Bacteroides against NO produced in the normal and inflamed gut. We will study the regulation
of the nrfHA operon during nanaerobic growth, study the ability of NrfHA to donate electrons to both nitrite
and NO, and determine if this complex allows Bacteroides to better survive in the inflamed gut with
concomitant protective effects for the host. The data obtained from the experiments of this proposal will
reveal several new aspects of the physiology of the Bacteroides that can be translated for human health
benefits."

Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a pediatric and young adult cancer that is driven by the EWSR1-FLI1 translocation.
Despite decades of work, this cancer is still an enigma, with poorly understood biology and no targeted
treatments. Our recent work published in Nature demonstrated a previously overlooked consequence of
EWSR1-FLI1, that this fusion causes hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (pRNAPII) due to loss of
EWSR1 inhibition of CDK7 and CDK9. We observed high levels of transcription, with high levels of R-loops
present in locations that R-loops normally (physiologically) occur. Based upon these findings, we began to
reconsider cellular phenotypes of EwS to identify the molecular basis of these phenotypes and ask whether
these changes provide a fundamental defect in all EwS. One phenotype that was previously identified in EwS
is that these cells display altered splicing profiles. In recent years there were several reports linking R-loops to
splicing, with splicing defects causing R-loop accumulation and R-loops being associated with sites of
alternative splicing. Further, it was reported that the splicing machinery inhibits DHX9 (aka RNA helicase A;
RHA) from causing accumulation of toxic R-loops. Also, of interest, is that EWSR1-FLI1 interacts with and
impairs DHX9 activity. By performing a genomic RNAi viability screen, we determined that EwS is acutely
sensitive to a loss of RNA processing capability. These collective observations led us to the hypothesis that
Ewing sarcoma is dependent upon RNA processing machinery to prevent accumulation of toxic R-
loops. If our hypothesis is correct, then it suggests that there may be a therapeutic opportunity to target
splicing components, converting the high levels of physiological R-loops in EwS into pathological R-loops to
drive toxic genomic instability. We propose to test our hypothesis with two Aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate
the mechanistic relationship between transcription levels, R-loops and splicing in EwS. For this we will
modulate splicing components by siRNA depletions, cDNA expression or use of pharmaceutical inhibitors,
examining transcription activity (Gro-Seq and uridine incorporation), splicing (reporters and RNA-Seq analysis)
and R-loops (DRIP-Seq). In Aim 2, we will examine whether EwS is particularly reliant on splicing components
or RNA:DNA helicases to block toxic conversion of R-loops and how targeting these processes impacts EwS
viability, DNA damage response and/or cell cycle progression. We will ask if these modulations effect EwS
cells at a particular time during cell cycle or stem cell state using single cell sequencing techniques. We will
also assess how these various components of R-loop biology interact with one another, with pRNAPII and with
R-loops in EwS. Finally, based upon these results, we will extend our findings to test efficacy of removing the
R-loop metabolizing program that EwS is most reliant upon as a means to inhibit EwS tumor growth. Overall,
this work should provide critical insight into the biology of Ewing sarcoma and provide new avenues for
treatment beyond the standard chemotherapeutics currently used."

This is the initial submission of a K01 application by Lindsay Miller Ph.D., under the mentorship of Joachim Ix
M.D., at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). This proposal will establish Dr. Miller as an
independent investigator and will leverage large-scale proteomics to understand the association and predictive
ability of the proteome with cognitive impairment (CI), a clinical symptom of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Candidate: Dr. Miller’s training objectives and career goals through this proposal include: 1) to become an
expert in CKD and CI in older adults 2) to develop skills in advanced methods for the application to proteomic
data, and 3) to develop skills in grant writing, lab management and career development. Dr. Miller will
accomplish these objectives through mentorship, coursework, and workshops. She has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team comprised of her primary mentor, Dr. Ix, an established leader in nephrology,
and the following co-mentors: Dr. Marquine, an expert in neuropsychology; Dr. Scherzer, the Director of
Biostatistics at the Kidney Health Research Collaboration at the University of California, San Francisco.
Research: CI is a clinical symptom of ADRD, with mild CI being often a precursor to the development of
ADRD. CI is common among patients with CKD; however, CI has received much less investigation than
complications such as CVD and end-stage kidney disease. Studies have primarily used estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) to evaluate the relationship between CKD and
CI. However, in recent work the applicant demonstrated that a panel of markers reflecting kidney tubule health
was associated with CI independent of eGFR and ACR in older adults, indicating that these markers of kidney
health do not fully explain its link with CI. Still, the relationship is likely more complex that what can be
identified using a few targeted biomarkers. Thus, Dr. Miller proposes to utilize large-scale proteomic data to
understand the multifactorial relationship between CKD and cognition with the long-term objective that these
insights might lead to novel approaches and therapies to prevent or ameliorate the development of CI in the
CKD population. Next, while large-scale proteomics is optimally suited to understand biological pathways
between CKD and CI, it will not be feasible to utilize in clinical practice to identify individuals at highest risk for
CI. As such, variable selection methods are needed to identify and validate subsets of proteins that will allow
clinical prediction of cognitive impairment. In aim 1, she will identify protein clusters and biological pathways
that associate with CI. This aim will be conducted in 3419 adults with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency
Cohort Study (CRIC). In aim 2 she will test different penalized variable selection methods to identify a panel of
proteins that predict CI in the same CRIC cohort. In aim 3, Dr. Miller will determine if the clusters and proteins
identified in CRIC externally validate among 1076 older adults with CKD in the Cardiovascular Health Study."

 Obesity is a major challenge for public health that predisposes individuals for metabolic diseases such
as diabetes. It arises because of a dysregulation in homeostatic maintenance of energy balance, resulting in
excess intake/storage relative to expenditure. By driving the storage of energy into white fat via
parasympathetic nerve driven release of the pancreatic hormone insulin, the autonomic nervous system plays
a key regulatory role in energy homeostasis. It also drives the expending of energy from fat by activation of the
sympathetic nervous system.
 The adipose hormone leptin orchestrates the communication between the nervous system and energy
storage organ, fat, that is necessary for homeostatic maintenance of energy balance. Leptin was previously
understood to do this by acting in a negative feedback loop with the brain to reduce fat mass via reduction of
food intake and sympatho-excitatory effects on adipose. Surprisingly, we discovered that leptin also regulates
plasticity in levels of sympathetic innervation inside of adipose tissue. These regulatory effects on the
sympathetic nerve architecture innervating adipose has functional implications for energy regulation by both
white fat lipolysis and brown fat thermogenesis. While we have delineated the brain circuit controlling this
process, the mechanisms that leptin uses to regulate adipose innervation plasticity, and whether this process
occurs in other metabolic organs, is still unknown.
 In the mentored phase of this grant, I will pursue a mechanistic understanding of how leptin-dependent
brain signals are translated into adipose sympathetic innervation plasticity. Specifically, I will dissect how
activity of a pre-autonomic neural population, BDNF-expressing neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus,
dynamically regulates sympathetic innervation levels in adipose. Furthermore, to identify the molecular
changes associated with plasticity in sympathetic ganglia innervating fat, I will develop a proximity protein
tagging strategy to enrich these factors from nerves inside fat for quantitative proteomics. Finally, in the
independent phase, I will explore the generality of leptin’s effects on autonomic innervation plasticity in organs
beyond adipose tissue. Here, I will study the role of leptin on innervation plasticity in an organ important for
energy storage, the pancreas, using the tools developed during the mentored part of this proposal.
 Altogether, this work will uncover the mechanisms by which leptin regulates the plasticity of autonomic
innervation inside of adipose and the pancreas. Understanding these mechanisms will enable the identification
of downstream targets which directly modulate autonomic innervation and their functional role in regulating
energy balance, forming a foundation for new therapies to treat obesity and diabetes."

Comorbid overweight/obesity (BMI>85th percentile for sex and age) was rare in youth with type 1 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM) prior to the 1990s, but the prevalence now exceeds that of youth in the general population.
Behavioral weight management interventions are evidence-based, first-line treatments for pediatric obesity.
Yet, there are unique challenges of T1DM that require thoughtful adaptations to these interventions. Examples
include reduced exercise and excess calorie consumption due to hypoglycemia. Adolescents with T1DM and
comorbid overweight/obesity are also at high risk of developing disordered eating behaviors. There is a critical
need for behavioral weight management interventions that address barriers specific to T1DM and incorporate
attention to eating disorder prevention in this at-risk population. The objective of this K23 project is to adapt the
primary mentor’s (Dr. Elissa Jelalian) established 16-week adolescent weight management intervention for a
T1DM population. Using the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, a framework for
intervention development, this project will design, refine, and test an adapted behavioral weight management
intervention for adolescents with comorbid T1DM and overweight/obesity using two related yet distinct studies.
Study 1 will ensure feasibility (i.e., participant attendance) and acceptability of intervention materials by
adolescents with comorbid T1DM and overweight/obesity using an open-trial design with 2-3 small groups (n=5
adolescents/group). Participants will complete validated measures of acceptability after each weekly session
and an exit survey post-intervention. The Candidate will iteratively refine the intervention based upon Study 1
results. Study 2 will compare the adapted weight management intervention to a usual care control group using
a pilot randomized controlled trial design (n=50 total adolescents) to verify that the adapted intervention
reduces participant BMI and increases the percent time spent in the target blood glucose range (70-180mg/dL;
primary outcomes). Participants in Study 2 will complete ecological momentary assessments (EMA) at
baseline and 16-weeks to determine events of maladaptive eating and weight control behaviors over time
(secondary outcomes). Exploratory analyses will evaluate correlates of these maladaptive eating and weight
control behaviors in real-world settings. This K23 project builds upon the Candidate’s prior work in pediatric
obesity and T1DM. The highly qualified and expert mentorship team will provide support and oversight,
allowing the Candidate to acquire the necessary skills to launch an independent research career aimed at
improving weight management for adolescents with comorbid T1DM and overweight/obesity. Results will
provide data for a subsequent application to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial to test the
efficacy of the adapted weight management intervention. The proposed project aligns with the NIDDK’s
mission to mitigate diabetes-related cardiovascular events and has the potential to be an important public
health intervention to improve the health of adolescents with T1DM and overweight/obesity."

 Thyroid cancer incidence is high, with 44,280 new cases diagnosed in the US in 2021. Thyroid nodule
incidence is rising primarily due to increased detection, necessitating more procedures such as fine needle
aspiration (FNA) biopsies to rule out cancer. However, most thyroid nodule biopsies produce benign,
indeterminate, or non-diagnostic results and are potentially avoidable. Our long-term goal is to improve risk
stratification of thyroid nodules, reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, and minimize the burden of
thyroid cancer diagnosis for patients and the healthcare system. Our central hypothesis is that thyroid cancer
genetic risk estimate will improve risk stratification of thyroid nodules and reduce the number of avoidable FNA
biopsies of benign thyroid nodules. Supported by robust preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing two specific aims: Aim 1. Define the genetic architecture of thyroid cancer. Aim 2. Develop and
assess the clinical utility of a genetic thyroid nodule classifier that discriminates between benign and malignant
thyroid nodules. Under the first aim, we will explore genetic associations with thyroid malignancy independent
of benign goiter to discover novel thyroid cancer biomarkers and develop a clinically useful polygenic risk score
(PRS). We will use two approaches: 1) test genetic associations directly using a GWAS meta-analysis with
4,994 thyroid cancer cases and 20,917 patients with benign nodules as controls, and 2) use a computational
GWAS-by-subtraction method to derive summary statistics for the thyroid cancer free from genetic
associations with benign nodular goiter. We will use publicly available genome-wide association studies, such
as from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative, and perform our meta-analyses using the Colorado Center
for Personalized Medicine Biobank and other Biobanks from around the world. We hypothesize that a thyroid
nodule classifier PRS in combination with standard of care Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-
RADS) ultrasound schema will improve risk stratification of thyroid nodules and ultimately reduce the number
of unnecessary thyroid nodule biopsies. We developed a thyroid nodule classifier PRS that differentiates
malignant and benign thyroid nodules with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.61.
We will apply this score to ~600 thyroid nodules from genotyped patients with known cytologic or
histopathologic diagnoses of benign goiter or thyroid cancer. Three expert physicians will estimate TI-RADS
points and categories. We will evaluate the efficacy of the TI-RADS algorithm alone and in combination with
our novel PRS to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. We will use the precisely defined genetic
landscape of thyroid malignancy (Aim 1) to improve the thyroid nodule classifier PRS. This study will pave the
way for personalized management of thyroid nodules and inform future mechanistic studies aimed at better
understanding the risk of thyroid cancer."
10863985,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Role of XPD in DNA Damage Response Pathway Choice
 The DNA damage response has evolved to protect the integrity of the human genome against the potentially
devastating effects of endogenous and exogenous genotoxins. A successful DNA damage response occurs due
to well-orchestrated crosstalk between pathways within the network. For instance, an intricate balance between
DNA repair and apoptosis minimizes the likelihood of genomic instability, which can lead to mutagenesis and
ultimately to disease. Although the regulatory mechanism and signaling pathways controlling DNA repair and
apoptosis are well characterized, the driving forces responsible for making the ultimate choice between DNA
repair and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress remain unclear. The overall goal is to understand the
mechanisms involved in triggering the appropriate reaction at the intersection of the nucleotide excision repair
(NER) and apoptotic pathways.
 The NER pathway occupies an important position in the recognition and repair of a wide array of helix-
distorting lesions, including formation of triplex structures and lesions generated by chemotherapeutic agents.
Recent work from our group has discovered that the NER protein, XPD occupies a central role in triggering p53-
independent apoptosis in response to helix-distorting DNA damage via phosphorylation of the H2AX tyrosine142
residue. In Aim 1, we will determine how XPD tyrosine phosphorylation functions as a signaling mechanism to
mediate DNA repair-apoptosis pathway choice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether XPD’s role in cell fate
decisions is linked to its molecular properties essential for repair, transcription, and apoptosis. The proposed
work is highly significant because imbalance between pathways within the DNA damage response network can
eventually contribute to the etiology of human diseases."

The Quantitative Metabolism and Imaging Core will provide nutrition and obesity researchers access to
advanced techniques to study metabolism. Core users will be provided targeted metabolomics, stable isotope
tracer measurements of metabolic flux, and imaging approaches. The Core will also consult with investigators
on experimental design and data interpretation. Metabolomic approaches will be used to quantify intermediary
metabolites and co-factors in plasma or tissue extracts using targeted MS based metabolomics. Since these
analyses can be performed quickly and inexpensively, they will be used as the first line of investigation to
inform the design of more intensive flux experiments. Stable isotope tracer experiments will provide detailed
information about the function of entire pathways by using labeled substrates that incorporate into
downstream metabolites. Labeling characteristics of metabolites, detected by NMR and/or MS, will be used
to determine metabolite turnover or perform metabolic flux analysis. Data will be returned to the investigator
and core staff will be consulted on data interpretation. These approaches can be used in projects involving
cell culture, mouse models and human subjects. Flux studies can be coordinated with additional analysis of
body composition and tissue intracellular lipid content using in vivo imaging spectroscopy techniques.
Additional metabolic imaging studies of tissue specific metabolic flux can be achieved using 13C-
hyperpolarized imaging. The Quantitative Metabolism and Imaging Core provides access to many of the state-
of-the-art approaches necessary for NORC investigators to carry out rigorous and innovative studies of

The cerebellum plays a key role in motor control, particularly in motor learning. However, there is increasing
recognition that the cerebellum also participates in cognitive functions such as planning, set-shifting, abstract
reasoning, attention and working memory. Indeed, cerebellar damage is associated with both motor and
cognitive problems and has been linked to a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, from
ataxia and dystonia to schizophrenia and autism. Despite this remarkable functional heterogeneity, the
cerebellar microcircuit is remarkably homogeneous, both across its different regions and across different
animal species. This has led to the theory that the cerebellum may accomplish its job by performing one
universal computation, which can be applied to both motor and non-motor functional domains by connecting
the cerebellum to different brain areas. Much of what we know about this universal computation comes from
mechanistic studies that have revealed what the cerebellum does – and how it does it – by manipulating and
recording neural activity in the cerebellum of mice and other animals performing simple sensorimotor learning
tasks. Based on this previous work, a picture is emerging that the cerebellum is a ‘machine’ specialized for
supervised learning, whose function can be summarized succinctly: to learn how to eliminate errors. While
there is good support for this idea for learning tasks in which the error signals are low-level and conveyed
directly from the sensory periphery to the cerebellum via subcortical pathways, there is almost nothing known
about the function of high-level error signals originating in parts of the brain that are not directly connected to
the sensory or motor periphery. The goal of this project is to start filling this gap by examining how the
cerebellum operates when mice are trained in 3 new learning tasks recently developed, in which the error
signals originate in the primary somatosensory cortex (aim 1), the cerebellum itself (aim 2) and the prefrontal
cortex (aim 3). To assess function, the proposed experiments will record and manipulate the error signals
present during the learning process with an unprecedented level of temporal and cellular specificity, using new
high-density Neuropixels tools and cell-specific photostimulation with optogenetics. This research could help
develop new therapeutic approaches to treat both motor as well as cognitive disorders associated with

The unicellular parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the most prevalent, non-viral, sexually-
transmitted infection worldwide, with approximately ¼ billion people contracting trichomoniasis annually.
Trichomoniasis is the most common parasitic infection in the US, with an annual incidence estimated at ~5 million
cases. Nevertheless, this parasite is vastly understudied. As such, T. vaginalis was classified by the Center of
Disease Control and Prevention as a neglected infection in the US in 2014. In addition to being a common cause
of vaginitis, trichomoniasis is associated with adverse inflammatory sequelae, that can contribute to pregnancy
complications and neonatal mortality, the spread of HIV, and increased metastasis of urogenital cancers. The
incidence of infection, the growing recognition that T. vaginalis is associated with long-term health consequences
and an increase in the number of drug resistant clinical isolates of T. vaginalis underscore the need to develop
new chemotherapeutic and vaccine design strategies. A much better understanding of processes involved in
infectivity and pathogenesis, such as those proposed here, will be imperative to achieve these goals. Several
years ago we discovered that T. vaginalis secretes small, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs), that
mediate host:parasite interactions. We have shown that parasite proteins are transferred to host cells via EVs,
which in turn, modulates both parasite adherence to host cells and the host cell responses. Host:pathogen cross-
talk mediated by EVs likely contributes to parasite colonization of the host and down-regulation of cytokines that
elicit immune cells to the site of infection. This proposal focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms used
for host cell internalization of EVs: a process required for EV-mediated communication between the parasite and
host. We will also examine the effect of EVs on the survival of parasites in vivo using a newly-developed mouse
model. To this end, we propose to: characterize biochemical properties of an EV ligand (Tv 4-alpha-
glucanotransferase) that binds host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans and drives EV internalization by host cells
(Aim 1); isolate and identify EV receptor(s) on the host cell and test whether the receptor(s) are required for EV
internalization (Aim 2) and to identify EV proteins involved in host cell internalization and test whether EVs affect
parasite survival during early stage infection in vivo using isogenic T. vaginalis strains that differ in host cell
adherence (Aim 3). We will uncover biochemical and cellular mechanisms that promote parasite infection and
will reveal whether our in vitro findings supporting a role for EVs in host cell colonization are confirmed in vivo.
Novel mechanisms are likely to be found, as very little mechanistic data on the interaction or uptake of any
parasite-derived EV with host cells have been reported. In addition to expanding our knowledge of host:pathogen
interactions, these studies will increase our overall knowledge of how EVs mediate cell:cell communication and
will contribute to a better understanding of the role of EVs in infectious diseases. These findings could also
enable future development of new therapeutic approaches."
10865122,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use
through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We
Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which
are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well-
designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity,
opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short-
term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use).
Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self-
monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes +
alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During
weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to
facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter
data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and
YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study
context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze
data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements
over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims
are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the
control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and
secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2:
To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the
experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary
outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3
(exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based
on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer
experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.).
Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management
intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery
method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS
to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact."

bat-borne viruses such as Lassa fever and probably Ebola, are among the most important causes of emerging
infectious diseases, and many circulate enzootically in W. Africa. The mechanisms whereby these and other
zoonotic African viruses emerge and spread remain obscure, along with the understanding of their disease
burden and varied clinical outcomes. The West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases will address
these critical gaps through field studies of enzootic transmission, and clinical studies of human exposure and
disease outcome. Our surveillance of humans, and wild animals, including bats (probable hosts of filoviruses,
coronaviruses and henipaviruses), and mosquitoes/ticks, will likely identify new emerging viral pathogens.
Further, the infrastructure and local expertise developed through these projects in Senegal, Sierra Leone and
Nigeria, along with biosafety/biosecurity training and improved diagnostics, will also prepare the region for
future outbreaks of emerging viral and other infectious diseases. The Center’s aims are to:
1. Study zoonotic arboviruses in Senegal, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, including identification and
 characterization of critical reservoir and amplification hosts, enzootic and epidemic vectors, temporal
 patterns of enzootic and epidemic circulation, levels of human exposure, immune responses and disease
 outcomes. The emphasis will be on the 4 “urban” (human amplified) arboviruses: CHIKV, DENV, YFV and
 ZIKV, but other known and possibly unknown viruses will also be studied. Risk maps will be generated.
2. In Sierra Leone and Nigeria, study the circulation among rodent hosts and infections of humans by Lassa
 virus, including identification of viral determinants of hemorrhagic disease severity and sequelae outcomes,
 and determination of the mechanisms of strain virulence variation. Risk maps will also be generated.
3. Perform surveillance in bats to identify potential sources of Ebola virus in W. Africa as well as other known
 or unknown zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses and henipaviruses that may be causing human
 disease, and which may explain the origins of emerging pathogens such as Nipah and MERS coronavirus.
4. Establish biocontainment and biosecurity training programs, advanced yet affordable viral genomics
 capabilities, and comprehensive diagnostics to support these aims as well as to improve research
 infrastructure and future outbreak responses in W. Africa.
Our results will increase the mechanistic understanding of zoonotic viral maintenance and emergence,
etiologies of febrile and hemorrhagic diseases, diverse disease outcomes, and risks for local and international
spread. Novel viruses with emergence potential will likely be discovered, and existing collaborations between
the Univ. of TX Medical Branch and its partners in Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, as well as research
infrastructure, will be strengthened to prepare for and respond quickly and effectively to future outbreaks."
10865123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epiblast cavity formation occurs as the embryo implants into the uterine wall, making this step ethically
inaccessible to experimental study in humans. While mouse embryos do provide a genetically tractable tool for
exploring mechanisms associated with epiblast cavity formation, such investigations are restricted to embryo
size and number, and live imaging of peri-implantation events is still limited. Thus, there is a critical need for an
in vitro platform to model, manipulate and directly study key steps involved. Recently, we showed that
aggregates of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) recapitulate several of these embryogenic events: they
readily polarize and self-organize into radial structures, forming spheroids with a central lumen (hPSC-
spheroid). This lumenal spheroid forming property, combined with the transcriptomic and epigenetic similarity
of hPSC to epiblast cells in vivo, makes this hPSC-based system an attractive model system for investigation
of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epiblast cavity formation. Strikingly, apical polarization,
radial organization and lumenogenesis in this system are driven by formation and membrane integration of an
apicosome, an apically polarized membranous organelle with extracellular-like features (i.e. microvilli, primary
cilium and accumulated Ca2+). To further expand the mechanistic understanding of apicosome biology, we
examined the comprehensive proteome of the apicosome territory using an APEX2 (engineered ascorbate
peroxidase 2)-based proximity biotinylation system, coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry. We
discovered several proteins that are enriched in the apicosome territory, including proteins with known
functions in vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeletal organization (RAB35 and CDC42) as well as mTORC1
signaling (LAMTOR1/p18 and V-type proton ATPases). Our preliminary results show that these proteins are
localized to the apicosome and apicosome precursor vesicles, and that the cellular and signaling processes
that are governed by these proteins are involved in apicosome formation. To further investigate this, we will: 1)
Explore how the small GTPase RAB35 regulates the formation and trafficking of the apicosome and establish
CDC42 as a downstream effector of RAB35; 2) Examine the requirement of mTORC1 signaling in apicosome
formation; 3) Determine mTORC1 function during ciliogenesis in the apicosome. Establishment of primary cilia
and apicobasal cell polarity are tightly linked. Proteomic analysis reveals that SLC7 amino acid transporter
proteins, including SLC7A3 (cationic amino acid transporter 3), SLC7A8 (large neutral amino acids transporter
small subunit 2) and SLC7A11 (cysteine/glutamate transporter), are enriched in the apicosome territory.
mTORC1 signaling was recently shown to regulate primary cilium formation downstream of SLC7A8. The work
proposed here will greatly accelerate the pace of discovery regarding these essential but previously
inaccessible peri-implantation events, and will have enormous implications for understanding early process
that impact embryonic development and human fertility."

This proposal is a request for continued funding of a broadly based predoctoral and postdoctoral Mechanisms
of Aging and Dementia Training Program from the Northwestern University Interdepartmental Neuroscience
Program (NUIN). Funding to support four advanced predoctoral candidates, after they have begun full-time thesis
research, and four postdoctoral trainees in early or later stages of training, is requested. Training duration will
be for two years with a goal to assist trainees in submitting and obtaining support from individual research
fellowships following training grant support. This training program developed from a multidisciplinary group of
investigators whose work focuses on the mechanisms of aging and dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease
and related disorders, frontotemporal degeneration, Parkinson's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,
with approaches spanning molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, neuropsychological and clinical
neuroscience. These faculty are affiliated primarily with NUIN and the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology
and Alzheimer's Disease, which has an NIA supported Alzheimer's Disease Research Center grant. The program
will be co-directed by Robert Vassar, PhD, and Sandra Weintraub, PhD, in a Multi-PI format. They will have the
assistance of Thorsten Kahnt, PhD, and Hongxin Dong, PhD, as Associate Directors, an internal Steering
Committee and an External Advisory Committee. The four predoctoral and four postdoctoral trainees will conduct
their research under the guidance of 48 preceptors from 13 departments of 3 schools on the Chicago and
Evanston campuses of Northwestern University, and one from Rush University Medical School. Predoctoral
trainees will be selected from NUIN and the other participating PhD programs on the basis of course
performance, research rotation evaluations, and the relevance of proposed dissertation research. Postdoctoral
trainees will be selected on the basis of previous training and a research plan. Special consideration will be given
to trainees whose research plans are interdisciplinary and carried out in more than one preceptor laboratory. A
concerted effort will be made to recruit trainees from under-represented backgrounds. The program will offer a
broad range of interdisciplinary research and training opportunities in both the fundamental and clinical
approaches to aging and dementia research. The preceptor faculty will assist and monitor trainee progress
through formal advising and evaluations, through the classroom and through informal discussions. In addition to
providing research training, the program will help trainees develop skills in written and oral communication, grant
writing, networking, career development and techniques for insuring reproducibility and accuracy of research
findings. Instilling a clear awareness of ethical issues facing neuroscientists and responsible conduct in science
will be another training goal."

Oliver McDonald, MD, Ph.D., with collaborative support from Dr. Ladan Fazlollahi, MD, MPH at Columbia
University. This Core provides several essential services to P01 investigators. The Molecular Pathology Core
interfaces with existing infrastructure at the University of Miami to coordinate the collection of high quality
tissue specimens (human and animal) so that an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist can process them
into slide-based formats (H&E stains, TMAs, specialized chemical stains, immunohistochemical stains) that are
suitable for histopathologic microscopic evaluation. The Core also annotates, stores, and tracks tissue
biospecimens as they are collected and processed. Most importantly, the Core provides expert gastrointestinal
pathology consultation and diagnostic slide review, including H&E morphology, special stain interpretation, and
immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation. These basic Core services are required for successful execution of
P01 projects, all of which require in-depth histopathologic characterization of Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) and
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The grading of BE-associated glandular dysplasia, grading and staging
esophageal adenocarcinoma, evaluating of in situ protein expression in these lesions, and implementating of

10922873,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Pediatric obesity is a pervasive problem in the United States. While short-term weight loss can be
achieved in a high proportion of adolescents with obesity the ability to prevent subsequent weight and fat mass
regain long-term is extremely challenging. The mechanisms underlying weight and fat mass regain in
adolescents with obesity are poorly defined and will be determined by this study.
 Neuroendocrine changes in the gut-brain axis (influencing appetite and satiety) and metabolic
adaptation (changes in energy expenditure and regulation) have been identified as key mechanisms
contributing to weight and fat mass regain after weight loss in adults. Whether these adaptive responses are
applicable to pubertal adolescents remains unknown. Presuming that adult mechanisms are applicable to
pediatrics is premature, adolescents undergo unique and dynamic changes, such as sex-specific
developmental growth and puberty-driven hormonal alterations, which could influence the biology regulating
energy balance in a fundamental way contributing to fat mass accumulation.
 Gaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving fat mass regain following weight
loss during adolescence will advance the current paradigm for treating pediatric obesity towards, 1) optimizing
the timing and intensity of treatment, 2) tailoring therapies based on sex-specific developmental characteristics,
and 3) lead to new intervention strategies. We propose a study to identify the biological mechanisms and
health behaviors driving weight and fat mass regain among adolescents (11 to 15 years old) with obesity by
carefully considering the impact of sex-differences. We will use an established approach of short-term (8
weeks) meal replacement therapy to elicit weight loss (≥5% BMI reduction). Following successful weight loss,
we will follow individuals (n=100) on lifestyle modification therapy for 26 weeks where we expect a wide-range
of responses ranging from continued weight and fat mass loss, maintenance of weight and fat loss, and weight
and fat mass regain. To examine the impact of sex, we will have an even distribution of males and females at
baseline, and we will carefully examine the biological influence of sex-specific differences.
 Our primary outcome will be change in total fat mass (kg) measured by dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry. Our overall hypothesis is that changes in energy expenditure and appetite and satiety
regulating hormones will independently explain the variability in fat mass trajectories, with sex-specific
differences playing an important role in mediating these relationships. This study will identify new treatment
targets to enhance weight loss maintenance in adolescents with obesity by: 1) uncovering the key aspects of
energy regulation and appetite/satiety hormones promoting fat mass regain and; 2) determining sex-specific
factors to inform tailored therapies to prevent fat mass regain."

The goal of the Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Disease (RMD) Epidemiology and Outcomes Training

environment to train independent interdisciplinary researchers who will improve our understanding of
the magnitude, etiology, impact, and treatment of RMDs, and who will assume leadership roles in RMD
epidemiology and outcomes research. An estimated 1 billion prevalent cases and over one hundred
thousand deaths were attributed to RMDs in 2017, which combined with the pending shortage of
rheumatologists underscores the need for trained researchers to advance RMD epidemiology and outcomes
research now and into the future. We propose to establish a robust training program in the University of North
Carolina Department of Medicine’s Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology (RAI) and the Thurston
Arthritis Research Center (TARC) focused on epidemiology and outcomes research in RMDs to address the
critical need for an enhanced interprofessional workforce trained to understand the etiology and clinical
management of RMDs. This will directly address the objective of the NRSA T32 program to enhance research
training opportunities for trainees interested in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research relevant to the NIH

Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute; emphasis on design, execution, analysis, and publication of
research projects to enhance the ability of the trainee to conceptualize and think through research problems
with increasing independence; experienced and dedicated mentors to guide the developing investigator. We
will emphasize rigor and reproducibility, data science principles, and the responsible conduct of research in an
inclusive and supportive training program. The program will benefit from strong leadership, outstanding faculty
from Schools and Departments across the university, and the strong research infrastructure of RAI, TARC, and

Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based hydrogels are widely used in medical devices and are being studied for the
delivery of protein and cellular therapeutics. While these biomaterials are widely regarded as biologically inert,
concerns over PEG’s immunogenicity have emerged in recent years. It has been estimated that 20-30% of the
population has antibodies against PEG due to exposure via pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other PEG-
containing products. While an anti-PEG immune response has been found to reduce the efficacy of
intravenously administered PEGylated drugs, the impact on the biocompatibility of PEG hydrogels has not
previously been studied and is currently unknown. To address this knowledge gap, this project has two
Specific Aims that encompass comprehensive in vivo testing to evaluate the host response to PEG hydrogels
of varying physical and chemical properties. In these experiments, PEG hydrogels will be implanted
subcutaneously in mice, and the host response will be evaluated at early, intermediate, and late timepoints
using histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and blood testing. The key comparison in these
experiments will be between animals conditioned to mount an anti-PEG response and immunologically naïve
controls. The project has two Specific Aims. Aim 1 focuses on PEG hydrogel formulations that lack
hydrolytically and enzymatically cleavable linkers. Hydrogels that differ in modulus, crosslinking chemistry, and
functionalization with cell-adhesive peptides will be systematically studied. Aim 2 focuses on PEG hydrogel
formulations that contain hydrolytically and enzymatically degradable linkers. In addition to evaluating the host
response, the impact of the anti-PEG immune response on the in vivo degradation rate of these hydrogels will
be investigated via non-invasive imaging in a longitudinal study. The results of this project will either alleviate
concerns over PEG immunogenicity for biomaterial implants or motivate future investigations on strategies to
mitigate its effects."
10866593,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The meninges, a protective layer ensheathing the Central Nervous System (CNS), is a highly vascularized,
complex tissue that serves as the primary site for equilibration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF, a
transparent, colorless fluid that recirculates throughout the CNS, supports brain buoyancy, prevents
vascular and neuronal collapse, and provides buffering against mechanical injury. Given the functional
importance of CSF for CNS homeostasis, the clearance of metabolic waste from this fluid compartment is
carried out as a nearly constant process. This waste removal process relies heavily on groups of vascular-
associated, perivascular cells within the meninges that filter the byproducts from the CSF and transport
them into circulation via the lymphatic system for ultimate disposal. Hence, the interaction between
meningeal cells and the vascular system is crucial to safeguard brain homeostasis. Some forms of
neurodegeneration have been linked with a decline in homeostasis and an increase in metabolic waste
accumulation in an age-, diet- or pathogenic infection-dependent manner. Understanding vascular-
associated meningeal cells make-up, developmental origin, genetic regulation and function is an important
long-term undertaking to fully grasp how neurodegeneration occurs in response to these conditions. The
amenability of the zebrafish for live imaging represents a remarkable advantage over other models to study
meningeal development in vivo. In Aim 1, I will use newly developed transgenic lines labeling pan-
meningeal and meningeal perivascular cell populations in vivo to uncover the developmental origin of these
cells using a combination of high resolution confocal imaging for lineage tracing studies, Transmission
Electron Microscopy to characterize their cellular structures, and single cell and “RiboTag” RNA-
sequencing to identify gene programs regulated in meningeal populations. Aim 2 will uncover the functions
that meningeal cells play in supporting CNS homeostasis and maintenance. Analysis will be done utilizing
readily available mutants that present defects in meningeal development. In addition, as an unbiased
approach, I will utilize a forward genetic mutagenesis screen to uncover genes required for proper
meningeal development and function. Lastly, complementary in vivo high resolution confocal imaging and
in vitro cell culture assays will be utilized to uncover biochemical changes in meningeal cells resulting from
age, diet, and infection in both wild type and mutant zebrafish populations (Aim 3). These aims are
designed to expand the current knowledge of meningeal cellular components, genetic signals controlling
their development, and a better understanding of their interaction with the vasculature. This proposal offers
a foundational niche in the vascular developmental biology field through which I can launch a future tenure-
track research faculty position."

 The ultimate goal of the proposed studies is to contribute to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been
four decades since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and a protective vaccine or functional cure has been
elusive. In 2020, there was an estimated 37.6 million people living with HIV. Despite highly active anti-retroviral
therapies, hundreds of thousands of people still die from AIDS-related diseases and millions of new infections
continue to emerge. Thus, finding a way to end this pandemic remains a global priority.
 The overall goal of the Consortium for Innovative HIV/AIDS Vaccine and Cure Research (CIAVCR) is
to develop an effective combined immunotherapeutic regimen for HIV-1 prevention and cure using the non-
human primate (NHP) model that has a direct path to the clinic for use in humans. There are two FOCI
proposed in the CIAVCR: In FOCUS 1, our overall goal is to demonstrate the correlates and mechanisms of
protection for a protective vaccine, and the role of vaccine-induced immune responses in selecting and limiting
the latent reservoir. The benefits of using novel mRNA constructs to deliver immunogens that can elicit both
humoral and cellular responses will be evaluated. In FOCUS 2, our overall goal is to determine the role of
vaccine-induced immune responses to 1) control HIV-1 infection by reducing the size or eliminating HIV-1
reservoirs, and/or 2) delay plasma virus load rebound. The protective vaccines studied in FOCUS 1 will be
tested to define the mechanisms of vaccine-induced B and T cell responses in clearing HIV-1 reservoirs.
Additionally, novel therapies will be combined with the vaccines to augment clearance of HIV-1 reservoirs.
In both FOCUS 1 and 2, analysis of the breakthrough and latent reservoir Env sequences will inform the
design of new vaccine boosts for an improved protective vaccine regimen that can also limit rebound
viruses.
 The NHP-SHIV Centralized Research Resource (CRR) will support the NHP studies in FOCUS 1 and
2 to investigate the effectiveness of vaccine-induced polyfunctional responses and novel immunotherapies
in clearing HIV-1 reservoirs. These studies will use innovative barcoded-SHIVs to determine the effect of
vaccine-induced responses on eliminating the viral reservoirs, and to evaluate the quantity and quality of
viruses that are reactivated by latency reversing agents (LRAs) following treatment interruption.
 The Management and Operations Support Unit (MOS) will coordinate the scientific and
administrative activities of this CIAVCR Program to ensure that the FOCI and NHP-SHIV CRR function
cohesively.
 By the end of this grant, we expect to have designed a combined preventive and therapeutic approach to
effectively protect from infection and eliminate viral reservoirs—a strategy for effectively impacting the HIV/AIDS
pandemic."

In contrast to rodents, little is known about neurogenesis in the human brain. The few studies that examined
neurogenesis in the human hippocampus have come to vastly different conclusions. Determining the existence
and course of hippocampal neurogenesis in the human brain is critical for the understanding of brain function,
cognition, putative preventative and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD). Our previous studies showed that hippocampal neurogenesis
persists throughout the 10th decade of life. New neurons were observed in the brains of participants with no
cognitive impairments (NCI), as well as in patients exhibiting mild cognitive impairments (MCI) or AD.
Interestingly, the number of new neurons was significantly lower in MCI and AD compared to NCI. On the
other hand, the number of early differentiating and mature astrocytes was increased in the AD brain.
Importantly, higher numbers of neuroblasts were associated with better cognitive performance in the brains of
aging, MCI and AD patients. Intriguingly, levels of neurogenesis in the brains of SuperAgers, individuals in their
80ies who exhibit memory performance comparable to people in their 50ies, were significantly greater,
compared to age-matched individuals with age-appropriate cognitive function. Nevertheless, the observations
above were made using the same neurogenic proxies used in the rodent brain and the nature of cells in the
human brain recognized by these proxies is not clear. Evidently, studies that could not detect neurogenesis in
the human brain used the same proxies. Thus, the goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that hippocampal
neurogenesis persists in the aged and AD human brain and its level is associated with cognitive function. By
providing new evidence for the presence of hippocampal neurogenesis using novel tools that would validate
previously used proxies. Experiments in Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that neural progenitor cells have a
lower level of proliferation and preferable differentiation into astrocytes leading to fewer new neurons in MCI and AD,
using multiplex RNA scope and neurogenic proxies. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine the spatial
organization of hippocampal neurogenesis in NCI, MCI and AD, and examine the hypothesis that autonomous
and non-autonomous factors in the DG determine the level of human neurogenesis in the aging and AD brain, using a
combination of spatial transcriptomics (pciSeq) and RNAseq. Aim 3 will address whether new neurons play a
role in cognitive reserve and resilience to AD. Experiments will examine the association between cognitive
performance , hippocampal neurogenesis and AD hallmarks in SuperAgers, age-appropriate cognitive
performance, MCI and AD patients. In summary, this project will provide novel crucial information about the
presence of neurogenesis and its role in hippocampal function in the human aging and AD brain."
10862563,"Disease-Modifying Genes in Huntington's Disease: HD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with a long,
costly, debilitating course to premature death, ~15 yrs after clinical diagnosis. There is a dire need for effective
therapies to alleviate the suffering and cost to the individual, family and society. The HD mutation in HTT is an
expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat whose length is the main factor determining the timing of clinical onset.
Although it is often assumed that the length of polyglutamine in huntingtin drives the rate of pathogenesis leading
to HD onset, our data from HD subjects do not support this conclusion. Disease-associated HTT alleles with the
same pure CAG repeat size may produce different-sized polyglutamine tracts due to variable glutamine-encoding
CAA codons, with no commensurate hastening in HD onset due to extra glutamines. Rather, age-at-onset is
best explained by a property of the pure CAG repeat separate from its coding potential. We have discovered that
HD age-at-onset is modified by genetic variation at 6 loci that encode genes involved in a variety of DNA
maintenance processes. These genetic modifiers, in both humans and mouse models, implicate somatic
expansion of the CAG repeat rather than encoded polyglutamine as the factor determining age-at-onset. By
contrast, symptomatic progression shows at best a weak correlation with CAG repeat size, while duration of
manifest disease (i.e., the time from motor diagnosis to death) is independent of CAG repeat length, suggesting
that other factors are paramount in determining pathogenesis from onset to death. Overall our findings point to
HD as comprising two distinct components: 1) length-dependent somatic expansion of the CAG repeat up to and
above a threshold length (rate driver) that then engages toxicity and 2) as yet uncertain mechanism(s) by which
the somatically expanded repeat triggers damage when the threshold length is reached (toxicity driver). The
nature of the toxicity driver(s) is not yet unequivocal. An effect on huntingtin by above-threshold polyglutamine
(rather than continuous length-dependent toxicity) is both attractive and consistent with the effects of long CAG
repeats in model systems, but other mechanisms that act at the transcriptional or RNA level have also been
suggested as causative. The success of our human genetic strategy has begun to provide new targets for
therapeutic interventions to delay or prevent HD onset. In this renewal, we will identify additional rate modifiers
to more fully delineate the process of somatic CAG expansion in humans and will extend our strategy to discover
modifiers of manifest disease that implicate the nature of the toxicity driver or its damaging consequences. The
identification of novel targets, implicated by the natural variation in biological processes ongoing in HD subjects
themselves, will provide a firm foundation for developing pharmaceutical interventions that push those processes
even farther, toward a strong therapeutic benefit. Thus, the promise of this grant is a new and powerful route to
fulfilling the greatest need of both premanifest and manifest HD subjects and their families: effective treatments
to block or delay onset and progression of the disease."

and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although some observations suggest that adults in LMICs
may asymptomatically harbor DEC and that DEC may be a frequent but unappreciated cause of
diarrhea in young children in HICs, the contribution of these organisms to gastrointestinal (GI)
illness in adults living in high-income countries (HICs) is poorly understood.
 Multiplex PCR panels enabling rapid detection of the common causes of infectious
gastroenteritis, including EPEC/EAEC, were approved by the FDA in 2014, and are increasingly
used by clinical laboratories. Recent studies employing multiplex panels indicate that DEC are
commonly found in adults in HICs. A multicenter study of patients with gastroenteritis in 10
European countries found that EPEC was the most common pathogen detected. However,
EPEC/EAEC were frequently found in samples containing multiple pathogens, raising questions
about their clinical significance. In our laboratories at the University of Washington, EPEC and
EAEC comprise 22.5% and 12.3% of all positive stool panel results, respectively.
 In this proposal, I plan to perform both retrospective and prospective studies to better define
the clinical significance of EPEC/EAEC in U.S. adults. The specific aims are to: 1) perform a
retrospective analysis of the clinical features, risk factors, antimicrobial susceptibility, and
outcomes of symptomatic adult patients with stool samples positive for EPEC/EAEC, and 2)
create a repository of EPEC/EAEC strains from symptomatic adult patients using prospectively
collected residual stool samples and perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to define the
molecular epidemiology of DEC in Seattle adults. These studies will provide new insights into the
clinical importance of DEC in HICs and inform strategies for their management and prevention.
 The research will be supplemented by coursework and specialized training activities as part
of a five-year career development plan to allow me to become an independent investigator.
Intensive training in next-generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics with mentoring
by experts in the fields of infectious diseases and bacterial genomics will allow me to achieve my
long-term objective of becoming a productive independent investigator with a focus on the
molecular epidemiology of bacterial infections."

Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common and distressing consequences of cancer therapy for young
female (YF) cancer survivors, with more than 50% of YF survivors reporting chronic sexual problems,2,3,4
including pain with sexual activity, vulvo-vaginal atrophy, and low desire. Severe sexual dysfunction sharply
diminishes psychological well-being and quality-of-life7,8 for YF survivors. For young women who are
developing or trying to maintain intimate relationships, the consequences can be devastating5. However,
sexual health rehabilitation is not available for most young women suffering from treatment-related sexual
dysfunction.36,37 To address this gap in survivorship care, the PI previously developed and piloted a brief (3-
hour), group-delivered, skills-based intervention called SHARE (Sexual Health And Rehabilitation). SHARE is
a self-management intervention that integrates state-of-the-art sexual rehabilitation with body awareness
training, elements of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and individual action planning. In two previous
single-arm, pilot trials, SHARE significantly reduced cancer-related female sexual dysfunction15 as well as
psychological distress. However, in its existing form, SHARE requires in-person attendance, which limits
access only to those with the time, means and ability to attend. To overcome this barrier, while building on our
previous success, we adapted the intervention for online delivery via videoconference format (SHAREonline)
and subsequently conducted informal pretesting of materials and format. Synchronous videoconferencing is a
format that has been shown to be as effective as in-person group61 but never before used to deliver sexual
rehabilitation to young cancer survivors. We now propose a Phase II “proof-of-concept” RCT to examine
preliminary effects of SHAREonline to reduce sexual dysfunction and psychological distress in a sample of 84
YF survivors. We will randomize 84 young female cancer survivors with sexual health concerns to either the
SHAREonline intervention or to an Enhanced Usual Care attention control condition (2:1) consisting of
education only. Sexual function will be assessed at baseline and at 8- and 16-weeks post-intervention.
Feasibility, acceptability, and credibility, including credibility of the control condition, will be examined to
prepare for a definitive efficacy trial. Women also receive take-home educational materials and a single
booster telephone call 4 weeks post-group session. SHAREonline was developed to meet the needs for
accessible and efficient intervention for young survivors. Whereas most YF survivors currently have no access
to evidence-based sexual health rehabilitation, SHAREonline has the potential to help close a major gap in
survivorship care. Evaluating preliminary effects of SHAREonline is a critical next step for planning a future
efficacy trial, and ultimately ensuring SHAREonline is an effective and widely available intervention to improve
the health and quality-of-life of young female cancer suffering from pronounced sexual dysfunction."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) comprises 80-85% of primary liver cancers and frequently develops in patients
with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. HCC's poor prognosis is primarily due to advanced-stage
diagnosis. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend biannual liver ultrasounds, with or without serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing, for at-risk patients to detect HCC at a curable stage. However, their accuracy is
limited, with sensitivity between 60-70% and specificity of 90%. Consequently, novel biomarkers for early
detection of HCC are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of lipid
nanoparticles that are released by all types of cells, and even more so by tumor cells. Tumor-derived EVs are
present in circulation at relatively early stages of disease and are readily accessible across all disease stages.
Since the surface proteins of tumor EVs mirror those of the parental tumor cells and those cells within tumor
microenvironment, exploiting the diagnostic potential of HCC EVs’ surface protein signatures as a novel
biomarker for early detection of HCC holds great promise to significantly augment the ability of current diagnostic
modalities.
Over the last five years, our joint team comprised of Eximius Dx, UCLA, and Cedars Sinai Medical Center
(CSMC) has demonstrated of HCC EV Surface Protein (SP) Test, capable of dissecting and quantifying
subpopulations of HCC EVs in plasma samples. In our 2022 Hepatology paper, we summarized a phase-2
biomarker study which successfully validated the feasibility of HCC EV SP Test for early HCC detection. The
long-term goal of this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal is to advance the development, optimization, and automation
of the HCC EV SP Test, with the ultimate goal of establishing a more sensitive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test based
on HCC EVs. The innovation of the proposed HCC EV SP Test lies in the integration of two platform technologies:
(i) EV Click MagBeads for click chemistry-mediated capture of subpopulations of HCC EVs, and (ii) real-time
immuno-PCR for quantifying the captured HCC EVs. In parallel, an algorithm will be established to process the
resulting HCC EV signatures into HCC EV SP score for distinguishing early-stage HCC from at-risk cirrhosis.
This new IVD test will use less then 1-mL plasma and have a sample-to-answer workflow of no more than 3
hours. By adopting an in-house developed robotic system, the automated workflow allows for a throughput >
480 samples per round. Once optimized and automated the HCC EV SP Test will be validated by clinically
annotated plasma samples to assess its diagnostic performance for distinguishing early-stage HCC from at-risk
liver cirrhotic patients, covering etiologies including alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), and viral hepatitis (B/C). The successful development of the proposed HCC EV SP Test
is rapidly translatable, enabling a sensitive HCC EV-based IVD test for detecting early-stage HCC."

The over-arching goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to optimize and implement high quality standard
reference diets for the Zebrafish (Danio rerio), an animal model of critical importance to the understanding of
human health and development of vertebrate organisms. A key problem in the industry is that high quality
standardized reference diets, with appropriate physical properties and adequate feed management strategies,
have not been developed for D. rerio. Our solution for the industry, driven by a synergistic collaboration
between Meridian Biotech and the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Watts at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, is to develop several open formulation diets for larval, juvenile and adult Zebrafish, which will
achieve a desired level of control and whereby use of this modern and effective biomedical animal model is
substantially improved and more standardized. This commercial-academic collaboration is a significant value
add to this applied science program. Key ingredients in this formulated diet will include protein packages that
contain defined and effective sources, including a microbial based Single Cell Protein (SCP), an enriched
protein source obtained from bacterial biomass. Diets with these protein sources have been developed by
Meridian Biotech, several of which have improved shrimp and fish farming feed technologies markedly; thus,
we wish to apply this technology to D. rerio and, potentially, other relevant animal models. Our mutual Phase II
Milestones and Specific Experimental Aims are many across both years of the program. Specific Aims for
Milestone 1 (Year 1 work) include optimizing the protein content and amino acid profile of our most promising
ingredient and testing it against the existing SCP-fortified diet used in pilot Phase I work, comparing the best
diet to the competitor diets currently used in academic cores across the US biomedical research enterprise,
and characterizing deeply at the phenotypic and genetic levels the benefits of our diet. Milestone 1 will seek to
identify and progress the best diet and drive its market penetration, initially in academia. Specific Aims for
Milestone 2 (Year 2 work) include further optimizing the amino acid, fatty acid, neutral fat, and energy of the
SCP ingredient and scaling up manufacturing to meet demands at Meridian’s new US-based facilities, sharing
the best diet formulation with academic Zebrafish cores to drive adoption of the diet, and centralizing the data
gathering from the many academic cores for use by all and the NIH ORIP. Milestone 2 will seek to penetrate
the academic Zebrafish husbandry marketplace by gaining Core adoption. In parallel with collaborative efforts
within the academic marketplace, Meridian and commercial partners across both years will also pursue a
Milestone 3 which seeks to expand the technologies and penetrate the industry fish aquaculture and farming
marketplace, other production species, and potentially develop human applications."
10826274,"Project Summary/Abstract
My career goal is to be a principal investigator at a top-ranked research institution. My scientific goal is to
understand how perceptual experience is transformed into adaptive memories, and how these memories impact
immediate perception. In this application, I outline an innovative research program to study how the
hippocampus, a brain region typically associated with memory function, supports visual perception and attention.
This research is motivated by an emerging literature suggesting that the hippocampus is involved in central
aspects of vision, such as eye movements, imagery, scene perception, and visual search. However, the
underlying principles that govern this contribution are debated. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) studies have shown that the hippocampus distinguishes visual stimuli through a process known as
differentiation. This process leads to the unexpected result that related stimuli are represented less similarly than
unrelated stimuli in the hippocampus. This form of relational coding stands in stark contrast to the tuning
properties of visual cortex, which represents related visual stimuli more similarly than unrelated stimuli. My
research strategy uses behavioral and fMRI methods to test the novel hypothesis that hippocampal differentiation
biases visual perception and behavior through the repulsion of attention away from related visual stimuli.
Specifically, we test the impact of hippocampal differentiation on the repulsion of object-based attention (Specific
Aim 1) and feature-based attention (Specific Aim 2). We implement proven learning protocols to measure
hippocampal differentiation with high-resolution fMRI and examine how these unique neural representations
relate to behavior in validated attention tasks. In Aim 1, we adapt a shape-based visual statistical learning task
from the Sponsor’s lab to drive differentiation, followed by a cueing task that measures object-based attention.
We predict that the degree of hippocampal differentiation between related shapes will be associated with the
amount of object-based attentional repulsion. In Aim 2, we use a color-based visual associative learning task to
drive hippocampal differentiation, followed by a contingent capture task that measures feature-based attention.
We predict that the degree hippocampal differentiation between related colors will be associated with the amount
of feature-based attentional repulsion. By linking memory systems to visual functions in the human brain, this
proposed research program may reveal new sources of attentional control, with significant implications for
advancing knowledge of visual deficits and for developing new approaches for visual rehabilitation."
10826346,"Impaired social processing is one of key hallmarks of many neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders
including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). As the social deficits tend to emerge during early childhood and
adolescence, characterization of developmental trajectories is vastly important for understanding and treating
underlying disruptions. The objective of our study is to identify the developmental mechanisms and windows
when circuits responsible for social processing are sensitive to modulation by aberrant social experience or
genetic risk of disorders. Such information will point toward therapeutic targets that allow amelioration of social
deficits. During the prior funding period, we demonstrated that corticothalamic projections from medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) to paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) (mPFC->PVT), which relays signals to various
components of the classical reward circuitry, is causally necessary for proper sociability, but is dysregulated by
juvenile social isolation in adult mice. Our preliminary study further revealed that mPFC->PVT neurons are also
dysregulated by the deletion of several ASD related genes including Fmr1. These findings prompt new pressing
questions: When and how the circuit and behavior deficits emerge across development? Can these vulnerability
windows serve as windows for preventing sociability deficits? Even if these windows are missed, to what extent
adult amelioration is possible later in life? In this competitive renewal, we propose to address these questions
by testing a hypothesis that juvenile social isolation or genetic risk of ASD (Fmr1 deletion) convergingly
dysregulates the maturation of mPFC->PVT projection neurons and sociability yet differentially impact the circuit
at different developmental windows. We will also test that these developmental windows of vulnerability also
serve as windows for interventions to prevent sociability deficits, while adult reversal is also possible by circuit-
based interventions. We will test this hypothesis by integrating techniques to measure (fiber photometry imaging,
patch-clamp/ in vivo electrophysiology) and manipulate (optogenetics/chemogenetics) the activities of selective
circuits during social behavior in male/female mice."
10827260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and cardiopulmonary
dysfunction following COVID-19, are components of the chronic syndrome known as Long COVID (LC). LC is
an unprecedented public health crisis leading to cognitive, mental health, and functional disabilities for millions
of people living in the United States and around the world. Large epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that
the risk of ADRD increases multifold in many old and young patients following even mild SARS-CoV-2
infection. Patients with LC also frequently experience profound limitations in physical function and exercise
intolerance that, when paired with ADRD, are life altering and result in inability to work and lead a family.
Rapidly growing evidence links the clinical manifestations of LC to pathophysiologic mechanisms of abnormal
inflammation and immune dysregulation. There is a driving, unmet need for robust clinical trials directly
targeting immune dysregulation to reduce ADRD and cardiopulmonary injury related to LC. Our central
hypothesis is that immunomodulators may be the most effective treatment for these sequelae of LC. Baricitinib
is an immunomodulator (JAK1/2 inhibitor) that is FDA-approved to treat acute COVID-19 infection as well as
certain autoimmune chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. JAK1/2 signaling is a cardinal driver of both
systemic and neuroinflammation. Our study, the Randomized trial EValuating Baricitinib on pERSistent
nEurologic and Cardiopulmonary Symptoms of Long COVID (REVERSE-LC), will enroll 500 patients with LC
and cognitive impairment at high risk for long-term ADRD across 4 sites to test the hypothesis that 6 months of
baricitinib versus matched placebo will improve neurocognitive and physical function in LC. Aim 1 will measure
the trajectory of neurocognitive function at enrollment, 6- and 12-months in baricitinib versus placebo patients
using an objective neuropsychological battery as well as patient-reported cognitive function. Aim 2 will
measure physical function using cardiopulmonary exercise testing and other functional measures in addition to
patient-reported physical symptoms in patients treated with baricitinib versus placebo. Aim 3 will evaluate the
effect of baricitinib versus placebo on plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and neuroimaging inflammatory markers at
enrollment, as well as 6- and 12-month follow-up study visits in patients with LC to identify inflammatory
mediators of neuropsychological (ADRD) outcomes. The REVERSE-LC trial is novel in targeting immune
dysregulation and inflammation for patients with LC and is based on our growing understanding of the
mechanism of this emerging, post-infectious cause of rapidly-acquired ADRD risk. Regardless of the outcome
of REVERSE-LC, this study will provide crucial insights into treatment of ADRD, sequelae of COVID, and
disease pathogenesis. This investigation will also establish an innovative trial platform by which to test future
interventions for rapidly-acquired neurocognitive dysfunction, cardiopulmonary disease, LC, and other age-
related comorbidities leading to ADRD. It will advance the science of aging brain disease and disability."

The major limiting factors to clinical applications of blood-contacting materials, ranging from small catheters to
large extracorporeal circulation (ECC) devices, include platelet activation leading to thrombosis and infection.
Thrombus formation can further lead to obstruction of blood vessels, device malfunction, or even life-threatening
situations such as embolism. Systemic anticoagulation is required to prevent clotting in the devices; however,
one of the resulting major complications of this is bleeding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has received critical attention as a therapy for patients where mechanical
ventilation alone is ineffective. Significant challenges remain due to the increased risks of thrombosis in the
circuitry that can be further exacerbated by hypercoagulable blood exhibited by COVID-19 patients. Therefore,
there is an urgent necessity and opportunity to combine strategies for preventing thrombosis and infection into
multifunctional device coatings for enhanced patency and safety.
Our work and others have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) release from polymers prevent platelets activation
and infection. This technology mimics the vascular endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, as well as other
cells in our bodies, producing NO locally to prevent clotting and bacterial biofilm and subsequent infections.
Recently we discovered that all of the positive effects can be achieved from polymers physically blended with
the NO donor molecule S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which is nontoxic, inexpensive, and easy to
synthesize. Nitric oxide release can prevent platelet activation/adhesion and exhibit broad-spectrum
antimicrobial properties, but low NO levels may not completely eradicate the bacterial colonization. Our recent
work has shown that by combining active NO release via synthesis of S-nitrosothiol modified ampicillin species
when incorporated in medical grade polymers reduces bacterial infection significantly better than NO-releasing
polymers alone. The goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and evaluate polymer comprised of S-
nitrosothiol (RSNO) modified ampicillin (RSNO-icillin) with active NO release (to inhibit platelet
adhesion/activation and bactericidal activity) covalently bound to ampicillin (a broad-spectrum antibiotic
to ensure eradication of bacteria), resulting in a significantly improved, non-thrombogenic,
antimicrobial, and hemocompatible polymer surface. The new polymers will be applicable to any blood-
contacting device; however, this proposal will focus on studying the combined antibiotic and NO-releasing
strategy in vitro for antimicrobial properties and in a rabbit extracorporeal circulation model for prevention of
thrombosis and infection. Successful completion of this project will allow progression to early clinical trials and
development of a new generation of extracorporeal circuits that can reduce complications while improving the
success of patient care."
10826718,"Project Summary
Formula provides nutrition to infants as a partial or complete substitute for human milk for working mothers or in
situations like lactation failure or poor maternal health. The heavy reliance on infant formula in the U.S. is
reflected by a National Immunization Survey which found that only ~25% of infants (< 6 months) were exclusively
breastfed between 2018-19, a number that was even smaller in rural areas and low-income families. The fat
composition of formulas serves a vital role in replacing human milk fat (HMF), which provides >50% of energy
to the infant during early lactation. However, derived from vegetable oils, the fat in commercial formulas often
lacks the unique fatty acid composition and lipid structure of HMF, resulting in reduced dietary benefits and
poorer health outcomes for infants. The distinct features of HMF include but are not limited to 1) a substantial
portion of medium-chain (C8:0-C14:0) fatty acids and 2) the prevalence at the sn-2 position of palmitic acid (a
C16:0 fatty acid) on triacylglycerols (TAGs). Medium-chain fatty acids are desirable as a quick source of energy
for infants because of their higher absorption rates compared to longer fatty acids. C16:0 esterification at the sn-
2 position prevents its release during digestion by the sn-1,3 lipase. This is important to avoid 16:0 precipitation,
which chelates essential calcium ions and causes hard stools. Present methods for correcting fatty acid
composition and TAG regioisomeric structure in formula are expensive and because of their reliance on palm
oil, undesirable from an environmental perspective. This project addresses these challenges through the
development of an HMF substitute in metabolically engineered algae: the goal is to generate a healthy,
environmentally friendly, and low-cost product for US consumption. Auxenochlorella protothecoides (A.pro)
presents an ideal platform for this goal because of 1) its exceptional biomass and oil accumulating capabilities
compared to traditional oil crops, 2) convenient genetic and genome modification tools to facilitate metabolic
engineering, and 3) the potential for producing the product at commercial scale. In this context, a fatty acid
substrate pool resembling the fatty acid composition of HMF will be built by heterologous expression of chain
length-determining fatty acyl-ACP thioesterases with desired substrate specificities (e.g., C8:0-C14:0) in A.pro,
followed by GC-MS product analysis for assessment (Aim 1). To achieve TAG products with the correct regio-
selectivity (C16:0 at sn-2), the C16:0-specific lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase will be introduced, followed
by stereochemical analysis of TAGs by sn-1,3 lipases treatment and GC-MS analysis of the isolated
monoacylglycerols (Aim 2). Finally, the endogenous polycistronic gene expression system, discovered recently
by the sponsor, will be exploited for simultaneous expression of rate-limiting enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis,
which will streamline the engineering process and enable more efficient production of HMF in A.pro (Aim 3). In
summary, this research will explore the feasibility of producing HMF in oleaginous green algae for infant formula
and also pave the way for developing a promising synthetic biology approach for other bioproducts in A.pro."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Proximity Based Therapeutics, organized by
Drs. Ryan Potts and Michelle Arkin. The conference will be held in Copper, Colorado from January 21-24, 2024.
Drug discovery is undergoing a revolution that moves away from occupancy-driven pharmacology to proximity-
based therapeutics that take advantage of event driven pharmacology. Induced proximity medicines or “multi-
specifics” mobilize a cell’s natural biological mechanisms to operate on disease-causing proteins by bringing
together these proteins with cellular effectors capable of regulating target activity or abundance. Proximity based
therapeutics have the potential to unlock new target space and make significant inroads to drug the
“undruggable” genome. This conference will focus on understanding the opportunities and challenges in this
exciting new area. The program includes topics such as: 1) Controlling Post-Translational Modifications by
Induced Proximity; 2) Emerging Proximity Biology for Target Degradation; 3) Stabilizing Protein-Protein
Interactions with Molecular Glues; and 4) Predicting and Discovering Ternary Complexes. The conference
program is designed to bring together interdisciplinary groups of scientists, including biologists and chemists,
from both academic and industry to explore the latest findings in this field and accelerate its growth. Finally, this
conference will be held jointly with Targeted Protein Degradation. This pairing will lead to synergistic interactions
between these two communities and will enhance momentum in basic and translation research, while providing
networking and career development opportunities at shared meals and poster sessions."
10932196,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incredible specificity with which we can discern a vast diversity of smells emerges from how olfactory
sensory neurons (OSN) express olfactory receptor (OR) genes. These OR genes encode the proteins that bind
chemical odorants. Each OSN stochastically transcribes only one allele of an OR gene. An OSN can choose to
express any one of the approximately 1400 OR genes or 2800 alleles. There is no one to one relationship
between an odorant and an OR as a combination of ORs are involved in the detection of one odorant. Thus,
the diversity of ORs expressed is important to the main olfactory epithelium’s (MOE) ability to detect a vast
range of smells.
The choice of an OR gene occurs as OSN progenitors mature into an OSN. Recent work has revealed
remarkable remodeling of the local chromatin and co-expression of multiple OR genes during this period, but
the molecular mechanisms governing these processes and their connection to a singular OR allele expression
in a mature OSN remain unknown.
We show that testis expressed 15 (Tex15), a protein that has only been studied in the testes where it regulates
methylation and silencing of transposons, is crucial for stochastic OR gene choice. We find that when Tex15 is
knocked out there is a dramatic reduction in the diversity of expressed OR genes with a few OR genes
dominating stochastic choice. Strikingly, Tex15 is only transiently expressed in OSN progenitors during a
period of OR co-expression. Our central hypothesis is that Tex15 is epigenetically controlling stochastic OR
gene choice, either by regulating DNA methylation or other aspects of OR gene chromatin structure. Aim 1 will
determine whether Tex15 is required for transient co-expression of multiple OR genes in OSN
progenitors. In aim 2, we will determine whether Tex15 protein binds to OR genes. Finally in aim 3, our
experiments on primary OSNs from Tex15 null mice will determine how gene repression is mediated in
OSN progenitors – through methylation or deposition of repressive heterochromatin.
Together, these experiments will elucidate a novel aspect of how OSNs come to stochastically choose a single
OR and how Tex15 gene and protein guides this specific yet diverse choice. We anticipate this project will
uncover new and/or unexpected role for Tex15 in the MOE. This will also reveal the key molecular
underpinnings for how our sense of smell develops and may provide important insight to further understand the
mechanisms of smell disorder. The proposed fellowship will train this applicant in several innovative techniques
in biochemical, cellular, molecular, and computational neuroscience. The established faculty-student
mentorships will ensure proper scientific and professional training necessary to become a successful,
independent sensory and computational neurobiologist."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a public health threat responsible for nearly 2 million deaths annually. While
an efficacious chemotherapeutic regimen exists, infection relapse is common even after an extensive treatment
time (6-9 months). Recent evidence indicates that Mtb antibiotic tolerance directly impacts treatment times and
opens the window for the selection of antibiotic resistance in persistent bacterial populations. Multiple studies
have shown that heterogeneously expressed immune pressures such as reactive nitrogen species induce
antibiotic tolerance in Mtb sub-populations. Therefore, one strategy to improve antibiotic efficacy is to target
pathways that reduce Mtb antibiotic tolerance in the face of immune insult. Data from the Sassetti lab and others
indicated that loss of Mtb glutamine (Gln) import or synthesis reduces bacterial viability and antibiotic tolerance
during murine infection. Based on these findings, the hypothesis of this proposal is that Gln starvation leaves
Mtb vulnerable to host immune pressures which translates as reduced antibiotic tolerance and increased drug
efficacy in vivo. Therefore, this proposal seeks to understand the mechanistic link between Gln starvation,
immune pressure vulnerability, and reduced antibiotic tolerance. To do this, the experiments described will use
Mtb strains deficient for Gln synthesis and/or host Gln import as a means to induce Mtb Gln starvation and disrupt
Gln metabolism. These strains will be used to assess how Gln starvation impacts antibiotic efficacy during murine
and intracellular infection. Aim 1 of this proposal will use single cell RNAseq to probe Mtb heterogeneity during
murine infection and treatment. Aim 2 will explore the mechanistic links between immune pressures such as
reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), phagosome acidification, Gln restriction
and Mtb antibiotic tolerance using engineered macrophage cell lines. Finally, as a proof of concept, Aim 3 will
use the relapsing mouse model to assess the impact Gln starvation has on infection clearance and relapse
following an extended antibiotic treatment. The PIs assert that the data generated in this proposal will pave the
way for new therapeutic strategies that both directly target Mtb viability and disrupt antibiotic tolerance leading
to a more efficacious therapeutic regimen. The research plan proposed will act as a means to expand on the
trainee’s skill set with a new emphasis on host-pathogen interactions. The techniques proposed include novel
host and bacterial genetic approaches, high content murine immune profiling coupled with infected cell sorting,
and evaluation of antibiotic efficacy in multiple animal models. The training environment described in this
proposal provides the trainee with opportunities to train under senior researchers with expertise in host and
bacterial genetics, high throughput cell profiling, and high content sequencing analysis. The completion of this
proposal will establish the trainee in methods with techniques to become an independent scientist."

leveraging novel data collected during routine clinical care from the Electronic Health Record to identify older
adults with ADRD (Kharrazi); (2) race-based disparities in ADRD caregiving in help-seeking and service use
(Fabius); (3) the prevalence and magnitude of ADRD-related financial loss (Nicholas); and (4) differences in
prescribing patterns for older adults with ADRD who are enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare as
compared with Medicare Advantage managed care (Drabo)."
10863952,"Abstract – External Research Resources Support and Dissemination (R&D) Core – Core D
The benefits of new knowledge and innovative research resources that improve understanding of ADRD care
and consequences will not reach their full potential without being accessed, understood, and acted upon by
appropriate audiences including the lay public, government and other policy-makers, and the scientific
community. The goal of the Hopkins’ Economics of Alzheimer’s Disease & Services (HEADS) Center
External Research Resources Support and Dissemination (R&D) Core (Core D) is to disseminate and
translate findings and research resources so that they reach diverse internal and external governmental,
advocacy, and scientific audiences who are positioned to influence policy and clinical practice. To meet its
goals, the R&D Core has the following three Specific Aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: To build research capacity and
promote ADRD economics and health services research through workshops focused on developing skills
using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (and National Study of Caregiving) for promising early
stage investigators in the field that address cross-cutting Center themes relating to family and unpaid
caregiving (in Year 02) and disparities (in Year 04). SPECIFIC AIM 2: To establish a strategic bi-directional
pipeline for developing, disseminating, and translating HEADS research and research resources through
engaging a Translation Advisory Panel of external leaders with diverse perspectives in ADRD-related policy,
advocacy, and health care delivery. SPECIFIC AIM 3: To translate and disseminate research results and
resources to internal and external audiences through multiple modes of communication by developing a
dissemination and translation infrastructure for extending reach and awareness of Center resources and
findings through print- and web-based approaches, social media, webinars, and traditional methods of
research dissemination, such as policy briefs and peer-review publication. The Core is structured to
maximize communication and networking among all Center components and with the larger Hopkins and
external scientific, policy, and service communities. The R&D Core will provide the leadership to engage
diverse audiences – e.g., policy-makers, members of the advocacy community, and key organizations that
are committed to improving the lives of persons with ADRD and their families – with the ultimate goal of
increasing the value of research evidence so that it is understandable and accessible and used by varied
stakeholders to guide strategic decision-making."
10863953,"Abstract – Remote Data Enclave Core (RDEC) – Core E
The Remote Data Enclave Core (RDEC) will be the “lab” for the HEADS Center, offering secure and
remote access to a wide range of ADRD-relevant datasets in a high-capacity computing environment.
Given the importance and growing relevance of large and often restricted data sources that can be
applied to address many of the most pressing questions tied to HEADS themes, claims data from
Medicare and Medicaid being the most prominent example, a high-capacity computing environment that
meets strict security and privacy standards is a critical need that the RDEC is designed to meet. The
RDEC will support a remote data enclave in a high-capacity computing environment to address the
overall themes of the HEADs Center. The RDEC will have the following Specific Aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1.
To create and sustain hardware and software for a remote data enclave with (a) security standards, (b)
privacy protection, (c) high-capacity computing, and (d) remote access. SPECIFIC AIM 2. To build and
maintain a unified data warehouse of ADRD-relevant datasets that (a) centralizes inventory of data
assets, (b) systematizes licensing and data use agreements, and (c) maintains and updates critical
datasets. Data warehouse will include restricted datasets, proprietary datasets, and linkable public-use
files. SPECIFIC AIM 3. To provide high-level services to remote data enclave users including (a)
establishing and ensuring fidelity to processes for data access, (b) assisting with data use and reuse
agreements, and (c) training and assisting in maintenance of data privacy and security. The RDEC will
establish and maintain a rigorously protected data infrastructure, leveraging significant investments in
powerful national datasets and providing HEADS Center investigators with unparalleled access to these
resources. By establishing a centralized accessible data warehouse in a robust and secure environment,
the RDEC will address critical barriers to entering this area of study, thus, attracting and supporting the
development of talented new investigators to ADRD research. The RDEC will enable creative linkages
across the growing collection of datasets to yield innovative insights related to HEADS Center themes."
10864015,"The theme of the Yale/NIDA Neuroproteomics Center, “Proteomics of Altered Signaling in Addiction”,
follows from the premise that exposure to drugs of abuse usurps regulation of intracellular signaling processes
in brain reward Centers that in turn alters gene expression, protein translation, and post-translational
modifications of proteins. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in stable alterations in these signaling
systems that are critical for the changes in brain chemistry and development of the structure of the addicted
brain. The major goal of the Center is to bring together exceptionally strong programs from Yale and 8 other
non-Yale institutions in proteomics, signal transduction, and drug addiction research to create a synergistic,
virtual environment that uniquely leverages existing resources and our ability to successfully compete for future
resources (e.g., instrumentation funding via NIH SIGs) to characterize neuronal signaling processes and to
identify adaptive changes in protein signaling that occur in response to exposure to drugs of abuse.
 The Administrative Core will play an essential role in the organization and operation of the
Neuroproteomics Center. Among its tasks will be to recruit for the Center's research base the very best
investigators in the field; ensure the Cores have sufficient space, the best possible instrumentation and staff,
ITS and infrastructure support, and are responsive to and are continuously developing innovative solutions to
optimally meet the biotechnological needs of the Center's investigators and pilot project grantees; promote
interactions among the investigators and scientific cores; and ensure that the Center maintains its focus on its
theme and actively engages in training and education.
 The Specific Aims of the Administrative Core will be to: 1. Administer the Yale/NIDA Neuroproteomics
Center; 2. Administer, support, and coordinate the activities of the Research Support Cores and optimize their
use by Center investigators; 3. Optimize overall operation of the Neuroproteomics Center and its interactions
with other Centers and organizations; and 4. Oversee the training mission of the Neuroproteomics Center.
 Through its interdisciplinary and collaborative organization, the Administrative Core will bring highly
qualified signal transduction and drug addiction researchers into the Center so that proteomic specialists can
utilize their rapidly evolving tools to gain understanding of the mechanisms of actions of drugs of abuse. They
will be supported by an extensive array of instrumentation and highly trained staff that will allow members of
this Center to optimally bring the most powerful proteomic technologies to bear on the study of the proteomic
changes that occur in response to drugs of abuse."
10864016,"The Discovery Proteomics Core (DPC) uses cutting edge sample preparation, state-of-the-art proteomic and
complementary recombinant protein expression, biophysical, and lipidomics technologies to analyze adaptive
changes in neuronal signal transduction mechanisms that occur in response to drugs of abuse. Aim 1 uses
discovery proteomics and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) from the Targeted Proteomics Core (TPC) to
identify proteins whose expression or posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are altered in cell-based systems,
tissue from discrete brain regions, single cell types and their organelles isolated with LCM or FACS, or protein
complexes isolated by proximity labeling or other approaches. To improve peptide identification from searching
databases with MS/MS spectra, we will use DIA and ETD-DIA and we will collaborate with the Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core (BBC) to enable MS/MS searches of RNA-sequencing-predicted proteomes. We will build
peptide MS/MS spectral libraries to support DIA assays. Aim 2 uses immunological and chemical approaches
to enrich for peptides and proteins containing PTMs to facilitate their identification. In collaboration with TPC,
the DPC will integrate PTM analyses into DIA, including use of ETD for glycosylation and “Middle-down”
analyses, and use Parallel Reaction Monitoring by TPC to validate differentially expressed proteins and PTMs.
Aim 3 uses “Middle-down” analyses to identify the multiple PTMs that occur in individual proteoforms such as
the combinatorial epigenetic changes in histone modification. In Aim 4 we will collaborate with the BBC to
streamline data output to improve visualization of quantitative protein PTM changes, and will improve existing
and design new tools to carry out more advanced data analyses. In Aim 5 we will overexpress and purify
recombinant proteins for our investigators and use isothermal microcalorimetry, static/dynamic light scattering,
circular dichroism, surface plasmon resonance, stopped-flow, and asymmetric flow field-flow-fractionation to
extend protein profiling into the functional domain by quantitatively determining the thermodynamics and
kinetics that underlie protein:protein and protein:ligand interactions. In Aim 6 we will quantify phosphoinositide
lipids in brain circuits involved in addiction and provide innovative cell-free assays for studying lipid transport
proteins that function at membrane contact sites. In collaboration with TPC, we will build a DIA assay for the
phosphoinositide interactome. In Aim 7, we will provide training in experimental design, sample preparation,
and use of softwares for analysis and interpretation of data from MS, biophysical, and phosphoinositide
analyses. The DPC will collaborate with Center investigators and will ensure that the Center's research is
supported by the most advanced instrumentation and biotechnologies. By taking a holistic approach the DPC
will provide Center investigators with the broad range of tools and training needed to identify, and then to
understand why certain proteins and their PTMs and phosphoinositide effectors are differentially expressed
following exposure to drugs of abuse."
10864019,"The Targeted Proteomics Core designs and implements targeted assays that have been used increasingly by
Center investigators to quantitate and validate potential protein biomarkers initially identified from the protein
profiling analyses carried out by the Discovery Proteomics Core (DPC), genomic studies, including the use of
neuronal cell type-specific transcriptional and translational profiling, or the literature. These analyses will
include relative and absolute quantitation of targeted protein levels or alterations in their post-translational
modifications that have been implicated in model and other organisms as adaptive changes that occur in
response to drugs of abuse. To address the huge level of cellular and sub-cellular heterogeneity in the central
nervous system, another objective is to develop the targeted workflows needed to analyze subcellular
organelles and sub-proteomes from the single types of neurons that define the circuits that underlie the actions
and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. In Aim 1 we will integrate high resolution Data-Independent
Acquisition (DIA) into our large scale targeted proteome assays using fractionated Data-Dependent Acquisition
(DDA) peptide libraries generated by the DPC from mouse, rat, and human brain regions. DIA analysis has the
potential to change the proteomic landscape since each sample only needs to be run once, and then all
peptide fragments can retrospectively be identified and quantified. In Aim 2 we will develop targeted, highly
sensitive DIA assays to examine the proteomes of specific neuronal sub-types and their organelles (e.g.,
nuclei, synaptic vesicles), sub-cellular fractions or partially enriched samples (e.g., PSD) and then use Parallel
Reaction Monitoring (PRM) to validate the most significantly differentially expressed proteins. In support of this
Aim, we will develop improved methodologies for protein profiling of the limiting amounts of protein that can be
obtained from the LCM and FACS-based approaches needed to isolate neuronal sub-types. Since eukaryotic
proteins almost always are assembled into multiprotein complexes in vivo, Aim 3 will leverage the data from
our targeted assays by implementing improved proximity biotinylation technologies for identifying protein
interactomes for those proteins that are found to be most differentially expressed by our targeted assays. To
further enhance the interpretation of the data from our targeted proteome analyses, in Aim 4 we will implement
a Puromycin-associated Nascent CHain Proteomics (PUNCH-P) assay for translatome profiling. Since under
steady state conditions protein levels are largely determined by transcript concentrations, it will be of
considerable interest to compare the approximately steady state protein levels determined by our DIA analyses
with the nascent protein levels determined by our PUNCH-P analyses before and after exposure to drugs of
abuse. In Aim 5, we will continue to train Neuroproteomics Center members in targeted mass spectrometric
techniques including experimental design, sample preparation and handling, digestion protocols, interpretation
of PRM and DIA spectra so they can optimally utilize the advanced technologies available in the Center."
10864021,"The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) supports statistical, bioinformatic and computational
needs of the Discovery and Targeted Proteomics Cores, as well as Center Investigators, their postdoctoral
associates and students, and Pilot Grant awardees. The BBC has four inter-related Specific Aims: 1)
Biostatistics; 2) Bioinformatics; 3) High Performance Computing; 4) Training and Education. In Aim 1,
we will provide statistical guidance on experimental design and data analysis, including sample quality
assessment, and exploratory analysis for a wide range of types of proteomics data sets; continue to develop
and add more features/functions to ProteomicsBrowser, a proteomics data analysis and visualization tool
developed by the BBC to assist Center users in better interpreting complex proteomics data; develop and
implement novel statistical methods to impute missing information in proteomics data; and develop and
implement an online tool for proteomics data preprocessing, including data normalization, batch effect
correction, and missing data imputation. In Aim 2, we will provide advanced bioinformatics software and
approaches to assist Center investigators and Pilot Grant awardees in fully interpreting their comparative
protein and protein post-translational modification profiling data; we will leverage information from single-cell
RNA-seq by incorporating stochastic expression at the cell-type-level into an analytic framework to deconvolve
tissue-level transcriptomics (RNA-seq) into fractions of constituent cell types for individual samples, and
identify genes and cell types showing significant discrepancies between RNA and protein levels; and develop a
unified computational framework for the detection of allele-specific peptides and allele-specific events from
existing whole-genome sequencing, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and proteomics data generated from
post-mortem human brain samples. In Aim 3, we will provide continued support for large-scale peptide
sequence alignment and support novel pipelines to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets;
work closely with the bioinformatics and biostatistics teams to help benchmark, scale, optimize, and speed up
computing tasks involving large-scale data analyses and database queries; and explore alternatives to
traditional high performance computing environments such as container systems and private cloud computing.
In Aim 4, we will provide training and education in biostatistics, bioinformatics, database and high performance
computing through interaction and collaboration with the Center investigators, including working closely with
the Yale Medical Library Bioinformatics Support Program and other Yale organizations."
10864022,"The role of the Pilot Research Project Core (PRPC) will be to oversee and help develop pilot projects that bring
new investigators into the Yale/NIDA Neuroproteomics Center, help encourage young investigators in our
Center's laboratories embark on careers in substance abuse research, disseminate the Center's core
technologies to researchers investigating the neurobiology of addiction who are not yet using neuroproteomics
technologies, and expand the technical abilities of the Center. The Center has greatly increased the pool of
researchers using proteomic methods at Yale and 7 other institutions, and has become a national resource for
proteomic studies of biological aspects of drug addiction. The 19 projects awarded in grant years 11-14 have
already resulted in at least 9 publications, 4 abstracts, 13 grants and one pending grant application. In addition,
5 of these awardees already have gone on to independent positions where they are using proteomic
approaches. The 4 awards in year 15 will expand the Center's technologies and also will result in novel
findings relevant to addiction and brain function. In Aim 1, we will build on this success and solicit new pilot
proposals via our web site, Twitter, emails, EAB, and NIDA program officials. The PRPC will encourage
applications that propose to apply technologies available from the Cores or to develop new technologies.
Applications will be accepted from Center and non-Center investigators expert in substance abuse with
interests in initiating research in neuroproteomics, and non-Center investigators with expertise in cell and
molecular aspects of neuronal signaling with interests in initiating neuroproteomics research on substance
abuse. Applications will be accepted from graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and higher level research
staff from these investigators' laboratories. In the current proposal, we have included 4 potential projects,
including one Technology Development Pilot, which together with 8 other proposals would be submitted for
competitive review if this renewal is funded. In Aim 2, we will continue to have pilot projects reviewed by two
senior Yale investigators, including the Director of the Pilot Project Core, as well as two non-Yale reviewers,
none of whom have a conflict of interest with the proposals reviewed. Using similar criteria to successful pilots,
the submitted proposals will be evaluated based on whether they meet the core mission of the program, as
well as on their overall scientific merit. In Aim 3, we will evaluate and track the success of the Pilot Program,
through analysis of publications, presentations and grant applications. In Aim 4, each funded project will be
mentored by a Center Core staff who is an expert in the technology to be used and who will provide training to
the awardee. Further, if the awardee is from a laboratory that does not have experience in drug abuse
research, they will be assigned a Center investigator who is highly experienced in drug abuse research who
will provide guidance in appropriate models of substance abuse and in experimental design."

Ca2+-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channels are among a few ion channels that convert
intracellular Ca2+ signaling into changes in membrane potential, in contrast to most ion
channels that directly or indirectly use membrane potential to regulate intracellular Ca2+
signaling. This unique property allows CAN channels to play critical roles in many tissues and
organs. While the existence of CAN channels has been known for decades, recent evidence
has established that monovalent cation-permeable TRPM4 and TRPM5 are the long sought
for CAN channels. Indeed, numerous TRPM4 mutations are linked to severe human diseases,
e.g., cardiac conduction block, Bragada syndrome, PSEK (a skin disease). Despite their
functional significance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing TRPM4&5
channels activity. Ca2+ is the only known physiological activator for them, though membrane
potential also regulates channel activity but only in the presence of Ca2+. However, while the
Ca2+-binding sites have been identified by cryo-EM studies, how Ca2+ and voltage activate
TRPM4&5 channels remains unknown. Furthermore, while most known disease-causing
TRPM4 mutations lead to a gain-of-function phenotype, no effective inhibitor for TRPM4&5 is
currently available. Based on our preliminary functional data on TRPM4 Ca2+ and voltage
activation, our discovery of novel TRPM4 mutations causing human skin disease, a new
disease-causing mutant channel CRISPR mouse model exhibiting skin phenotypes, and our
recent discovery of a novel TRPM4 inhibition process, we plan to use a multidisciplinary
approach aiming at revealing the fundamental mechanisms of TRPM4&5 activation and
inhibition."

Smoke-free housing (SFH) has recently been mandated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) to protect public housing residents from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure.
However, our preliminary work suggests that SFH might not be effective. In focus groups, smokers in
low-income housing have reported to us that they are primarily motivated by fear of punishment, rather
than an obligation to comply with SFH, which they perceive to be unfair. They describe a situation in
which many smokers respond by hiding their smoking inside their apartments—where they think they will
be less likely to be seen—when compliance with SFH is perceived to be an inconvenience or even
unsafe (e.g., if they would have to walk across their community at night to smoke off the property). This
suggests that the perceived legitimacy of SFH is low—residents feel so strongly about its unfairness that
they are unlikely to comply with it on their own. This means that efforts to increase resident compliance
by relying on threats of punishment could be counterproductive. Residents also report several barriers to
compliance with SFH that they also perceive to be unfair (e.g., banning smoking in public housing but
allowing it on other types of properties). These barriers vary between housing authorities and represent
important differences in SFH implementation strategy.
Principles and approaches from community-based participatory research guide this study. In Aim 1 we
assess factors associated with perceived legitimacy and compliance across six housing authorities. We
will use a mixed methods approach to establish: (1) who exhibits lower perceived legitimacy of SFH, and
under what circumstances, and (2) what property and organizational factors that differ between and
within housing authorities could affect SFH implementation and resident compliance. In Aim 2 we test
associations between perceived legitimacy, SFH implementation strategy, and several markers for SHS
(fine particulate matter, airborne nicotine, and exhaled CO). We hypothesize that: (a) perceived
legitimacy will be related to differences in SFH implementation, (b) differences in SFH implementation
strategy will affect SFH compliance, as measured by SHS, and (c) low perceived legitimacy of SFH will
mediate the impact of implementation strategy on SFH compliance. In Aim 3 we develop a scalable
implementation strategy for SFH that to improve resident compliance and perceived legitimacy.
Community advisory boards will be used to inform this process to ensure that solutions are grounded in
real-world experiences."

10862152,"Project Summary/Abstract
Proteoforms are molecular forms of proteins in cells and tissues containing site-specific sequence
variations and post-translational modifications. Proteoforms effectively describe cell phenotypes
and provide important implications in disease mechanisms. Recent studies in immunobiology and
disease pathology have emphasized intact proteoform characterization without enzymatic
digestion in bottom-up approaches. Current mass-spectrometry-based top-down proteomics
technologies fall short in capturing the complex proteome in small biological samples such as
single cells. This proposal generates a suite of novel technologies for high-throughput omics-
scale single cell proteoform profiling using innovative instrumentation, bioinformatics and high-
throughput strategies. I will use human kidney cells as a model biological system in this proposal,
and the approaches are generalizable to different cell types. I have recently developed a
technology employing localized proteoform sampling coupled to single-molecule mass
spectrometry to directly image and identify intact proteoforms in tissue sections (Su et al., 2022,
Sci. Adv.). In Aim 1, I will expand the proteome detection and identification capabilities in this
technology using innovative instrumentation, sampling and data acquisition algorithms. Together
these will curate a knowledgebase serving as a proteoform library for kidney single cell proteoform
profiling. In Aim 2, I will develop a novel platform leveraged for profiling of single cells dissociated
from human kidney biopsies. I will develop a single cell preparation protocol for maximizing
proteoform detection in kidney parenchymal and immune cells. I will also develop a bioinformatics
approach tailored for proteoform identification in single cell datatype and discover proteoform
signatures that differentiate cell types. In Aim 3, I will address the limitation in rare cell profiling by
developing a series of high-throughput strategies including high-speed sampling and microarray
cell patterning. These new technologies will unravel proteoform landscapes and signatures in rare
kidney-resident innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) for the discovery of
new cell populations that can be used as therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools for inflammatory
diseases. My mentoring team consists of Dr. Neil Kelleher (mentor), a world-renowned protein
biochemist, and Dr. Satish Nadig (co-mentor), a leading expert in kidney immunobiology. The
proposed research is a substantial technological advancement in single-cell proteomics and sets
a solid foundation for the pursuit of my independent career. The proposed research also well
aligns with my long term research interest in developing enabling analytical technologies for
biomedical science community with a special interest in the human innate immune system."

regulate energy balance and metabolism. This includes studies investigating the pathophysiology of obesity
and the effects of altered composition and quantity of nutrients to impact intermediary metabolism and
modulate disease risk. We will also support studies aimed at developing novel interventions to reduce obesity
and associated comorbidities. To achieve this goal, we will provide opportunities for both new and established
UT Southwestern investigators to generate sufficient preliminary data for a successful application for major
research funding from NIDDK or other national granting agencies. The $100K/year for the UTSW NORC P&F
grants program will fund up to 4 applications each year. These awards will be important for recruiting and
fostering new investigators to the field. We also strongly believe that given the nutrition and obesity research
expertise at UT Southwestern, these awards will result in considerable return of new funded NIDDK awards,
new collaborations among UTSW NORC members, and most importantly, significant advances in the field
that will lead to new therapeutic opportunities."

The zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter is among the principal etiologies of diarrhea in children living in low
resource settings. Emergence of multi drug resistance against clinically relevant antimicrobials including
fluroquinolones and macrolides make it a high-priority pathogen by the World Health Organization. However, the
molecular epidemiology and ecology of this pathogen in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) remains
unresolved. This knowledge gap is especially evident in the pathogen’s main host: the chicken. Preliminary
evidence suggests that there are sufficient genomic features to differentiate Campylobacter populations between
small-scale and industrially scaled poultry. This K43 Emerging Global Leader career development award aims
to study and compare the molecular epidemiology and ecology of MDR Campylobacteriosis in industrially and
domestically reared poultry within a highly endemic setting. This will be achieved through i) the detailed study of
genomic features of Campylobacter populations from backyard reared and industrially produced poultry, ii) the
assessment of Campylobacter genomic determinants of multi-drug resistance in backyard reared and industrially
produced poultry, and iii) the linkage of epidemiologic data of locally reported antibiotic exposures and genomic
signals of drug resistance. The results from this study will critically contribute to the human source attribution
models of disease being built in the study under which this project is nested (an ongoing pediatric cohort and
nested case control studying the transmission dynamics of Campylobacter in the Peruvian Amazon). To fulfill
these goals, an accomplished group of mentors will collectively provide mentorship and train the candidate, Dr.
Francesca Schiaffino. Dr. Schiaffino proposes a career development plan that includes advanced methodological
training in genomic analysis (through coursework, personalized training sessions and on-site scholarly rotations),
publications, grantsmanship and continued training in responsible conduct of research within the context of
global health. The main mentoring committee is composed of world-class experts in the field, including Dr.
Margaret N. Kosek (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Dr. Carlos Shiva (veterinary microbiology, poultry
science), Dr. Craig T. Parker (microbial genomics), Dr. Kerry Cooper (bacterial genomics and targeted
metagenomic analysis), Dr. Samuel Sheppard and Dr. Ben Pascoe (Campylobacter ecology and evolution,
source attribution studies), and Mrs, Maribel Paredes (community based participatory research, project
management). Dr. Schiaffino’s career development plan has been sequentially designed with the objective of
positioning her as an independent veterinary scientist and epidemiologist with expertise in bacterial genomics
with the overall objective of improving human and animal health through safe and robust food systems."
10866483,"Project Summary
 Religion is a primary driver of concerns with genomics and genomic healthcare (GGH). It is vital for research
on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genomics to understand the role of religion in shaping
public attitudes toward GGH. Ninety percent of the US public believes in some kind of higher power and 55%
pray daily. The US public attends religious services at a rate 3 times higher than scientists in the US, who are
at risk of misunderstanding the role religion plays in attitudes toward GGH. Further, Black, Hispanic, and rural
populations attend religious services more frequently than the general US public. Concerns with GGH
activities may lead to lower levels of engagement of GGH, which may in turn contribute to health disparities.
This project aims to understand why higher levels of religious practice are associated with greater concerns
with GGH activities.
 Additionally, this project will interview faith leaders to identify how public health genomics might engage
faith communities in ways that are respectful and constructive. While some concerns with healthcare
technologies may disappear with new information, others stem from worldviews, deep moral commitments,
or mistrust of the healthcare system. Engaging religious communities is essential to identify which concerns
can be addressed with information, which call for alternative responses, and what alternative responses might
look like. Very few models exist for genomic public health engagement with religion, particularly models that
directly address value-laden concerns.13,14 This project will achieve two specific aims:
1. Quantitatively examine which aspects of religion explain its influence on support for GGH activities.
We will survey 4800 adults in the US to examine the association of religious variables with support for GGH
activities such as prenatal genetic testing, gene editing, and mRNA vaccines. We will generate rich descriptive
data and explore how and when diverse religious variables predict support for, or opposition to, GGH activities.
2. Explore how genomic public health can engage with religious communities in a way that is
respectful and constructive. We will conduct in-depth interviews via Zoom with 180 faith leaders—30 from
each of six groups: Evangelical, Mainline Protestant, Historically Black, and Catholic Christianity, Judaism,
and Islam. These groups represent the largest religious groups in the US, comprising 90% of those with a
religious affiliation. Interviews will explore several different issues: What are their views on GGH activities? Is
diversity of opinion on these matters tolerated within their community? To what extent are concerns with GGH
activities principled and to what extent might further information be helpful? How might genomic public health
engage religious communities in a way that is both respectful and constructive?"
10866485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The dynamic three-dimensional folding of the human genome within the cell nucleus, referred to as the 4D
nucleome, plays roles in many genomic processes, including gene regulation and maintenance of genome
stability. Defects in chromosome organization are associated with human diseases such as cancer, and
premature aging. The 4D nucleome is extensively re-organized as cells change state during development and
as cells age. In order to understand how the genome works we need comprehensive maps of the 4D nucleome
for different cell states. We also need detailed knowledge of the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of
chromosome folding and insight into the role of the 4D nucleome in genome function, and particularly in
establishing and maintaining cellular states in development and their loss in aging and disease
 To address these challenges, we have assembled a highly interdisciplinary Center with the goal of
generating comprehensive 4D nucleome maps that represent the spatial, physical, dynamic and functional
organization of the human genome during key transitions of the 4D nucleome during early and late stages in
life. Our Center has extensive experience and produced 4DN Reference Hi-C and Micro-C Interaction maps,
and FISH datasets to compare to Hi-C data. We have benchmarked technologies for mapping genome folding,
and developed data standards, common file formats, Hi-C/Micro-C data processing and data visualization
pipelines, and polymer simulation approaches. We also developed new methods to quantify the forces that
drive chromosome folding (liquid chromatin Hi-C), to map loci at the nuclear periphery (Protect-seq), to detect
topological catenations (multi-contact 3C) and to map sub-nuclear proteomes and transcriptomes (C-BERST).
 With a comprehensive suite of benchmarked genomic, imaging, proteomic assays and modeling tools now
in hand, we will apply these approaches, and integrate and model the resulting data to determine pathways of
how 4D nucleome develops during life span: from an immature state in embryonic stem cells, to a mature state
during cell differentiation into hepatocytes, and then how the 4D nucleome changes again and deteriorates as
cells (prematurely) age. We will map the 3D structure of the genome and associated proteins and RNAs, map
loci near sub-nuclear structures, identify cell-to-cell variation in organization, quantify dynamic and biophysical
properties of chromatin interactions, and relate chromosome and nuclear organization to gene expression.
These different datatypes will be integrated to determine dynamic trajectories of the 4DN nucleome at the
resolution of single loci as cells differentiate and age. Mechanistic models for chromosome folding will be
formulated and experimentally tested. Finally, we will develop new platforms to visualize and widely share
navigable maps of the dynamic 4D nucleome and 4D nucleome trajectories during cellular transitions."

This proposal will establish a Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Phase 1: Data Production
Research and Development Center based entirely at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine – the JAX
MorPhiC Center. JAX MorPhiC will comprise, under one roof, a team of highly collaborative scientists with
complementary skill sets and decades of cumulative experience in mammalian gene knockouts (KO), stem cell
and developmental biology, molecular phenotyping, single cell analysis, and advanced metabolomics and
lipidomics capabilities. We will KO 250 protein-coding genes over the Phase 1 period of this initiative and will
engineer these KOs in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that will subsequently be differentiated into
two cell lineages, the extra-embryonic and the neuroectodermal, where cells will then be comprehensively
phenotyped. Our rationale for selecting these lineages is that they are two of the most evolutionary divergent
between species, and primate-specificity is one of our criteria for gene prioritization. In addition, the extra-
embryonic lineage rapidly develops into a cellular functional endpoint responsible for many biological processes,
thus permitting interpretation of function of diverse genes, whereas the early neuroectodermal lineage is relevant
to neurodevelopmental disorders. In Aim 1, we will prioritize genes for knockout; selection criteria include
expression in extra-embryonic or neuroectodermal lineages, primate-specific features, broad classes of
functions while enriching for transcription factors, and genes implicated in human disease. In Aim 2, we will
generate iPSC KO clones in high-throughput using high-efficiency protocols and workflows established in JAX's
Cellular Engineering core. We will engineer KO clones for 250 genes in the well-characterized, stable human
iPSC line, KOLF2.1, while considering the effects of sex, genetic background, possible adaptive/compensatory
responses, and different KO strategies including incorporation of conditional/reversible and scalable approaches.
In Aim 3, will carry out comprehensive phenotyping of derivatives differentiated from KO iPSCs. We have
selected a combination of assays to maximally integrate consistency, scalability, and functional informativeness
to help achieve the overall objectives of the MorPhiC Consortium. These include imaging, single cell
transcriptomics, single nucleus epigenomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics. Our research Aims will be
coordinated in administrative Aim 4, which will ensure efficient project management and oversight, internal and
external communications, and data dissemination to the MorPhiC Data Resource and Administrative
Coordination Center (DRACC). Successful completion of the proposed work will address several main barriers
hampering the ultimate goal of the MorPhiC Consortium to functionally characterize all human genes: identifying
the most effective KO strategies and optimal phenotyping technologies, as well as scaling efficiencies to expand
this program towards future MorPhiC Phases. In the process, we will generate a valuable resource of 250 human
iPSC KO lines that will be distributed to the scientific community via existing operational infrastructure at JAX."

The Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) has been operating at the Mayo Clinic Rochester
(MCR) and Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) since 1990. The theme of the current cycle of the ADRC is Multiple
Etiology Dementias. We recruit and follow participants on the Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body disorders (LBD) and vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) spectra
to study the roles of multiple pathologic processes functioning to impact cognition in aging. We will be evaluating
the social and structural determinants of health in African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino communities at
MCF and rural residents at MCR to determine the manner in which the multiple pathologic processes evolve in
these communities. Our team has secured several grants in AD, FTLD, LBD and VCID to allow us to leverage
the resources of the ADRC against these projects to advance our knowledge. New cores in this ADRC
application include the Genomics Core that will study the role of multi-omic aspects of various
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) disorders, and a Digital Innovation Core that will
combine aspects of artificial intelligence neuroimaging, gait, speech/language and remote cognitive
assessments to help diagnose and evaluate the longitudinal outcome of neurodegenerative and CVD disorders.
The Biomarker Core will evaluate several plasma assays and platforms to determine the utility of these plasma
markers in predicting the underlying pathologies, assisting in the biological aspects of the diagnosis and following
treatments of these disorders. The Neuroimaging Core will continue to unify imaging protocols across
modalities between MCR and MCF as well as move the field forward with defacing MRI and PET images to
maximize research participant privacy. Our Neuropathology Core has been at the forefront of developing
neuropathology criteria and serves the vital function of confirming the multiple etiological nature of most
degenerative/CVD conditions. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to lead the field in
electronic data capture for our Center enabling the robust sharing of data. The Research Education
Component has been successful at training the next generation of investigators from underserved populations
and will expand these efforts. The Mayo Clinic ADRC will continue to be a leader in sharing images, data and
biospecimens with the other ADRC’s and the broader research community. The unique focus of the Mayo Clinic
ADRC involving the combinations of most of the major neurodegenerative and CVD disorders will advance the
field for refining diagnoses leading to the development of therapies."
10865851,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Mayo Clinic ADRC will pursue the theme of Multiple Etiology Dementias, as emphasized in the 2022
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Summit. Toward that goal, the ADRC will continue its current efforts
to support research in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Lewy body
disorders disease (LBD) spectrum disorders, and in conjunction with other new programs, add vascular cognitive
impairment dementia (VCID), to the neurodegenerative diseases. The Center will focus on the recruitment of
underrepresentated groups (URGs) including an African American/Black cohort, a Hispanic/Latino cohort, and
participants from Rural Dwelling areas. The Center will continue activities through the existing Administrative,
Clinical, Data Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement,
Biomarker, and Neuroimaging Cores, and the Research Education Component (REC). We will be adding
two new Cores in this application. The Genomics Core will focus on genetic and -omics aspects of the various
neurodegenerative diseases and has already established a strong foundation in the various disorders with
numerous additional grants. The Digital Innovation Core will combine techniques involving neuroimaging, gait
assessments, speech/language and remote cognitive screening to also pursue the theme of the Center.
The Administrative Core of the Mayo Clinic ADRC will oversee all activities of the Center. The Mayo Clinic
ADRC operates in Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR) and Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) in Jacksonville, Florida. It has
functioned seamlessly for 33 years and, with the assistance of institutional support from the Mayo Clinic, has
operated as a single Center. The Administrative Core of the ADRC performs liaison activities with Executive
Dean for Research at Mayo Clinic and with the National Institute on Aging. The Core holds regularly scheduled
meetings of the Core Leaders of the ADRC and maintains communication among the faculty. As described in
this and multiple other Cores, succession plans are in place to transition many of the Core Co-leads over the
next cycle, if funded. Resource sharing with national repositories and external investigators; engagement of
investigators, trainees and participants of URG backgrounds; and training the next generation of investigators
devoted to AD/ADRD research, will continue as high priorities for the Center – to be coordinated by the
Administrative Core and associated Cores and REC."
10865852,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL CORE
 The Mayo ADRC is comprised of two sites: Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR) and Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) that
have collaborated closely for the past 30 years. Following the theme of expanded phenotyping to characterize
multi-etiology contributions to later life cognitive impairment, the Mayo ADRC will take advantage of our long-
standing interests and involvement in Alzheimer Disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and
Lewy Body Disease (LBD) spectrum disorders to provide the clinical and logistical infrastructure needed to
support the many clinical projects in which Mayo investigators are involved. We have expanded our
characterization of the cerebrovascular contribution to cognitive impairment (VCID). Each of these disease
entities are represented in joint engagement by the Clinical Core of the ADRC and separate NIH-funded multi-
center investigations (ADNI, DLB-U01, NAPS, LEADS, ALLFTD, Mark-VCID2). The Clinical Core also works
closely with the ORE Core, with the MCF Clinical Core unit will continue its very successful focus on enrolling
cognitively unimpaired African American/Black participants and, more recently, Hispanic/Latino participants, as
well as individuals from those communities with AD/ADRD. The MCR Clinical Core along with the ORE Core
will continue to focus on recruitment of persons from rural areas, an effort that has long been a strength of the
MCR site of this ADRC.
 The Clinical Core behavioral neurologists perform full clinical evaluations, while study coordinators perform
detailed interviews with knowledgeable informants that include functional assessments, review of medical history
and medications and assessments of structural and social determinants of health. All participants undergo
neuropsychological testing with trained psychometric technicians that is reviewed by ADRC neuropsychologists.
The Clinical Core operates in close coordination with the Neuroimaging Core to obtain and interpret MRI,
amyloid PET, tau PET, FDG PET and DAT scans in a large proportion of our participants. With the rapid
developments in plasma biomarkers, the Clinical Core will also be operating in close collaboration the
Genomics and Biomarker Cores for obtaining blood and CSF and performing biomarker assays including
expansion of our multiomics capabilities. We will phenotype all participants and render diagnoses that are
reviewed at our regular consensus conferences at each site. Several times a year, joint MCR and MCF
consensus conferences are held to standardize our approach across sites and ensure data harmonization.
 Clinical Core physicians are primarily responsible for presenting the case to participants to allow post-mortem
neuropathological examinations. The Clinical Core clinicians and the Neuropathology Core physicians meet
biweekly to conduct clinico-pathological conferences. At those conferences, clinical, imaging, and more recently
biofluid studies are reviewed and compared to neuropathological observations."
10865853,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL CORE
The Data Management and Statistical Core (DMS) will provide database, logistical and statistical support to
all Mayo Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Cores in the recruitment and follow up of patients connected to
other studies focused on the neurodegenerative diseases AD, LBD and FTLD and the vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) in these diseases. The members of the DMS Core bring expertise
in the development, implementation and management of relational databases, logistical support of large studies,
and the statistical methods for analysis of cognitive impairment in longitudinal data. The DMS Core will 1)
maintain and optimize the Mayo ADRC database housing the longitudinal clinical, neuropsychometric,
structural/social determinants of health data (SSDoH) and components of the data from the Neuroimaging,
Biomarker, Genomics and Neuropathology Cores 2) provide logistical support to all Cores for patient and
biological sample tracking 3) support for the electronic capture and organization of data across all Cores 4)
support in sharing of data and samples internally and externally, including the transfer of data and samples to
the NACC, LONI and AD-Knowledge Portal and NCRAD national repositories 5) provide statistical support to
the Development Projects (administered by the Administrative Core), to mentor trainees (from the Research
Education Component) in study design and statistical methods, and for development of new disease models
to improve understanding of the progression of cognitive decline in patients.
The DMS Core is essential to the proper functioning of the Mayo ADRC. The database systems of the DMS
Core are essential to activities including tracking participants’ status for longitudinal follow-up, accurately storing
and accessing data for research projects, appropriately uploading Uniform Data Set (UDS) data to NACC,
coordinating with the Biomarker, Genomics, Neuroimaging and Neuropathology Cores so their data and
samples transferred to the LONI, AD-Knowledge Portal and NCRAD national repositories can be de-identified
yet matched for analysis. The statistical expertise of the DMS Core is of similar importance to the Mayo ADRC,
as it is critical for the preparation and organization of data for subsequent analysis, for efficient study design, for
accurate analytical plans and the final interpretation of research findings. Additionally, the DMS Core is active in
development of new models of dementia and of corresponding software allowing broad application of these new
disease models. The Data Management and Statistical Core aims to collaborate in advancing the scientific
understanding of neurodegenerative diseases AD, LBD and FTLD and the contribution of VCID through the
resources it provides to the Mayo ADRC."
10865854,"PROJECT SUMMARY – NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE
The Neuropathology (NP) Core performs diagnostic evaluations, quantitative analyses on brain tissue collected
at autopsy of participants in the Mayo Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), allowing feedback to
clinicians, closure to family members and contribution to research by providing scientists postmortem brain
samples and data derived from those samples. The NP Core provides support to ADRC-affiliated investigators
and to outside investigators. The neuropathologic and genetic data are communicated to the Data Management
and Statistical Core, who uploads it to the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). The research
approach for the NP Core is as follows: Specific Aim 1. Perform brain autopsies on a diverse population of
participants of the Mayo ADRC in a timely fashion and according to protocol, which includes collection of fixed
and frozen tissue, postmortem CSF and demographic and clinical data related to these samples. Specific Aim
2. Provide neuropathologic evaluations and collect neuropathologic data using standardized methods for gross
dissection and neurohistology. Assign AD likelihood diagnoses based upon Thal amyloid phase, Braak NFT
stage, and CERAD neuritic plaque score using the NIA-AA ABC diagnostic probability scheme. Arrive at a
consensus on clinicopathologic diagnoses and educational opportunities at videoconferences. Record
neuropathologic data with NACC Version 11 and provide data to the Data Management and Statistical Core
and NACC. Specific Aim 3. Generate quantitative endophenotypes using digital pathology and image analysis
in support of ADRC research. Specific Aim 4. Store brain fixed and frozen tissue and other autopsy-derived
materials and provide clinically and pathologically well-characterized tissue samples to investigators at Mayo
Clinic and outside institutions supporting biochemical and biomarker discovery. Frozen tissue is continuously
monitored by an electronic system and available backup freezers to ensure high-quality sample preservation."
10865059,"ABSTRACT
INVESTIGATORS: Tristan Maerz, PhD (PI) is an ESI biomedical engineer focused on developing new treat-
ments for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). The Co-Investigators Kurt Hankenson, DVM PhD and Craig
Duvall, PhD have expertise in Wnt signaling and biomaterial-mediated tissue regeneration, respectively.
RESEARCH CONTEXT: Overactivation of canonical Wnt/β-Catenin (cWnt) signaling is increasingly recognized
as a driver of joint degeneration in PTOA. A novel cWnt agonist in the context of PTOA is R-spondin 2
(Rspo2), which some literature and our data support as a disease-promoting ligand via cWnt-mediated induc-
tion of synovial fibrosis, protease overexpression, chondrocyte hypertrophy, and aberrant bone sclerosis. A
recent drug screen identified that the drug Mianserin inhibits Rspo2 signaling by blocking Lgr5 binding. Given
high solute clearance rates in the joint, we must engineer new depot-type formulations using biomaterials to
deliver small molecules such as Mianserin. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres are a versatile
and biocompatible delivery vehicle well-suited to deliver molecules to the joint, and they can be engineered to
deliver Mianserin for sustained intra-articular cWnt pathway inhibition by targeting Rspo2 signaling.
OBJECTIVE: To validate the role of Rspo2 in PTOA pathogenesis and test efficacy of sustained intra-articular
Rspo2 inhibition using Mianserin-loaded PLGA microspheres.
SPECIFIC AIMS: 1). Elucidate the impact of Rspo2 on PTOA progression; 2). Advance the development of
PLGA microspheres to achieve sustained in vivo delivery of a small-molecule Rspo2 inhibitor; 3). Test the effi-
cacy of sustained intra-articular Rspo2 inhibitor therapy as a novel PTOA treatment.
RESEARCH PLAN: Aim 1). We will delineate Rspo2-responsive cell types and characterize the disease-pro-
moting effect of Rspo2 in healthy and injured joints of TCF/LEF Wnt reporter mice. Single-cell RNAseq will elu-
cidate Rspo2-Lgr signaling cells while unbiasedly assessing transcriptional responses to Rspo2. Rspo2 will
then be ablated globally at the time of joint injury using Rosa26-CreERT2; Rspo2f/f mice and PTOA severity will
be assessed. Aim 2). We will formulate Mianserin-loaded PLGA microspheres, aiming to achieve >4 weeks of
in vitro release with negligible burst. We will confirm 4 weeks of in vivo cWnt signaling suppression and assess
safety. Using primary cells, we will examine the effect of sustained Mianserin delivery on cWnt signaling in
chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and osteoprogenitor cells. We will further test PLGA-based Mianserin deliv-
ery on Rspo2-treated human cartilage explants obtained during total knee arthroplasty. Aim 3). We will admin-
ister Mianserin-loaded PLGA microspheres to the joint following injury and comprehensively phenotype PTOA,
benchmarking efficacy against repeated Mianserin and repeated β-Catenin inhibitor injections. We will verify
that the in vivo effect of Mianserin is mediated through Rspo2 inhibition by performing these studies in WT and
Rspo2 conditional knockout mice, and we will confirm suppression of cWnt signaling using IHC."
10865061,"Children in the US are exposed to various neurotoxicants that can damage their developing brains. We have
recently shown that the long-known negative impact of low SES on cognitive development is mediated by
differences in brain structure. Specifically, the association between brain structure and SES is more
pronounced in the poorest children, those who are often the most exposed to neurotoxic metals, such as lead
(Pb). Here, we aim to better understand the impact of perinatal Pb exposure on brain, cognitive and behavioral
development longitudinally using a novel tooth dentine assay. This novel measure allows quantification of
prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure beginning with the 2nd trimester in utero and ultimately until the tooth is
shed during later childhood; dentine develops over time, much like rings of a tree, trapping earlier exposures
beneath the next “ring” of dentine to form, allowing temporal measurements of Pb in consecutive rings of
dentine. The effects of Pb exposure may be exacerbated in the context of low SES, but this important aspect of
brain development in the environmental setting has received little research attention. In this proposal, we will
leverage substantial existing funding by investigating Pb exposure among a subset of ~500 participants of the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study who have donated shed deciduous (baby) teeth. We
will also leverage recent funding from the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR: Project
#2017-1920; now HHEAR) to cover the costs of tooth analysis at three distinct developmental periods: the 2nd
trimester and 3rd trimester of fetal development and the 1st year of life. Notably, the ABCD cohort of over
11,800 participants varies considerably on race and ethnicity, geographic location, family income, and parent
education, and nearly 4,000 participants have donated teeth. This will allow a strategic selection of participants
who are matched by Pb risk measures (based on publicly available risk maps of Pb exposure geocoded to
each participant's home address) while controlling for SES and race factors that could be confounded by risk of
Pb exposure. Pb risk may increase the likelihood of exposure, but it is clear that some at high risk could have
low exposure whereas some at low risk may have high exposure. While our preliminary studies show that Pb
risk status is associated with brain, cognition, and behavior as a function of SES in the ABCD cohort, only by
measuring endogenous Pb levels within groups of individuals matched on SES by risk status can we determine
how and where to focus future efforts to reduce remediable Pb risk factors and improve the health of children
in the US. In this proposal, we will assess (1) associations between dentine Pb levels on structural brain
development during childhood and determine if associations vary as a function of level of exposure at 3
developmental time points, (2) associations between dentine Pb levels and cognitive and behavioral
development along with sex differences on these associations, and (3) the moderating or mediating effects of
SES on brain-cognitive-behavioral development in the context of perinatal Pb exposure."
10865062,"Abstract
Approximately 5.4 million adults in the United States (1 in 45) are believed to have autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), but there is a lack of services available to support them in reaching their full potential. Although typically
conceptualized as a childhood disorder, ASD-related service needs persist into adulthood. The core social and
communication impairments of ASD, reported difficulties with change, and a high rate of co-occurring mental
health conditions often result in limited participation in major life areas that are determinants of health,
including social and community participation, employment, housing, and transportation. The transition to
adulthood is not only associated with developmental challenges, but also a “services cliff” whereby supports
and services that were previously available through the education system are no longer available. Peer-
delivered interventions have emerged as a potent, evidence-based modality for enhancing outcomes among
other clinical populations, such as adults with serious mental illnesses, with effectiveness in enhancing social
networks, empowering participants, reducing the use of inpatient services, and increasing life satisfaction. At
present, there is limited research on the effectiveness of autistic-led peer support interventions, especially
those that target broad aspects of community functioning. The proposed study seeks to refine, manualize, and
test a pilot autistic peer support program aimed at supporting community participation among autistic young
adults, with the goal of preparing it for large-scale testing and future dissemination and sustainability. The first
aim of this proposal is to enhance the structure of a pilot autistic-peer delivered intervention (Community
Autism Peer Specialists, or CAPS) that is currently in use as a Medicaid-reimbursed service in Philadelphia.
This will include developing a manual and fidelity tool to facilitate evaluation and systematic implementation.
The second and third aims are to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled
trial with 40 young autistic adults to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and research
procedures, while also examining proposed target mechanisms of action (e.g., self-efficacy, working alliance,
perceived social support) and clinical outcomes such as community participation, loneliness, and resilience.
This work will gather additional evidence and implementation information to support a fully-powered R01-
funded clinical trial. The proposed efforts will involve substantial engagement of a diverse group of autistic
adults in all phases along with multiple community partners, including a Medicaid payer. The project has
tremendous potential to expand service options for autistic adults and is uniquely poised to have broad,
scalable impact."

10863121,"Project Summary
 Firearms are the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in the United States. They are
also the most lethal means of suicide - more than 90% of youth who attempt suicide with a firearm will die.
Limiting access to firearms for individuals at elevated risk for suicide, a component of lethal means safety
counseling, is an underutilized evidence-based suicide prevention strategy. In addition to being a safety net for
vulnerable youth, Emergency Departments (EDs) across the country have begun screening patients for suicide
risk. Yet, lethal means counseling does not occur in most circumstances in which it’s indicated. Previous studies
have developed tools, for example Lock to Live, to support adults at elevated suicide risk in the ED
setting. Existing lethal means interventions for teens were developed with caregivers of teens at elevated
suicide risk, and engage only caregivers in lethal means safety planning, thereby failing to address the teen
voice in limiting firearm access. This proposal aims to leverage user-centered design methods to develop a
user friendly teen-centered lethal means safety planning tool for teens presenting to the ED by pursuing the
following aims: 1) Assess perspectives of teens at elevated risk for suicide and their caregivers around current
lethal means safety planning tools using qualitative methods, 2) Adapt an intervention with teens and
caregivers to co-design a tool that addresses both teen and caregiver firearm access, and 3) Test the
acceptability and feasibility of the intervention in a pilot trial. As a pediatric emergency medicine physician
and prior administrative leader, Dr. Maya Haasz is familiar with the benefits, challenges, and operational
considerations of implementing this intervention in the Emergency Department. Her clinical experience and
research expertise position her to complete the proposed K23 research and training aims. Dr. Haasz’s long-
term goal is to become an independent investigator with a research program focused on reducing firearm
morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents. To this end, she has developed a detailed career
development plan consisting of guided literature review, coursework, workshops, and hands-on research
experience to develop her skills in qualitative research, human-centered intervention development,
implementation, and clinical trial design. Moreover, she has assembled a nationally renowned multi-
disciplinary team with relevant expertise and extensive mentorship experience to ensure her success in
achieving her research and career goals. Her innovative proposal, which involves teens in developing an
intervention to decrease firearm access among teens at elevated suicide risk, will also serve as a model for
teen engagement in other mechanisms of firearm injury prevention. Moreover, this proposal will prepare Dr.
Haasz to transition to an independent investigator and prepare her for future R01 funding."
10863127,"The long-term objective of this project is to improve the walking speed and stability Veterans disabled by
incomplete SCI (iSCI) sufficiently to safely participate in community activities outside of the home, and thereby
enhance their independence and daily function. We will advance this goal by developing and implementing
new, practical, and readily customizable control systems for peripheral nerve stimulation to augment the
actions of selected weak or paralyzed muscles based on real-time feedback of voluntary body movements.
Ten subjects representing a cross section of individuals with difficulty walking due to iSCI will undergo
conventional gait training prior to serving as their own controls in a series of single-subject research studies
with and without our stimulation controllers active. The proposed controller will process inputs from a small set
of body-mounted sensors to guarantee that stimulated assistance works together with intact movements to
automatically advance the body forward, intuitively vary walking speed, and take corrective forward or
sideways steps to recover from unexpected and potentially destabilizing disturbances. By the end of the study,
six of the participants will have received such gait assist systems consisting of our current implanted
stimulators and externally worn sensors. The resulting knowledge with prepare for clinical translation via
surface-based or completely implanted stimulation and sensing systems, such as the soon to be available
Networked Neural Prosthesis System currently undergoing pivotal trials for marketing approval. Our aims are:
1) Develop and implement a stimulation control system based on estimates of movements of body Center of
 Mass during walking from a small set of wearable sensors. Transitions between patterns of stimulated
 assistance to the specific set of weak or paralyzed muscles most responsible for the individual gait
 difficulties of each subject will be made automatically to keep the body moving forward dynamically.
2) Adapt the timing and intensity of stimulation automatically alter walking speed from those sufficient for
 household ambulation (<0.4m/s) to those required to function in the community (>0.8m/s). A control
 algorithm will facilitate intuitive modulation of gait speed by adjusting stimulation during the next step to
 match the movements of the body generated by the volitional actions of the intact muscles sensed during
 the current and immediately previous steps.
3) Finally, we will counteract large and potentially destabilizing perturbations to the Center of Mass by
 interrupting continuous walking and a generating a forward or sideways protective step to prevent losses of
 balance and maintain standing posture. Inputs from the same wearable sensors sensitive to the Center of
 Mass will be interrogated to detect sudden disturbances to trigger the reactive steps in the appropriate
 direction and facilitate recovery. This represents the first time such mechanisms will be explored as a
 protective measures during stimulation assisted walking.
This study is an important next step toward preparing wider scale application in larger clinical trials of the gait
assist system in via a VA Translational Rehabilitation Research Award or the Cooperative Studies Program. It
will determine whether the new control algorithms we propose are customizable to individuals with iSCI with a
variety of impairments, are easy to set up and intuitive to use, and improve walking function and overall activity
levels, and engender confidence and reduced fear of falling. Successful completion of this project will define a
new intervention for Veterans with difficulty walking due to partial paralysis from iSCI, thus enabling them to be
independent ambulators and accelerating their access to life opportunities as active participants in their
communities and society at large."
10863125,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia characterized by the aberrant, unorganized initiation and
propagation of electrical impulses across the atria. The most common serious arrhythmia, AF affected an
estimated 33.5 million globally in 2010, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 3 individuals older than 55 years old. A
greater understanding of the mechanisms of AF is required to design more effective treatment strategies.
 Genome-wide association studies have linked AF with over 143 genomic loci, including the transcription
factor (TF) TBX5. In our previous study, we integrated single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC- sequencing
(multiomics) of control and Tbx5 KO aCMs with TBX5 chromatin occupancy in aCMs to identify direct TBX5
targets that might contribute to AF. In the process, we uncovered a novel function for TBX5 in maintaining
genomic accessibility at enhancer elements, likely by recruiting chromatin modifying proteins. TBX5 interacts
with chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4), a component of the nucleosome remodeling and
histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Although conventionally viewed as a transcriptional repressor, our
Preliminary Data reveal an exciting, alternative role for CHD4 as a transcriptional activator.
 To better understand gene expression changes central to AF, we performed multiomics on a second AF
mouse model caused by Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) inactivation in aCMs, a gene decreased in human AF patient
aCMs, revealing 632 core atrial rhythm (AR) genes that are commonly downregulated in aCMs from both
models. 61% of AR genes were adjacent to regions co-occupied by CHD4-TBX5, and include the Na+ channel
SCN5A, regulators FGF12/13 and the gap junction channels Connexin 43 (GJA1) and Connexin 45 (GJA5).
These data lead to our central hypothesis that CHD4 maintains rhythm homeostasis in healthy atria by
complexing with TBX5 to maintain the accessibility of TBX5-dependent enhancers, promoting the expression
of genes that are critical for normal aCM electrical function.
 To determine the mechanisms by which the CHD4-TBX5 complex regulates the atrial enhancer network,
we will characterize the phenotypic and genomic consequences of Chd4 inactivation in aCMs, identify CHD4-
interacting proteins required for aCM gene activation, and uncover other cis-activating factors that function
cooperatively with CHD4-TBX5 to regulate aCM gene expression. To identify core atrial genes required for
atrial rhythm, we will test the requirement of select AR genes to maintain atrial rhythm by inactivation. Genes
identified as critical regulators of rhythm will then be evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in AF prevention and
reversal in our established AF mouse models. This proposal is significant because it will mechanistically
characterize genes required for atrial function, determine how they are regulated, and test their potential as
therapies in multiple models, laying the groundwork for the development of more effective treatment strategies."

cognitive, and emotional development. Surprising to many, the prevalence of pediatric voice disorders is high,
yet systematic bench-to-bedside research targeting pediatric voice assessment is severely lacking. This
innovative proposal seeks to advance our knowledge of the basic properties of pediatric dysphonia and to
develop and improve laboratory methods and clinical protocols for quantifying pediatric voice quality (VQ). The
proposal addresses three fundamental issues as yet unanswered. First and foremost, we challenge the tacit
assumption that the primary dimensions of pediatric VQ, to be assessed, analyzed, and tracked, are the same
across age and vibratory source. These assumptions have yet to be tested, though they permeate clinical
practice and research, despite the fact that there are marked differences in the vocal anatomy and physiology
between children and adults and between vibratory sources that can impact VQ. To this end, Aim 1 involves a
systematic multidimensional scaling approach to establish the dominant voice qualities associated with glottal
and supraglottal vibratory sources in pediatric dysphonia. Aim 2 explores the potential role of pitch perception
to inform us about pediatric dysphonia and to better accommodate different vibratory sources. While standard
VQ assessments do not distinguish among possible vibratory sources, experts anecdotally note very different
source-dependent VQ. In doing so, we address the vexing problem posed by aperiodic signals (e.g., Type III)
in pediatric voices with supraglottal sources by invoking recently developed, pitch-based measurement
methods. In Aim 3, we use a theoretical framework of perception to quantify VQ along primary dimensions to
support: 1) discovery of objective indices of VQ, 2) development of robust perceptual measures of VQ, and 3)
development of novel ratio-level scales ideal for clinical use as diagnostic and outcome measures. Such scales
enhance clinical perceptual evaluation of voice to support quantitative comparisons among pre-treatment, peri-
treatment, and post-treatment outcomes to provide robust, evidenced-based outcome measures. The success
of this proposal is bolstered by the uniquely qualified expert team that has been assembled. The team includes
collaborators that are expert pediatric voice clinicians, led by Dr. Alessandro de Alarcon who is a foremost
pediatric laryngologist, and a group with years of experience using innovative methods to investigate voice
quality in adults, including Drs. David Eddins, Rahul Shrivastav, Supraja Anand, and Erol Ozmeral, with
expertise in voice, speech, hearing, and signal processing. Together, this multi-disciplinary team has the
knowledge, experience, expertise, and multi-site resources to efficiently and effectively address the limitations
noted above. This pre-translational and translational research has the promise to substantially advance the
field of pediatric voice and vocal heath care with the potential to lead to formal clinical trials."

Eastern (EEEV), Venezuelan (VEEV), and Western (WEEV) equine encephalitis viruses
are mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses with the potential to cause fatal neuroinvasive
disease in humans and domesticated animals. These viruses also can be spread by the
aerosol route and thus, have significant potential as biowarfare/bioterrorism agents. In
2019, EEEV human infections increased to levels not seen since the 1950s. Currently,
there are no antiviral therapies or vaccines licensed for these alphaviruses. The existing
investigational live-attenuated VEEV vaccine (LAV; TC-83) was generated >40 years
ago, is highly reactogenic, poorly immunogenic, and causes disease in up to 20% of
recipients. For EEEV and WEEV, investigational formalin-inactivated vaccines have
been given to at-risk workers. While both elicit antibody responses, they provide
uncertain protection and require multiple booster injections. A trivalent veterinary vaccine
against VEEV, EEEV and WEEV is available but is so poorly immunogenic that domestic
animals must be boosted annually and disease is seen in vaccinated animals. Here, we
propose to develop safe and effective LAVs vaccine against these alphaviruses using
recent advances in understanding of the virulence mechanisms of each. These
advances will allow mutagenesis of pathogenicity domains that specifically reduce
virulence, increase cytokine induction and antigen presentation and provide long-lasting
protection. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of each mutation will be known and
each will be specifically designed to resist reversion. We will combine mutations to
create an optimal vaccine strain for each virus and then investigate their use in
multivalent formulations, critical to veterinary vaccine development and highly desired for
human formulations. We will identify correlates of protection for each vaccine and
address the extent of cross-protection versus encephalitic viruses. For the first time with
alphaviruses, the individual and combined effects of mutations with known mechanisms
of action will be tested for effects on virus replication, disease and immunogenicity in
animals."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a public health emergency impacting the lives of an estimated 5.6 million individuals
in the United States. OUD is a particular concern for vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women, criminal-
legal system involved populations, etc.), where the barriers to evidence-based care and the economic burden
remain significant. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for identifying causal
treatment effects and is the primary scientific tool to inform clinical decisions. RCT research designs are also
growing in use for conducting robust health economic studies to ensure that evidence-based treatments can be
cost-effective and sustainable—reaching the broadest number of individuals with OUD while efficiently using
scarce healthcare resources. As such, health economic RCT research designs have become a critical tool in
identifying sustainable and cost-effective solutions to prevent and mitigate the opioid epidemic. The NIH HEAL
initiative has championed such research by funding economic evaluations alongside clinical trials in the Healing
Communities Study, NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) and Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network
(JCOIN), and The HEAL Prevention Cooperative (HPC), among others. Traditional RCTs have demonstrated
the effectiveness of medications for OUD (MOUD) but have limitations in addressing the unique needs of these
populations. Real-world data and evidence (RWE) research designs that use observational data from healthcare
claims, electronic medical records, and other sources have been used to answer critical questions in medicine
that are difficult or impossible to implement in equivalent RCTs. The 21st Century CURES Act reaffirmed the use
of RWE and provided greater research flexibility of data sources for the FDA drug approval process. Despite
this, significant concerns remain about the reliability of RWE due to its observational nature and potential for
confounding bias. To address these concerns, RCTs have been used to inform RWE research designs (e.g., the
popular “target RCT” framework) and augment RWE findings. The alternative and unconventional approach of
integrating RWE to inform inconclusive RCTs to support robust and causal conclusions that can inform clinical
practice has been systematically ignored but represents a potential opportunity to reduce research waste and
produce more reliable findings to inform clinical decision-making and improve outcomes for at-risk populations
with OUD. This project will develop novel econometric methods and unified framework for integrating RWE in
the analysis of inconclusive RCTs by adapting existing econometric and biostatistical techniques into
comparative economic and effectiveness assessments of OUD treatments conducted alongside RCTs. The
project will evaluate multiple maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approaches combined with propensity score-
based causal inference methodologies to achieve this goal. This novel approach, which is the reverse of
traditional practice, offers a unique and highly risky ""out-of-the-box"" solution to address emerging barriers in
generating evidence for health interventions targeting vulnerable populations affected by the opioid epidemic."
10863725,"There is abundant evidence that obesity confers increased risk for various forms of cancer. The
incidence of breast, colon, and liver cancer are all increased in obese populations, and the epidemiologic
evidence for the obesity-breast cancer connection is particularly strong. One in eight women will be diagnosed
with breast cancer during their lifetime. Breast cancer incidence increases approximately 10-fold for women
age 60 and above, compared to women 50 or younger. This increase in breast cancer risk parallels an increase
in obesity. Indeed, obesity increases the risk of triple negative breast cancer in pre-menopausal women and
estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women. A rarer form of inflammatory breast cancer
is dramatically increased (up to 5-fold) in both groups. More importantly, obesity shortens decrease-free
survival in both pre- and post-menopausal women. Patient mortality in breast cancer is primarily caused by
distant metastases and obesity at the time of diagnosis is associated with increased risk of distant metastasis and
mortality.
 Studies in rodents have confirmed these relationships, showing that dietary-induced obesity and high-fat
diets lead to increased incidence and growth of tumors in oncogene and carcinogen-induced breast cancers.
Despite this body of correlative evidence, the mechanisms of obesity-induced breast cancer risk remain poorly
understood. One possibility is that the obesity causes insulin resistance in the liver that causes insulin levels to
rise to control glucose levels, but other tissues, including tumors, may not be insulin resistant so are exposed to
increased insulin signaling. Indeed, we have found that reducing insulin resistance by treating with omega-3
fatty acids reduces breast cancer growth in mice. We have also found that a time-restricted, high-fat diet
improves insulin resistance despite continuing obesity, and not coincidentally inhibits tumor growth. But many
important questions remain to be answered. Firstly, how does insulin drive tumor growth? Is it a direct effect on
the tumor cell, or on the microenvironment? Secondly, does correction of the circadian rhythms in the tumor
cell by TRF contribute to the reduced tumor growth? Thirdly, how do nutrients and insulin regulate the
circadian clock in the tumors? Lastly, we know that obesity alters an individual's response to chemotherapy and
anti-estrogen therapy, but is the response of the tumor altered by nutritional interventions such as TRF?
 In summary, aging and obesity are strong risk factors for breast cancer in women because as ovarian
estrogen declines, women have less protection from the harmful effects of obesity, which causes inflammation
and increases insulin levels. These harmful effects can be reversed by weight loss, but weight loss through diet
and exercise is not sustainable for most obese individuals. We have shown that a novel dietary intervention
using time-restricted feeding of a western-style, high-fat diet prevents the effect of obesity to drive breast cancer
in mice; the proposed studies will investigate whether this nutritional intervention can enhance the response to
normal chemo- and hormonal therapy for breast cancer."
10866399,"Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical
clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an
academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health
records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical
informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided
by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing,
and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical
syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases
vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and
heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual
framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score
based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including
mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations:
insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not
commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis
techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research
Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that
provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality.
In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and
innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional
FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3,
we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal
context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non-
VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring
team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed
reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an
independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of
Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of
mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers
as clinical-investigators."
10866429,"ABSTRACT
Optoacoustic tomography (OAT), also known as photoacoustic computed tomography, is a non-invasive
imaging modality actively being developed for breast cancer imaging and other biomedical applications. A
unique feature of OAT is the ability to produce an image based on the endogenous optical contrast associated
with the concentration and oxygenation state of hemoglobin within tissue, without ionizing radiation and without
the loss of spatial resolution typically associated with purely optical techniques such as optical diffusion
tomography. Because aggressively growing malignant breast tumors tend to be under hypoxia and decreased
blood oxygen saturation due to substantially increased metabolic activity in comparison to healthy tissue, an
optimized and validated OAT system can be a powerful tool for the management of breast cancer by assessing
density of the tumor microvasculature and its blood oxygenation.
 Currently, there is no validated OAT method that is sufficiently accurate for widespread clinical imaging of
the breast; important issues such as optimal hardware and image reconstruction designs, the ability to resolve
lesions at depth, and quantitative imaging remain unresolved. Due to the competing requirements of light
delivery and acoustic detection, a variety of different system designs for breast OAT have been proposed; this
is unlike in x-ray mammography, breast MRI and breast ultrasound, where very similar implementations are in
use per modality. Considering the large number of parameters involved, it is infeasible to systematically
optimize breast OAT through human trials due to time- and cost-constraints and ethical concerns. However,
virtual imaging trials (VITs), where an imaging study is conducted in silico by use of representative numerical
phantoms and imaging models, can offer a rapid and cost-efficient means of assessing and optimizing new
imaging concepts and technologies such as OAT. The ability to conduct VITs for 3D OAT is currently lacking.
 The broad objective of this project is to develop, validate, and demonstrate computational tools for
performing VITs that can inform the development of clinically viable and effective 3D breast OAT technologies.
This will afford researchers an unprecedented level of control in modeling and validating quantitative OAT
imaging of the tumor and tissue oxygen saturation distributions necessary for assessing breast cancer. The
results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of OAT and the knowledge
attainable in these studies is critical for translating this technology to the clinic.
 The Specific Aims of the project are: Aim 1. To develop multi-physics simulation tools for the in silico
simulation of realistic measurement data in 3D breast OAT; Aim 2. To systematically develop and refine
quantitative OAT image reconstruction methods; Aim 3. To conduct physical experiments that will be used to
validate the computational models; Aim 4. To conduct VITs to explore quantitative OAT system optimization."
10866534,"Age-related cognitive decline has emerged as one of the major public health challenges of our time. It is well known that normal cognitive function requires an adequate blood supply to support neuronal activity. In the healthy young brain, cerebral blood flow is rapidly adjusted to meet the increased oxygen and nutrient demands of active brain regions via a homeostatic mechanism known as neurovascular coupling (NVC, or functional hyperemia). Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that NVC is impaired in normal aging, and experimentally induced impairment of NVC responses in young animals results in cognitive impairment. Restoration of NVC in these animals by targeted pharmacological treatments improves cognitive function. Testing specific interventions in humans that have demonstrated efficacy in animal models is a reasonable and prudent approach that may improve impaired NVC and may be the key to developing effective therapies to reverse or prevent age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease/ Alzheimer’s Disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) in older adults. Endothelial dysfunction and impairment of NVC responses have been associated with increases in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are one of the well-defined ‘Hallmarks of Aging’. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the major regulators of ROS and has been shown to attenuate ROS production. Our preliminary studies indicate that NAD levels are profoundly reduced in brain vascular endothelial cells of aged mice and that restoration of NAD levels in normal aged mice (equivalent of ≥60 years of age in humans) using an NAD precursor rescues age-related endothelial dysfunction, restores NVC responses and attenuates cognitive decline. Age-related NAD depletion, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired NVC responses are observed in older adults even in the absence of predisposing vascular pathology. Although supplementation with the NAD precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), has been reported to increase blood cell NAD levels in humans, effects on endothelial function and NVC responses have not been investigated. Addressing this scientific gap is essential to further develop our understanding of the etiology of NVC impairment and establish its role in the genesis of cognitive decline in aging and AD/ADRD. Our central hypothesis is that restoration of NAD levels with NR in older adults will improve NVC responses and micro- and macrovascular endothelial function. This hypothesis will be tested by assessing the effects of treatment with oral NR (1g/day per os for 8 weeks) or placebo (8 weeks) in community dwelling older adults (60-85 years of age) in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel study design. These studies will determine whether NR supplementation alleviates endothelial and neurovascular dysfunction and, potentially, cognitive decline. We anticipate that identifying NAD dysregulation during aging as a driver of vascular dysfunction will not only result in development of new and urgently needed tools to treat vascular dysfunction in aging, but also advance research related to the etiology of AD/ADRD."

Solving the complex problems in human health and modern biology represents a major challenge
for those who will lead biomedical research in the near and long-term future. The core disciplines
of our training program—molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry—have led the way in
development of innovations that are driving life sciences research and applications today. It is
imperative that US life scientist training programs evolve to meet the demand for a diverse group
of leaders who are trained in rigorous and transparent implementation and reporting of
quantitative analysis of biological data. We recognize that this demand will require a change in
training culture that focuses on a high standard of professional development for trainers and
trainees. The objectives of this predoctoral training program are to: (1) Build and sustain an
equitable and inclusive training environment for an increasingly diverse group of PhD students.
(2) Integrate training in the design and implementation of rigorous and transparently reported
experimentation throughout the program. (3) Integrate training in quantitative and computational
approaches throughout training program. (4) Integrate career exploration and student
professional development throughout the program.
Faculty trainers in the Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry Graduate Program
(MCBGP) are accomplished scientists who are drawn from 11 Departments at Brown University
and the Warren Alpert Medical School. The mission of the MCBGP is to train the next generation
of leaders in biomedical research to probe the molecular mechanisms of cellular and biochemical
processes by building and sustaining an equitable and inclusive training environment in which a
diverse group of PhD students will successfully gain quantitative, conceptual, technical, and
professional skills that will allow them to conduct the rigorous and reproducible research that
interdisciplinary life science demands.
The MCBGP admits 9-14 students per year based on their research and academic potential.
During the first or second year of graduate study, trainees will be selected from the ~20 eligible
MCB graduate students for appointment to the training grant on the basis of their potential for
success in research. Each year, 4 first-year and 4 second-year predoctoral students will be
supported; funds to support 8 trainees per year are requested."

Food insecurity, defined by the United Nations as inconsistent access to a sufficient quantity of affordable,
nutritious food, is a prevalent SDOH among safety-net primary care patients. Among adults with food
insecurity, conditions like hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (DM2) are as much as two times more
prevalent. Widely available chronic disease self-management education and support (SMES) programs place
much emphasis on nutrition education but do not significantly address access to affordable, nutritious food or
meals. Notably, simulations have shown that medically-tailored meals for food-insecure adults could be as
cost-effective as some commonly prescribed medications.
Drawing upon our knowledge of systems engineering and user-centered design, our team created and
successfully piloted a novel, dietitian-led sociotechnical intervention called FoRKS: Food Resources & Kitchen
Skills. Safety-net primary care patient-participants (N=20 across two pilots) received essential home cooking
tools, home delivered lower sodium, lower-carbohydrate Mediterranean-style meals and ingredients, and twice-
weekly hands-on home cooking classes. Mean attendance was 87% and mean satisfaction was 4.7/5.0 for
delivered foods and 4.9/5.0 for hands-on cooking class. Webex videoconference classes allowed participants
to learn and cook together in a socially supportive “space” from their own home kitchen.
We here propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate FoRKS versus enhanced usual care (EUC). Safety-
net primary care patients aged 35 years or over with food insecurity and systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm Hg
(~40% will also have DM2) will be invited, consented, assessed, and randomized. EUC consists of SDOH
screening, referrals to food pantries, and assistance enrolling in food programs (e.g., SNAP). EUC also
consists of our CDC-approved 5-week SMES program. Those randomized to FoRKS will, in addition to EUC,
receive home-delivered meals and ingredient kits, and twice-weekly Webex cooking classes to week 16. In
week 17, participants will transition from FoRKS-delivered foods to shopping for affordable, nutritious foods.
FoRKS classes will continue in order to maintain learning and social support that may be critical to longer-term
engagement and self-efficacy for obtaining and preparing nutritious food.
The primary hypothesis is that, relative to EUC, FoRKS participants will experience lower mean systolic blood
pressure immediately post-intervention (16 weeks post-baseline). Maintenance to 24-weeks post-baseline will
also be assessed. Food security, nutrition, and HbA1c will also be evaluated as will cost-effectiveness and
behavioral mechanisms such as learning engagement, self-efficacy, and food resource management skills."
10866873,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background – The microbiome affects host metabolism predominantly via metabolites synthesized or modified
by gut bacteria. The identity of these metabolites and their mechanisms of action in the host remain largely
unknown. Overarching metabolomic analyses have offered a glimpse into classes of microbial molecules and
how they associate with disease. Two such types of molecules, bile acids and folates have been shown in recent
years to differentially modulate cell signaling pathways. However, the mechanisms of how distinct bile acids and
folates induce gut permeability and inflammation, the hallmarks of metabolic syndrome remain largely evasive.
Research – Targeted metabolomic analyses in human patient and rodent models of inflammatory diseases will
identify bile acid and folate metabolites that differ compared to healthy controls. Preliminary data suggests that
microbial unconjugated bile acids induce intestinal permeability, inhibition of which protects against development
of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Bile acids are deconjugated by gut bacteria. The K99 phase of the
proposal will identify mechanisms of how unconjugated bile acids induce intestinal permeability, and if chronic
inhibition of gut bacterial bile acid deconjugation is an effective strategy to rescue gut permeability and NASH.
There is sufficient evidence to suggest that bacterially produced polyglutamylated (glu) folates can activate host
folate receptor (FR) signaling, which in turn induces the MAP kinase pathway. The K99/R00 transition phase of
the proposal will identify and quantify individual folate molecules in diseased cohorts that activate FR. The
diseased samples include rodent and human bariatric surgery, NASH, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
intestinal contents. A compound library of folates will be generated for high-throughput screening. Inflammatory
folate producing bacteria will be isolated to establish causal relationships between strains and gut inflammation.
Multiple IBD patient ileal biopsies show an upregulation of the folate hydrolase (FOLH1) gene, the only known
purpose of which is to deconjugate poly-glu folates to mono-glu form. In the R00 phase, the mechanism of folate-
mediated upregulation of FOLH1 in IBD will be studied. Further, the role of poly-glu folate deconjugation will be
studied in the context of intestinal inflammation and metabolism. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, one-
carbon metabolism, and energy status will be measured following activation or inhibition of the folate/FR/FOLH1
axis. This study will also utilize high-throughput screening to identify molecules that can rescue gut inflammation.
Impact on Public Health – Bacteria in the gut encounter bile and dietary nutrients prior to their absorption in the
body. Approximately 50% of bile acids and folates absorbed from the intestine is microbially derived. Therefore,
studying microbiome-derived metabolites and their activity is important not only for intestinal, but organismal
homeostasis. Bile acids are one of the most abundant molecules in the gut, present in millimolar concentrations.
Folate concentrations, also high in the gut, vary widely based on folate fortification policies imposed by different
countries. Therefore, the study of these metabolites in disease prognosis will reveal strategies for amelioration."

interdepartmental PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). For more than 50
years this program has provided cutting-edge research opportunities to trainees. In addition to our ongoing
expertise in key areas in genetics (e.g., genetics of model microbes, plants, and animals) and molecular
biology (e.g., signal transduction, gene expression, and virology), we have added strengths in epigenetics,
clinical and translational genetics, systems genetics, quantitative genetics, computational genetics, and
genomics. Extensive interaction between researchers in diverse areas is promoted by the interdepartmental
and inter-school nature of the program, as well as many faculty centers, and is facilitated by the physical
proximity of the different units on a single campus.
 Our mission is to train students from diverse backgrounds to conduct responsible research leading to a
PhD, while also providing training and acquisition of skills for them to enter a variety of careers in research and
research-related fields. We continuously update our program, based on our own studies and best practices
throughout the field to ensure that it is modern and innovative. Several years ago we added “modular” 5-week
courses that allow students to tailor their coursework more closely to their needs. We offer numerous career
information and training events, as well as internships in industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.
 We compete nationally for the top students and have successfully recruit students from a variety of
backgrounds, with about 20% belonging to one of the NIH-defined diversity groups. Our students are
successful in obtaining competitive external funding, and every student publishes at least one first-authored
research paper in a peer-reviewed journal. The vast majority of our students remain in scientific careers after
they graduate. Most initially do postdoctoral research in academia, government labs, or private research
foundations. Some remain in academic/government research, but others go into industry, science teaching, or
science policy."

Work performed by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) under the proposed Vet-LIRN
cooperative agreement supports the following:
 1. Strengthening the national food safety system’s ability to identify potential adulteration or
 contamination of animal foods or animal drugs by supporting research and capacity building
 through case investigations (chemical, microbiological, and/or pathological) within the purview of
 a veterinary diagnostic laboratory;
 2. Validating and harmonizing analytical methods and equipment platforms across the national food
 safety network;
 3. Strengthening inter-agency coordination of veterinary diagnostic laboratories as their efforts relate
 to the national food safety system and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety
 Modernization Act (FSMA) through potential animal foodborne illness outbreaks;
 4. Maintaining excellence in quality assurance through employee training and proficiency exercises,
 and developing inter-agency data sharing processes;
 5. Expanding the laboratory’s ISO/IEC 17025:2017 scope of accreditation as it relates to animal
 diagnostics and food/feed testing.
The mechanism for achieving the above is active participation in the FDA Veterinary Laboratory
Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN). The Vet-LIRN partnership spans across various state
and federal agencies and provides a mechanism for surge testing in the event of an emergency. The
network also offers proficiency testing or interlaboratory comparison exercises for a variety of toxicological
and microbiological agents that could negatively impact the food supply. In the event of an emergency,
the TN Department of Agriculture (TDA) may receive samples collected by federal, state, or local
government agencies or other local sources as deemed necessary for the response effort.
TDA is uniquely qualified to participate in this agreement as the department’s veterinary diagnostic
laboratory, the C. E. Kord Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory (KAHDL), shares a facility with the
laboratory that services the state’s Animal Feed Regulatory Standards Program (AFRPS) testing. This
second laboratory, the Technical Services Laboratory (TSL), complements KAHDL in terms of testing
capabilities and expertise. KAHDL staff are highly qualified to perform veterinary diagnostic work while
TSL staff have a demonstrated history of success performing regulatory pet food/animal feed analysis.
Additionally, the two laboratory branches share leadership, including a Quality Manager and Lab
Administrator/Director.
The overall goals for the project will be to renew KAHDL’s commitment to the Vet-LIRN partnership, to
provide quality analytical data in a timely manner, and to enhance the laboratory’s scope of accreditation
under ISO/IEC 17025:2017. Small scale method development and/or validation projects may also be
undertaken at the request of the Vet-LIRN Program Office (VPO). TDA has other agreements with FDA
relating to food/feed testing, and this new/renewed Vet-LIRN partnership further demonstrates the
commitment that both agencies have to the preservation of the food/feed supply."

Atherosclerosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, contributing to diseases such as
coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. It is known that atherosclerosis has a focal
propensity to areas of disturbed flow (d-flow) while areas of steady laminar flow (s-flow) are relatively protected.
Endothelial cell (EC) activation by d-flow is an early step in atherosclerosis, and it is known that ECs exposed to
d-flow show higher levels of inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence. We have recently shown
that ZBTB46 is a flow regulated transcription factor in ECs, is down-regulated by d-flow, and that its
overexpression in ECs inhibits proliferation. While the role of ZBTB46 in atherosclerosis is not known, our
preliminary studies suggest that ZBTB46 regulates a number of genes in ECs potentially involved in
atherosclerosis, including P21 and SFRP2. We propose to test the overall hypothesis that decreased ZBTB46
expression in ECs in response to d-flow leads to downstream changes in EC gene expression including
decreased P21 and SFRP2 gene expression, promoting EC activation, apoptosis, and senescence, and
consequently a focal predisposition to atherosclerosis. We address three specific aims for this project: 1)
Determine the downstream targets of ZBTB46 involved in flow regulated EC proliferation. First by combining loss
of function and gain of function methods and various flow conditions, we will determine if P21 and/or SFRP2 are
responsible for the inhibitory effect of ZBTB46 on EC proliferation seen under s-flow. We will also test if P21 and
SFRP2 are direct or indirect targets of ZBTB46. Finally, to identify other potential targets of ZBTB46 as a
transcription factor, we will use ChIP-seq in ECs expressing ZBTB46, and use the data to test the role of other
potential downstream targets of ZBTB46 that could be involved in atherosclerosis in the future. 2) Determine the
role of flow regulated ZBTB46 on EC apoptosis, senescence, and inflammation. We will test if EC-ZBTB46
expression affects these aspects of EC function which are seen in atheroprone areas exposed to d-flow, by using
siRNA and adenovirus mediated overexpression of ZBTB46 under s-flow and d-flow conditions in conjunction
with relevant stimuli such as hydrogen peroxide and TNFa. 3) Determine the effect of EC-ZBTB46 on
atherosclerosis in vivo. As ZBTB46 is also expressed in classical dendritic cells which are known to affect
atherosclerosis, our team has developed hyperlipidemic EC-targeted ZBTB46-KO mice. Using these mice in
experimental models of atherosclerosis, we will determine if loss of ZBTB46 specifically in EC contributes to the
flow mediated susceptibility to atherosclerosis by promoting EC apoptosis, senescence, and/or inflammation.
Successful completion of our aims will potentially find a novel regulator of EC functions contributing to
atherosclerosis and may identify novel potential therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis."
10863834,"Abstract / Project Summary
The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex three-dimensional milieu that has a profound
influence on synaptic plasticity and myelination during development. The pathways and cell types
driving ECM generation during brain development are poorly understood. This proposal investigates a
recently identified cellular pathway that controls ECM composition from the oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells (OPCs). This discovery was made through studies of the transcription factor THAP1, which is
mutated in the neurodevelopmental movement disorder DYT-THAP1 (DYT6) dystonia. Previous work
identified a critical role for THAP1 in developmental myelination. Loss of THAP1 in the oligodendrocyte
(OL) lineage impairs the progression of OPC into mature myelinating OLs. Recent work has established
that THAP1 mediates OL differentiation in large part by controlling the composition of secreted
chondroitin sulfate (CS) GAGs, a class of long unbranched polysaccharides and core-constituents of
the ECM, which are inhibitory to OL differentiation. The hypothesis that OPCs regulate ECM
composition is new, and the transcription factor THAP1, together with its partner YY1, provides an
inroad to delineating the cellular mechanisms that regulate ECM composition during CNS development.
The proposed studies will establish a molecular understanding of the regulation of ECM and myelination
by THAP1. Aim 1 will use ChIP-seq and transcriptomic studies to test the hypothesis that THAP1 and
its co-regulatory transcription factor YY1 regulate GAG metabolism through a shared pathway in
differentiating OPCs. Both transcription factors have established roles in myelination and cause human
dystonia when mutated. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that OPCs are important contributors to
developmentally regulated CS-GAG composition of the brain ECM and define the relative contribution
of other CNS cell types, and the role of THAP1 in this process. Aim 3 test the hypothesis that THAP1-
dependent OL maturation is required for normal motor learning and define THAP1-dependent changes
in ECM pathway genes induced by motor learning. These studies will advance our understanding of
the mechanisms by which glia and ECM contribute to CNS motor function and will shed light on how
disruption of these processes contribute to pathogenesis of dystonia and other neurodevelopmental
disorders."

This is the second competitive renewal of a grant application to identify the pathophysiology and treatment of
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a disease characterized by granulomatous lesions with characteristic
clonal CD207+ CD1a+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) with activating somatic mutations in MAPK pathway
genes, most notably BRAFV600E. Clinical presentations are highly variable, from self-resolving single lesions to fatal
disseminated disease. Optimal therapeutic strategies for patients with LCH remain a major unmet need. We propose
to define the roles of cell of origin, differentiation of cells harboring activating MAPK pathway mutations, and the
impact of target tissue on pathogenesis in order to identify and test novel therapeutic strategies to improve
outcomes for patients with LCH. The overall goal of expanding on this collaborative research program is to
define pathogenic mechanisms and identify and test therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes of patients with
LCH.
Specific Aim 1:
To determine the roles of cell of origin, age, MAPK mutation, and microenvironment (ME)
on extent of disease. Building on previous studies, we propose to test the relative role of the cell of origin of the
MAPK mutation and hematologic and stroma microenvironment in target tissues in defining extent of disease
and clinical phenotype.
Specific Aim 2: To identify the contribution of cellular senescence program to LCH pathogenesis and
clinical outcomes. The finding that BRAF mutation in early HPC leads to LCH disease led us to explore why
and how early HPC expressing BRAFV600E mutations can lead to LCH lesions in the periphery. Strikingly, we
found that BRAF mutations in HPC induce a senescence program that enhances mouse and human HPC
differentiation into LCH-like cells. We found that BRAF-mutated HPC and LCH cells expressed canonical
senescence program including high levels of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN2a, the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-xL,
increased mTOR activity and senescence associated secretory proteins (SASP) that promote the accumulation
of long lived inflammatory LCH-like cells in tissues. Therefore, we will test the contribution of the senescence
program to LCH disease outcome.
Specific Aim 3: To test the benefit of senolytic drugs in LCH treatment. We will test the therapeutic potential
of two senolytic therapies including BH3 mimetics alone and in combination with chemotherapy and MAPK
inhibition for LCH."

The South Carolina Biomedical Data Science and Informatics for Health Equity Research (SC BIDS4HEALTH)
training program seeks to train informaticists and data scientists to address health disparities, via engagement
with local communities, using telehealth services and informatics tools to improve access, through interoperability
and enhanced health information exchange, through improved healthcare quality (particularly in rural and critical
access hospitals) and through novel, health disparities focused e-health innovations. Given that chronic illnesses
underlie health disparities in South Carolina, the development of our curriculum is based on application of the
Wagner model of chronic illness care to address healthcare related disparities through informatics to make chronic
care for those with disparities more available and effective. This model provides a framework to enhance health
systems for those at risk of disparities, using informatics and data science driven approaches to improve health of
at-risk individuals through more effective, patient-centric healthcare. The SC BIDS4HEALTH builds on an
existing joint Clemson University – Medical University of South Carolina PhD program in Biomedical Data Science
and informatics and that involves faculty who are nationally and internationally recognized leaders in biomedical
informatics, public health, computer science and engineering, and multiple biomedical and health domains. We
leverage many existing resources and partnerships to enable curriculum that both provides state-of-the-art
training and makes a notable impact on South Carolina communities, especially those that are medically
underserved. Through these same partnerships, we create pathways into our program from local historically
black colleges and universities. We hypothesize that systematic training in SC BIDS4HEALTH is achieved by
(Aim 1) synthesizing new didactic curricula building on the foundations of Biomedical Informatics, Data Science,
and Population Health to achieve understanding of how these concepts can be applied in rural and underserved
populations, to advance health and alleviate health disparities; (Aim 2) developing new immersive practical and
research experiences in affected communities to allow for direct trainee interactions and measurable impactful
research outcomes; (Aim 3) providing teaching experiences to the pre-doctoral trainees and promote exposure
of HBCU students to biomedical data science and informatics research and careers; and (Aim 4) developing a
new postdoctoral training program. We further propose to (Aim 5) evaluate the careers and community impact
of the SC BIDS4HEALTH training program. The predoctoral program is 2 to 3 years in length, while the length of
the postdoctoral program is 1 year with possibility of renewal for another year. At full capacity, this program will
simultaneously support 10 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees across Clemson and MUSC."
10863839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The aim of this R35 application is to develop a high quality, translational research program in inflammation-
induced endothelial damage and organ dysfunction. Dysregulation of microvascular function contributes to the
pathophysiology of indirect organ injury after trauma. In particular, damage to the endothelial glycocalyx occurs
within minutes of traumatic injury and is associated with increased microvascular permeability resulting in multi-
organ failure and increased mortality. Strategies that attenuate glycocalyx disintegrity by preventing its cleavage
and/or facilitating its repair hold significant promise for minimizing microvascular dysfunction and post-traumatic
organ injury. The long-term objective of our research program is to establish basic science and translational
studies that focus on the identification of novel therapeutic targets that will (1) prevent glycocalyx damage, (2)
repair glycocalyx integrity or (3) inhibit dysregulation of endothelial cell permeability that occurs as a result of
glycocalyx disintegrity. The specific programmatic areas of focus will include studies to identify the role of
heparanase in regulating glycocalyx (dis)integrity after trauma-hemorrhage and on mechanisms that mediate
glycocalyx synthesis. Additionally, our proposed studies will identify signaling pathways that regulate endothelial
barrier function that are effected by loss of cell surface glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid,
which are primary constituents of the glycocalyx layer. Our research program will focus on the endothelial cell-
specific response to trauma-hemorrhage in organ systems that are most susceptible to secondary injury (e.g.,
kidney, lung and intestines) with the over-arching goal of determining how resuscitation strategies mediate
glycocalyx-dependent mechanisms in each organ. These programmatic areas of research hold promise for
significantly impacting the current resuscitation paradigm for patients in hemorrhagic shock by aiding in the
discovery of novel therapeutic targets that can be used to inhibit glycocalyx dysfunction, facilitate its repair or
reverse the downstream consequences of glycocalyx disintegrity."
10862482,"Warfarin is an anticoagulant that prevents venous and arterial clots but doubles the risk of major hemorrhage.
Over the past decade, warfarin use has caused more medication-related emergency department visits among
older Americans than any other drug. Our long-term goal is to improve the safety and effectiveness of
antithrombotic therapy. To advance this goal, we have developed clinical and pharmacogenetic (PGx)
dosing algorithms to guide days 1–5 of warfarin dosing and placed them on a non-profit web application
(WarfarinDosing.org) that has been accessed more than 1.8 million times. This success provides the
rationale for the proposed study: that algorithm-based dosing of warfarin reduces the risks of overdose and
iatrogenic hemorrhage compared to trial-and-error dosing. Because the rate of warfarin overdose is highest
between approximately 6-28 days of therapy, we will use penalized regression and machine learning (ML) to
develop warfarin-dosing algorithms for this interval. To promote use of the new algorithms, we will configure
the electronic health record (EHR) used at 23 medical centers in MO and IL to export data into
WarfarinDosing.org, seamlessly providing clinicians with clinical decision support to guide warfarin initiation.
Aim 1: To use linear regression to develop clinical and PGx dosing models for days 6–28 of warfarin therapy.
To balance accuracy and parsimony, we will use penalized regression to elucidate relationships between the
therapeutic dose and anthropomorphic, clinical, demographic, laboratory, and genetic variables. We have
data collected from 3107 participants in 3 randomized clinical trials.
Aim 2: To use ML to develop clinical and PGx dosing models for days 6–28 of warfarin therapy.
Aim 3: To validate the models developed in Aims 1 and 2. We will quantify the accuracy of the models
developed in Aims 1 and 2 in a set-aside 20% testing sample using mean absolute error (MAE) and
secondary metrics (e.g. R2). We hypothesize that the best clinical and PGx models developed in Aims 1 or 2
will predict the therapeutic warfarin dose with MAEs < 1.0 mg/d in the testing sample.
Aim 4: To update and expand WarfarinDosing.org to provide clinical decision support based on the best
clinical and PGx models validated in Aim 3. WarfarinDosing.org will be revised to interface with Epic (Epic
Systems Corp, WI), the EHR used across our 23 medical centers in MO and IL. We hypothesize that
integrating its use with Epic will decrease the rate of the composite outcome of a warfarin overdose or a
hemorrhage as compared to historic rates among patients starting warfarin.
The proposed research is innovative and significant because it uses penalized regression and ML to derive
novel PGx and clinical algorithms that will reduce the risk of overdose and iatrogenic hemorrhage from
warfarin initiation. The integration of Epic and WarfarinDosing.org will be a sustainable and scalable
intervention to improve the safety of anticoagulant therapy."

MOUNT SINAI’S CoFAR CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER
Food allergy is estimated to affect approximately 8% of children and 10% of adults; in the US this translates to
32 million people. Food allergy is potentially life-threatening, significantly impacts quality of life and nutrition,
and carries a high economic burden. Although significant advances have been made for prevention and therapy,
prevalence rates remain high and therapeutic options are few. The long-term goals of CoFAR are to develop
effective strategies to prevent and treat food allergies, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. As the
leadership center (LC) for CoFAR from 2005 to 2015, and as a CoFAR Clinical Research Center (CRC) for 17
years, we are the only CRC to have contributed to every CoFAR study, trial, and supplemental projects, with
leadership roles in 9 projects, including the current SUNBEAM birth cohort study. The objectives of CoFAR CRCs
is to conduct network-wide studies and trials and center-specific projects to advance knowledge, management
and treatment across a range of food-allergic diseases, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. The Mount
Sinai CRC team has been successfully and safely conducting food allergy research since 1997. The CRC PI,
Scott Sicherer, MD, brings broad experience having been site PI for all of the past CoFAR interventional trials,
as well as being Protocol Chair of the CoFAR observational study and Co-Chair of SUNBEAM. Co-Investigators
Drs. Wang and Bunyavanich (who serves as chair for the SUNBEAM biosampling program) have served as
successful PIs on clinical trials. Early stage investigators on the team will benefit from their involvement to
become the next generation of leaders in food allergy research. Our CRC laboratories have been the central
biomarker facility for CoFAR and easily manage biological samples at the direction of the LC. The CRC is located
in Manhattan, with access to an extensive base of potential participants; it has safely conducted >30,000 oral
food challenges and has a superb record of study recruitment and retention. To increase opportunities to
contribute to CoFAR’s goals, a Network-wide clinical trial is proposed to improve safety and allow dietary
incorporation of common allergens; preliminary data suggest that potentially half of people living with IgE-
mediated food allergy may benefit. Two site-specific studies will inform improving diversity, equity and inclusion
in food allergy research, and inform pathogenesis and course of food allergy through a novel, non-invasive
approach. In summary, the Mount Sinai CoFAR CRC brings extensive resources and experience to ensure that
the goals of CoFAR, at the direction of the LC, Steering Committee and NIAID, are met."
10827543,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The global injury burden is disproportionately concentrated in low and middle income countries. This
project, named ICREATE: Injury Capacity in Research in EAsTern Europe, expands on five successful years
of building injury research and education capacity in the countries of Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova. These
countries are strategic global priorities due to their political and economic ties to the Middle East, Russia,
and Europe. Through a European Union TEMPUS grant, our partner institutions established MPH programs
in 2010, but at that time no programs had injury or violence course content or research. After our first cycle
of funding, all MPH programs, as well as one new undergraduate program in Moldova, have injury content in
the core curricula. We have built data capacity through the establishment of an 8-hospital emergency
department trauma registry and an NIH-funded prospective brain injury registry; these databases have been
used for student projects, and trainee publications and presentations. In our first cycle, we trained 40 MPH
students, 9 PhD students, mentored 43 experiential learning projects, and published 13 papers.
 In the next funding cycle, we propose the following aims: train a critical mass of researchers from
Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova to conduct innovative research; facilitate the transition of trainees to
positions of leadership; develop our partner institutions as sustainable centers of excellence in injury
research and education; and, engage partners to translate research into effective prevention and treatment
programs. Our original topic areas of focus on road traffic injury, interpersonal violence, and acute care will
be expanded to include alcohol use, and we will expand our methodologic focus on data and analytic
capacity to include implementation science. Our program will prioritize MPH and PhD training to build
research and leadership skills focused on injury and violence prevention. Through a credit-sharing
agreement, trainees will be able to study at multiple institutions during their degree program. Now that
partner institutions have implemented injury curricula, PhD degree training will shift from the University of
Iowa to partner countries. Our Injury Prevention Summer Course, previously hosted at the University of
Babes-Bolyai, will now circulate between partner institutions, taught by trainee alumni appointed as faculty.
Partner countries will continue to host annual research symposia to highlight trainee research and to
promote the field of injury and violence research. We plan for these activities to build sustainable research
and education capacity that will lead to reductions in the burden of traumatic injuries and violence.

10890885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that causes severe disease in immunocompromised
individuals (e.g., AIDS patients) and fetuses. Its abilities to proliferate inside all nucleated cells and establish an
infection in almost all warm-blooded animals make the parasite an ideal model to study the mechanisms
involving in host-pathogen interaction. The outcome of Toxoplasma infection varies between host species. For
example, mice generally succumb to acute Toxoplasma infection while most non-murine hosts, such as rats
and humans, usually do not display symptoms but the chronic infection is established. As one of the cell types
determining the infection outcome, macrophages play an essential role in the early innate immune response
against Toxoplasma and coordinate the adaptive immune response. To successfully establish infection,
Toxoplasma co-opts host macrophages via parasite effectors secreted from its unique secretory organelles
(e.g., rhoptry and dense granule), named ROPs and GRAs, respectively. The role of Toxoplasma effectors has
been predominantly studied in murine macrophages, however, the effectors contributing to the infection in rat
and human macrophages are mostly unknown. My previous studies, together with preliminary data of this
project, identified several Toxoplasma effectors that specifically modulate the innate immune response in rat
but not murine macrophages. My central hypothesis is that Toxoplasma secretes a different set of parasite
effectors involved in the modulation of various innate immune responses to establish an infection in
macrophages from non-murine hosts. The goals during the K99 mentored phase are: 1) to understand the
mechanism of Toxoplasma effector-mediated activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome in rat macrophages; 2) to
mechanistically determine the role of Toxoplasma effectors that are required for parasite proliferation in naïve
rat macrophages. In the independent R00 phase, I will apply the training from the mentored phase to study the
interaction between Toxoplasma effectors and the innate immune response in human macrophages.
Specifically, I will identify fitness-conferring Toxoplasma secreted effectors and mainly determine parasite
effector-regulated host transcriptional responses in human macrophages. To accomplish these goals, valuable
training from a highly complementary mentor team with scientific and mentoring skills will guide my path to an
independent researcher. Furthermore, I will develop my leadership skills and strengthen my technical skills
through the proposed training. Collectively, the completion of this project will enhance our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms controlling host susceptibility to Toxoplasma infection. Also, knowing the parasite
effectors important for host modulation will provide better drug targets against toxoplasmosis."
10824671,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Obesity and its comorbidities pose an ever-increasing challenge to public health
despite massive investments in pharmacologic, surgical, and lifestyle-modifying therapeutic strategies. New
strategies are needed to alleviate the worsening metabolic health of the national and global populations. One
promising strategy is to harness the innate calorie-burning properties of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a
metabolic organ specialized for the conversion of chemical energy to heat. Although active BAT is highly
correlated with metabolic health in humans, its overall prevalence is low and declines with age and obesity.
BAT-targeted therapeutics will thus require the generation of increased BAT mass. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the physiologic development of BAT. BAT derives from the dermomyotome (DM), a multipotent
embryonic tissue that also gives rise to skeletal muscle and dermis. The goal of the current proposal is to
define the embryonic progenitor cells in the DM-to-BAT lineage and identify the molecular mechanisms
controlling the specification and differentiation of brown adipocytes. Preliminary work has identified candidate
progenitor cell populations marked by expression of Cdh4 and Dpp4, respectively, and confirmed that these
cell populations derive from the DM. The first aim of this proposal will employ adipogenic differentiation assays
and lineage tracing to determine whether Cdh4+ and Dpp4+ cells develop into brown adipocytes in vitro and in
vivo. In addition to their potential role as progenitor cells, Dpp4+ cells encapsulate developing BAT and
express several signaling molecules, including the brown adipogenic factor BMP7, that may regulate BAT
development. Preliminary studies show that GATA6, a transcription factor expressed in Dpp4+ cells, is
essential for embryonic BAT development. The signaling genes most enriched in Dpp4+ cells are regulated by
GATA6 in other developmental contexts, suggesting that GATA6 may promote BAT development by regulating
signaling in Dpp4+ cells. Thus, the second aim of this proposal will test the hypothesis that Dpp4+ cells secrete
BMP7 and other signaling factors in a GATA6-dependent manner to promote BAT development. Completion of
the proposed work will elucidate the developmental trajectory and molecular mechanisms underlying BAT
development, uncovering new cellular and molecular targets for BAT-directed therapeutic interventions.
Importantly, the fellowship applicant conducting these studies, Ethan Fein, will obtain rigorous research training
that is integrated with his clinical training as a student in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). His
training goals will be accomplished through a comprehensive training plan developed by Ethan and his
sponsor, Dr. Patrick Seale. Ethan will benefit from the outstanding training environment provided by the Seale
lab, the MSTP, and the University of Pennsylvania as a whole. The research training plan outlined in this
fellowship application will maximize Ethan's potential to develop into a successful physician-scientist."
10824677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) comprise a group of neurodegenerative diseases
characterized by progressive decline of cognitive, behavioral, and/or motor function. These conditions place a
significant burden on patients, families, and the healthcare system. Among the ADRDs is frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), with approximately half of FTD cases characterized pathologically by frontotemporal lobar
degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMEM106B are
known to alter risk of FTLD-TDP. TMEM106B is a protein localized to late endosomes and lysosomes and has
been reported to play a role in endolysosomal trafficking and brain myelination. Only one TMEM106B SNP
causes a coding change, altering the amino acid at position 185 from threonine to serine (T185S). The TT185
haplotype is associated with significantly increased risk of FTLD-TDP relative to SS185. The SNP is also in high
linkage disequilibrium with other TMEM106B SNPs, marking the coding change as a potential mechanism behind
TMEM106B’s modulation of disease risk. The coding SNP of TMEM106B has not been studied extensively,
though the coding change has been reported to alter protein half-life and autophagic flux in the cell. Recently,
four groups published the discovery of TMEM106B amyloid fibrils in sarkosyl-insoluble cortical lysates across a
range of neurodegenerative diseases, including FTLD-TDP. In preliminary studies, we have observed that
accumulation of TMEM106B fibrils is positively associated with the TT185 haplotype. We speculate that the
TMEM106B risk haplotype drives fibril formation and endolysosomal dysfunction, both of which contribute to
neuron loss in disease. The studies outlined in this proposal will characterize the biological consequences of
TMEM106B fibril formation in the diseased human brain and investigate TMEM106B haplotype-specific
differences in endolysosomal function in a new cell model system. In Aim 1, we will identify protein interactors of
TMEM106B fibrils in postmortem FTLD-TDP and non-diseased brains to test the hypothesis that TMEM106B
fibrils exhibit disease-specific interactions that drive neuron loss. In Aim 2, mechanistic studies will be performed
in novel, isogenic iPSC-derived neuron models stably expressing TMEM106B coding variants to test the
hypothesis that the TMEM106B risk haplotype impairs endolysosomal function. We will also assess mechanistic
relationships between TMEM106B and top interactors identified in Aim 1, and how they may vary with
TMEM106B haplotype. We anticipate that this work will help identify novel protein targets to investigate or target
for therapeutic development."

Womer will learn key skills in clinical epidemiology and health services research, while writing a K23 award and
ultimately becoming an independent physician-scientist designing predictive tools and interventions to help
identify and assist patients at risk for impaired recovery from respiratory illness.
Clinical Problem to be Addressed: Financial toxicity affects patients suffering from a variety of acute and
chronic conditions, and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The prevalence and risks associated with
financial toxicity in pneumonia are not known but are likely significant.
Candidate Background: Dr. Womer is a fellow in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. He
received his MD from Temple University. To date he has published 8 original peer-reviewed manuscripts, one
as first author. He will be presenting his current work at the American Thoracic Society 2023 meeting. His
department has a strong commitment to his academic career, including placing him on a T32 grant and funding
a year-long training program in clinical investigation.
Career Development Plan: In order to achieve these goals, he proposes to develop expertise in
statistics through a combination of mentored learning, investigative research work, and formal coursework to
obtain a Master of Health Science (MHS) degree from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Mentors: His primary mentor is Dr. Theodore J. Iwashyna at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who has
served as the primary mentor on 8 K-awards (5 of whom have transitioned to R01), including 5 individual K
awards, and as co-mentor on another 5. His co-mentor is Dr. Michelle Eakin, who has several NIH grants and
won awards for her mentorship of many fellows and junior faculty.
Aims: Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1: to test whether new onset financial toxicity
due to pneumonia is associated with increased subsequent need for acute care; 2: to test whether new onset
financial toxicity due to pneumonia increases the risk of later disability.
Deliverables from Aims: His proposed Aims will lead to 3-4 publications with semiannual presentations at
institutional conferences and yearly presentations at national conferences. This proposal will constitute the
foundational work for a future K23 application to build a predictive model of which patients will suffer financial
toxicity and test the efficacy of possible interventions."
10931600,"Leptomeningeal (LM) metastases occur in a wide variety of hematologic and solid malignancies, including
leukemia, breast cancer (BC), and lung cancer. When LM metastases arise, they are almost always rapidly fatal,
causing severe neurologic symptoms and death within weeks to months. The molecular mechanisms that enable
LM metastasis have been poorly understood, and there are currently few targeted interventions to prevent or
treat this deadly disease complication. Our lab recently made the seminal discovery of a direct cell trafficking
pathway between the vertebral and calvarial bone marrow (BM) and the adjacent CNS LM. We initially
demonstrated this pathway in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models, showing that ALL cells invade
the central LM by migrating along the abluminal surface of emissary blood vessels that bridge the vertebral and
calvarial BM and subarachnoid spaces. These emissary blood vessels, whose basement membrane is highly
enriched in the extracellular matrix molecule laminin, pass from the BM through apertures in the vertebral or
calvarial bone to enter the LM. ALL cells crawl along the outside of this emissary vasculature by binding laminin
via cell surface integrin α6 laminin receptors, circumventing the blood brain barrier (BBB) to efficiently
metastasize to LM by this perivascular route. Subsequent work has shown that this direct cell trafficking pathway
between BM and LM is also used by immune cells to rapidly respond to CNS inflammation, although whether
this pathway is important for tumor-immune responses is unknown. It is also unknown whether continued tumor
integrin α6 interactions within the LM membranes, which highly express laminin, are important to sustain tumor
growth in the LM microenvironment. Our new data in mouse breast cancer (BC) LMD models show that
solid tumors can enter the LM through this novel BM-to-meninges perivascular migration pathway and
suggest that the high affinity laminin receptor, α6 integrin, is a critical target to prevent breast cancer
LMD. These data also demonstrate a crucial role for perivascular macrophages in promoting BC LMD.
Our proposal aims to further our understanding of the interplay between laminin-rich emissary vessels, meninges,
tumor cells, and immune cells in LM metastasis, in order to expose novel approaches to augment therapeutic
responses in the “sanctuary” of the LM. Through cutting-edge spatial transcriptomic analyses and real-time in
vivo imaging approaches, our work will also create an unprecedented understanding of the tumor
microenvironment of the LM niche, and how this laminin-rich environment contributes to disease survival and
proliferation. Finally, we will seek to translate these discoveries into clinical practice through an understanding of
how integrin α6 blockade can be used to prevent and treat LMD in preclinical models of BC LM metastasis. Our
approach represents a shift in the treatment paradigm for LMD, away from minimally effective cytotoxic therapies

Vision begins in photoreceptor cells with light activation of the visual pigment, rhodopsin, which triggers a
transduction cascade to produce the cellular electrical response. A wide range of blinding disorders have been
associated with mutations in rhodopsin. From these, mutations of Glycine 90 to Aspartate (G90D) and to Valine
(G90V) have been reported to cause congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP),
respectively. Structural and biochemical in vitro studies have shown that the G90D/G90V mutations cause
rhodopsin destabilization that could interfere with normal light detection. However, despite decades of research,
the mechanisms by which these mutations cause vision loss remain unclear and effective treatments for people
with these mutations are not available. To address these questions, we have created G90D and G90V rhodopsin
knockin mice. We will perform comprehensive analysis of these mice to determine the phenotype of their rod
photoreceptors. These experiments will include morphological analysis and in vivo eletroretinography and single-
cell suction electrode recordings to determine the physiological properties of the mutant rods, combined with
microspectrophotometric and biochemical analysis to determine the molecular properties of the mutant mouse
rhodopsins (Aim 1). We will perform experiments to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the G90D
and G90V rhodopsins cause blindness by evaluating the stability of their covalent bonds between opsin and
chromophore, the binding and release of chromophore, and the equilibrium between chromophore-free and
chromophore-bound mutant opsins (Aim 2). Finally, we will also test the efficiency of genome editing for rescuing
the function of rods with the G90D or G90V rhodopsin mutations (Aim 3). Together, these experiments will
establish the unique disease mechanisms of two distinct human visual disorders caused by mutations in the
same residue of rhodopsin and will develop therapeutic approaches for reversing their effects that could
eventually be used in human clinical studies. Analyzing our G90D and G90V mutant mice side by side will also
help understand why these two similar mutations produce distinct clinical phenotypes."
10826278,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
For decades, the analysis of Alzheimer’s brain pathology has remained, by and large, unchanged, with the
detection of Aβ plaques and tau tangles representing the hallmarks features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that
are intimately linked to cognitive decline. This traditional analysis of AD brain is very qualitative and limited by
the slow and tedious “one-at-a-time” approach to detect individual markers of interest in the brain. This lack of
innovation has posed major limitations in achieving more rapid, comprehensive, and quantitative views of
dementia. Recently, a technology was developed called cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) imaging mass
cytometry (IMC) and its potential for translational applications, especially neurodegenerative diseases, is
remarkable. The reason for this is that we can now analyze all cell types and structures in a single
experimental design. We can also quantify and mine these data to provide spatial insights into how the brain
degenerates over time to establish a “brain signature” of aging and dementia. Such multiplexed analysis of a
large panel of human brain samples will provide rapid quantitative insights that will inform our understanding of
AD pathophysiology. In this study, we developed a “brain vulnerability and resilience” panel suitable for probing
mouse and human brains, with particular emphasis on immune factors that have been implicated in AD. By
probing their abundance, cell-type specific accumulation, and spatial proximity in relation to plaques and
tangles, we will provide global insight into AD progression. We hypothesize that the ensemble of spatial
information, gleaned from 45+ simultaneous markers of interest, will point to specific microglia subpopulations
that drive or suppress brain pathology. In Aim 1, we will generate a comprehensive brain signature of aging
and AD by employing IMC on a panel of human brains to derive in situ spatial information of brain health and
resilience, providing a thorough assessment of disease trajectories. The inclusion of normal aged brains will
also allow us to delineate the earliest stages of age-related brain changes, a timeframe that is more amenable
to eventual therapeutic interventions. We will then validate the emergence of these spatial signatures using
well characterized AD mouse models that show either slow- or fast-progression towards cognitive decline. In
Aim 2, we will develop an automated bioinformatics approach for multi-sample IMC data to segment brain cell
types and define their cellular microenvironments. We will also develop machine learning approaches to
summarize the spatial patterns and predict clinical outcomes. This proposal is a highly innovative merging of
unique experimental and computational strengths; it is significant since it represents a conceptual leap in how
we image, visualize, and quantify brain data; and it has enormous clinical implications, since it could highlight
multiplexed imaging coupled with predictive modeling to determine which patients transition from the normal to
diseased state. Given that immune mediators often circulate peripherally, our study provides a foundation for
the use of IMC to discover future biomarkers as readouts for immune dysfunction."
10826279,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the cellular mechanism and therapeutic potential of targeting
the serotonin-2B receptor (5-HT2B) to attenuate fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is the most
common monogenic heart disease and the most common cause of sudden death in young adults. A hallmark of
this disease is myocardial fibrosis, an early manifestation of HCM defined as pathological remodeling that leads
to heart wall stiffening and diastolic dysfunction. Due to the lack of knowledge on HCM disease emergence and
progression, there is an unmet need to identify new pathways and therapeutic opportunities targeting
fibrosis in HCM. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the primary cell type that contribute to fibrosis, as their function
to preserve the myocytes’ surrounding environment by degrading and synthesizing the extracellular matrix can
lead to pathological remodeling of the myocardium. Previous studies have antagonized 5-HT2B in
cardiopulmonary diseases and demonstrated a decrease in fibrosis; in a mouse model of myocardial infarction,
5-HT2B antagonism decreased both the fibrotic scar size and number of isotropic collagen fibers in the
myocardium, preventing the fibrotic remodeling process and preserving systolic and diastolic function. Our
preliminary data shows an increase in 5-HT2B expression in HCM patients and a correlation between 5-HT2B and
ANP, a marker of cardiac hypertrophy. In our hands, the 403/+ mouse model of familial HCM confirms an
increase in 5-HT2B expression and pro-fibrotic markers. Therefore, we hypothesize that ablating 5-HT2B
activity will attenuate fibrosis in HCM. To investigate this hypothesis, the following aims will be addressed. 1)
Clarify the CFs vs. cardiomyocytes contribution to attenuation of fibrosis in HCM through global and CF-specific
genetic ablation of 5-HT2B. This will be tested through the creation of two mouse models that provide both global
and CF-specific genetic deletion of 5-HT2B. 2) Test the therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT2B antagonism and subsequent
mechanical characterization of the cell type responsible for 5-HT2B – mediated fibrotic remodeling in HCM.
Collaboration with Dr. Craig Lindsley has led to the discovery of two novel compounds that are highly specific
for 5-HT2B and are systemically restricted from entering the brain. Following 5-HT2B antagonism, CFs will be
isolated and mechanically characterized for their proliferative, contractile, and migratory capabilities. The
training received throughout this fellowship will enable the candidate to conduct a successful project
that will enhance our understanding of the underlying pathology and therapeutic potential of 5-HT2B
antagonism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
10826361,"Project Summary/Abstract
Seizures, a reflection of extreme excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, are a common neurologic comorbidity in
individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) and are even more prevalent in syndromic
IDDs. Individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, are particularly
impacted, as over 90% of AS individuals experience seizures, in addition to other symptoms such as severe
intellectual disability, motor deficits, lack of speech, and sleep disruption. The recurrent seizures affecting AS
individuals are usually difficult to treat and sometimes deadly, yet clinical efforts to alleviate seizure burden have
been stymied by a lack of insight into ictogenic and epileptogenic mechanisms. I hypothesize that improved
understanding of the circuitry underlying seizures in AS model mice can be leveraged toward the development
of improved anti-epileptic therapies to address this unmet clinical need. This project builds upon previous work
from our laboratory demonstrating enhanced epileptogenesis in AS model mice that have undergone seizure
kindling, a process whereby repeated seizure inductions alter neural circuitry to increase seizure susceptibility.
Prominent neuropathology arises post-kindling in AS mice in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, making this
region a key mechanistic candidate. Moreover, we have found that deletion of Ube3a, the causative gene in AS,
from GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), but not somatostatin or vasoactive intestinal peptide,
drives seizure phenotypes. In the proposed project, I aim to elucidate the role of PV+ neurons in the seizure
susceptibility of AS model mice. Accordingly, in Aim 1, I will perform whole-cell slice electrophysiology to
determine how the intrinsic firing properties of PV+ neurons in the dentate gyrus differ between AS and wild-type
mice, and whether these properties favor hyperexcitability in AS model mice following seizure kindling. In Aim 2,
I will selectively reinstate Ube3a in PV+ cells to assess whether this confers resilience to kindling and prevents
hippocampal histopathology. These experiments will provide important information at the cellular and circuit
levels regarding how loss of Ube3a promotes seizure, potentially inspiring new treatments for AS and other
epilepsy disorders. In addition to providing novel insights into circuit mechanisms of hyperexcitability, this project
will provide the applicant with excellent training in slice electrophysiology (Philpot and Manis), confocal
microscopy and image analysis (Itano), and the care of pediatric epilepsy patients (Yang), that will prepare him
well for a career as a physician-scientist."
10826362,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Myocardial infarction (MI) happens when the blood flow in one or more coronary vessels are blocked.
Due to the limited regenerative capability of the heart, this can lead to life-threatening heart failure (HF). End-
stage HF usually requires heart transplantation. Stem cells have been studied as promising therapeutics for
cardiac repair post-MI in numerous pre-clinical studies and a variety of clinical trials. However, the translation
of stem cell therapy for heart diseases from bench to bedside is still hampered by cell sources, cell viability,
uncertain delivery efficiency and immune rejection. It has been well established that many types of adult stem
cells exert their beneficial effects mainly through secretion of paracrine factors that promote endogenous heart
repair. In recent years, many in the field including our group have gravitated toward the study of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) released from stem cells, which contain the biologically active components and have
comparable therapeutic effects but minimal immunogenicity, suggesting the possibility of a promising
alternative to stem cell therapies. In the past 8 years, our group has been developing secretome and
exosomes (Exos; 30-150 nm extracellular vesicles)- based therapies for lung and heart diseases, and we have
successfully shown their therapeutic efficacy in several pre-clinical studies. Among them, transplantation of
lung spheroid cells (LSCs) has been advanced to a first-in-man clinical trial in patients with lung fibrotic disease
and LSC-secretome/exosome has recently been approved for ARDS-associated COVID-19. Given the safety
and great regenerative potential of LSC products, we performed RNA sequencing in LSC-Exos and found
various therapeutic miRNAs enriched in them. The most abundant of them, miR-100, were shown to benefit
neovascularization and heart function in several studies. However, most exosome therapies for MI treatment
have their intrinsic limitations, such as the safety and efficiency of delivery routes, deliberately hindered the
clinical feasibility. Moreover, since the half-life of Exos in vivo is short, repeated dosing of exosomes is required
for long-term heart treatment. Our main goal of current proposal is to develop inhalation delivery, as a
repeatable and noninvasive route that may boost the efficacy and translatability of LSC-Exo treatment to MI.
Aim 1. Establish the therapeutic benefits of repeated inhalation delivery of LSC-Exo in a mouse model of MI.
Aim 2. Explore and validate the mechanism of action in LSC-Exo inhalation treatment. Aim 3. Determine the
safety and efficacy of LSC-Exo inhalation treatment in a clinically-relevant porcine model of MI. The
development of inhalable cell-free therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize current regenerative medicine
practice. The results of this project, if successful, are expected to dramatically impact current treatment options
for MI patients. These studies will help validate the use of inhalable exosomes as a new therapeutic modality
for heart disease, and lay the ground for future IND-enabled human trials."
10826504,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In this proposal we will address one of the major unanswered questions in vision: the mechanism
of rhodopsin delivery and loading into new photoreceptor discs. This perpetual process is
particularly robust in rods where, for mammals, the daily delivery of 30 million rhodopsins supports
the formation of 80 new discs in each rod. While rhodopsin synthesis and delivery to the rod apical
region has been intensively studied, almost nothing is known about what happens afterward, thus
representing a critical knowledge gap. Roadblocks to under-standing this process include the
complexity of the inner segment-outer segment interface that is below the resolution limit of
fluorescence microscopy and the limitations of prior approaches that relied almost exclusively on
static analyses in fixed tissues. To overcome these roadblocks, we have implemented live-cell 3D
super resolution single particle tracking microscopy (3D-sptPALM) to directly examine the
dynamics of individual rhodopsins within discrete photoreceptor compartments in real time. We
will exploit a key mouse model, the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse, which allows us to
intentionally vary the level of outer segment membrane complexity while retaining the
photoreceptor cilium. Our preliminary results show the entry of individual rhodopsins into
photoreceptor cilia, their transport along the cilium and, remarkably, their exit back into the inner
segment, for the very first time.
We will address the following fundamental questions:
Aim 1: How does rhodopsin enter (and exit) the photoreceptor cilium?
Aim 2: How is rhodopsin transported within photoreceptor cilia?
Aim 3: How are rhodopsins loaded into new discs?"
10826786,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sleep is a substantial yet understudied contributor to metabolic health, with measures of poor sleep associated
with increased adiposity and metabolic risk markers in youth. Dysregulation of energy homeostasis, the body’s
ability to actively maintain a steady internal state despite external disruptions, is a primary contributor to
metabolic risk. The hypothalamus is a key brain region responsible for regulating major aspects of both energy
and sleep homeostasis via neuroendocrine signaling. In compelling studies in rodents, inadequate sleep was
shown to induce proinflammatory pathways, including hypothalamic inflammation, and led to impaired glucose
tolerance. These animal studies also linked poor sleep to alterations in neuroendocrine signaling and a decrease
in insulin sensitivity, suggesting that hypothalamic inflammation and impaired neuroendocrine signaling may
represent an important mechanistic link between sleep and metabolic risk. While prior work shows associations
between poor sleep and adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in youth, existing studies in
children are limited
because they are cross sectional in nature, have not examined
prospective brain and
metabolic trajectories, do not include objective naturalistic measures of sleep such as actigraphy, and lack
rigorous measures of insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis1,10
. The work proposed here will address these
limitations and will test for the first time in humans whether poor sleep is associated with longitudinal brain MRI
markers of hypothalamic inflammation and impaired hypothalamic nutrient signaling as well as longitudinal
increases in adiposity, insulin resistance, and/or glucose dysregulation in children. The overall objective of this
study is to translate these important findings in animal models into studies in children. The central hypothesis is
that poor sleep is associated with longitudinal impairments hypothalamic signaling, and increases in metabolic
risk during childhood. Utilizing an animal to human translational approach, we will leverage the established
BrainChild Cohort of 200 children (R01DK116858; MPI: Drs. Page & Xiang) ages 7-10 with measures of sleep
(duration, quality, and timing variability), neuroimaging, and metabolic data measured longitudinally over 2 years
to assess the following specific aims: the relationship between indices of sleep (measured with accelerometry)
and: (1) MRI based markers of hypothalamic inflammation and hypothalamic nutrient signaling; (2) measures of
adiposity, insulin resistance, and measures of glucose homeostasis from oral glucose tolerance tests (insulin
sensitivity, beta cell function); (3) to explore the hypothalamic markers as a possible mechanism linking poor
sleep to increases in metabolic risk in childhood. This proposal seeks to fill critical gaps in knowledge by studying
children at an early age (7-10 years) and following them longitudinally to provide insights into the potential
mechanisms and pathways linking poor sleep characteristics to obesity risk. This work could lead to clinical trials
to test sleep modification as an important target for prevention of obesity and diabetes during childhood, a
sensitive time period of development when interventions may have large and lasting benefits for long-term health.
The outstanding inter-disciplinary mentorship team assembled in this proposal will provide rigorous training for
a future career as independent investigator. Long-term training opportunities and goals include obtaining a
competitive post-doctoral position on the topic of sleep modification during childhood, which could be a potential
valuable tool towards obesity prevention."
10826789,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a form of brain cancer with no cure and a five-year survival rate below 10%.
Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) have shown great promise in other solid tumors
but have demonstrated no clinical benefits for GBM patients. In part due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment that inhibits T cell activation and infiltration. There is consequently an urgent unmet need to
engineer new immunotherapies for GBM. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a promising target for cancer
immunotherapy. RIG-I is an RNA sensing pattern recognition receptor in the cytosol that leads to downstream
production of type I interferon, which can lead to CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumors. However, RNA delivery to
the cytosol is a challenge because the negative charge of RNA prevents internalization. Therapeutics that
activate RIG-I have been demonstrated to improve response to ICB in several preclinical models of solid tumors
but have yet to be explored in GBM. This proposal aims to design and test a biomaterial therapy that locally
delivers a RIG-I agonist, 5’-triphosphorylated double-stranded RNA (3pRNA), via a polymeric nanocarrier to elicit
a pro-inflammatory response in mouse models of GBM. RIG-I is an unstudied target for treating GBM, and we
will deliver a unique stem-loop 3pRNA (SLR) to activate the pathway. SLR will be delivered in pH responsive
nanocarriers that destabilize the endosome and release SLR into the cytosol. An α-CD11b nanobody will be
conjugated to the nanoparticle to drive uptake by antigen presenting cells, including resident microglia and
infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages. We propose two specific aims to 1) Engineer RANs for GBM
immunotherapy and 2) determine their immunological consequences. We will test the aims using the
following experiments: Aim 1) SLR will be covalently conjugated to polymeric nanoparticles, followed by click
chemistry to attach an α-CD11b nanobody. We will verify RNA activity and uptake in vitro using interferon reporter
cell lines and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. The efficacy of our engineered nanoparticles will be tested in
the GL261 and CT2A immunocompetent models of GBM using intracranial injection of the nanoparticles. We will
determine if combination therapy with ICB leads to enhanced efficacy, as RIG-I activating nanoparticles will
create a more immunogenic tumor microenvironment. Aim 2) Studies will determine the immunological
mechanism of treatment. We will evaluate immune cell frequency and activation state in the tumor and brain.
We will determine T cell dependence, if infiltrating T cells are necessary for efficacy, and if therapy creates
memory T cells in the brain. We hypothesize that our polymer therapeutic will activate antigen presenting cells,
leading to CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor. This project will improve the knowledge in the field of
neuroimmunology through insight gained about the role of RIG-I activation in GBM. It will also enhance
knowledge in the field of materials engineering because we will learn information about the brain response to pH
reactive polymers, which can be applied to future therapies."

Osteoarthritis (OA), one of the leading causes of disability in the US, is characterized by cartilage degradation, synovitis,
and subchondral bone remodeling. While there are currently no treatments for OA, there is increasing evidence that
chronic low-level inflammation plays a role in driving disease progression. Inflammation during OA manifests as the
infiltration of joint tissues (especially the synovium and subchondral bone) by immune cells, including macrophages, T
cells, and NK cells. Although mechanisms driving synovial inflammation are currently an intense area of study, little is
known regarding how inflammation in the subchondral bone (SCB) occurs and its consequences on remodeling and
joint homeostasis. Recently, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory pathways have been implicated in OAassociated
synovitis, cartilage erosion, and bone remodelling. Our previous work demonstrated that mice deficient in
CD14, a TLR co-receptor, are partially protected from disease in a post-traumatic OA model. Specifically, CD14-
deficiency resulted in a significant reduction in SCB bone thickening and cartilage damage after joint-injury compared
to wild type mice, with the most substantial amelioration of the SCB pathology. OA bone pathology extends beyond
signs of remodeling, and also includes an increase in inflammatory cells in the bone marrow. 1bis inflammation may
contribute to pain in OA, but the mechanisms driving SCB inflammation are poorly studied. Thus, I propose that TLR
signalling in osteoclasts modulates the osteoclast secretome, resulting in osteoblastogenesis as well as T cell
migration. To explore this, I will first show in vitro that TLR signaling leads to the release of factors that are both proinflammatory
and osteoblastogenic (Aim 1 ). Next, I will use IMC to characterize the T cell landscape in the subchondral
bone of osteoarthritic mice and determine anatomic associations between T cells and osteoclasts 1 (Aim 2a). Lastly, I
plan to develop a novel osteoclast T cell migration assay to show that TLR signaling in osteoclasts increases proinflammatory
T cell migration (Aim 2b). Successful completion of these Aims will provide a better understanding of
the cellular and tissue-level changes that occur in the subchondral bone in OA, as well as new targets for therapeutic
intervention. I have collected a significant amount of preliminary data, motivating the direction of these aims and
showcasing the skillset and tools I have already become proficient in. Additionally, with the help of my mentors as well
as my collaborators Dr. Su and Dr. Liu, I have all the necessary expertise to ensure the successful completion of this
project."

from growth to stasis. We will: a) determine how PstP phosphorylation is affected by stresses in Mtb; b) identify
the key substrates of PstP and determine the activity of different PstP phospho-isoforms on each substrate; and

characterize the function and regulation of the catalytic activity of CwlM.

This proposal seeks continued funding to expand and enhance the IPUMS Health Surveys Project. IPUMS
Health Surveys provides streamlined access to core U.S. survey data on population health through two
integrated databases: the National Health Interview Survey (IPUMS NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey Household Component (IPUMS MEPS). The NHIS is the leading source of information on U.S. health,
health disparities, the social determinants of health, and health systems change; the MEPS is the primary source
of information on national trends and correlates in health care spending. The proposed project will further improve
this crucial resource for pathbreaking research in five ways: (1) Harmonization of redesigned NHIS. NHIS has
been significantly redesigned in 2019. Several aspects of the redesign represent major departures from past
practice and have implications for the comparability of the data over time. This project will create and modify
existing IPUMS NHIS data and metadata to accommodate these changes to the survey, including documenting
changes to the data collection procedures and data structure so users can develop analyses that bridge the
survey redesign period to the fullest extent possible. (2) Database expansion. This project will expand IPUMS
Health Surveys by integrating five new years of NHIS and MEPS survey data and documentation. In each year,
the surveys will add, drop, and modify questions. The proposed project will accommodate and document those
changes without losing detail. (3) MEPS enhancements. This project will enhance the IPUMS MEPS database
by incorporating data from the 1996-2023 medical conditions and event files, documenting relationships among
condition files, event files, and rounds and describing the relationships between the different file types and the
data already available through IPUMS MEPS in machine-readable metadata that will be used to create new
user-facing tools. (4) Data infrastructure and access improvement. The proposed project will enrich access to
the data with three new approaches: (a) design and implement a variable construction system on the IPUMS
MEPS website; (b) support online data analysis of the IPUMS MEPS data through a new online data tabulator;
and (c) develop an Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate programmatic access to MEPS and
NHIS data. (5) Dissemination. Through user support, training, and outreach activities, the proposed project will
attract new users and support continuing use of the IPUMS NHIS and IPUMS MEPS data. Along with conference
exhibits and presentations, introductory workshops, and timely answers to user queries, the project will provide
new introductory webinars, in-depth webinars covering specific topics, and two multiple-day workshops to train
early-career scholars to use IPUMS MEPS."
10839335,"The seemingly straightforward function of the centromere in directing chromosome segregation is difficult to
reconcile with multiple complexities of the underlying molecular machinery, particularly rapid evolution of both
centromere DNA and proteins and seemingly redundant pathways linking the DNA to spindle microtubules.
This project focuses on centromere drive as a key to unlocking centromere complexity. Selfish centromere
DNA sequences bias their transmission to the egg in female meiosis, while centromere proteins evolve to
suppress fitness costs of drive while maintaining essential centromere functions. Our recent work determined
how selfish centromeres interact with spindle microtubules to bias their segregation. We developed mouse
model systems exploiting natural variation in mouse centromere DNA, defined tubulin detyrosination as the key
post-translational modification creating meiotic spindle asymmetry, showed that microtubule-destabilizing
proteins act as drive effectors exploited by selfish centromeres, established an integrated model for both drive
and suppression, and sequenced Murinae genomes for molecular evolution analyses to identify rapidly
evolving centromere proteins. Our progress represents crucial steps towards understanding the centromere
drive conflict but leaves key gaps in our understanding of drive and suppression and centromere protein
evolution, which are addressed in this proposal. First, we will determine how selfish centromeres interact with
an asymmetric spindle to bias their segregation. Our previous findings suggest a hypothesis that we will test by
manipulating microtubule destabilizing activities at centromeres in live cells, using chemical optogenetic
approaches that we developed. Second, we will test whether genetically different centromeres differentially
recruit centromere proteins, a central but untested component of the centromere drive theory. Using hybrid
mouse zygotes with divergent maternal and paternal centromere satellite DNA sequences as a model system,
we will determine if rapidly evolving centromere protein interact differentially with different centromere DNA
sequences. Third, we will test for reproductive fitness costs associated with functional differences between
centromeres, taking advantage of our hybrid mouse model systems in which paired homologous chromosomes
in meiosis have divergent centromeres. Fourth, we will test the concept that centromere proteins have evolved
to suppress costs due to functional differences between centromeres, which has been the most challenging
part of the drive theory to address experimentally. With tractable experimental systems, a mechanistic model
for drive and suppression, and molecular evolution analyses of centromere proteins in place, we will address
this challenge by testing whether recurrent changes in rapidly evolving centromere proteins have functional
implications consistent with our model. Overall, by investigating centromeres in the context of genetic conflict,
this project represents a unique contribution to studies of chromosome segregation and inheritance, with broad
consequences for reproductive biology and chromosome evolution."

10839440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over the past several years, we have studied changes in critical blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junction
(TJ) proteins (i.e., claudin-5, occludin) in response to diseases or drugs. Our work has shown that claudin-5 and
occludin expression and trafficking is modulated by pain (i.e., TJ dysregulation), an effect that increases brain
uptake of opioids such as codeine. Our preliminary data show that acetaminophen (APAP) can modulate
expression of claudin-5 at the BBB and increase paracellular permeability (i.e., “leak”). Leak has previously been
shown to occur with low dose, acute cocaine administration as well as methamphetamine. Both APAP and pain
target transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β) signaling, a pathway that controls TJ expression and BBB integrity.
 In this grant, we hypothesize that APAP, by itself and in the setting of pain, can increase BBB
“leak” and enhance CNS opioid delivery. These studies are highly significant because they will uncover
mechanisms of altered opioid antinociception and adverse drug events that can occur in individuals
who abuse or misuse opioids or APAP. Additionally, APAP is taken with other centrally acting drugs
where “APAP leak” can lead to therapeutic toxicity.
 Aim 1: To investigate, in vivo, changes in TJ protein expression and trafficking at the BBB
following APAP administration. We will study how APAP alters CNS effects and adverse events of opioids.
We will investigate the time course of changes in transmembrane TJ protein (i.e., claudin-5, occludin) expression
and trafficking and the dose-response relationship of APAP on changes in TJ protein complexes in male and
female Sprague-Dawley rats (Aim 1A). We will then study the temporal relationship between CNS opioid
delivery, opioid-associated antinociception, respiratory depression, and opioid-associated reward behavior (Aim
1B). Since we have shown that transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β) signaling regulates BBB integrity, we will
study the role of this pathway on claudin-5 and occludin expression and trafficking (Aim 1C).
 Aim 2: To examine involvement of APAP on BBB integrity in pain. Using established in vivo pain
models (i.e., l-carrageenan-induced acute inflammatory pain, chronic pain spinal nerve ligation), we will study
the time course of APAP effects on TJ protein expression/trafficking (i.e., claudin-5, occludin) as well as on CNS
opioid uptake (Aim 2A). We will demonstrate effects of single versus multiple doses of APAP on TGF-β signaling
pathways in both pain models (Aim 2B). We will study how changes in CNS opioid delivery affect opioid
antinociception, respiratory depression, and opioid-associated reward behavior (Aim 2C). Since we have shown
that APAP increases functional expression of the critical opioid transporter P-glycoprotein, we will examine the
contribution of claudin-5/occludin modulation and P-gp changes to CNS opioid delivery (Aim 2D).
 Our group is uniquely positioned to provide a mechanistic explanation (i.e., signaling, activity,
trafficking) for adverse drug events in individuals who abuse/misuse prescription pain drugs."
10839462,"The balance of hepatic lipid synthesis, uptake, export and oxidation plays an important role in the progression
and pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and is particularly important for the growing incidence of
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the mechanisms governing the shift from normal metabolic
physiology to pathophysiology are poorly understood, particularly with respect to the role of lipid metabolism.
Our overall goal is to determine how the liver senses and responds to fluctuations in fatty acid availability to
facilitate key processes such as gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, and to understand how targeting lipid
metabolism could either protect or potentiate obesity, diabetes and NASH. We have developed multiple mouse
models that disrupt fatty acid catabolism at unique metabolic nodes in the liver. We have shown that although
all of these models exhibit fatty liver and exist in a putative linear pathway for the oxidation of fatty acids, they
exhibit surprisingly unique cellular and molecular phenotypes. These data demonstrate that both triglyceride
hydrolysis and fatty acid oxidation convey unique biochemical information to the hepatocyte to coordinate the
catabolism of fatty acids. To describe this unique fatty acid dependent regulatory code, we propose three
specific aims to 1) Determine the independent roles for triglyceride hydrolysis and fatty acid oxidation during
fasting, 2) Determine the independent and interdependent roles of triglyceride hydrolysis and fatty acid
oxidation in HFD-induced obesity and 3) Determine the role of fatty acid-dependent lysine acetylation in the
regulation of hepatic metabolism. Here we will use these models to understand the metabolic code by which
fatty acids affect the hepatic coordination of lipid metabolism."
10863825,"Despite recent advances, pancreatic cancer patients continue to have dismal outcomes thereby
underscoring the need for development of new therapeutic strategies. Recently, there has been
a resurgence in understanding the role played by stroma in supporting tumor growth and the
stroma- cancer cell cross talk continues to be a promising anti-cancer target. Previous research
has shown that NFκB, the master regulator of inflammation, is overexpressed in various cancer
cells, and its deletion in the pancreas leads to decreased tumor formation in genetically
engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer. However, the impact of NFκB signaling in
tumor stroma on pancreatic cancer growth is still unclear. Preliminary results from our lab
suggest that NFκB signaling in pancreatic cancer stroma is pro-tumorigenic and protects cancer
cells from T cell-dependent tumor elimination. Our in vitro studies and analysis of TCGA human
pancreatic cancer data suggest that CCL5 or RANTES may be one of the key cytokines that
mediates this pro- tumorigenic effect. In the current grant, we propose to corroborate our novel
findings and the overall aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms by which NFκB in
tumor stroma protects cancer cells from immune- mediated cell death. We are confident that the
successful completion of this study could provide new insights into the role played by stromal
NFκB/CCL5 in pancreatic cancer growth and metastases. These findings could be used to
enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy which, so far, has had limited success
against pancreatic cancer."
10863827,"Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from
Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical
data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care
provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state-
of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using
information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our
expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will
allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the
largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease,
atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1)
compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups,
2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established
clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e-
phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2
(RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family
history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of
phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk
communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock
RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs
intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient),
with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and
patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes):
Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of
RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical
care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of
clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The
primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by
ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct
analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results
changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization."
10863986,"Neuroinflammation has been recognized as an essential player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Recently, the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a
multimeric protein complex that tightly regulates the innate immune responses, has been suggested with
critical roles in AD development and progression. Dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for
the over production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, ultimately leading to inflammatory
responses and cell death. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome represents an attractive drug target for AD and offers
promise to provide effective disease modifying potential. Over the past several years, our team has
successfully developed novel small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome selective inhibitors (NSIs). We originally
reported NSIs with sulfonamide containing chemical scaffolds, and have established a small molecule library
containing > 200 compounds with various biological characteristics. Proof of concept studies of our 1st
generation lead NSI in transgenic AD mouse models demonstrated target engagement and in vivo efficacy to
reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive functions. Our recent medicinal chemistry campaign led to
the identification of new lead NSIs with significantly improved potency and binding affinity. Furthermore, our
accumulated structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have identified key structural features of the scaffolds
for further optimization. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that structural optimization of the current two
preclinical lead NSIs will be achieved by designing new viable analogs and isolating potent and orally available
NSIs with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (Aim 1), and that pharmacological suppression of the
NLRP3 inflammasome by our NSIs will mitigate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive functions in
preclinical AD animal models (Aim 2), which will be further evaluated by preclinical Investigational New Drug
(IND)-enabling studies (Aim 3) to advance to clinical studies. For our hypothesis, the goal of this application is
to accomplish preclinical IND-enabling studies on at least one candidate NSI and prepare for a meeting with
the FDA and subsequent IND filing. Three aims are proposed to achieve our objectives. In Aim 1, new analogs
of the lead NSIs will be designed, synthesized and biologically characterized to build a dynamic drug discovery
and development pipeline. In Aim 2, selected NSIs from aim 1 will be tested for PK/PD properties in various
animal models including AD mouse models. In aim 3, the top candidate NSI identified from Aim 2 will be
subjected to IND-enabling studies including GMP production, GLP toxicology studies in rodents and dogs, and
oral formulation development to prepare for IND filing and clinical trials. The proposed research is highly
significant because we are developing a novel class of NSIs that will offer great promise to provide novel and
effective therapeutics for AD, a devastating neurodegenerative disorder without cure currently."

New York City remains an important battleground in efforts to end the HIV epidemic (ETE) and many hospital
based dental practices draw patients from high HIV incidence and prevalence neighborhoods. The goal of this
project is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of a bundle of evidence-based ETE
interventions in hospital based dental clinics followed by a robust implementation evaluation if early success is
realized. The proposed study will draw upon both structural information technology (IT) interventions, such as
electronic medical record (EMR) alerts to prompt HIV testing, tablet-based HIV risk assessments for
consideration of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and engagement dashboards to ensure or re-establish
care linkage. We will also explore variations in the structure of the dental care team that might facilitate uptake
and performance of comprehensive ETE activities. The proposed project is segmented into phases, commencing
with the UG3 that will assess the acceptability and feasibility of introducing the IT enhanced ETE intervention
bundle (testing, prevention, engagement) to a standard dental team versus care navigator augmented dental
team model (Aim 1). If both models meet pre-determined acceptability and feasibility thresholds, we will conduct
a comparative effectiveness study using a cluster randomized model at four sites in the UH3 to determine the
optimal model (Aim 2). The optimal model will then be advanced to a full implementation evaluation at six distinct
hospital dental service sites, four associated with New York Presbyterian Hospitals in Manhattan, Brooklyn and
Queens and two New York City Health and Hospitals facilities located in the Bronx (Aim 3). To our knowledge
no prior studies exist examining the potential of introducing a full suite of evidence-based ETE interventions into
the dental care environment with careful attention to acceptability, feasibility, effectiveness and the real-world
implementation challenges across multiple institutions. The successful introduction, maintenance and
sustainability of comprehensive and effective HIV ETE activities in dental practices would likely prove to be a
vital component of any successful ETE strategy."

Dentists can play an important role in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative by providing access to HIV testing
and facilitating access to HIV prevention services for at-risk populations in geographic hotspots, thus
decreasing the incidence of HIV infection. To enhance Diagnosis, we propose to investigate incorporating
routine on-site rapid HIV testing into the community health center dental clinics to increase HIV testing rates.
To expand the delivery of HIV Prevention services in the dental clinic setting, we will test a patient-level text
message (TM) intervention designed to decrease risk in those at high risk for HIV infection. In the
developmental UG3 phase, we will conduct qualitative research with CHC dental clinic patients, CHC dental
providers and dental teams to gain perspectives and explore facilitators, barriers, and acceptability of
integrating rapid HIV testing and TM-delivered prevention into dental clinic visits. This data will be used to tailor
the final interventions which will then be pilot tested. This formative work will facilitate intervention adoption and
success. In the UH3 trial phase, four CHC dental clinics in a designated geographic hotspot for HIV infection,
Suffolk County, MA, will participate in a cluster randomized trial comparing the efficacy of on-site rapid HIV
testing delivered in the dental clinic (intervention) to referral for HIV testing by a dental provider (control). When
that trial ends, a second RCT among dental clinic patients at high risk for HIV infection will determine the
efficacy of a text messaging intervention in increasing repeat testing and reducing HIV risk behaviors.
The UG3 Specific Aims are: 1. Investigate barriers and facilitators to on-site rapid HIV testing in CHC dental
clinics by conducting interviews with dental patients (N=32) and dental providers (N=8); and focus groups with
dental teams (N=4); 2. Develop and implement comprehensive training on rapid HIV testing for dental
providers; 3. Develop and program the TM intervention, including content, and TM user and interactivity
features to increase user appeal and engagement, by conducting qualitative interviews with dental patients
(N=32); 4. Conduct pilot testing of rapid HIV testing (n=1 CHC) and referral for HIV testing (n=1 CHC); 5.
Conduct pilot testing of the TM intervention among dental clinic patients (N=20).
The UH3 Specific Aims are: 1.Conduct a cluster randomized trial among four CHC dental clinics to
determine the efficacy of on-site rapid HIV testing in increasing HIV testing rates compared to referral within
the CHC; 2. Determine changes in the dental clinic HIV testing rates over time to assess intervention
sustainability; 3.Conduct a randomized clinical trial among dental clinic patients (N=266) at increased risk of
HIV infection to determine if the dental clinic-delivered TM increases utilization of HIV prevention services
including repeat HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and HIV risk reduction compared to a control TM condition; 4.
Assess the mechanisms through which the intervention effects occur (mediators)."
10865096,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Humans and other animals are governed by an internal circadian clock that regulates the cycling of biological
processes, including memory, across the 24h day. Both non-pathological aging and Alzheimer’s disease are
accompanied by impairments in both memory and circadian rhythmicity, but the connection between these age-
related deficits is currently unclear. Recent work suggests that the circadian gene Period1 (Per1) may serve as
a molecular interface between the circadian clock and memory, as Per1 supports memory formation in the dorsal
hippocampus in addition to its well-documented role in the brain’s central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Further, in old mice, hippocampal Per1 is abnormally repressed, contributing to age-related impairments in
spatial memory. Preliminary data indicates that Per1 is induced by learning during the day, when memory is
robust, but is not induced by learning at night, when memory is poor, suggesting that Per1 may modulate memory
formation across the 24h day. Additionally, Per1 regulates the activity of CREB, a transcription factor that is
critical for determining which individual neurons participate in encoding a given memory (a process termed
“memory allocation”). This proposal aims to understand how Per1 exerts circadian control over hippocampal
memory formation and determine how this process is changed in the old brain. Specifically, we hypothesize that
Per1 regulates the proportion of hippocampal neurons that express active CREB and are therefore allocated to
memory across the 24h day. Accordingly, reductions in Per1 that occur either at night or in old age may restrict
the number of cells allocated to memory, impairing memory formation. To fully test this hypothesis, we propose
three aims. In Aim 1, we will test whether Per1 controls circadian oscillations in hippocampal memory allocation
in young mice. Here, we will bidirectionally manipulate Per1 expression during the day and night with HSV-
CRISPR technology and use both behavior and Arc FISH-based neural ensemble monitoring to determine the
effects on both memory performance and memory allocation. In Aim 2, we will combine our bidirectional CRISPR-
based Per1 manipulations with viruses that either block (phospho-dead CREBS133A) or enhance (phospho-
mimetic CREBS133D) CREB phosphorylation to determine whether Per1 controls memory allocation by regulating
CREB activity. Finally, in Aim 3, we will first determine how circadian oscillations in both memory and memory
allocation change across the lifespan in 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-m.o. mice. Then, we will test whether age-related
repression of Per1 disrupts CREB-mediated memory allocation, ultimately disrupting the circadian regulation of
memory in old mice. Together, our results will determine how the circadian clock interfaces with memory at a
molecular level and how disruption of this process contributes to age-related memory decline. These results
represent a significant conceptual advance in our understanding of age-related memory decline and may identify
potential targets for therapeutic intervention to improve cognition in old age."
10865024,"ABSTRACT
Contingency management, an incentive-based intervention, boasts a massive research base and has been
demonstrated efficacy in increasing drug abstinence and medication adherence in people with opioid use
disorder. There is a huge gap between the evidence in support of this approach and its dissemination in
practice. A digital health program that surmounts most of the barriers to dissemination has been developed
that collects all the relevant data and implements all of the contingency management procedures
automatically. This program has been shown to be efficacious in several peer-reviewed studies. However, one
key barrier to dissemination remains. In order for contingency management to become truly impactful on a
national scale, providers must actively engage patients by informing them about it, encouraging them to use it,
assisting their enrollment, and then using the data generated by the platform to inform their ongoing care. The
best way to surmount this final barrier is to use the motivational technique of contingency management itself;
incentivize the necessary provider behaviors. Thus, this SBIR Fast Track application proposes to develop and
evaluate a novel incentivized collaborative care model for the delivery of contingency management services
for buprenorphine pharmacotherapy patients with opioid use disorders. We believe this model will have the
important secondary effect of increasing access to buprenorphine pharmacotherapy, as prescribers will be
indirectly incentivized to maximize the number of buprenorphine patients in their practice. Phase I will begin
with preparatory activities, including streamlining the enrollment system so that any buprenorphine
prescriber can use it, adding data collection systems for provider information, and data display systems that
providers can use to easily access the patient data they wish to see. A Phase I feasibility study (n = 10) will
follow. The milestones require the potential of the incentivized collaborative care model in disseminating
contingency management to be demonstrated. If successful, the feasibility study will pave the way for a
randomized controlled trial (RCT). This RCT will be the primary activity of Phase II of this SBIR award, and is
designed to evaluate the efficacy of incentivized collaborative care in the dissemination of contingency
management. Primary outcome measures will include the engagement in collaborative care in relation to the
contingency management intervention, as well as buprenorphine prescribing trends. Secondary analyses will
be designed to assess the economic effect of DynamiCare on providers. The RCT will also include exploratory
analyses of patient outcomes. Overall, this project is highly consistent with current ONDCP priorities to,
“Identify and address policy barriers related to contingency management interventions (motivational
incentives),” and “Explore reimbursement for motivational incentives and digital treatment for addiction.” If
successful, this project could lead to rapid dissemination of contingency management and improved access to
buprenorphine pharmacotherapy to people with opioid use disorder throughout the United States."
10865025,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year, nearly 20,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and
5-year overall survival rates remain dismal despite high intensity chemotherapy and, in many cases, stem cell
transplant. Success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in patients with B cell malignancies has
prompted intense interest in applying this revolutionary type of immunotherapy to AML. However, clinical
translation has been limited by overlap of AML target expression on indispensable, healthy tissues, which
increases their susceptibility to CAR T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Endothelial cell toxicity is of particular concern
for some AML targets under investigation. To advance CAR T cell therapy for AML, it is critically important to
devise strategies to preserve anti-leukemic efficacy while simultaneously sparing normal tissue from on-target,
off-tumor toxicity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that antigen-specific inhibitory CARs (iCARs) can be
engineered to modulate CAR T cell activation signals and will decrease on-target, off-tumor toxicity of AML CAR
T cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Identifying
optimal inhibitory motifs to incorporate into iCAR-containing NOT-gated CAR T cells; 2) Defining mechanisms
by which those inhibitory motifs within iCARs can interrupt CAR T cell signaling using advanced proteomic
techniques; and 3) Determining endothelial-specific NOT-gate surface targets by integrating transcriptomic and
proteomic data. Key innovations of this proposal include implementation of a targeted screen to identify a best-
in-class iCAR that will be generalizable across targets and application of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to interrogate
fundamental inhibitory signaling mediators in CAR T cells. While the immediate focus of this proposal is designing
a NOT-gated CAR for AML, principles defined by these experiments will provide the framework for applying this
technology broadly to other tumor types.
The proposed research activities are part of a comprehensive career development plan that will build on past
expertise of the applicant and are crucial to her development as an independent investigator focused on
translational immunotherapy. In particular, the applicant will gain expertise in high dimensional proteomics and
bioinformatics by taking advantage of the world class scientific and mentorship environment at Stanford
University. The applicant will be mentored by Dr. Crystal Mackall, renowned for her work on fundamental CAR
T cell immunology and translational immunotherapy, and co-mentored by Dr. Ravi Majeti, an expert on
therapeutic targeting of AML stem cells. Under their guidance, along with the assembled advisory committee
(including Drs. Kara Davis, Ansuman Satpathy, and Kenneth Weinberg) and specific educational plan, the
applicant will receive the necessary support and resources to accomplish the proposed aims and efficiently
transition to independence following the K08 training period."
10865127,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year there are 1.5 million skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays for post-acute care among Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD), representing over 60% of
beneficiaries who receive care in SNFs. ADRD patients often face unique challenges, including an inability to
describe their diagnoses and symptoms or to participate in care planning, which may contribute to a higher
likelihood of SNF use following hospitalization and poor outcomes. Following hospitalization, ADRD patients
are four times more likely to be discharged to a SNF compared to patients without ADRD. SNF patients with
ADRD have worse outcomes than other SNF patients, including higher re-hospitalization rates, longer SNF
stays, and a lower likelihood of being discharged back to the community. Insufficient information-sharing
capabilities between the SNF, the hospital, and other providers are thought to contribute to the frequency of
these events. SNFs were not eligible to receive incentive payments through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR
Incentive Programs that led to widespread adoption of health information technology among hospitals and
physicians. HIE participation is now being actively promoted by policymakers as means to improve the quality
of care in SNFs. However, there is no evidence of its ability to do so for SNF patients with ADRD. This is likely
due to a lack of available data on SNF participation in HIE that includes key information, such as dates of HIE
participation. In this project, a novel data source will be used that includes dates of HIE participation for all
SNFs participating in HIE in New York State over an eight-year period (2012-2019). These data will be merged
with a 100% sample of Medicare claims for all beneficiaries in the state who received care in SNFs during the
study period to examine the relationship between SNF participation in HIE and the quality and the cost of care
for patients with ADRD. The relationship between SNF participation in HIE and the quality of care will also be
examined specifically for dual-eligibles and racial minorities with ADRD, who are more likely to receive
fragmented care of lower quality compared to other Medicare beneficiaries. Our research design utilizes a
difference-in-differences framework using the differential timing of SNF participation in HIE and incorporates an
instrumental variable based on a patient’s residence and the differential distance between the nearest SNF
with HIE and the nearest SNF without HIE. The robust study design will allow estimation strongly indicative of
causation. The results of the proposed project will be important regardless of our findings. It will be the first
investigation of whether HIE participation among SNFs (1) improves the quality of care, (2) lowers health care
costs, or (3) reduces income and racial disparities in the quality of care for ADRD patients. The information will
be useful to policymakers, SNF and hospital executives, physicians, patients, and leaders of health information
exchanges."
10865128,"Brain edema and brain swelling are major complications of ischemic stroke. Two molecular pathways, aquaporin-
4 (AQP4), and SUR1-TRPM4, have been linked to edema. Water transport via AQP4 is governed principally by
the rate-limiting number of AQP4 channels present in the plasmalemmal membrane, and by the transmembrane
osmotic gradient. It was recently reported that in cultured cells, surface localization of AQP4 is regulated by
Ca2+/calmodulin (CAM), with CAM binding causing a conformational change in the carboxyl terminus of AQP4
that drives cell-surface localization. Although this seminal discovery hints at a potentially important way to
manipulate AQP4 to influence brain swelling, a major gap in knowledge is the mechanism of dynamic regulation
of surface localization of AQP4 in ischemia in vivo. We hypothesize that in post-ischemic perivascular astrocyte
endfeet, Na+ influx via SUR1-TRPM4 shifts Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1) into “Ca2+ entry mode” (CaEnt-NCX1),
which extrudes Na+ and causes Ca2+ influx, and that CaEnt-NCX1-mediated Ca2+ influx activates CAM to drive
surface localization of AQP4 in endfeet that promotes endfoot swelling, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction
and brain swelling. Central to our theory are new findings and new preliminary data: In mouse brain tissues after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), both SUR1-TRPM4 (a “Na+ channel” activated by ATP depletion) and
NCX1 are upregulated in perivascular astrocyte endfeet. In post-MCAo brain slices, preliminary data with Ca2+
imaging of perivascular endfeet show that activation of SUR1-TRPM4 causes an increase in Ca2+ in endfeet that
is blocked by inhibitors of SUR1 and by inhibitors of CaEnt-NCX1. Also central to our theory is our recent
development of a method to measure the surface localization of AQP4 in brain slices, an important development
that provides a novel tool for studying post-ischemic brain swelling. In post-MCAo brain slices, preliminary data
indicate that surface localization of AQP4 is increased by ischemia, and the increase is blocked by pretreatment
with CaEnt-NCX1 inhibition. In this project, we will confirm and expand on these preliminary data by pursuing
the following specific aims: In Specific Aim 1, making use of a novel mouse model we developed
(Slc8a1fl/fl;+GFAP-cre/ERT2 mouse), we will characterize the role of astrocyte NCX1 in post-ischemic BBB
dysfunction and brain swelling. In Specific Aim 2, making use of our unique method to quantify surface
localization of AQP4 in brain slices, we will characterize the role of astrocyte NCX1 in post-MCAo AQP4 surface
localization. In Specific Aim 3, using PC::G5-tdT mice with transgene expression (GCaMP5G and tdTomato)
regulated by pGFAP-cre/ERT2, we will characterize the role of astrocyte NCX1 in post-MCAo perivascular
endfoot swelling and Ca2+ signaling. This project, which is focused on astrocyte endfoot NCX1 and AQP4,
advances a novel theory that unifies the SUR1-TRPM4 and AQP4 edema pathways by incorporating an
intermediate element – NCX1 – in a novel molecular mechanism of brain edema. We anticipate that the science
emerging from this project will be highly impactful, and will have great translational potential."

older Veterans compared to controls; and 2) the predictive power of peripheral blood and/or skeletal muscle
biomarkers for the physical and cognitive effects after three months and one year of Gerofit participation in
older Veterans compared to controls. By accomplishing these goals, the results can provide more information
about the role of exercise in cognitive improvements in older adults, specifically within the VA Gerofit exercise
program, and the use of predictive biomarkers to determine which Veterans will obtain the most benefit
cognitively and physically."
10863049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells drive dramatic and durable remissions in patients with B-cell
malignancies, responses in solid tumors have been more challenging. There is a dearth of highly effective
“armoring” strategies for CAR-T cells to generate additional proteins that augment CAR-T cell function and
modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective CAR-T cell
therapies for solid tumors. The overall objective is to determine the effect of locally secreted VEGF blockade
on CD70 CAR-T cell function, safety, and anti-tumor efficacy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Our central
hypothesis is that locally secreted VEGF blockade will prevent CAR-T cell exhaustion while blocking
angiogenesis/tumor growth, and pathologic endothelial activation. The underlying rationale is that
determination of the preclinical therapeutic efficacy and associated mechanisms of locally secreted VEGF-
blockade will offer a strong scientific framework for new strategies to cancer therapy. To attain the overall
objective, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) Determine the effect of secreted VEGF blockade on CD70-
CAR-T cell biology ; and (2) Define the capacity for CD70-CAR-T cells with secreted VEGF blockade to
modulate RCC tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and endothelial activation in vivo. Approaching the project,
the candidate will examine each side of the immune synapse, in turn, by (1) defining the effects of anti-VEGF
single chain variable fragment (scFv) secretion on CAR-T cells through the underlying CD70 CAR-T biology
and honing in on the site of actions of the VEGF-scFv (paracrine, autocrine, or intracrine) (Aim 1), and (2)
determining the effects of anti-VEGF scFv secretion on RCC tumor cells, angiogenesis, and endothelial
activation via in vivo orthotopic RCC tumor models, cytokine release syndrome models, and VEGF-blockade
cardiovascular toxicity models (Aim 2) The applicant, Dr. Mark Leick, an oncologist at the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) spends 80% of his time in translational research and 20% in clinical practice caring for
patients with cancer. He has outlined a five-year career development plan consisting of coursework,
conferences, seminars, and structured mentoring in experimental design, mouse modeling, angiogenesis and
VEGF signaling pathways, CAR-T signaling, and renal cell carcinoma to acquire the necessary skills required
to perform his research and to reach his goal of becoming an independent investigator in translational
research. His research is directly relevant to the mission of the NCI to conduct cancer research to advance
scientific knowledge and help all people live longer healthier lives using immune cell therapies. Supervising Dr.
Leick’s mentorship and training is Dr. Marcela Maus, a worldwide leader in cellular immunotherapy. Dr. Leick
will conduct this research at MGH and leverage the exceptional research and teaching environments of his
scientific advisory committee (MGH, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and
Boston Children’s Hospital)."
10863671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal presents a five-year research and career development plan focused on machine learning
(ML)-guided antibiotic development for multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The candidate, Melis
Anahtar, MD, PhD, has completed clinical pathology training at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is
now a postdoctoral researcher under the mentorship of Dr. James Collins at MIT and the Broad Institute. Dr.
Collins pioneered the field of ML-based antibiotic discovery and has trained over 70 independent research
investigators. The proposed project builds on Dr. Anahtar’s previous research experiences in the vaginal
microbiome and in genomic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants. AMR poses an existential threat by
rendering existing antibiotics useless. This threat is exemplified by N. gonorrhoeae, a sexually transmitted
gram-negative bacterium that afflicts ~87 million people every year and has recently developed resistance to
ceftriaxone, the last remaining highly effective antibiotic treatment. Untreated gonorrhea causes infertility,
pregnancy complications, neonatal blindness, severe disseminated infection, and death, prompting the CDC
and WHO to recognize drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae as one of the five most urgent AMR threats to human
health. Traditional drug discovery has failed to keep up with AMR and there is a critical need for innovative
approaches to fill the antibiotic development pipeline with promising candidates. To solve this problem, Dr.
Anahtar proposes using predictions from ML models to efficiently guide focused testing and development of
novel compounds for the treatment of drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. The central hypothesis is that ML models
such as graph neural networks can identify new antibiotic candidates for N. gonorrhoeae by predicting growth
inhibitory activity from chemical structures given high-quality training data. In preliminary work, Dr. Anahtar
phenotypically screened a foundational library of 38,000 chemically diverse compounds for N. gonorrhoeae
growth inhibition, used the results to train an ML model, and deployed the model to identify novel compounds
with activity against multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. To expand the pool of novel antibiotic candidates, Dr.
Anahtar will use this ML model to screen large (10^8) chemical libraries in silico and then validate the
predictions in vitro (Aim 1). The mechanism of action of the most potent and non-toxic compounds will then be
determined using microscopic, proteomic, and genomic approaches (Aim 2). Finally, their in vivo efficacy will
be tested in a preclinical animal model of N. gonorrhoeae infection (Aim 3). The long-term goal is to discover
new biological insights into the treatment of drug-resistant bacteria. This work will be performed at the Broad
Institute, MIT, and MGH, which provide an exceptional training environment and ample scientific resources.
The candidate is supported by an outstanding scientific advisory committee with decades of experience in N.
gonorrhoeae, AMR, medicinal chemistry, and mentoring physician-scientists. This career development award
will enable Dr. Anahtar’s transition to independence with a focus on understanding and combating AMR."
10863672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medical and behavioral interventions are critical for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But there are
statistical challenges when estimating causal effects for such interventions. Most statistical methods assume the
treatment of one individual does not affect outcomes of other individuals, i.e., that there is no interference or
spillover effect. However, the effects of infectious disease interventions often include both direct effects on
individuals receiving treatment and spillover effects in the community. An additional challenge for estimation of
effects in infectious disease settings is external validity, as study samples often differ from the populations where
interventions will be applied. Such differences can limit generalizability of study findings. Despite the importance
in the field of infectious disease research, there has been no research at the intersection of interference and
generalizability. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent scientist and expert
biostatistician working at the interface of causal inference, epidemiology, and infectious diseases. Therefore, the
primary goal of this K01 award is to acquire training in infectious disease epidemiology, interference, and
machine learning to develop and apply innovative statistical methods for infectious disease research. The
candidate, Dr. Bonnie Shook-Sa, has assembled a strong team of mentors and collaborators who are leaders in
each of these training areas. Training will support Dr. Shook-Sa's research aims which bring together the fields
of interference and generalizability for the development of estimators of overall and spillover effects from
infectious disease prevention studies that generalize to target populations that differ from study samples.
Methods will first be developed in a standard interference setting, where individuals eligible for treatment are at
risk of the outcome, e.g., for estimating the effect of child bed net use on incidence of malaria among children.
Then, methods will be extended to the “bipartite interference” setting, where individuals eligible for treatment are
distinct from those at risk of the outcome, e.g., for estimating the effect of universal HIV testing and treatment of
persons with HIV on forward infection among persons without HIV. The proposed work will consider a variety of
study designs, including cluster-randomized trials, probability-based sample designs, and convenience sample
designs. Nonparametric estimators based on flexible machine learning methods will be proposed in each setting.
The properties of proposed estimators will be derived, and estimators will be evaluated empirically through
simulation studies. Proposed methods are motivated by and will be applied to data from the Uganda Malaria
Indicator Survey, the HPTN 071: Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission
(PopART) cluster-randomized trial, and the Hutterite Influenza Prevention Study."
10866359,"In response to RFA-CA-20-001, we will create the United States-East Africa HIV-Associated Malignancy
Research Center (USEAHAMRC) for Career Development and the Prevention, Early Detection and
Efficient Linkage to Care for Virus-related Cancers. The RFA requires formation of a collaborative
partnership between one or more US institution and institutions in at least two LMICs. It challenges
applicants to conduct relevant research while also building long-term biomedical research capacity and
career development opportunities. We will create a dual purpose multi-country network to conduct
research as well as to sponsor career development activities modeled after the NIH institutional K award
program, a successful approach for junior investigators in the US. To manage the complexity of
required activities, an astute and efficient central administrative body is needed. The overarching
objective of this body will be to provide effective scientific leadership and administrative coordination.
Accordingly, the specific aims of the Administrative Core will be to:
 Aim 1. Facilitate internal communication and coordination between USEAHAMRC members
 and activities.
 Aim 2. Lead efforts in external interactions with local stakeholders, funders, and other NCI U54
 consortium members.
 Aim 3. Provide financial oversight for the research and career development objectives of the
USEAHAMRC.
 Aim 4. Convene and facilitate the External Advisory Panel
The Core will schedule regular communications, establish rigorous document organization structures,
design automated monitoring, and stimulate scientific exchange amongst all investigators (Aim 1). We
will engage policy makers at African Ministries of Health, the NCI, and other HAMRCs funded by the
RFA (Aim 2). In addition, the Core will evaluate quarterly financial reports to ensure responsible and
transparent use of monetary resources (Aim 3). Bringing together a variety of engaged and affected
community members, scientific experts, and policy officials, the Core will assemble an External Advisory
Panel, which will assist the USEAHAMRC with choosing the most relevant research questions, engage
the community, and advise on appropriate dissemination of research findings (Aim 4). At the end of the
funding period, the USEAHAMRC will have fulfilled the requirements of the RFA and be well positioned
to pursue the next phase of research and capacity-building goals. The Administrative Core will have
optimized usage of its financial resources while serving as a model for our emerging African principal
investigators to emulate as they build leadership and administrative research skills."
10866361,"Creating an independent scientist requires extensive training within an enriching academic environment as
well as adequate salary and research support for the trainee. The period that follows didactic graduate
training is particularly vulnerable in East Africa, which is also true in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. While
funding streams exist for graduate training, the region lacks comprehensive mechanisms to support junior
investigators as they transition towards research independence. In the U.S., post-graduate training is often
facilitated by NIH ""K Award"" programs at both the individual and institutional level. NIH K Awards had been
unavailable to African scientists but this recently changed with the creation of the K43 Emerging Global
Leader Award. Yet, there still remains a substantial challenge preparing both trainees and their home
institutions to compete for a K43 Award or other career development awards. To address the need for
career development in the post-graduate period, the Developmental Core of the USEAHAMRC will:
 Aim 1. Bolster the overall environment for career development in clinical, epidemiologic and
 translational research at the East African institutions of our United States-East Africa HIV-
 Associated Malignancy Research Center (USEAHAMRC).
 Aim 2. Mentor and provide protected time for our emerging African and U.S. junior scientists
 working in the field of HIV-associated malignancies as they develop their academic and
 leadership portfolio and mature towards independence.
 Aim 3. Award funding for pilot research projects to be conducted by emerging African or U.S
scientists.
Modeled on institutional K Award programs in the U.S., we will create a semi-monthly Career Development
Seminar featuring emphasis on scientific writing, mentorship skills, and foundational methodologic training
for all interested scholars at our participating institutions (Aim 1). By drawing upon lessons learned from K
Award funding in the U.S., four emerging Ugandan principal investigators will have a substantial portion of
their time supported for the conduct of research in area of HIV-associated malignancies and will be
mentored to compete for funding that will propel them to the next stage of their careers (Aim 2). With the
assistance from substantial institutional commitment from UCSF, we will award two or three Pilot Project
Awards annually over the 5-year funding cycle for research related to the USEAHAMRC research themes,
which will help us identify and mentor the next cohort of junior investigators."
10866364,"Data management and biostatistical analysis are critical to the success of clinical, epidemiologic and
translational research. Despite this, these two disciplines are frequently overlooked and under-resourced
during research planning and execution. Sub-optimal data collection and management approaches can
generate missing and inaccurate data; researchers may be unaware of such issues in their data, which may
be irreparable or require considerable resources to retrospectively repair. Deficiencies in biostatistical
analysis are common and are also frequently unrecognized by non-experts. In resource-limited settings
such as East Africa, research is even more susceptible to data management and biostatical analysis
problems due to the absence of well-trained personnel and appropriate funding for high-level data
management and biostatistical analysis. The result is a biomedical research system that often relies upon
sub-optimal data management and analytic approaches performed by individuals with less than optimal
training. Our goal is to transfer relevant technology and approaches to East Africa by making these available
to our Research Projects and investigators within one efficient shared resource core. The Data
Management and Biostatistical Analysis Core (DMBAC) of United States-East Africa HIV-Associated
Malignancy Research Center (USEAHAMRC) will therefore have the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Provide expertise and a common platform for primary data collection and data
 management as well as specialized instruction to our junior scientists.
 Aim 2. Offer project-specific biostatistical support both during the planning of new research and
 during the analysis of ongoing studies as well as specialized instruction to our junior scientists.
We will leverage the expertise in data management and biostatistical analysis built at the Department of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF over the past two decades — and particularly during U54
CA190153 — and use it to support our two Research Projects and Pilot Projects. The core will also provide
focused high-level didactic instruction in data management and biostatistical analysis through the Career
Development Seminar organized by the Developmental Core. This will allow our emerging African principal
investigators to incorporate best practices into their current and future studies, communicate effectively with
data managers and biostatisticians, and keep abreast of developments in technology and methodology. By
offering assistance from faculty-level biostatisticians who are familiar with the substantive aspects of HIV
infection and HIV-related malignancies, we will ensure that the USEAHAMRC meets these objectives."
10866367,"Women in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly East Africa, bear among the greatest burden of cervical
cancer in the world, and the reasons are clear: lack of widespread HPV vaccination, lack of screening for pre-
cancer, lack of early detection, and high prevalence of one of the most potent accelerants of cervical cancer
— HIV infection. It is of note that while great strides have been made in HIV infection control in the last
decade in Africa, progress in cervical cancer control has languished. Indeed, continued occurrence of
malignant complications of HIV  such as cervical cancer  threaten to undermine the successes. In
recognition of the relevance of cervical cancer, the WHO has drafted a global strategy for cervical cancer
elimination. It calls for 90% HPV vaccination coverage, 70% screening coverage, and treatment of 90% of
those with cervical disease. Lacking in this strategy, however, is a clear path towards implementation.
 Through funding from U54 CA190153, to address the gap in implementation of effective preventive
interventions for cervical cancer, we began to develop, in Uganda, what we call a public health approach to
cervical cancer prevention. The approach combined Village Health Team-led community mobilization with
community-based self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV testing and a mobile team to provide community-
based ablative treatment for those HPV-infected. These community-based campaigns were feasible, well-
attended and well-accepted. Given the initial success of this approach, the Ministries of Health in Uganda
and Kenya seek to partner with us to add HPV vaccination to this public health approach in a model called
the Integrated Cervical Cancer Prevention Program (ICCPP). The Ministries of Health will implement the
ICCPP, and the overarching goal of the current proposal is to evaluate it. We propose 3 specific aims:
 Aim 1: Evaluate the uptake and acceptability of the HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening
 components of the ICCPP in East Africa;
 Aim 2: Determine the factors explaining non-participation in either HPV vaccination among
 adolescent girls or in cervical cancer screening and treatment among women in East Africa; and
 Aim 3: Assess the costs and efficiency of the integrated public health approach to HPV vaccination
 and cervical cancer screening in East Africa.
To address our aims, we will evaluate an entirely community-based integrated program implemented by our
Ministry of Health partners in Uganda and Kenya in which women undergo cervical cancer screening and
treatment and adolescent girls who have not been fully HPV-immunized get vaccinated. Evaluation will
include uptake, acceptability, exploration of reasons for non-participation and costs. The project tests a new
paradigm in cervical cancer prevention in Africa — a public health approach to reach the greatest number of
girls and women at lowest cost. Findings may form a blueprint for the ultimate elimination of cervical cancer."
10848339,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The microbiome affects many aspects of human health and has been linked to diseases such as
obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and allergy. The balance between host and commensal
bacteria is well maintained in most healthy individuals. One host factor that contributes to intestinal
homeostasis is antibody of the IgA subclass. Plasma cells that produce IgA are found in mucosal tissues such
as the lamina propria of the gut, but they can also be found in systemic sites including the bone marrow.
However, high levels of bone marrow IgA are only found in the presence of certain consortia of bacteria.
Increased frequencies of bone marrow IgA-secreting plasma cells are associated with increased concentration
of serum IgA that has been shown to be protective in a sepsis model of polymicrobial dissemination. The
mechanisms by which bacteria induce systemic IgA responses are unknown. The main goal of this proposal is
to take an unbiased approach to defining gene-level mechanisms used by commensal bacteria to induce
systemic IgA. Additionally, we will examine how inter-species interactions contribute to systemic IgA specificity.
Together, this proposal will provide a framework for understanding how systemic antibody responses are
induced in response to commensal bacteria. This understanding could lead to novel therapies aimed at
maintaining intestinal homeostasis or using commensal bacteria as a vaccine delivery system. This proposal
will support the overall vision of our research program to understand the complex interplay at the interface of
bacteria and host by deciphering gene-level mechanisms used by bacteria to induce IgA responses."

In response to RFA-AI-19-030, Feasibility of Novel Diagnostics for TB in Endemic Countries
(FEND-TB) the leadership team has brought together a consortium of experienced investigators
and clinical sites and developed a research plan to address critical unmet TB diagnostic needs.
This program benefits from experience gained during the successful 7-year tenure of the NIH
DMID-funded TB-Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium (TB-CDRC), with overlap in
leadership, investigators and sites. This program has been adapted in several ways to further
enhance capacity to meet the current challenges in the field -- the successful collaboration with
the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) has been strengthened to now a full
partnership that will facilitate access to cutting edge technologies and alignment of FEND-TB work
with global stakeholder priorities; clinical study sites in India and Peru have been added to
accelerate recruitment and augment capacity to enroll patients with co-morbidities and drug-
resistance; inclusion of a mature analytic laboratory and revised technology evaluation strategy
that together allow for rational, nimble, step-wise evaluation of early-stage diagnostics; and
inclusion of mathematical modeling capacity to inform optimal diagnostic strategies in TB endemic
settings. This proposal will test two main hypotheses: A. Novel early stage TB diagnostics, that
target bacterial and/or host targets and will be ready for evaluation in the next five years, will have
performance characteristics suitable for point of care (POC)/near-care use for TB detection,
triage, or drug susceptibility testing. B. Rapid non-sputum diagnostics will provide ancillary
support as components of algorithms for the diagnosis of childhood TB as well as paucibacillary
pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB in adults. Specific Aims are: 1. To evaluate the diagnostic
accuracy of early stage diagnostic tests for tuberculosis. 2. To identify new early stage
diagnostics for evaluation, and to develop and implement for each a stepwise evaluation plan. 3.
To use economic analysis and transmission modelling to design optimal diagnostic algorithms."
10848425,"ABSTRACT. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) are leading causes of death in the United
States that disproportionately impact individuals with less education and income. There is substantial evidence
that ADRD is strongly patterned by socioeconomic status across the lifecourse. However, little prior work has
evaluated whether socioeconomic interventions to increase socioeconomic status reduce the population burden
of ADRD, or if there are differentially effects by sociodemographic subgroup, resulting in smaller disparities; this
proposal addresses this critical gap in the literature. We evaluate socioeconomic interventions that increased
years of education (Aim 1) and income security (Aim 2) to determine if such interventions impacted dementia
risk overall, and whether structurally minoritized groups (Black Americans, individuals from low childhood SES
backgrounds, and people who grew up in rural areas or the South) differentially benefited (Aim 3). We will use
data from Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
cohort (REGARDS), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort to evaluate these aims. Our
research team has previously published using all three data sets. Aim 1 will evaluate whether expansion of
college access reduced ADRD risk; hypothesis 1 evaluates college geographic accessibility via increases in 2
and 4-year higher education institutions per capita, while hypothesis 2 evaluates college financial accessibility
via a large social intervention that subsidized college education (the Vietnam War GI Bill). Aim 2 will evaluate
whether policies that increased income security reduced ADRD risk; hypothesis 1 evaluates the long-term effects
of a working age poverty-alleviation policy (the earned income tax credit), while hypothesis 2 evaluates
retirement income security (Social Security). Aim 3 will evaluate whether the education and income security
interventions examined in Aims 1 and 2 reduced socioeconomic, racial, and geographic disparities in ADRD;
differential effects will be evaluated using interaction terms, quantile regression, and distributional
decomposition. If our hypotheses are confirmed, results from this research will provide direct evidence for
solutions to reduce the future population burden of ADRD and disparities in ADRD. Our work can also inform
targeting of interventions to those who benefit most. This research will provide immediately actionable evidence,
because the interventions we evaluate are specific and feasible."

This proposal seeks to establish a T34 MARC undergraduate training program at
Vanderbilt University that is structured to support the enhancement of achievement and
retention in STEM majors of students from underrepresented groups. In support of the
overall NIH mission, the overarching objective of the program is to provide an
exceptional training environment for the next generation of diverse and inclusive
biomedical scientists and faculty, and is built on the foundation of a strong training
faculty with exceptional records of scholarship, research support and undergraduate
mentoring, and an exceptional institutional environment with core emphases on
undergraduate research Immersion, and institution-wide dedication to increasing
diversity and Inclusive Excellence. The heart of this mission is expressed in the
academic and research goals of the program, which are to provide our students with a
strong didactic foundation in the STEM disciplines through core curriculum offerings, and
to provide them with the opportunity to carry out state-of-the-art research in the
laboratories of a group of highly successful and committed mentors, here at Vanderbilt,
and for one summer at another institution. In addition, the program has strong emphases
on professional and career development, and on quantitative literacy and rigorous
science, with the objective of building the requisite skills needed for success in graduate
school and beyond, and of training an inclusive cadre of future independent investigators
in biomedical research. The proposed MARC Program at Vanderbilt is an
interdisciplinary program that encompasses 40 faculty preceptors from 3 different
colleges and schools and 7 departments, including the departments of Biological
Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, Neuroscience,
Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology. These departments currently host ca. 700
exceptionally qualified undergraduates that are MARC eligible, providing an outstanding

Diabetes is a global heath epidemic affecting close to 400M people worldwide. Even with rigorous
management increased risk for diabetic complications remains. Bioengineering approaches are providing
innovate technologies that are increasingly overcoming the current limitations in developing new
diagnostics, treatments and cures for diabetes and complications. However there is a shortage of a skilled
scientific workforce able to work on these developments. The University of Colorado is uniquely placed to
develop an innovative new program to train future scientists with the skills and knowledge to solve existing
and future problems in diabetes research and clinical care. This includes world-renowned research and
clinical programs in diabetes, particularly type1 diabetes; exceptional engineering research and training
programs; and bioengineering research and training that is fully integrated with the Medical campus. To
maintain the strong and growing areas of cooperation intersecting bioengineering and diabetes research we
propose an innovative new training program: Bioengineering Interdisciplinary Training for Diabetes
Research. The primary goals of this program are: 1). To attract high-quality trainees with
engineering/quantitative backgrounds; 2). To provide in-depth, multi-disciplinary research training for
predoctoral trainees integrating bioengineering and diabetes; and 3). To prepare trainees for transition to
individual fellowships and research careers in academia or industry. To effectively achieve these goals, our
research training will follow 3 core principles: a). That a successful bioengineering career requires an
intrinsically multi-disciplinary approach, with scientists equipped with skills covering a broad variety of fields;
b). That successful training of these scientists will require constant interactions between trainees and cross-
disciplinary mentors at all levels of research; and c). That developing such scientists requires an institutional
environment with breadth and depth, established interactions between engineering and clinical science, and
faculty committed to this training. Our innovative research training program will combine didactic and hands
on coursework, lab-based research, clinical experiences and career skills. Research areas will focus on true
strengths at the institution in which established interactions between bioengineering and diabetes are
present, including designing biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for diabetes and complication, clinical
trials, imaging diagnostics for diabetes and complications, biomaterials and cell-based therapies, and
artificial pancreas diabetes management. Our current outcomes achieved in bioengineering training,
including for under-represented populations; the depth of expertise in diabetes and engineering research;
the significant institutional support, and the wide range of facilities available make a compelling argument to
develop such a program at the University of Colorado."
10848268,"Project Summary/Abstract
Life expectancy at age 65 increased steadily in the United States over the past half-century. There is great
uncertainty, however, regarding the extent to which this increase was accompanied by the compression of
morbidity/disability due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD-related dementias (ADRD), and stroke—the leading
causes of cognitive impairment (CI) among the elderly—or to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, arthritis,
and fractures—the leading causes of non-cognitive disablement in basic activities of daily living (ADL) among
the elderly. Given the aging of the U.S. population and the increasing costs of health care and long-term care
above age 65, addressing this uncertainty is of profound public health importance. The 1982–1994 National
Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) produced the first reports of major improvements in ADL and instrumental
ADL (IADL) disability rates above age 65. While ADL/IADL improvements continued through 2004 in the NLTCS,
dramatically larger improvements occurred for severe cognitive impairment—including AD/ADRD—during 1984–
2004. Moreover, multiple reports from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) indicated that the favorable trends
in severe cognitive impairment continued, but at a slower pace, through 2012; similar reports from the National
Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) provided additional independent evidence of continuing improvement
during 2011–2015. We propose to conduct comprehensive analyses of genetic and non-genetic modulators of
the compression of morbidity/disability in the NLTCS, HRS, NHATS, and Long Life Family Study (LLFS), using
morbidity/disability criteria consistent with the HIPAA ADL and CI triggers, to test two major hypotheses: (1) that
modifiable non-genetic risk factors account for the recent temporal changes in the incidence, prevalence, and
continuance of cognitive and physical impairments; and (2) that constitutional genetic and epigenetic factors
modulate individual differences in lifetime morbidity/disability incidence, prevalence, and continuance of
cognitive and physical impairments. We will analyze the roles of modifiable non-genetic risk factors in longevity,
co-morbidity, functional health (ADL/IADL), and severe cognitive impairment (Aim 1). We will complete the SNP
array analysis of 2,680 biospecimen samples (918 currently done) and conduct DNA methylation analysis of 639
blood samples in the NLTCS. De-identified NLTCS genetic and epigenetic data will be released using NIAGADS
protocols. We will use SNP and DNA methylation data to conduct genetic and epigenetic association analyses
with phenotypes of aging, health, longevity, physical disability, and severe cognitive impairment (Aim 2). We will
analyze associations of phenotypes of long healthy life with candidate polymorphisms within two highly relevant
coupled gene networks—Insulin/IGF1 signaling (incl. FOXO3A and IGFR) and mTOR pathways—linked to aging
and longevity across different species and associations of global and pathway-specific indices of heterozygosity
with exceptionally high/low morbidity/disability risks; we will determine the roles of AD/ADRD, heart disease,
cancer, stroke, and diabetes in these associations (Aim 3)."
10848355,"Old age is associated with a high prevalence of metabolic alterations like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and preOM 0ointly 'dysglycemia'), and with an immunologic decline associated with higher risk of developing and dying
from lung infections like pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). These immune-metabolic alterations are accompanied
by failure in other organ systems (lung, brain, skeletal muscle), leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
Understanding these interactions and detecting them early is critical for delaying, preventing or restoring an
individual's organ system health. The underlying mechanisms for immunometabolic alterations are unknown, but
our joint studies in humans and mice with and without Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection provide
support for the role of oxidative stress and associated inflammation as a driver. Accordingly, in our Hispanic
human cohort, we find that systemic oxidative stress is higher in TB or DM patients, and exacerbates age effects.
We hypothesize that aging-related immunometabolic changes that drive organ failure are largely originated from
impaired mitochondria-driven oxidative stress pathways. We will test these hypotheses, conducting snap-shot
and longitudinal studies in humans. We will identify the age at which these changes initiate and the most affected
pathway, focusing on monocytes attained from relatively non-invasive specimens. i.e., blood. These studies will
take advantage of a well-defined Hispanic clinical cohort at the Texas-Mexico border and our established team
of field investigators. In Aim 1, we will determine: i) when altered measures of mitochondria-induced oxidative
stress and immune dysfunction are first detected in blood and monocytes during the process of aging, to identify
the most effective age for interventions. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of host biological perturbations
(dysglycemia and PTB) on these outcomes. We will further evaluate if PTB may serve as a new model of
accelerated aging, given its association with inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, results will provide the
foundation for future clinical testing selected interventions in-vivo and monitoring individualized responsiveness
with simple biomarker testing, to promote extended cellular health and organ system healthspan."

We propose to develop intranasal, parainfluenza 5 (PIV5) viral-vector delivered vaccines
against human Lyme disease (LD) to be administered using a prime-boost schedule, for the US
market. A recent new estimate of LD by the CDC places the new number at 476,000 annual
cases, up from 329,000 in 2015 which strongly suggests that the number of Americans affected
by this vector-borne disease is increasing. Currently, there is no human Lyme Disease vaccine
available in the market. A prime-boost vaccination with an intranasal immunogen is a scientific
and technologic advance over best vaccination protocols in development for LD that currently
rely on parenteral inoculation of a minimum of 3 doses over 1 year. Our preliminary studies
show that intranasal administration of a modified OspA vaccine delivered by the laboratory
strain WR-PIV5 viral vector (WR-PIV5-OspABPBPk) via prime-boost (2 doses), produces an
immune response that is 100% protective against tick transmitted B. burgdorferi infection in
mice challenged 4 months after the 1st dose. PIV5 is a safe delivery vector used to develop
many vaccines, one of which is undergoing a human clinical trial. The commercialization
potential and societal impact of developing a novel, safe and efficacious LD vaccine that can be
delivered by a non-invasive method is highly significant given that it may induce more durable
immune responses, it could diminish vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine compliance, and it
could enable self-administration of one or both doses. The novelty of the vaccine proposed in
this Direct to Phase II SBIR application relates to: 1) the use of a modified full length OspA
protein in which the putative autoantigenic epitope has been replaced; 2) a needle-free
intranasal delivery method in a safe, highly immunogenic viral vector; 3) the reduced number of
immunizations; 4) ease of administration; and 5) the potential to increase immunity longevity.
We propose to develop a new viral vector expressing OspABPBPk based on the PIV5 vaccine
strain (CPI) and evaluate intranasal vaccine efficacy in mice as compared to the WR-PIV5-
ABPBPk shown in preliminary results; we will also assess immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of
the best vaccine candidate in the non-human primate (NHP) model of Lyme disease; last, we
will perform studies required for Investigational New Drug (IND) regulatory approval by FDA.
Once the novel vaccine is shown to meet pre-set performance criteria specified in our
milestones (>80% efficacy in mice and non-human primate models), it will be trademarked as
LymeMist™ and the company will implement a plan to commercialize it."

The microbiota of the mammalian gut is a complex community of individual strains shaped in part by microbial
competition over diet components. Despite computational analyses predicting enzymatic capacity of diverse
bacteria, this knowledge is not sufficient to determine how diet influences bacterial abundance in the gut. In
particular, little is known about regulation of carbon utilization enzymes in gut bacteria. Do they have
mechanisms similar to E. coli carbon catabolite repression to consume preferred nutrients sequentially? Or do
they consume all available nutrients simultaneously? How do these different strategies contribute to microbial
abundance in the gut? We have identified a mechanism resembling carbon catabolite repression in Collinsella
aerofaciens that may be a disadvantage when there is an abundance of secondary carbon source in the gut.
Our laboratory seeks to characterize regulatory mechanisms governing carbon consumption in Collinsella
species, in culture and in the mouse gut. Collinsella species are poorly studied Actinobacteria that are linked to
chronic human diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. We have studied a group of closely
related species and strains that vary in their regulation of carbon consumption. We will use this existing
variability and experimental evolution to identify a common pathway of carbon catabolite repression in these
bacteria. We will measure the heterogeneity of this pathway and related metabolic functions using single-cell
RNA-seq. Finally, we will characterize the impact of this regulation on bacterial growth and competition in the
mouse gut.
Together, this research will define regulatory pathways that contribute to advantageous strategies in the
complex nutrient environment of the mammalian intestine. Despite the vast number of correlative studies
implicating a role for the gut microbiome in human disease, there remains much to explore in identifying
bacterial metabolic pathways governing bacterial abundance and function in the gut. This gap limits both our
understanding of the basic biology of these community interactions as well as the ability to design effective
microbial therapeutics for human diseases characterized by complex microbial dysbiosis."

10866816,"PROJECT SUMMARY – NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE (CORE D)
The Neuropathology Core of the Wisconsin ADRC provides neuropathology expertise and infrastructure to
perform rapid brain autopsies, collect and share postmortem data and biospecimens, and conduct detailed
neuropathologic examination and diagnosis of brains donated to the Wisconsin Brain Donor Program (WBDP;
housed in Core D) from consenting Clinical Core participants. Neuropathologic examination is performed by
Board-Certified neuropathologists following NACC protocols for postmortem tissue and biofluids collection,
banking, and neuropathologic evaluation, which includes state-of-the-art whole slide imaging. Critically, this in-
depth neuropathologic characterization provides pathological basis for ADRC investigators to understand the
role of AD and mixed-brain pathologies in AD and ADRD that contribute to clinical symptoms. The Core also
supports advanced postmortem case workup for individuals with antemortem biomarkers, including postmortem
MRI, image-guided tissue sampling, and collection and assessment of arterial vessels. This extensive
neuropathologic characterization in conjunction with deeply phenotyped antemortem clinical, biomarker,
behavioral, and genetic data collected during life uniquely facilitates cutting-edge clinicopathologic research
characterizing antemortem imaging and fluid biomarkers and bridging the gap between brain pathology, ADRD
biomarkers, and their clinical consequences. The WBDP works closely with Cores C, F, and G to educate
participants on the impact of brain donation and encourage enrollment, and regularly communicates brain
donation procedures with participants, their families, a network of pathologists, and funerary providers to ensure
a short postmortem interval. Finally, the Core and its investigators collaborate with the REC to provide an array
of neuropathology training resources including clinicopathologic case conferences, in-person training on gross
and microscopic brain examination, and pathology coursework. The Core goals are accomplished in four specific
aims. Aim 1 will perform rapid brain autopsies, collecting and archiving frozen and fixed tissue blocks from
multiple brain regions on deceased individuals enrolled in the Wisconsin ADRC and linked studies, and receive,
catalogue, and process relevant postmortem blood and CSF biospecimens. Aim 2 provides comprehensive
neuropathologic evaluations per NIA consensus guidelines on Clinical Core subjects, collect NACC
neuropathology data, and make the results available to the family, relevant clinicians, qualified researchers, and
NACC. Aim 3 focuses on sharing postmortem biospecimens (brain regions, blood products, CSF) and
associated neuropathologic and other data to support UW-Madison investigators, and national, and international
multi-center AD/ADRD research collaborations. Finally, Aim 4 will enable innovative antemortem-postmortem
research with deeply phenotyped antemortem biomarker, clinical, cognitive, and genetic characterization."
10857903,"Title: The genomics and consequences of gut bacterial adaptation to high-fat diets
Project Summary: The gut microbial communities of humans and other mammals respond rapidly to changes
in host diet, and diet-induced changes in the microbiota can feedback to shape host health outcomes.
However, little is known about how individual microbial species within the gut adapt to changes in host diet.
The central hypothesis underlying the proposed work is that high-fat diets drive adaptive evolutionary
responses in gut bacterial genomes that in turn affect host metabolic traits. Guided by preliminary data
generated by our lab, we propose that 1) specific genomic loci underlying gut bacterial adaptation to high-fat
diets can be discovered using evolve and re-sequence experiments leveraging genome-resolved
metagenomics approaches; 2) plasmid transmission and proliferation promoted by high-fat diets can be
quantified through high-throughput culturing and low-cost isolate genome sequencing; 3) fitness effects
conferred by gut bacterial genome evolution induced by high-fat diets can be tested through microbiota-
competition experiments in germ-free mice; and 4) the effects on host metabolic traits of strain variation
selected by high-fat host diets can be measured through transplantation into germ-free mice of defined
microbial cocktails evolved under high-fat or low-fat host diets. In Aims 1 and 2, we will use an existing panel of
wild-derived inbred mouse lines, each of which harbors a distinct wild-derived gut microbiota, to conduct
metagenomic evolve and re-sequence experiments with highly replicated sets of sublines maintained for
multiple generations on either high-fat or low-fat diets. Analyses of metagenome-assembled genomes will be
used to identify population-genomic signatures of gut bacterial adaptation to the diets (Aim 1), and analyses of
bacterial isolate genomes will be used to link diet-associated plasmids with their bacterial hosts (Aim 2). In Aim
3, we will use approaches recently developed and employed by our lab to conduct microbiota-competition
experiments in germ-free mice fed either high-fat or low-fat diets. These experiments will enable quantification
of the degree to which high-fat or low-fat diets select for the bacterial genomic changes identified in Aims 1 and
2. In Aim 4, we will directly test in germ-free mice how strain adaptation to high-fat host diets affects proximal
host traits, such as gut gene expression and immune responses, as well as higher level metabolic traits,
including adiposity. These experiments will uncover the adaptive landscape experienced by gut bacteria in the
context of a high-fat host diet and determine the consequences of diet-induced bacterial evolution for host
metabolic health."

The DPBRN provides a unique opportunity to conduct impactful research in oral health. Dental practices are
an ideal setting for identifying trends and studying effectiveness and potential benefits of dental care delivery
strategies in “real-world” populations. The Network needs an experienced, efficient Coordinating Center to
optimize its productivity and impact. The CHR Coordinating Center (CHR CC) proposes to: 1. Establish
productive, collaborative working relationships with DPBRN leadership and facilitate the
development of a 7-year DPBRN strategic plan. The CHR CC will work with the National Network
Director(s), Node Directors and Node Coordinators to inventory existing DPBRN research infrastructure,
assess and prioritize the Network's needs, craft strategic aims, and create a detailed work plan for achieving
those aims; 2. Provide central coordination for the DPBRN. Based on Aim 1, the CHR CC will develop
processes, technologies and other resources to maximize the efficiency and increase the impact of the
DPBRN; 3. Augment DPBRN resources by establishing a comprehensive, integrated, secure DPBRN
research website (the DPBRN Hub), integrating the DPBRN practitioner database access into the
website, and developing a Common Data Model (CDM) based on electronic dental and medical health
record data. The CHR CC will create a multi-function website that will serve as the primary hub for network
research. The DPBRN Hub will provide a communications platform, a data collection, management and
reporting system, a scientific review system, and access to Network-wide and study-specific documents. The
existing practitioner database will be imported to the Hub and a new practitioner survey implemented and
both sources will be linked with the data management system. We also propose developing content and data
architecture for a dental CDM that can be used to carry out data-only studies, provide preliminary data for
designing studies, and identify patients for recruitment or additional follow-up. 4. Provide scientific,
statistical and operational support for the review, development, implementation and dissemination of
DPBRN research studies. The CC will create and maintain technologies to manage study concept review
and study development and implementation. CC teams will provide the methodologic, clinical, regulatory,
administrative, operational, and technical expertise needed to support active study teams. The CC will
develop multiple strategies for data collection, as well as procedures and templates to streamline the
approval and implementation of DPBRN studies. Over more than 25 years, the CHR CC has developed a
large repertoire of tools, technologies, processes and policies to coordinate multi-center research studies,
and it will provide a solid foundation to support the DPBRN."
10862681,"Neurodegenerative disorders including Lewy body Dementia (LBD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are
characterized by aggregation of a-synuclein (a-syn), however the downstream toxic events that lead to cell death
are not understood. Proteome dysfunction is a prominent feature of synucleinopathies, as indicated by genetics
and pathology. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how the proteome changes in PD, we performed a
quantitative proteomic study to identify proteins that aggregate in patient derived iPSC-neurons as a
consequence of a-syn accumulation. By comparing iPSC neurons expressing A53T a-syn with isogenic
corrected lines, we discovered a remarkable level of selectivity in the classes of proteins that aggregate.
Specifically, we found that RNA binding proteins NONO and SFPQ undergo dramatic solubility shifts from
detergent soluble into the insoluble state. NONO and SFPQ are multifunctional nuclear proteins that play critical
roles in transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and RNA editing of genes that regulate axon guidance. They are
core components of a membraneless sub-compartment in the nucleus called the paraspeckle, and contain prion-
like low complexity domains that permit phase separation under physiological conditions. Paraspeckles occur in
neuronal cultures and in vivo in the brain, and are thought to play key roles in regulating homeostatic stress by
transiently sequestering transcription factors and RNAs to prevent translation. Once stress subsides,
paraspeckles normally dissolve and gene expression returns to normal. However, we have found that NONO
and SFPQ irreversibly form pathological aggregates in patient iPSC-neurons and LBD patient brain. This effect
is specifically associated with a-syn accumulation, and does not occur with general cellular stress. Mechanistic
studies in iPSC-neurons suggest that formation of NONO/SFPQ aggregates is associated with loss of their
functions, resulting in neurite degeneration. We find that the SFPQ transcriptional target, ADAR3 that mediates
RNA editing, is nearly completely depleted in patient neurons. Here, we propose to examine the mechanism of
how a-syn accumulation leads to aberrant NONO/SFPQ aggregation in the nucleus and downstream
pathophysiology. Given their role in RNA splicing and editing, we propose to employ both targeted and unbiased
methods to identify changes in RNA editing including RNA-seq, exon-junction microarrays to examine RNA
splicing, and ChIP-seq to detect changes in SFPQ transcriptional activity. These phenotypes will be correlated
with distinct aggregated forms of a-syn and neurodegeneration. Finally, we will attempt to rescue established
phenotypes in patient iPSC-neurons by promoting soluble, function NONO/SFPQ. Our preliminary studies have
identified a novel pathogenic pathway in synucleinopathies, and we will extend these findings by examining the
mechanisms of gene dysregulation and RNA processing. We will provide the first description of RNA editing and
splicing changes in patient iPSCs, which may uncover novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies."
10862682,"Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, experiencing persistent nociceptive sensory and negative
affective symptoms. Currently available pain treatments are inadequate at safely and effectively relieving both
the sensory and affective features of chronic pain, partly because of their lack of specificity to modulate distinct
neural cell-types and processes. While diagnostic imaging tools have correlated the affective unpleasantness of
chronic pain with dysfunction across broad brain regions-such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus
accumbens (NAc)-they lack specificity to identify individual functional cell types that might underlie this
maladaptive plasticity. A key first step towards identifying and targeting affective nociceptive neural circuits is to
visualize the dynamics of nociceptive transmissions between affective-motivational brain regions during the
transition from acute to chronic pain. The research goal of the proposed project is to functionally characterize a
nociceptive BLA to NAc circuit that contributes to negative affective-motivational behavior in acute and chronic
nociceptive states. Dysfunction of the BLA has been implicated in chronic pain and neuropsychiatric disorders
through the process of assigning valence to internal and external sensory information. The BLA contains a
functional subpopulation of negative valence neurons essential for the emotionally aversive aspect of nociception
(BLA""0 ci). Inhibition of BLAnoci neurons reduces affective-motivational responses to noxious stimuli in acute and
chronic nociceptive states. BLA neurons send long-range axons to many downstream targets, including the NAc,
a striatal structure important for driving appetitive and aversive behaviors. Preliminary data suggests that BLAnoci
neurons project to the ""limbic"" NAc Shell subregion (NAcSh). Furthermore, there is a group of neurons highly
responsive to noxious stimuli within the NAcSh (the ""inner-horn""; NAcSh1H) that a bundle of BLAnoci axons strongly
innervate. However, it is unknown if BLAnoci neurons transmit affective nociceptive information to the NAcSh1H
nor if NAcSh1H neurons are essential for driving nociception-related negative affective-motivational behaviors.
Aim 1 will functionally characterize the BLAnoci to NAcSh1H circuit in acute and chronic nociceptive states using
in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic activation of BLAnoci axon terminals in awake behaving subjects. Aim 2
will image and manipulate NAcSh1H neuron activity in acute and chronic nociceptive states using calcium imaging
and optogenetic manipulation of NAcSh1H neural activity. Completion of these proposed aims will result in the
characterization of a potentially key affective circuit between the BLA and NAcSh1H encoding acute and chronic
nociceptive information. The outcome of this proposal will help the field of affective pain neuroscience better
understand neural circuit function in healthy and pathological states. Furthermore, this research may inform
future translational investigations into treatments for the negative affective symptoms of chronic pain. Completion
of this fellowship will achieve the training goals of expanding the technical expertise of Ms. Wojick in systems
neuroscience and facilitate her career goal of becoming a leading expert in affective pain research."
10859250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory viral coinfections (RVCIs) are more common in children than adults and have become increasingly
important due to the emergence of SARS-COV-2. However, the distinction between coinfection and codetection
remains unclear. Further, the association between finding multiple viruses using our current clinical methods and
the effect on clinical outcomes is nebulous. Understanding positive viral testing has become crucial with the
ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment algorithms that are expensive or deleterious to patients with
other viruses. Currently, clinicians struggle to identify the dominant virus inducing the host immune response in
RVCIs in children. Our group has developed gene classifiers to identify adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to
other viruses using nasopharyngeal swabs. Further, we are the first to develop a host/microbe classifier for
pediatric patients on the ventilator that will distinguish lower respiratory tract infections using lower airway
sampling. Here, our objective is to identify patient features, coinfecting viruses, microbial contributions, and host
responses that enhance disease severity in SARS-CoV-2–infected children. As the only pediatric hospital in the
state, Arkansas Children's Hospital is an ideal site for studying SARS-CoV-2 RVCIs. We aim to leverage our
unique multi-institutional collaborative team with extensive experience applying metagenomic next-generation
sequencing to simultaneously evaluate viral and host genetic material from clinically obtained nasopharyngeal
specimens. This approach identifies host–virus interactions and allows us to assess their impact on immune
responses and disease severity during RVCIs. We hypothesize that a combination of patient characteristics, viral
features, and host immune responses will predispose a child to more severe disease. We also expect to identify
an immunologic fingerprint for SARS-CoV-2 that can be used to identify it as the “infecting virus” in children with
codetections. The impact of this study is significant, and the multidisciplinary team that this proposal brings
together is experienced. By employing epidemiologic, -omic, and computational approaches, we will identify
immunologic fingerprints of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, which can help identify the “infecting virus” when
multiple viruses are detected. Further, this study will provide distinction regarding the clinical implications of
codetections of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in children. The findings will support future clinical trials
evaluating treatment options based on the immunologic fingerprints that we identify."

This R01 study will apply neurocognitive, brain, and plasma biomarkers to quantify prodromal signs of dementia
in autistic adults ages 40-65. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition that continuously demands
precision diagnosis, targeted treatment, and high-quality care. Emerging clinical and epidemiological studies
suggest that autistic adults are more vulnerable to developing early-onset dementia than the general population
as they age. Robust pilot data from our group show accelerated verbal memory and executive function
deterioration in middle-aged autistic adults. Our free-water diffusion MRI (FWdMRI) data show FW
accumulations in the hippocampal and frontotemporal areas relevant to these behavioral deficits in ASD. Our
amyloid PET scans highlight early amyloid load in Phase 1 (i.e., neocortices) Thal regions and elevated amyloid
burden in Phase 2 (e.g., entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala) Thal regions in autistic adults,
accompanied with cortical thinning and volume reductions of these affected areas. Our preliminary plasma
biomarkers also show significant increases in amyloid β42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, total Tau, and neurofilament light chain
(NfL) in autistic adults relative to controls. Despite promising findings from our lab and others, studies focused
on neurodegenerative comorbidities in ASD are scant. We are still far from a systematic understanding of
dementia onset, manifestation, and progression in ASD. To address this critical scientific gap, we plan to acquire
cross-sectional data to quantify established neurocognitive, brain, and plasma biomarkers of dementia in autistic
adults and compare these markers with age- and sex-matched cognitively normal controls. Forty-five autistic
adults and 45 controls ages 40-65 will be recruited. Aim 1 will quantify verbal memory retention and executive
function impairments in ASD. Aim 2 will quantify dementia-related brain degenerations in autistic adults using T1
weighted MRI, FWdMRI, and amyloid PET. Regions of interest will focus on the hippocampus, hippocampal
input and output tracts, and frontotemporal areas. Aim 3 will focus on quantifying plasma
Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers in autistic adults, including Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio,
phosphorylated Tau (pTau), NfL, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The relationships among cognitive
(Aim1), brain (Aim2), and plasma (Aim 3) biomarkers will be explored to achieve a multi-dimensional evaluation
of dementia pathophysiology in ASD. This work holds significant promise to develop a foundational
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dementia in ASD across outcome measures at
multiple levels."
10862408,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity affects 1 in 5 children and adolescents in the United States and prevalence of severe obesity is
worsening. Despite advances in treatment for obesity, primary prevention is essential to prevent morbidity and
early death. Infants who gain weight rapidly have over 4 times higher odds of developing obesity as a child or
adult, and rapid weight gain during infancy also explains a large percentage of the entrenched and worsening
racial and ethnic disparities in childhood obesity and subsequent cardiometabolic disease. Infants who are
predominantly bottle-fed are at higher risk for excessive infancy weight gain and childhood obesity, yet we do
not have effective interventions to reduce excessive weight gain among infants who are bottle-fed. Our
preliminary work suggest that two novel intervention strategies are feasible and may reduce excessive infancy
weight gain: reducing bottle size; and increasing bottle opacity. Both smaller size and increased opacity
attenuate the visual cues that may encourage overfeeding of bottle-fed infants and overriding infants’ hunger
and satiation cues. Our past observational work shows the size of the infant bottle is positively associated with
total formula fed, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length from 2 months through 12 months of life. Our past
experimental work shows that smaller bottles are a feasible intervention from the primary care setting. We
have also shown that caregivers using opaque bottles showed greater sensitivity to their infant’s hunger and
satiation cues and fed their infants less than when using clear bottles. Opaque bottles were acceptable and
feasible in a community-based intervention over 3 months. We aim to test the independent and joint efficacy of
these two intervention components among exclusively bottle-fed infants in a randomized, full factorial clinical
trial. We hypothesize that smaller and opaque bottles reduce conditional weight gain, decrease volume per
feed, and improve caregiver sensitivity to infant hunger and satiation cues. Our objective is to understand the
independent and joint efficacy of reduced bottle size and increased bottle opacity and to collect additional
feasibility and acceptability data in order to facilitate rapid translation and implementation of optimized bottle
feeding strategies. We plan to achieve our objectives by (1) assessing the independent and joint efficacy of
reducing bottle size and increasing bottle opacity to reduce excessive weight gain from birth to four months of
infant life, (2) determine the effects of reducing bottle size and increasing bottle opacity on changes in volume
per feed and on caregiver-infant dyad feeding interactions through video-recorded feeding observations, and
(3) quantify and describe factors associated with eligibility, enrollment, and adherence to bottle design
interventions. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a team of experts in obesity, primary care-based
clinical interventions, infant growth, caregiver-infant dyadic feeding behaviors, factorial designs, and
biostatistics. The results from this novel intervention strategy will be used to design a large, multicenter clinical
trial of a comprehensive bottle-feeding strategy to reduce the incidence of obesity in early childhood."

Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, yet they remain
underrepresented in discussions about the utility of genetics and genomics and how this technology should or
should not be implemented into clinical care. One condition, Asian Alcohol Flushing Syndrome, affects over
25% of East Asians and is caused by a genetic variant, ALDH2*2. ALDH2*2 also has links to serious medical
conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and Alzheimer’s Disease, and it affects individuals’ alcohol
metabolism, making alcohol consumption more toxic and cancer causing. Lifestyle changes, such as reducing
alcohol consumption, can reduce the risk of esophageal cancer for East Asian Americans with this variant.
However, we lack information about East Asian American community members’ perceptions of genetic testing
for ALDH2*2 and how to implement this testing into clinical care.
The goal of the proposed research is to engage an underrepresented community in the implementation of
genomic testing that has direct relevance to their health outcomes. I will accomplish this goal by evaluating the
effect of ALDH2 genetic testing on the drinking behaviors of East Asian Americans and assessing clinician and
patient opinions of moving this test from direct-to-consumer to clinical practice. This proposal has three specific
aims. Aim One: To evaluate East Asian American community members’ perceptions of personal utility for
ALDH2*2 genetic testing and preferences for screening. Aim Two: To identify barriers and facilitators to
implementation of ALDH2*2 genetic testing in primary care. Aim Three: To measure the effect of direct-to-
consumer ALDH2*2 genetic testing and education on health behaviors of East Asian Americans who flush
when they drink alcohol. The proposed research will provide community-driven recommendations for
implementing ALDH2*2 genetic testing in primary care.
Dr. Young will achieve these aims by drawing on her current skills in qualitative research and genetics, as well
as additional training in community-engaged research, pragmatic clinical trials, and implementation science.
These research and training goals are to be carried out at Northwestern University in conjunction with a
Community Advisory Board of East Asian Americans who flush when they drink alcohol and an experienced
team of mentors. Dr. Young is already an accomplished scholar with a track record of high-quality research.
The outlined training plan will enable Dr. Young to accomplish her long-term career goal to become an
independent, interdisciplinary researcher implementing ethical and equitable genetic testing interventions for
underserved communities."
10861613,"Key tools for studying neural circuits combine Cre recombinase dependent expression of either:
markers (GFP), optogenetic and chemogenetic actuators (e.g. channelrhodopsin and DREADDs) or
biosensors (GCaMPs). A common design is to use AAVs to deliver the gene-of-interest that is made Cre
dependent by flanking its inverted open-reading frame with specific Cre recognition sites (loxP/lox2272; DIO or
FLEX design). Recent studies have sounded the alarm on leaky, non-Cre dependent expression by injecting
these AAVs into wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Using this approach we find 6% off-target expression of FLEX-
tdTomato (Addgene 28306). This level of off-target expression of FLEX/DIO AAVs leads to confounds in the
interpretation of results, and coupled with their wide-spread use (>2,000 papers), highlights the need for
improved Cre-dependent designs. Fixing the off-target leak begins with understanding two of the main sources
of the problem.
 Problem #1 is that current FLEX sequences recombine during cloning, plasmid amplification, and AAV
production (Fischer et al., 2019). To reduce recombination we replaced the lox sites with mutant sites that
form shorter hairpins (lox71/66). In vitro testing of this FLEX2 design indicates spontaneous recombination is
reduced 4-fold and expression after Cre recombination is improved 8-fold.
 Problem #2 is that the AAV ITR sequences have promotor activity (Haberman et al., 2000), which leads
to the expression of the actuator even though it is oriented 3’-5’ relative to the neuronal promoter. Our solution
was to combine a split intron and a split open-reading frame of the actuator into two fragments and then invert
one of them. The split intron serves to remove residual lox sites from the final coding sequence.
 Preliminary data shows the effectiveness of this approach to deliver diphtheria toxin A chain to ablate
hippocampal interneurons in VGAT-Cre mice. Approx. 50-70% of GABAergic neurons in the CA3 stratum
radiatum and dentate hilus were ablated. These mice developed spontaneous recurring seizures (SRS) in the
absence of any other precipitating cause. This supports the hypothesis that loss of GABAergic inhibition can
cause epilepsy.
 The goal of this grant is apply the FLEX2 design to the most commonly used Cre-dependent AAV tools.
In collaboration with Addgene, these plasmids will be used to produce AAV particles. Both the FLEX2 plasmids
and AAV will be directly distributed by Addgene to the research community."

Dysregulation of RNA-binding protein (RBP)-RNA interactions impacts the coordination of RNA fate with
severe implications for human health. RBPs interact directly with RNA processing machinery to modulate RNA
localization, degradation, and translation independently of transcriptional regulation. Disruptions in RBPs or
their RNA binding sites can lead to fluctuations in oncogene or tumor-suppressor gene expression and
malignant changes in cellular homeostasis. Understanding the molecular functions of RBPs in regulating gene
expression is then imperative for predicting metastatic progression in cancers with RBP mutant gene
signatures. Recent work has led to the discovery of thousands of human RBPs, but much less has been done
to systematically describe the function that each protein and its individual domains have on regulating their
RNA partners. Additionally, the functional organization of RBPs beyond their distinct and generally
well-characterized RNA-binding domains (RBDs) is not fully understood. Until recently, it was assumed that
RBPs were effectively non-modular outside of RBDs; however, current studies suggest that RBPs may be
composed of separable ‘effector’ domains that interact with processing machinery and promote regulatory
activity. I hypothesize that most RBPs contain distinct effector domains that post-transcriptionally regulate
protein abundance through interactions with cellular machinery that controls RNA decay or translation.
The Bintu lab has developed a high-throughput recruitment assay to recruit 80 amino acid protein portions, or
tiles, to a synthetic DNA reporter gene. I propose to extend this methodology to identify functional effector
domains within human RBPs, where they also may be more sensitive to oncogenic mutation. First, I will use a
high-throughput assay I recently developed to recruit tens of thousands of protein tiles to a synthetic reporter
RNA, evaluate their effects on downstream protein expression, and determine the mechanism by which they
regulate RNA levels. This will allow me to identify annotated oncogenic mutations that overlap effector domains
and likely cause disease by disrupting RBP regulatory activity. Second, it is currently difficult to predict how
loss of RBP activity affects a single bound transcript, largely because RBPs bind at different positions and in
different copy numbers on each of their multiple partner RNAs. I will quantitatively compare how variation in
RBP and effector domain positioning and occupancy along transcripts affects gene expression and eventual
different cancer phenotypes. Finally, I will conduct a mechanistic investigation into METTL3, a known
RNA-modifying enzyme whose overexpression is believed to drive the development of multiple cancers. I will
determine its RNA regulatory potential independent of modification writing and query the direct correlation
between RNA modifications and overall expression. This work will be the first to systematically identify
functional domains in RBPs and will increase understanding of how dysregulation of RBP function leads to
cancer through altered interactions with crucial cellular machinery."

Relapse and craving in addiction are heavily controlled by environmental cues that evoke dynamic motivational
states and reinforce actions. Both the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dopamine (DA) signaling are critical for
associative learning processes and cue-driven motivational states. The BLA receives dense dopaminergic
projections and is enriched with D1 DA receptors (D1DRs), however BLA DA functions in addiction remain largely
unexplored. Presentations of cocaine-predictive stimuli increase extracellular DA levels and activate neurons
within the amygdala, while BLA D1DRs influence drug-seeking behaviors and their activation increases
excitability of BLA principal neurons - a major target of DA inputs into the BLA. As there are extensive excitatory
projections from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), if BLA DA and D1-neurons are underlying facets of
state dynamics-driven drug seeking behaviors, synaptic strength within this pathway may be uniquely potentiated
following binge-like cocaine seeking. Understanding the role of BLA activity and DA signaling in drug seeking
will reveal novel insight into the brain circuitry that drives emotional learning and addiction-related behaviors to
provide a strong scientific framework for investigating mechanisms underlying affective diseases. This proposal
will make use of new tools to record and manipulate DA and D1 neurons in the amygdala to investigate
their contributions to dynamic cocaine seeking behaviors (Aim 1) and investigate how binge-like cocaine
self-administration impacts the functional connectivity of glutamatergic BLA to NAc circuits (Aim 2).
First, I will measure in vivo DA signaling and D1-neuron activity in the BLA during cocaine self-administration
using fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that BLA DA transmission and D1-neuron activity will track the
emergence of dynamic, sensory-guided drug seeking motivational states. I will also optogenetically inhibit BLA
D1-neurons during the same paradigm to investigate if BLA D1-neurons play a necessary role in state-level
control of binge-like drug seeking. Finally, in an ex vivo preparation, I will use optogenetics to stimulate the
terminals of glutamatergic BLA projection neurons in an NAc slice while recording the resulting local field
potentials after rats undergo cocaine self-administration. These studies will test the hypothesis that BLA-NAc
excitatory synaptic strength will be modulated by the pattern of drug use history via drug state-intermittency
information from the BLA. This proposal will establish fundamental principles by which dopaminergic and
glutamatergic mechanisms interact within the amygdalostriatal system to influence the emergence and control
of dynamic drug-seeking motivational states."

Helicobacter pylori infection is commonly associated with several gastric diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcer
disease, lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, and gastric adenocarcinoma. H. pylori has
evolved various mechanisms to evade the host innate immune response, and as a result, these bacteria can
thrive for decades in the gastric mucosa. Chronic infection elicits the continuous generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) by neutrophils and gastric epithelial cells. Elevated levels of ROS can damage macromolecules,
and previous studies have focused on how ROS mediate DNA damage during infection. However, ROS can also
generate oxidative post-translational modifications on host proteins containing redox-sensitive cysteines that
regulate important cellular functions. Our lab previously performed a chemical proteomic screen to identify
cysteines in host proteins that exhibit decreased reactivity during H. pylori infection of human gastric cancer
cells. This proposal will focus on two ribosomal proteins, uL14 and eS27, which contain cysteine residues that
were among the top hits from this screen. Host translational inhibition is a well-characterized response to
infection by several microbes, and Aim 1 of this proposal will elucidate whether ribosome biogenesis and
translational function are similarly affected during H. pylori infection. Aim 2 will focus on characterizing how the
reactivity of the specific cysteines Cys125 of uL14 and Cys77 of eS27 contributes to the cellular localization and
interactions of the ribosomal proteins. Overall, this proposal will provide insight into how redox regulation of host
ribosomal proteins affects their function and expand our understanding of host cellular processes that are
modulated by H. pylori infection."

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by expansion of the CGG short tandem repeat (STR) located in the 5’ UTR
of the FMR1 gene. Upon expansion to mutation-length, local DNA methylation at the FMR1 promoter leads to
silenced transcription which is thought to drive the pathophysiology of FXS. However, Fmr1 knock-out mice do
not reproducibly recapitulate the range of FXS clinical presentations, suggesting that FMR1 dysregulation alone
cannot explain the pathophysiology of FXS. Recently, our lab uncovered Megabase-scale domains of the histone
modification H3K9me3 at the FMR1 locus on chromosome X and multiple autosomes. The H3K9me3 domains
encompass silenced genes encoding synaptic plasticity and epithelial integrity, which correlate with symptoms
experiences by FXS patients, raising the possibility that these heterochromatin domains contribute to the
pathophysiology of FXS. The objective of my proposal is to investigate the mechanisms by which the mutation-
length CGG STR coordinates Megabase-scale heterochromatin domains and their inter-chromosomal contacts.
My central hypothesis is that expansion of CGG STR to mutation-length is necessary and sufficient for the
heterochromatinization of the FMR1 locus and a subset of autosomal domains. Upon heterochromatinization,
the domains form pathologic inter-chromosomal contacts with each other in a H3K9me3-dependent manner. I
have formulated my hypothesis based on my unpublished imaging data demonstrating that (1) ectopic trans
interactions form between H3K9me3 domains in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the mutation-length
CGG STR tract, (2) in single cells, FXS domains that form inter-chromosomal contacts are more enriched in
H3K9me3 than those that do not, and (3) cut-back of the CGG STR can reverse H3K9me3 signal at a subset of
domains. I will test my hypothesis by leveraging a newly developed protocol for STR synthesis with
CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to generate iPSC clones with the same genetic background but varying STR length
and sequence at the 5’ UTR of FMR1. I will measure the effect of the mutation-length CGG STR, as well as the
overexpression of H3K9me3 writer and eraser enzymes, on H3K9me3, trans interactions, and transcriptional
silencing using state-of-the art genomics and multimodal imaging techniques including CUT&Run, Hi-C,
sequential Oligopaint FISH, and single-molecule RNA FISH. Successful completion of these experiments will
demonstrate the contribution of both STR sequence and length to the multi-chromosomal, Megabase-scale
heterochromatinization of the FXS genome and defined the requirement for H3K9me3 for trans interactions. My
work is significant because it will expand classic models of how the mutation-length CGG STR causes FXS to
include Megabase-scale heterochromatinization and ectopic inter-chromosomal contacts. Studying these
mechanisms will have a broad impact on our understanding of the role for heterochromatin and miswiring of the
3D genome in a wide range of repeat expansion disorders and in cancers with repeat instability."

Biological mechanisms underlying psychosocial stress-induced changes to the larynx remain understudied.
Psychological stress symptomology is concurrently reported in 25% of patients with voice problems. From a
biological perspective, psychosocial stress can have deleterious consequences on both microbial communities
and epithelial barrier integrity, as reported, in other mucosal organs such as the gut and stomach. First, the
laryngeal microbiome has a distinct microbial composition when compared to the gut. How this distinct
composition is influenced by psychosocial stress remains unknown. Independently, stress-induced changes to
epithelial permeability (such as reduced epithelial proliferation and reduced mucus thickness) may potentially
leave the larynx susceptible to further infection. This proposal broadly questions whether psychosocial stress
can lead to microbial dysbiosis and compromised epithelial barrier integrity. In our proposed experiments, mice
will be assigned to unstressed or stressed groups. Psychosocial stress will be induced via a validated chronic
restraint stress protocol. Specific Aim 1 will determine laryngeal microbial adaptations following chronic,
psychosocial stress exposure. We hypothesize that psychosocial stress will result in reduced microbial
diversity and abundance, altered composition and differential abundance of specific bacterial taxa, and distinct
predicted functional profiles in the laryngeal microbiota. To obtain laryngeal microbiota outcomes, 16s rRNA
sequencing will be used completed on bacteria extracted from murine laryngeal tissue. Specific Aim 2 will
delineate changes in vocal fold epithelial integrity post-chronic psychosocial stress. We hypothesize
that psychosocial stress will result in increased bacterial translocation, decreased mucus thickness, reduced
epithelial proliferation, reduced epithelial cell junction integrity, and altered gene expression of mucins in the
vocal folds. Immunohistochemistry/ Immunofluorescence and qPCR will be used to delineate consequences of
psychosocial stress on the laryngeal epithelium. Taken together, we hypothesize that psychosocial stress will
concomitantly lead to microbial dysbiosis and alter epithelial barrier integrity in the larynx. Data from these two
aims will lay the groundwork for identifying and manipulating specific bacterial phyla to delineate host-microbial
epithelial interactions of psychosocial stress in the larynx."

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a disease indicated by autoimmune-mediated destruction of the pancreatic β-cells in
the islets of Langerhans, which form 2-5% of the pancreas. Although the vast majority of T1D research has
focused on structural and functional changes in the islets, substantial abnormalities in the exocrine pancreas
also occur with this disease. Acinar cells in the exocrine pancreas synthesize, store, and secrete digestive
enzymes into the duodenum. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of exocrine pancreas
dysregulation in the pathophysiology of T1D. This proposal specifically will define changes in central carbon and
lipid metabolism in the exocrine pancreas in T1D. I hypothesize that the T1D exocrine pancreas experiences
increased TCA cycle turnover and de novo lipogenesis (DNL). I will test this hypothesis through two specific
aims. Aim 1 will quantify changes in exocrine pancreatic central carbon metabolism in a transgenic mouse model
of T1D. Aim 2 will determine rates of lipid turnover in the exocrine pancreas. The experiments outlined in Aims
1 and 2 utilize a novel pancreas perfusion method to examine exocrine pancreas metabolism. In aim 1 this is
combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using hyperpolarized substrates as well as gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to establish the significance of TCA cycle and glycolytic flux in the
exocrine pancreas in T1D pathogenesis. Aim 2 utilizes ex vivo, in vivo, and commercially available assays to
investigate flux through lipid metabolic pathways and lipid storage. This research plan addresses the unmet
biomedical need to understand acinar cell central carbon and lipid metabolism, thus provides critical
insight on mechanisms that drive exocrine dysfunction in T1D. The knowledge gained through this work
will serve as a foundation for understanding how exocrine pancreas dysregulation may affect T1D development
and subsequent β-cell dysfunction.
The fellowship training plan outlines three goals to accomplish my ultimate career goal of becoming an
independent investigator at a tier 1 research institution: i) increase technical expertise ii) improving scientific
communication and iii) engaging in mentorship. This proposal encompasses technical training in pancreas
physiology, stable isotope tracing, NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS, and metabolomics analysis. The Merritt research
group, the Advanced Magnetic Resonance and Spectroscopy (AMRIS) facility, and the Diabetes Institute at the
University of Florida provide an exceptional environment in which to acquire these skills. Furthermore, the Merritt
laboratory supports the improvement of my scientific communication and mentoring abilities. Ultimately, this
training environment is ideal to engage in career development and complete the proposed research."
10825003,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are disorders in which lung inflammation and scarring cause reduced lung
function. When seen in the context of connective tissue disease (CTD), ILDs are treated with generalized immune
suppression as mechanisms driving disease remain poorly understood. COPA syndrome is a monogenic
autosomal dominant autoimmune disease causing CTD ILD that often progresses despite immune suppression,
with several patients with this rare disease requiring lung transplant. Importantly, this syndrome provides a model
for identifying disease pathways driving CTD ILD. Studies from the laboratory of Dr. Anthony Shum (my sponsor)
defined COPA syndrome and determined that disease is caused by failed retrieval of stimulator of interferon
genes (STING) from the Golgi to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by coatomer subunit α (COPA). STING, a key
innate immune adaptor, can only signal from the Golgi, and our group and others have shown that the pathogenic
mechanism causing COPA syndrome is constitutive STING activation and signaling.
 COPA syndrome has a non-penetrance rate of ~30%, with unaffected carriers showing no signs of
disease. As STING drives pathogenesis of COPA syndrome, we hypothesized that STING alleles might act as
genetic modifiers impacting disease penetrance. Remarkably, we found perfect co-segregation of diseases non-
penetrance with heterozygosity for the common R71H-G230A-R293Q (HAQ) STING allele in 25 carriers of
pathogenic COPA mutations. As such, we propose HAQ STING as a suppressor allele for COPA syndrome.
This proposal seeks to define the mechanisms by which HAQ STING is protective in COPA syndrome.
 STING is an ER-localized signaling hub for innate immune activation in response to cytosolic DNA.
STING activation results in interferon signaling and multiple other outputs including NFkB activation, autophagy,
senescence, and cell death. While HAQ STING has been shown to have impaired interferon signaling, this allele
is highly prevalent (over 30% of non-Africans have at least one copy) and is thus likely to be competent for some
but not all STING roles. How HAQ STING confers protection in COPA syndrome will be determined at many
levels. Differences in HAQ STING in the presence or absence of pathogenic COPA mutations will be established
at the mRNA and protein expression levels, through intracellular localization in resting and stimulated cells, and
via interferon dependent and independent read outs of STING activation. With STING implicated broadly in ILD
and other forms of lung inflammation, these studies hold potential for identifying novel therapeutic approaches
for COPA syndrome and other forms of ILD. Discovery of additional disease modifying approaches is critically
needed as ILDs have limited treatment options, resulting in high morbidity and mortality."

In the United States, the prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosed in adolescents has nearly
doubled in one decade and is projected to increase four-fold by 2050. Young adults less than 40 years old now
represent 15-20% of adults with T2D. Early-onset T2D in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) is associated
with earlier and higher rates of failed glycemic control, cardiovascular disease, microvascular complications, and
mortality compared to T2D that develops after age 40 years old. Accelerated decline in b-cell function is thought
to underlie the aggressive T2D phenotype in AYAs. The T2D glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist therapies
(GLP-1 RAs) achieve glycemic control by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion. However, the real-
world effectiveness and utilization of GLP-1 RAs in young adults with T2D compared to other second-line non-
insulin diabetes therapies are unknown. Furthermore, recent GLP-1 RA shortages, known racial/ethnic
disparities in access to novel diabetes medications, and the disproportionally increased risk of T2D among
minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged AYAs, all raise additional concerns regarding AYA access to
GLP-1 RAs. The overarching goal of this training program is to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and
utilization of GLP-1 RAs in AYAs with T2D using the TriNetX network database, a large-scale electronic health
record database. In Aim 1, a retrospective incident user cohort design will be used to emulate a target trial to
compare the real-world effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in achieving and maintaining glycemic control in young adults aged 18-30
years. In Aim 2, an interrupted time series will be used to examine changes in utilization of GLP-1 RAs in AYAs
10 to 30 years old since FDA approval of the GLP-1 RA, liraglutide, for adolescents in June 2019 and use
multivariable logistic regression to identify patient characteristics associated with lower utilization of GLP-1 RAs.
The proposed study will provide insights in how to best optimize treatment of T2D in AYAs and lead to future
studies evaluating interventions to increase utilization of these treatments. This grant will provide Dr. Chu with
valuable training in epidemiologic research methods. She will obtain intensive training in complex observational
study design, biostatistics, and database management by accomplishing the above aims and through formal
coursework as part of her Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology degree program. Her research training will
also involve mentors with complementary expertise in pharmacoepidemiology and patient-oriented research in
diabetes who are focused on her career development into a physician-scientist. The data obtained from this
proposal will inform the design of future studies in optimizing treatment and access of medications in AYAs with
T2D to prevent long-term diabetes-related complications, which will be the focus of her K23 application."
10825714,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, with a median survival rate of
less than 16 months after diagnosis. Despite extensive research efforts, GBM remains incurable due to its highly
invasive that make complete surgical resection nearly impossible and tumor recurrence inevitable. While it is
recognized that GBMs characteristic invasion is the major determinant of poor clinical outcome, the genetic and
epigenetic regulation of GBM invasion remains poorly understood. To improve GBM treatment options, a
comprehensive understanding of the genetic and epigenetic regulation of GBM invasion along with efficient
targeting modalities are urgently needed. Recent efforts from our lab have included an analysis of human
histology and single-cell RNA sequencing data from ten GBM patients classified as invasive or nodular. Through
these experiments, we identified Crystallin Alpha B (CRYAB) as the top candidate gene upregulated in invasive
GBM samples and saw that overexpression of CRYAB in-vivo increased the invasive phenotype and resulted in
rapid post-operative tumor recurrence. Although these studies suggest that targeting genetic regulators of
invasion may serve as a promising therapeutic for GBM outcome, these analyses were performed by comparing
invasive and noninvasive samples from different patients, and the mechanism by which these invasive genes
drive invasion, including chromatin accessibility that regulates their expression, and how these invasive cells
interact with various cell types of the tumor microenvironment remains unexplored. Therefore, a comprehensive
analysis that elucidates both the genetic and epigenetic regulators of GBM invasion with spatial context in GBM
samples from the same patient are warranted. In Aim 1 I will perform spatial single cell RNA sequencing and
spatial Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) sequencing on GBM tumor samples with matched
pieces from identified contrast enhancing tumor core and non-contrast enhancing invasive tumor. With this
dataset, I will distinguish invasive tumor cells from cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and noninvasive
tumor bulk, and use this data to identify novel genetic and epigenetic regulators of GBM invasion. In Aim 2, I will
explore the mechanism and evaluate the in-vitro and in-vivo impact targeting i) previously identified invasive
gene CRYAB, and ii) candidate gene identified in Aim 1, has on the invasive phenotype by leveraging our lab’s
expertise in nanoparticle design and synthesis for delivery of genetic materials. This research will reveal critical
insight into the mechanisms underlying GBM invasion and progression, and may also provide candidates to
serve as novel prognostic and therapeutic candidates."
10932207,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 29.5 million people over the age of 12 in the US had alcohol use disorder (AUD) according to the
2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Chronic alcohol use can lead to the emergence of cognitive
deficits, particularly working memory, which persist during alcohol withdrawal and abstinence increasing the
odds of relapse. Approved treatments for alcohol use disorder are not designed to treat alcohol-induced cognitive
dysfunction, so understanding potential mechanisms is necessary to develop new treatments. The nucleus
reuniens of the thalamus (RE) is a ventral midline thalamic nucleus that plays a key role in cognitive function,
such as spatial working memory, attention, and behavioral flexibility. The RE is also bidirectionally connected to
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus, which have been highly studied in AUD and cognition.
Despite its interconnectedness, the RE is understudied in the alcohol field. In my preliminary studies, I induced
alcohol dependence using chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure (4 cycles) in male and female
C57BL/6J mice. Following CIE, mice were either tested on a T-maze delayed alternation spatial working memory
task or sacrificed for whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to measure intrinsic excitability in the RE. Mice
used in the T-maze task were trained prior to CIE and tested following 2 and 4 cycles, to track cognitive decline
across the development of dependence. Both male and female mice exhibited significant deficits in performance
after CIE. Despite this similar behavioral phenotype, CIE had divergent effects on intrinsic excitability, causing
an increase in firing in females and a decrease in males. I also found that firing in the RE in the absence of
alcohol exposure appeared to be sex-dependent, where males have significantly greater excitability than
females. These results indicated that the RE could be an exciting new target for the study of chronic alcohol-
induced cognitive deficits. The overall hypothesis of this research proposal is that chronic alcohol exposure
causes sex-dependent functional adaptations to the RE and that regulating RE activation will improve cognitive
performance. To achieve this, the proposal uses a multi-technical approach to study the RE in vivo and in slice
physiology. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine if chronic alcohol exposure alters the function of the RE using
fiber photometry during performance on a spatial working memory task and whether normalizing aberrant activity
using optogenetics will improve cognitive performance in CIE-exposed mice. Aim 2 of this proposal will
characterize the effect of CIE exposure on the physiology of RE neurons involved in mPFC and hippocampal
circuitry by recording intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission from neurons that project to the mPFC, the
hippocampus, or both. The results of these experiments will serve as landmark studies for the role of the RE in
alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and allow us to further understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive
deficits following chronic alcohol."
10828318,"Title: Epigenetic Regulation of Germ Cell Differentiation from a Stem Cell Lineage
Project Summary:
 Many human diseases are caused by imbalances between self-renewal/proliferation versus
differentiation of adult stem cells. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the molecular and cellular mechanisms
that regulate stem cell function to understand the diseases such as cancers and tissue degeneration. Additionally,
to utilize stem cells in therapeutic applications, it is critical to understand the mechanisms that maintain stem
cells, regulate proper proliferation of progenitor cells and program cellular differentiation in stem cell lineages.
Stem cell-based regenerative medicine also holds promise for diseases such as cancers, neurodegeneration,
muscle dystrophy, diabetes, and infertility.
 A broad definition of epigenetic mechanisms refers to DNA-associated factors that change gene
expression without altering the primary DNA sequences. Epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles in defining
stem cell identity and regulating stem cell activity. Among known epigenetic regulators, the Polycomb group
(PcG) transcriptional repressive proteins have critical functions in multiple stem cell lineages across different
species from Drosophila to mammals. In addition to their well-characterized functions in silencing gene
expression, studies from many labs have shown other roles of PcG in areas such as DNA replication and cell
cycle progression.
 My lab uses the Drosophila male germline stem cell (GSC) lineage as a model system to investigate
how epigenetic mechanisms regulate stem cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and dedifferentiation.
Our previous studies have shed light on epigenetic mechanisms in regulating multiple events in GSC lineage
including GSC maintenance and germ cell differentiation. Our recent work reveals under-appreciated functions
of DNA replication and potentially new roles of epigenetic regulators such as Polycomb (Pc). We propose to
use well-established and newly developed methods in molecular genetics, cell biology, biophysics and
genomics to provide an in-depth and systematic understanding of how key epigenetic players regulate stem cells
in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have a broad impact on stem cell biology, germ cell
biology, DNA replication, chromatin biology, cancer biology, reproductive biology, and regenerative medicine."

The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize and automate our existing online platform for recruitment,
screening, and longitudinal monitoring of elders to accelerate interdisciplinary clinical aging research. This will
be accomplished using the Brain Health Registry (BHR), an online registry and cohort with over 62,000
participants enrolled. The BHR collects longitudinal cognitive, health, and lifestyle data using self- and study
partner-report surveys and neuropsychological tests. The BHR platform has been used by many collaborators.
We will expand platform capabilities, optimize for efficient deployment in research settings, and automate manual
steps for scalability. We will facilitate the work of multiple clinical researchers by providing them user friendly
access to the BHR website, software and data. Specific Aims:
1. Study Partner First: Currently an innovative online BHR tool collects study partner (SP) information, but an
enrolled BHR participant must nominate a SP to join. We will develop and deploy SP-First to allow SPs to be
recruited de novo and for the SP to be the first or only point of contact with BHR. This will facilitate recruitment
and engagement of older adults into BHR and eventually into other Alzheimer’s disease (AD) studies and clinical
trials.
2. Referrals: To optimize and automate our current system which has referred over 27,000 BHR participants to
clinical AD and aging studies, including clinical trials and observational studies. This will greatly increase use of
this program, with the overall goal of facilitating recruitment and screening for AD and aging clinical studies.
3. Co-enrollments: To optimize and fully automate our current system for enrolling existing clinical cohorts in
BHR with data linkage. We will automate the co-enrollment process for investigators to enable efficient, scalable,
and adaptation of the tool for multiple aging studies. Co-enrollment can facilitate validation of online methods,
and is likely to improve longitudinal engagement and retention of participants in in-clinic studies.
4. Software as a Service (SaaS): BHR licenses the BHR platform as a software service to collaborators who
will create their own registries or referral programs under their own IRB, removing the need to create new registry
platforms. We will automate the SaaS process to facilitate highly scalable use by many investigators.
5. Data Sharing: To automate the process of data linkage, creating datasets, enabling highly scalable data
access, and data distribution. De-identified data from the general BHR study data will be made available to the
research community. A novel interface will allow investigators to query the database, create customized
datasets, upload and download data. In addition, we will expand and automate the capability to collect biofluids
for biomarker and genetic testing, and to integrate biofluids data into the BHR database.
Our innovative, highly-scalable platform will be of great value to investigators by providing them with user-friendly
internet tools for recruitment, assessment and longitudinal monitoring of their cohorts."

 Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the largest population of adolescents living with HIV
(ALWH). Engaging ALWH in HIV care is challenging and reflected in lower rates of viral
suppression and higher rates of loss to follow-up as compared to adults in the region. Depression
has been identified as a significant barrier to initiating and remaining in HIV care. Indeed, this is
the case for ALWH in Malawi where estimates of viral suppression range from 40%-78% and
estimates of depression range from 18-26%. Resource-appropriate interventions that improve
depression and address engagement in HIV care for ALWH are urgently needed.
 The Friendship Bench (FB) is an evidence-based depression counseling intervention
delivered by trained, supervised lay health workers. It is proven to reduce depression in the
general population in low-resource settings but has not been adapted to be youth-friendly or
enhanced with peer support to facilitate engagement in HIV care among ALWH. FB is based on
problem-solving therapy, which offers an ideal framework for youth-friendly adaption and
integration of retention peer support into a proven depression treatment model.
 Our long-term goal is to adapt, test, and scale up resource-appropriate interventions to
reduce depression and improve engagement in HIV care amongst ALWH. Our specific aims are:
1) to conduct formative research for youth-friendly adaptation and peer support enhancement of
FB; 2) to adapt the evidence-based FB protocol to meet the developmental and contextual needs
of ALWH and enhance this adapted FB protocol with peer support to facilitate HIV care
engagement among ALWH; and 3) to determine the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the
Adapted and Enhanced FB protocols to improve depression and engagement in HIV care among
ALWH. For the latter, we will conduct a 3-arm individually randomized pilot study to compare the
adapted FB and the enhanced FB to standard care. The proposed aims pave the way for a R01
application to test the adapted and enhanced Friendship Bench interventions in a cluster
randomized controlled trial and represent an important step forward towards improving
depression among ALWH."
10828412,"Craniofacial bone loss in children is common due to traumatic and congenital causes. Costs attributed to just
the repair of craniofacial bone loss in the US currently is estimated to be up to $549 million/year, and there is
no regenerative option for pediatric cases. Autologous bone graft harvest is the only surgical approach to
replace craniofacial bone and revision surgeries are necessary due to the limited supply. Bone graft harvest
requires prolonged operative time, overnight stay in the hospital, hip pain and risk of hip fracture. Current bone
regenerative strategies exist for adult spine surgery patients (BMP2); however none exist for children due to
potential carcinogenicity of BMP2 in children. Our group identified Jagged1 as a potential bone regenerative
therapy based on in vitro and in vivo studies following deletion of Jagged1 from the cranial neural crest (CNC)
(JAG1CKO). Human mutations in JAGGED1 cause Alagille syndrome which has cardiac, biliary and
craniofacial bone loss phenotypes and our model is a phenocopy of Alagille craniofacial bone loss. Our team
recently described that Jagged1 delivery in vitro and in vivo induces mineralization and ossification through
non-canonical Notch signaling suggesting that Jagged1 therapy is a potential bone regenerative strategy. Our
long-term goal is to develop bone regenerative approaches to treat craniofacial bone loss in children. The
overall objective in this application is to engineer, characterize and test a Jagged1-hydrogel as pre-clinical data
to develop human bone regenerative therapies. The central hypothesis is that Jagged1-hydrogel delivery can
induce human pediatric bone progenitors (HBO) to terminally differentiate to form bone through a Notch non-
canonical pathway using in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models. The rationale for the proposed research is that
the development of bone regenerative Jagged1 osteoinductive hydrogels is the first step towards a novel bone
tissue engineering solution for children. Guided by strong preliminary data, including a novel non-canonical
pathway, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Engineer Jagged1-presenting hydrogel
to induce pediatric HBO to form bone through Notch non-canonical signaling in vitro; 2) Test the in vivo ability
of Jagged1 hydrogels to regenerate bone in a pre-clinical animal model of craniofacial bone loss. In Aim 1 we
will engineer a synthetic hydrogel to present Jagged1, and then block canonical Notch signaling to test and
characterize the optimal cell-instructive cues for HBOs to mineralize through the Jagged1 non-canonical
pathway. In Aim 2 we will test the ability of optimized Jagged1-hydrogels in vivo to induce bone formation
using HBO cells in a murine craniofacial traumatic bone loss model and induce mesenchymal stem cells to
induce bone in an in vivo pre-clinical animal model. The proposed research is innovative in that we will
develop a novel Jagged1-hydrogel therapy targeting the Notch non-canonical pathway and test the Jagged1-
hydrogel therapy using pre-clinical models. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to the
first step to develop therapies for craniofacial bone loss, and is relevant to craniofacial and long bone repair."
10826074,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The growing prevalence of multifocal cerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs), also known as ""cerebral microbleeds,"" is
a significant and newly recognized problem in the aging population. These CMHs are major contributors to vascular
cognitive impairment (VCI) and gait and balance disorders, which are among the most common causes of falls in
older adults. Hypertension is the primary risk factor for CMHs in older adults, which are associated with the rupture
of small intracerebral vessels and progressive impairment of neuronal function. Despite affecting over 50% of older
individuals, the pathogenesis of CMHs remains obscure, and no therapeutic interventions are currently available for
their prevention. The objective of the present proposal is to elucidate the specific age-related mechanisms that lead
to increased cerebromicrovascular fragility and identify potential targets for prevention of CMHs using innovative
preclinical models. Results from recent studies provided insights into the cellular mechanisms by which aging may
increase cerebromicrovascular fragility and promote development of CMHs: increased presence of senescent
endothelial cells in the cerebral microcirculation. Our central hypothesis is that the accumulation of senescent
endothelial cells in the cerebral microcirculation, caused by aging, results in a microvascular phenotype that is prone
to fragility. Senescent cells release activated matrix metalloproteinases and other paracrine factors (""senescence-
associated secretory phenotype"" or SASP), which promote structural maladaptation to high pressure, degradation of
collagen and remodeling of extracellular matrix, thus creating loci of least resistance that can easily burst upon induction
of hypertension. We will combine advanced imaging techniques and cutting-edge transcriptomics to investigate
microvascular structure and gene expression in senescent cells in the cerebral microcirculation of aged mice. Our
prediction, based on our working hypothesis, is that elimination of senescent cells, either through genetic manipulation
(p16-3MR mouse model) or by pharmacological means will protect the structural integrity of cerebral vessels
preventing the development of CMHs. Specific Aims: 1) Determine the causal link between increased presence of
senescent cells in the microcirculation and genesis of CMHs in aged mice. 2) Determine whether induction of
accelerated senescence exacerbates CMHs in young mice, mimicking the aging phenotype. 3) Determine how
senescence promotes a pro-fragility phenotype in cerebral microvessels. Together, the proposed studies will identify
a fundamental mechanism responsible for age-related exacerbation of CMHs, and the resulting vascular-induced
neurological deficits. The increased presence of senescent cells in the microcirculation and consequential
degradation of cerebrovascular structural integrity are key contributors to this phenomenon. By uncovering these
mechanisms, our research will have a significant positive impact allowing us to develop novel, translationally relevant
interventional strategies for the prevention of CMHs. Ultimately, this will help protect cerebral function in the elderly

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infection worldwide and a major driver of antibiotic
resistance. Although many experimental staphylococcal vaccines have been reported, all vaccines
tested to date in human trials have failed for unclear reasons. Unlike mice, humans are exposed to S.
aureus beginning early in life, leading to generation of antibodies to S. aureus antigens. In preliminary
experiments, we have shown that select human anti-S. aureus antibodies are protective, but many are
not. In mice exposed to S. aureus, vaccination against protective antigens leads to immunity against S.
aureus whereas vaccination against non-protective antigens induced recall of non-protective immunity
which further interferes with protective antibodies by direct competition. Based on these findings, we
generated a model of how pre-existing antibodies shape vaccine responses and how this predicts novel
ways to develop effective vaccines against S. aureus. To query the validity of our model, in Aim 1, we
will recruit children and old adults with invasive S. aureus infections, survey the anti-S. aureus antibody
profile and define functionally protective antibody responses to S. aureus antigens. In Aim 2, we will
identify and characterize protective and non-protective anti-S. aureus antibodies from candidate
samples acquired in Aim 1, and assess structural and functional features of the specific antibodies that
confer protection or non-protection. In Aim 3, we will study these antibodies and their target in the
context of naïve mice and mice previously exposed to S. aureus. We will evaluate mechanisms
whereby non-protective memory shapes vaccine efficacy and test strategies that circumvent
interference. Overall, using the novel model systems, we aim to develop a more predictive framework
for explaining staphylococcal vaccine failures and developing novel strategies for effective vaccination
against S. aureus."
10862091,"Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, queer/questioning, and other sexual/gender
minority (LGBTQ+) Veterans have disproportionate risk for poor mental health outcomes and suicide. Despite
advances in VHA LGBTQ-affirmative care, systemic discrimination and barriers to accessing affirmative mental
health care continue to exacerbate mental health disparities. LGBTQ-Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT) is a unique intervention with a strong evidence base for improving mental health among LGBTQ+
individuals. This intervention is ready for implementation, but it has not yet been implemented widely in VHA.
Additionally, despite models and frameworks focusing on the intersection of health equity and implementation
science, there is a lack of empirical evidence testing the impact of equity-focused implementation strategies.
Significance: Points of significance include: 1) High rates of suicide among LGBTQ+ Veterans and few
evidence-based solutions for this population, 2) Focus on LGBTQ+ equity and collaboration/power-sharing,
both of which are part of the VHA Strategic Plan, and 3) Strong partnerships with operations partners and
Veteran-led community partners to enable quick action on study findings.
Innovation & Impact: Points of innovation include: a) First known study to test implementation of an LGBTQ-
affirmative mental health treatment within VA or the broader community, b) Unique emphasis on power-sharing
and participatory methods to incorporate health equity into rigorous implementation science methodology, and
c) First known clinical trial to leverage a validated natural language processing-based algorithm to identify an
electronic, administrative cohort of LGBTQ+ Veterans to test effectiveness outcomes.
Specific Aims: The objective of this project is to use a hybrid type III implementation-effectiveness trial design
to test provider-level and Veteran-level outcomes associated with an Equity-Focused Implementation Package
to increase adoption and sustainment of LGBTQ-Affirmative CBT. The study includes the following specific
aims: 1) to refine an Equity-Focused Implementation Package for improving uptake of LGBTQ-Affirmative CBT;
2a) To conduct a multi-site cluster-randomized trial of 12 facilities comparing a Standard Implementation
Package to an Equity-Focused Implementation Package; 2b) To qualitatively examine equity-related
determinants of implementation across sites; and 3) To estimate the reach and effectiveness of the Equity-
Focused Implementation Package among LGBTQ+ Veterans between implementation arms.
Methodology: This cluster-randomized trial will include 12 facilities randomized 1-to-1 to receive either a
Standard Implementation Package (train-the-trainer, access to self-guided training, free treatment manuals,
and national consultation calls) or an Equity-Focused Implementation Package (Standard Implementation plus
6 equity-focused implementation strategies). The primary implementation outcome is adoption, as measured
by the rate of psychotherapists delivering at least one session of LGBTQ-Affirmative CBT. Effectiveness
outcomes include clinically significant change in depression (primary) and likelihood of self-injurious thoughts
or behaviors (secondary). The study includes three key phases of implementation based on the EPIS
Framework (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment): refining the Equity-Focused
Implementation Package using implementation mapping methodology with adaptations to incorporate power-
sharing and equity focus; implementing the intervention using two separate, randomized implementation
conditions; and removing external implementation to observe sustainment of the intervention.
Next Steps/Implementation: Dissemination and implementation activities will be carried out in partnership
with the study Workgroup, operations partners, and Veteran-led community organizations, and will be directed
within and outside of VHA. Additionally, the Equity-Focused Implementation Package will be considered as a
promising practice for widespread VHA implementation."
10862195,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is more prevalent in Veterans than civilians, leading to ALS being considered
a Service-Connected condition by the VA. ALS features incomplete degeneration of upper and lower motor
neuron pathways within the spinal cord, a circumstance resembling that of spinal cord injury (SCI).
Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) has demonstrated remarkable potential to activate damaged
circuits after SCI to improve motor and autonomic function.
Partly funded by a prior RR&D SPiRE award (RX002527), we have preliminary data demonstrating that pairing
subthreshold cervical TSCS pulses with suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses can
enhance hand muscle motor evoked potentials when the cortical pulse reaches the cervical spinal cord 0-5
milliseconds prior to the spinal pulse. This evidence for immediate facilitation of the response to one pair of
pulses suggests that if given repetitively, this approach could mediate spinal cord associative plasticity
(SCAP) outlasting the period of paired stimulation. We propose that increasing neural plasticity in this manner
could be applied as a method to strengthen volitional (cortical) motor output and/or to 'prime' weakened circuits
for improved responses to task-oriented exercise.
Both exercise and neuromodulation are understudied in ALS. Though not likely to cure the underlying disease
mechanism, these approaches have the potential to mediate symptomatic benefit. We strive to find better ways
to conduct disease-oriented research that may provide direct clinical benefit to research participants with
ALS and simultaneously increase scientific understanding. Additionally, most ALS clinical study entry criteria
heavily favor those at earlier stages of disease. Strict entry criteria are understandable from the scientific
perspective. However, we have repeatedly observed the frustration and rejection felt by individuals with ALS
who cannot enter clinical trials. Our proposed study does not restrict entry by time since symptom onset. We
thereby hope to produce more generalizable knowledge by performing a phased study:
1. Optimization: SCAP synaptic pairing interval and repetitive frequency pattern will be individually
 optimized to enhance hand muscle excitability and dexterity. We hypothesize that pairs of stimuli with
 TMS arriving at the cervical spinal cord up to 2 ms prior to TSCS, delivered in an ‘intermittent theta burst’
 pattern, will produce the strongest facilitation of hand neural circuits.
2. Consolidation: Two-week programs of SCAP alone versus exercise alone versus SCAP plus task-
 oriented hand exercise will be compared. We hypothesize that the combined intervention will result in
 greater and longer lasting physiological and clinical benefits than either modality by itself.
There are currently no clinical studies in the world involving magnetic brain paired with phasic electrical spinal
stimulation for ALS. Therefore, safety needs to be meticulously tracked. Aside from detailed clinical safety
measures, we will analyze serum biomarkers drawn at baseline and various stages of the study to better
understand whether baseline levels of neurodegenerative, excitotoxic, inflammatory, and neurotropic
biomarkers associate with either beneficial or detrimental responses to SCAP and exercise interventions."
10862405,"SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in the US, with ~20,000 new diagnoses
and ~11,000 deaths per year. This pernicious hematological malignancy has rapid progression and startling
mortality in untreated patients. This is particularly true for elderly patients (i.e., > 65 years of age), where up to
70% of newly diagnosed patients succumb within a year. These patients have worse prognoses, often cannot
tolerate the most aggressive (and effective) treatment courses, are less likely to obtain complete remission af-
ter standard induction and consolidation treatment, and are more likely to have serious complications and side
effects. Using bioinformatic and bench approaches, we found the leukemic cells show striking sensitivity to mi-
tochondrial toxins. Our subsequent research identified a correlation between lower coupling efficiency in the
mitochondria of AML cells and increased sensitivity to mitochondrial damage. We showed strong synergy be-
tween multiple combinations of mitochondria-targeting molecules and known anti-cancer agents in AML, but
not healthy cells, selectively killing cancer cells. We hypothesized that hematological cancers accrue substan-
tial mitochondrial damage but reduce activation of mitochondrial recycling (mitophagy), likely in an effort to
maintain their cell division potential. However, over-activating mitophagy causes a crisis that triggers pro-
grammed cell death pathways. To leverage these findings, we performed a high-throughput screen and identi-
fied 8 compounds that increased levels of mitophagic activator kinase PINK1, driving mitochondrial turnover.
Iterative structure-activity relationship studies yielded two analogs, named PS127B and PS127E, with CC50AML
in the nM range; healthy cells survived the drug at up to 20 times these concentrations. These molecules inhib-
it mitochondrial function, reduce oxygen consumption and ATP production, and activate several programmed
cell death pathways. These compounds also synergized with known AML chemotherapeutics, were effective
against primary AML cells (including leukemia stem cells), and reduced tumor burden and extended survival
in mice engrafted with human leukemia cells. A subsequent in silico screen of over 4 M compounds using two
predicted activities (apoptotic agonist and thioredoxin glutathione reductase inhibition) shared by multiple cyto-
toxic PS127-family members (but missing for non-cytotoxic members) identified 213 hits. 93 of these hits were
in a cluster of compounds with chemical similarity to the PS127 family. 23 others were in a second group,
structurally related to each other, but not to PS127. In this project, we will validate cheminformatics predictions
of these comounds’ molecular targets, determine their effects on cellular metabolism, and confirm that they
trigger mitophagic activation via the PINK1/Parkin axis in mammalian cells. Completion of the proposed exper-
iments will identify and characterize high-value leads for future pre-clinical studies of in murine models engraft-
ed with patient-derived leukemia cells, including PK/PD and treatment efficacy. This work will also validate tar-
geting mitochondria for autophagic degradation as a therapeutic strategy for AML."
10863918,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiomyopathies occur in ~1:200 individuals and are commonly caused by inheritance of variants in genes that
encode proteins that regulate the sarcomere, the force-producing organelle of heart cells. Due to an incomplete
understanding of variant pathogenicity and cardiomyopathy pathogenesis, physicians are currently limited in
their ability to provide diagnoses, prognoses, and therapeutic options for cardiomyopathy patients. Variants in
the TTN gene, which encodes the sarcomere protein titin, are the most frequently identified genetic lesion in
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is characterized by heart chamber dilation, reduced contractile function,
risk of sudden death, and progressive heart failure. The most frequent type of TTN variant identified in DCM is
a truncation mutation that would be predicted to shorten TTN protein length and to reduce TTN protein quantities.
Significantly, truncation variants localized to distal TTN structural domains are more pathogenic than those
localized to proximal structural domains, but the mechanistic basis for this relationship is uncertain. It remains
incompletely understood how TTN truncation variants cause DCM generally, which is compounded by our lack
of understanding of the ‘length dependence’ of TTN variant pathogenicity. These knowledge gaps limit disease
prognostication, biomarker identification, and therapeutic development for DCM patients. The central goal of
our study is to define how disruptions in TTN length and dosage by TTN variants cause DCM, and exploit this
knowledge to develop DCM therapeutics for TTN variant carriers. We hypothesize that healthy cardiac
contractile function and structure depends on the regulation of TTN length and dosage, and that varying
pathogenicity of TTN truncation can be explained by distinct structural and functional consequences associated
with the specific site of truncation. In Aim 1, we will determine the functional consequences of TTN truncations
across structural domains by harnessing 3-dimensional heart tissue models composed of human cardiomyocytes
differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells in which variants have been introduced by CRISPR-mediated
genome editing. We will interrogate these models for tissue mechanical phenotypes (such as passive tension
and Frank-Starling behavior), TTN protein length and levels (using specialized methods), proteostasis stress
pathway responses (using immunoblotting), and mechanotransduction signaling and alternative splicing (using
expression analysis and transcriptomics, respectively). In Aim 2, we will restore TTN protein levels using the
recently developed method of CRISPR activation applied to DCM engineered heart tissue models for both
evaluating the function of TTN isoforms generally and as a DCM proof-of-concept therapeutic. Through these
Aims, we will gain critical new insights into the pathophysiology of DCM-associated TTN truncation variants,
uncover features to explain the variable pathogenicity identified in DCM patients, and develop a therapeutic to
target TTN directly. We anticipate this new knowledge will improve physicians’ capacity to diagnose, prognose,
and treat patients with DCM due to TTN variants."
10839443,"Insulin resistance plays a major role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, which is emerging as one of the
most critical global health challenges of the 21st century. Despite its significant contributions to whole body
glucose production, surprisingly little is known regarding insulin action and insulin resistance in the kidney in
vivo. While gluconeogenesis from the renal cortex is responsible for all of the glucose production from the kidney,
it remains unknown what role insulin plays in regulating renal cortical metabolic fluxes, such as gluconeogenesis,
mitochondrial anaplerosis, and mitochondrial substrate oxidation. Furthermore, it is widely debated if the kidney
becomes insulin resistant. As such, the molecular mechanisms of lipid-induced renal cortical insulin resistance
have not been well characterized. Recently, our laboratory has generated compelling data demonstrating that
increases in plasma membrane sn-1,2-diacylglycerol content leads to activation of PKCe which in turn
phosphorylates insulin receptor kinase threonine1150 resulting in reduced insulin receptor kinase activity and
insulin resistance in vivo. This mechanism of lipid-induced insulin resistance has now been demonstrated to
occur in liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in mice, rats and humans, raising the possibility of an
evolutionarily conserved, whole-body mechanism of lipid-induced insulin resistance that may also extend to the
renal cortex. In addition, our group has also recently demonstrated a critical role for acetyl-CoA in the regulation
of hepatic gluconeogenesis by insulin and its dysregulation during obesity-associated white adipose tissue
dysfunction in vivo. However, the role of acetyl-CoA in the regulation of renal cortical gluconeogenesis in vivo is
unknown. This proposal seeks to build upon our strong Preliminary Data demonstrating a key role of plasma
membrane sn-1,2-diacylglycerols and PKCe activation in mediating high fat diet (HFD)-induced renal cortical
insulin resistance in awake rodents. We will also employ state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry methods to assess in vivo rates of renal cortical pyruvate dehydrogenase flux, mitochondrial
succinate dehydrogenase flux, glutaminase flux and pyruvate carboxylase flux for the first time, in combination
with unique transgenic rodent models to thoroughly characterize the pathophysiology and mechanisms of lipid-
induced renal cortical insulin resistance and lipid-induced alterations in renal cortical gluconeogenesis and
mitochondrial substrate oxidation. This proposal will also assess the effects of a controlled release mitochondrial
protonophore (CRMP) in reversing HFD-induced renal cortical insulin resistance. It is anticipated that the results
of these studies will provide important new insights into: 1) the molecular mechanisms of lipid-induced renal
cortical insulin resistance, 2) insulin regulation of renal cortical gluconeogenesis and renal cortical mitochondrial
oxidation in vivo, 3) HFD diet-induced dysregulation of renal cortical gluconeogenesis and renal cortical
mitochondrial oxidation in vivo and 4) lead to the development of novel agents to treat type 2 diabetes."
10863828,"Project Summary
The Cardiovascular Surgery Research Training Program’s main objective is to prepare full-time academic
cardiovascular surgeons, clinicians and scientists in cardiac and vascular basic and translational research. This
objective will be accomplished by an outstanding mentored research experience and rigorous programs of
didactic and career development training in a multidisciplinary setting. The overall goal is to train 4 postdoctoral
MD, PhD, and MD/PhD fellows per year in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research where trainees and faculty
will interact closely. This training Program is designed to train and prepare the trainees to conduct research using
state-of-the-art methods, conceptualize research problems, and publish research findings for successful
academic careers as independent investigators. The fundamental need for research training in cardiovascular
surgery is highlighted by studies showing that the number of clinician/surgeons and PhD scientists in translational
CVD research continues to decline. Furthermore, research findings demonstrate that clinician-scientists who are
most successful to date are the ones who have undergone a period of intense research training for two or more
years as an integral part of their training. One- to two-year training of PhD scientists during their early
postdoctoral training period will certainly help build a solid knowledge- and experience-based foundation to
become excellent cardiovascular researchers in the coming days. Upon completion of this training program the
cardiac and vascular surgeons and the cardiologists will be able to better integrate into the rapidly expanding
and changing fields of specialized cardiovascular medicine and surgery. In parallel, in addition to having state-
of-the-art cardiovascular research experience, the postdoctoral PhD scientists will be well-trained to address the
major cardiovascular health issues, research questions and challenges of the day. While there are a few good
training programs in cardiac medicine and surgical research, they tend to be limited in focus to certain specific
issues such as transplantation, ventricular mechanics, and gene and cell-based therapies. The proposed training
Program has been built upon an integrated approach to the training of a new generation academic cardiovascular
surgeons and scientists, which in turn will result in excellent quality of teaching, success of research funding,
and publication of high quality basic and translational research findings in the field of cardiovascular research."
10863942,"ABSTRACT
The Director-General of the World Health Organization has called for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) elimination
by 2030. Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a ~10-fold higher risk of ICC. There is an urgent need for high
quality evidence on optimal strategies for ICC prevention directly applicable to WLWH who face a disparate
burden of cervical precancer and ICC.
We will establish a CASCADE Network UG1 Research Base (RB) at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
(UNC) to prevent ICC among WLWH. The overarching goal of this UNC RB proposal is to develop, test, and
implement effective, scalable, and cost-effective screening and treatment strategies to reduce ICC among
WLWH. We will develop, implement, and analyze innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials in the
CASCADE Network focus areas of “Improving the Management of Screen Positives” and “Optimizing Precancer
Treatment”. The UNC RB will be composed of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and training experts
with decades of research experience on ICC prevention and HIV in both LMIC and the US. Our multi-disciplinary
team has expertise in implementation science, screening with automated visual evaluation (AVE), pathology,
and cost-effectiveness analyses.
In Aim 1, we will Develop CASCADE Network trials of evidence-based interventions to optimize the screening
for and management of cervical precancer among WLWH by 1) providing scientific, clinical and statistical
expertise to develop innovative concepts and protocols for novel, yet pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trials, and 2) creating organized processes to efficiently develop concepts and protocols by
leveraging diverse input from the UNC RB Scientific, Statistical, Clinical Sites Advisory, Patient Advocacy
Advisory, and Scientific Advisory Committees. As an illustrative example of a potential clinical trial for “Improving
Management of Screen-Positives”, we propose Protocol 1, a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to Evaluate
AVE triage versus HPV-and-treat among HPV-positive WLWH for CIN2+ prevention. For “Optimizing Precancer
Treatment”, we propose Protocol 2, a Hybrid Type 1 trial to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant, self-
administered intravaginal topical therapy following primary 2/3 treatment to prevent CIN2+ recurrence among
WLWH. Outcomes for both trials will include clinical effectiveness for precancer, implementation outcomes, and
cost effectiveness analyses. In Aim 2, we will ensure successful Implementation and Analysis of CASCADE
Network trials by providing scientific, clinical and statistical expertise, operational support, and regulatory
oversight. In Aim 3, we will provide Rigorous Foundational Clinical and Research Training for UG1 Clinical
Sites and Early-Stage Investigators to design and implement clinical effectiveness research. If successful,
CASCADE Trial findings will advance clinical screening and treatment guidelines for WLWH in LMIC and United
States."
10863944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biophysical cues encoded in the structure, mechanics, and dimensionality of the stem cell microenvironment are
now appreciated as important regulators of self-renewal and differentiation. For the past 15+ years, including
two periods of R01 support, we have been exploring mechanistic and translational aspects of this regulation in
hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), which generate new neurons into adulthood and contribute to
neurological disease and repair. We have made several important contributions to the field’s understanding of
stem cell mechanobiology, including the discovery that NSC lineage decisions are maximally sensitive to
extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics within a restricted temporal window, during which stiffness cues are
processed by a signaling network that includes RhoA GTPase, actin/myosin, angiomotin, YAP, and β-catenin.
Our discoveries raise two important questions of general interest to the stem cell field, which will serve as the
foundation for our renewal application. First, what molecular mechanisms govern NSC mechanosensitive lineage
commitment in three-dimensional (3D) ECMs, and how do these mechanisms differ from two-dimensional (2D)
ECMs? We will build on our exciting recent discovery that the transcription factor Egr1 is a critical, 3D-specific
regulator of NSC mechanosensitive lineage commitment. Second, how do stem cells dynamically integrate
mechanical inputs on the time scale of minutes to hours to trigger functionally important signaling events? Here
we will leverage our preliminary studies in which we have probed the timing of mechanosensitive signaling events
with mismatched DNA-crosslinked viscoelastic hydrogels and optogenetic reagents that allow timed activation
of RhoA and Cdc42 activation. We have two specific aims: In Aim 1, we will investigate mechanisms through
which Egr1 controls mechanosensitive lineage commitment in 3D matrices using a combination of 2D and 3D
engineered biomaterials, candidate-based molecular studies, and screens to identify Egr1 targets relevant to
neurogenesis. In Aim 2, we will investigate how stiffness cues from 2D ECMs are triggered on the minutes-to-
hours time scale are integrated over hours to days to control lineage commitment. Work in this aim builds on
our observation that timed optogenetic stimulation of RhoA and incorporation of viscous (loss) properties into
elastic ECMs both suppress NSC neurogenesis. We will identify critical regulatory time scales for both
perturbations and determine if they influence lineage commitment through common mechanisms. To integrate
aims, we will investigate the time-dependence of mechanosensitive lineage commitment in 3D ECMs and ask if
RhoA stimulation and stress relaxation act through Egr1 to suppress neurogenesis. Our work will accelerate the
field’s understanding of how stem cells sense and act upon mechanical signals to guide fate decisions, a problem
of high fundamental and translational value. We will also marry several innovative approaches, including
optogenetics, viscoelastic ECMs, genome editing, and sequencing/screening technologies. We expect that our
studies will provide an intellectual roadmap that can be applied to other ECM and stem cell systems."
10863945,"Neuropeptides are crucial in development and for a wide variety of behaviors including circadian rhythms and
sleep. This project has been using imaging to study synaptic neuropeptide release. For example, a new optical
method based on a fluorogen activating protein (FAP) has shown that activity-evoked synaptic neuropeptide
release occurs solely via fusion pores formed by kiss and run exocytosis. These experiments also established
that synaptic fusion pores open spontaneously at a low rate, thereby providing a basis for resting peptidergic
transmission. Furthermore, FAP imaging in the brain showed that Drosophila clock neurons release
neuropeptides daily with different rhythms from terminals and the soma. This differential timing is based on the
use of independent triggers: synaptic release requires Ca2+ influx as expected for release induced by electrical
activity, but somatic release is mediated by the biochemical signal IP3. Remarkably, perturbing the somatic
release mechanism alters specific features of circadian behavior and sleep. Thus, spatially and temporally
partitioned neuropeptide release controls rhythmic behaviors. In parallel, GFP-tagged neuropeptide imaging
led to the discovery of regulation of neuropeptide packaging by tyrosine phosphatases and new insights into
neuropeptide delivery, capture and release at synapses. Finally, G-protein coupled receptor GPCR activation-
based (GRAB) fluorescence sensors have been incorporated into our research to provide a new approach for
resolving release and the subsequent spread of neuropeptides in the brain. Here the above optical tools will be
used with Drosophila genetics to answer three questions posed by prior work on this project:
(a) How is daily IP3 signaling induced in clock neurons and coupled to somatic neuropeptide release and
regulation of rhythmic behaviors?
(b) How does multi-compartmental fusion pore opening and dilation orchestrate neuropeptide release at
native release sites?
(c) How are neuropeptide packaging, axonal transport and synaptic capture controlled to support
neuropeptide stores in release sites undergoing morphological plasticity (i.e., as occurs daily in clock neurons
and in motor neuron axonal arbors in response to retrograde signaling)?
These studies will reveal how surprising signaling-induced neuropeptide release from the soma participates the
peptidergic connectome. Furthermore, in vivo imaging will elucidate the process of neuropeptide release by
fusion pores. Finally, the cell biology underlying the support of peptidergic transmission during plasticity will be
determined for the first time. Thus, this project will yield fundamental insights into neuropeptide release and the
control of behavior, which are critical to the operation of the nervous system."
10864394,"Our patients, and the needs of the science, demand that we try to answer the difficult question, “what will
happen to me?”. In this renewal application of MADRC, an interdisciplinary Center for the study of Alzheimer’s
and related dementias at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, we will build on promising
scientific advances to contribute to answering this question. We propose 7 Cores (Administrative, Clinical,
Biomarker, Imaging, Neuropathology, Data, and Outreach) and a Research Education Component (REC).
Each Core has two major strategic goals: 1) to bring to bear each Core’s unique expertise to understand the
drivers of clinical progression in “normal” aging, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Lewy Body Disease (LBD), and
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTLD), and 2) to develop strategies and technologies to improve precision of
measuring pace of progression of both clinical symptoms and underlying disease processes. Our Research
Cohort, which has been rebuilt with a renewed commitment to priority populations, is a state-of-the-art clinical
phenotyping laboratory that will allow us to measure multiple aspects of pace of clinical progression across a
spectrum from normal cognition to mild dementia. We will, for example, develop digital phenotyping and
explore strategies to “take the research to the participant” to break down barriers and improve measurements.
The Biomarker Core uses single molecule detection (simoa) and other technologies focused on analytes
present in plasma that reflect brain pathologies, including tau, amyloid β, inflammation markers, and, in work
we are very excited about, synaptic loss. Our Imaging Core will, for the first time, be resourced to perform
longitudinal MRI and PET scans on the Research Cohort and will explore the use of novel MRI techniques that
promise additional precision. The Neuropath Core is building a set of matched brain/iPS cell pairs from
individuals with different (often mixed) etiologies of dementia and provided them to NCRAD to facilitate studies
of how disease related phenotypes measured in iPS cells relate to neuropathological changes in the brain, and
to clinical change. The Data Core has led major new “Big Data” initiatives and is the analytical engine of the
Center. The ORE Core brings to bear modern behavioral and community engaged research to our group. It
takes the lead in recruitment of a diverse cohort for MADRC studies, clinical trials, and other affiliated
programs, and in building effective networks of communication with the community and with health care
professionals in our eco-system. As a team, we will be able to explore potential drivers of clinical progression
comparing with markers of disease progression (eg amyloid and tau), neuroinflammation, vascular lesions and
neurodegeneration, appreciating that most of our participants will have multiple drivers of cognitive change,
and aware that these relationships may differ in different populations. Finally, education and training of the
next generation of clinicians and scientists is the mission of the REC, and an important component of each
Core. Working together, we hope to make a difference in these devastating diseases."

outlines the tactics: We created the strategic plan for this application, with a focus on two closely related topics:
understanding clinical progression and its relationship to markers of disease progression, and developing novel
techniques to improve measurement of both. We coordinate efforts of the various components of the Center
with each other, and coordinate planning for optimal utilization of resources within the Center and by
leveraging institutional capabilities. We also act as an interface for the Center to optimize connections with the

interactions to develop trans-ADRC and other outside research projects. We oversee the research and grant
administrative processes, including human subjects, animal welfare (if needed by a Developmental Project),
scientific integrity, data and sample sharing, and financial policy requirements. We ensure timely and complete
communication with NACC, timely and complete submission of samples to NCRAD, and continued
participation in NIA summits and similar national forums.
 The Director is assisted and advised by an Administrative team that runs day to day operations and
provides fiscal and regulatory oversight, an Executive Committee, composed of Core leaders, a Data-
Operations Committee charged with operational efficiency, an Internal Advisory Committee of institutional
leaders, and by a series of special purpose committees, including Developmental Projects, Clinical Research
Steering Committee (which also oversees clinical trials interactions), Tissue Distribution and Biofluid
Distribution Committees, Minority Inclusion Program Committee, the Community Advisory Board, and a REC

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Enrichment Program of the UT Southwestern NORC has been designed with three overlying goals in mind.
The first goal is to provide opportunities for the dissemination and exchange of knowledge among UT
Southwestern students, principal investigators and their research teams, and health care professionals
interested in nutrition and obesity research and in evidence-based clinical care of individuals with obesity. The
second goal is to foster interactions between nutrition and obesity researchers at UT Southwestern with those
at other NORC-funded institutions as well as institutions without NORC funding, as a means of facilitating the
exchange of ideas and collaborations. The third goal is to engage the North Texas and wider community at large
– both families and health professionals – in an effort to provide them knowledge on the science behind
overweight and obesity, to better equip them with evidence-based, best practice strategies for improving
metabolic health, and to familiarize them with the translational obesity-related research opportunities at UT
Southwestern. In order to achieve these goals, our program will institute the following elements: 1) a UT
Southwestern NORC Seminar Series, 2) the UT Southwestern NORC McGarry Symposium, 3) coursework and
journal clubs for students in a new Molecular Metabolism and Metabolic Diseases Graduate Track and for
students interested in nutrition and obesity who are currently funded by several T32 Training Programs on
Campus, 4) an Introduction to the UT Southwestern NORC Core Facilities Workshop, 5) a community outreach
program entitled, “UT Southwestern Weight Wellness and Healthy Lifestyle Day”, 6) an ongoing Podcast, and 7)
maintenance of an active and up-to-date social media presence. This program will facilitate the dissemination
and exchange of knowledge, will enhance educational opportunities, and will provide opportunities for outreach

team reflects expertise pertinent to our expanded focus on ambulatory methods for assessing exposures and
cognitive performance. As in prior funding periods, the Administrative Core will be responsible for management
of study resources, managing and integrating scientific research goals of the EAS P01, serving as a liaison
with collaborators, and recruitment and follow-up of study participants. These functions are carried out in
cooperation with four established committees. The Long-Term Planning Committee establishes programmatic
priorities, and coordinates allocation of resources to meet individual and overall project goals. The Scientific/
Administrative Committee monitors subject recruitment and retention, supervises data management, reviews
scientific advances and progress at regular meetings, promotes scientific collaborations with other aging
research programs at Einstein, and oversees the sharing of data and bio-specimens with consortia and
investigators at other institutions (e.g., management of resource sharing agreements). The Fiscal Oversight
Committee oversees management of budgets and personnel, including the preparation of annual progress
reports for the National Institute on Aging and the Einstein Institutional Review Board. The Administrative Core
will rely on an External Advisory Committee to provide input regarding analytic approaches, study procedures,
and long-term strategy, and will be responsible for coordinating regular meetings with them and for
implementing their recommendations and suggestions. The Administrative Core also will foster liaisons with
community groups to enhance community relationships and study participation and provide outreach to the
scientific community."
10857285,"ABSTRACT CLINICAL CORE
The Clinical Core (CC) supports the Einstein Aging Study Program Project (EAS P01) by collecting data for
key measures used to characterize the cohort, to define the primary cognitive outcomes for this P01 which
include cognitive performance, cognitive decline, mild cognitive decline and dementia. The core also manages
the collection of robust data regarding exposures and risk factors to be used by the Projects. These measures
cover multiple domains and include objective and subjective assessments collected using both conventional
clinic-based and ambulatory methods using smartphones and wearable devices. This Core has a strong track
record utilizing multiple modes of data collection including telephone evaluations, in-person and virtual visits,
ambulatory assessments, and at-home surveys to complete annual evaluations. The Clinical Core will 1) obtain
informed consent; 2) conduct evaluations that include medical and epidemiologic histories, psychosocial and
behavioral reports, annual neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, physical measures
(anthropometrics, blood pressure); 3) obtain fasting blood samples; 4) train participants in ambulatory and
remote data collection techniques; 5) conduct consensus case conferences to determine clinical cognitive
diagnosis (mild cognitive impairment, dementia and dementia subtypes); and 6) manage participant flow to the
Projects and Cores including MRI and consent for brain autopsy. The CC trains and manages the study staff
who conduct these assessments; we have an excellent record of staff retention across many years, who live in
the surrounding community and understand the needs and concerns of participants. The Clinical Core
cooperates with the Administrative Core to collect follow-up medical and neuropsychological information for
study participants no longer able to return for in-person evaluations. Data from the Clinical Core are used to
determine participant eligibility for the MRI sub-study. Finally, with the Biomarker Core, the Clinical Core
distributes samples to the appropriate labs, and banks biological specimens for current and future assays."
10865097,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This K01 award will be integral in the development of my career plan designed to extend my prior training
in nutrition and nutrition interventions to include skills in clinical assessment of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) research methods, cognitive theory and assessment, and metabolism themed MR neuroimaging tools.
My previous training briefly introduced me to AD research and confirmed that I am passionate about a career
in AD. Nutrition research in AD is a young and promising field that will require nutrition experts to gain
extensive training to understand AD and its assessment tools. To this end, I’ve assembled an expert mentor
and advisory committee to provide formal training in AD clinical assessment, cognition, and MR neuroimaging.
 I was appointed as an Assistant Professor on the Tenure Track in the KUMC Department of Dietetics and
Nutrition on September 22, 2019. I will take advantage of KUMC’s interdisciplinary culture and train under the
mentorship of Drs. Jeff Burns, Munro Cullum, and William Brooks. This will allow me to capitalize on several of
KUMC’s research strengths: the NIH-designated KU Alzheimer’s Disease Center (ADC), Hoglund Brain
Imaging Center, KUMC Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, and the Clinical and Translational Science Unit
(funded through an NIH CTSA). Dr. Cullum will provide valuable external institutional training in AD research
and cognition at UT Southwestern in Dallas, TX. The proposed K01 training will add to my well-developed
nutrition skillset and forge a path toward my overall goal to establish research independence in the field of
Nutritional Cognitive Neuroscience applying nutrition interventions and the neuroimaging and cognitive tools
learned in this K01 to AD research.
 The scientific goals of this project are to build upon my doctoral research investigating nutrition’s role in
AD risk. This is a growing field as current treatments for the disease are relatively ineffective and means for
preventing its development are highly sought after. I propose to build off of my previous work showing high
glycemic diet’s relationship with brain amyloid and investigate its relationship with AD risk using the tools
acquired from the training in this K01.
 Aim 1 will leverage a clinical cohort (P30 AG035982) of over 450 participants at the University of Kansas
Alzheimer’s Disease Center (KU ADC). This aim seeks to investigate the cross-sectional relationship of high
glycemic diet with cognition and MR-derived brain structure and blood flow in older adults with and without AD.
 Aim 2 will leverage an NIA-funded R01 (AG060157-01) study at KUMC investigating the role of
Mediterranean diet vs. low-fat diet interventions in AD prevention. The goal of this aim is to investigate whether
intervention-related changes in high glycemic diet explain changes in cognition and MR-derived brain structure
and metabolic profile. This aim will also explore whether the relationship between high glycemic diet and brain
health outcomes is mediated by changes in glucoregulation, as assessed by insulin resistance scores."

10864921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop a pathomics biosignature for aggressive melanoma to guide treatment decisions for
patients who have had a melanoma surgically removed but remain at high risk of recurrence and death. This is
a critical need because patients with stage II and III melanoma have an approximate 30% chance of dying of
melanoma over 10 years. Therapies have been shown to lessen recurrence risk, but they are toxic and costly.
Identifying patients who have truly been cured by the surgery and are cancer free would be tremendously useful
to guide patient care. It has been known for decades that the immune system limits melanoma progression and
that higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) portend a favorable outcome. Assessment of TILs,
however, involves a subjective determination by the pathologist using qualitative criteria and this approach is
prone to inter-observer variability. One barrier to the development of prognostic biomarkers in early stage
melanoma is that the tumors are tiny and most dermato-pathologists require that the entire sample be formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) for careful morphology analysis. In order to overcome this barrier, our team
has developed and published three digital pathology methods to estimate recurrence risk. These biomarkers are
based on the hypothesis that evidence of strong immune surveillance within the tissue indicates lower recurrence
risk and include quantitation of TILs using digital software, staining for macrophages and T cells using
quantitative- immune-fluorescence (qIF), and measurement of an interferon signature using NanoString
technology. Each of these methods provides unique information about the tumor immune micro-environment.
For example, NanoString provides genomic information but does not provide spatial information regarding the
locations of specific cell phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as qIF does. For instance, qIF revealed
the macrophages confer a poor prognosis specifically when located within the tumor stroma. In Aim 1 of the
proposal we validate three previously published biomarkers using 514 melanoma samples from Roswell
Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, The University of British Columbia, Yale School of Medicine, and
Geisinger Health Systems. Next, in Aim 2 of the proposal we propose an integrative systems biology approach
including transcriptomic, qIF, morphology analysis of TILS, and standard clinical and pathology features to
create a multi-parameter biosignature. First, we use the raw clinical and pathomics data to build a model
multiscale biomarker network of aggressive skin melanoma. Using a Bayesian network, we identify nodes that
determine the recurrence phenotype and identify new imaging and genomic targets that may enhance the
precision of our biomarker. We then construct a composite biosignature based on this network. Finally, we test
the new biosignature, as well as the original multiply validated biomarkers from Aim 1 in prospective retrospective
fashion on samples from the E1697 trial of adjuvant interferon for which there is over 10 years of follow up. The
retrospective prospective approach removes any selection bias introduced by retrospective study."
10864922,"The rate of obesity is particularly high in U.S. Veterans, conferring a substantial health burden. Eating
behaviors are one possible target for obesity prevention and management. As such, understanding factors
impacting eating behaviors in Veterans will be an important step as obesity rates continue to rise. A key
obstacle in understanding these factors, however, is the current lack of understanding of sex-based differences
in eating behaviors. Sex-based differences in eating behaviors are consistently observed. For example, women
are more likely to diet than men, express greater concern about weight control, and attribute greater
importance to healthy eating. Women also report more behaviors associated with eating disorders, and have
higher rates of obesity. Differences in eating behaviors and obesity rates between men and women involve a
number of factors, such as gonadal hormones, social pressures and norms, and physical activity engagement.
These factors also interact with neuronal processes involved in eating behaviors. A clear understanding of sex-
based differences in neuronal mechanisms underlying food intake has yet to be established, however. The
goal of this proposal, therefore, is to better understand how sex differences impact the neurobiology of hedonic
eating behaviors. This is particularly relevant to Veterans' health, as women are the fastest-growing population
of Veterans receiving healthcare at the VA, with almost 2 million living women Veterans.
 Understanding sex-based differences in the neurobiology underlying food intake behaviors, and how
gonadal hormones contribute to these differences, will be important for developing novel treatment methods for
overweight/obesity and weight maintenance. Hedonic eating, or eating beyond homeostatic needs, may be
particularly associated with obesity. As such, identifying sex-based differences in neurobiology underlying
hedonic eating is of particular relevance. To this end, we recently completed a preliminary study investigating
sex-based differences in neuronal responses to foods with high (vs. neutral) hedonic value, in both fasted and
fed states. Sex-based differences were observed in the fasted state, with greater responses in women
compared to men in the nucleus accumbens and insula, brain regions with prominent roles in food-related
reward processing. This could indicate that women are more sensitive to salient and rewarding aspects of
hedonic foods than men when fasted. This was not observed when comparing foods to non-food objects, i.e., it
was specific to the comparison of hedonic to neutral foods, rather than foods as a whole.
 While these preliminary findings are provocative, many questions remain to be answered and issues
addressed. First, the sensitivity of the initial study was likely insufficient, given the relatively small sample size.
Additionally, women were all scanned in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in the initial investigation.
Given that differences in neuronal responses to food cues are observed in different phases of the menstrual
cycle, it is important to determine how menstrual cycle phase impacts sex-based differences. Furthermore,
measures of gonadal hormones were not included in the preliminary study. This will be critical in understanding
the contribution of hormones to neuronal responses to hedonic foods. Lastly, previous studies have not
addressed how neuronal differences translate to real-world behaviors, which will be essential in understanding
how neuronal differences between sexes can guide development of treatment options.
 The overall goal of this application is to expand on initial findings to better understand sex-based
differences in the neurobiology underlying hedonic eating behaviors and food-based reward processing, how
gonadal hormones contribute to these differences, and how this translates to real-life eating behaviors in
Veterans."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are a major global public health problem, predicted to increase
dramatically over the next decades. Effective therapies to prevent, cure, or slow the disease progression are
lacking. A diversified portfolio of new therapeutic strategies with discrete pharmacological function is urgently
needed. We propose repositioning of an existing acute brain injury clinical candidate, MW189, now in phase 2
critical care medicine testing for hemorrhagic stroke. Repositioning of therapeutic candidates in clinical
development, or repurposing of approved drugs, are generally considered faster and more efficient approaches
than de novo CNS drug discovery and development. Caveats include the lower success rates when done
across disease indications (e.g., oncology to neurology) vs within the same disease indication. Repositioning of
MW189 will use an existing CNS drug development portfolio and research infrastructure. Deliverables will allow
rapid transition to clinical evaluation in AD patients. MW189 is a CNS-penetrant, small molecule that selectively
attenuates stressor-induced changes in dysregulated cytokine production. The resultant pathophysiology
contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in diverse diseases. MW189 has
no liabilities in IND-enabling preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology and successfully completed three
phase 1 clinical studies of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic end point engagement.
MW189’s excellent profile in FDA guided preclinical and clinical studies provides a strong foundation for
continued MW189 clinical development in other CNS disease areas. We hypothesize that MW189 is a viable
candidate for daily oral treatment of dementia patients. We propose studies to remove the remaining technical
and regulatory barriers to MW189 entry into future AD clinical investigations.
Aim 1: Produce GMP clinical drug substance, drug product, reference standard and internal standard. GMP
clinical drug for oral administration will be FDA quality compliant for phase 2 INDs and will address recent FDA
new guidances on enhanced drug quality.
Aim 2: Perform extended GLP toxicology studies in rats (6 mo) and dogs (9 mo) with recovery phase and
toxicokinetics. Outcomes will allow future daily oral administration to AD patients and provide refined dosing
parameters for longer term administration.
Aim 3: Obtain a phase 2 IND for future clinical trials in early AD and related dementias. This final milestone will
position us to immediately proceed to a future phase 2a clinical study of AD patients.
Successful outcomes from the proposed investigations and the follow-on clinical trials will impact a number of
CNS disorders where cytokine dysregulation is part of the disease progression or susceptibility mechanism."

This competitive renewal application for the University of Pennsylvania's Paul Calabresi Career
Development Award for Clinical Oncology K12 was established in 1997 and has received funding for 22
years. With this renewal, we seek continued support for the training and mentorship for 6 MD or MD/PhD
investigators with a commitment to patient-oriented cancer research. Our K12's mission is to identify and
train the next generation of outstanding translational and clinical investigators who are focused on the
problem of human malignancies. This program provides the critical protected time, mentorship, resources,
educational experience, and environment necessary to achieve this goal. Our training program is not a
stand-alone entity. It is bolstered by the remarkable physical and human resources and strong institutional
commitments of the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania and Abramson Cancer
Center and along with the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia. Typical trainees have completed clinical oncology training (fellowship or residency) and enter
this K12 grant as instructors or junior assistant professors. We have appointed 54 trainees (Scholars) from
a deep pool of applicants fed from the various clinical oncology training programs (i.e.
hematology/oncology fellowship, pediatric hematology/oncology fellowship, gynecologic oncology
fellowship, radiation oncology residency). The K12 Executive committee selects trainees based on their
demonstrated commitment and promise for translational and clinical research. Once enrolled, our Scholars
embark upon a tailored curriculum based on their specific research interests and education, supplemented
by didactic coursework and research seminars. Most Scholars are appointed for 2 years. The uniqueness
of this K12 is that it facilitates in a very explicit manner the “bench-to-bedside” development of translational
research, as well as clinical epidemiology and health services research. Progress of our Scholars is
closely monitored with an individualized plan that is customized for each Scholar and by the K12 program's
Advisory Committee, which also reviews overall programmatic priorities. We have established high
standards and expectations for our research mentors who come from diverse backgrounds.The program
measures success by publications, funding, and independent careers in cancer research. Over the last 22
years, 87% of our Scholars have gone on to pursue full-time academic careers, the vast majority of these
with independent funding from NIH or other sources. Our broad goals for the next 5 years are to: 1) To
prepare all of Scholars with the knowledge and tools necessary to be successful clinical or translational
researchers, including training in biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics and clinical trial design and 2) build
upon our recent successes in attracting and training a diverse group of women and men to this training
program."
10866356,"Project Summary/Abstract
Glomerular epithelial cell/podocyte injury is a prominent pathological feature of diabetic nephropathy
(DN). In podocytes, hyperglycemia causes alteration of slit diaphragm proteins, foot process
effacement, apoptosis and cell detachment, events that ultimately results in loss of renal function. High
glucose concentrations (HG) and oxidative stress are potential mediators of glomerular injury in
diabetes. We have evidence that Dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) is expressed in glomerular cells and
contributes to HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as podocyte injury.
Additionally, we have demonstrated that glomeruli isolated from DuoxA-/- mice were protected from
high glucose-induced hydrogen peroxide generation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
ROS generated by Duox2 play a pivotal role in glomerular lesions and podocyte injury in the diabetic
kidney. The goals of this proposal are to utilize in vitro and in vivo approaches to establish the
importance of Duox2 in podocyte injury in the diabetic environment and identify the factors that are
modulating Duox2 activity/expression. The role of Duox activators (DuoxA), translational mechanisms,
and calcium in Duox2 activation will be explored. For the in vivo studies, we will utilize previously
collected kidney cortices from diabetic and non-diabetic mice where DuoxA function is impaired. As no
data related to Duox enzyme expression and function within podocytes are available, the experiments
proposed should serve as proof of concept to demonstrate the utility of targeting the Duox/DuoxA
system to reduce diabetes-mediated glomerular lesions. Characterization of the deleterious actions of
Duox2 and identification of its regulators will contribute to the design of novel therapeutic interventions
and will help establish adjunct therapy to treat DN. The studies will stress the relevance of the
development of modulators of Duox2 expression and activity in the kidney as therapeutic agents to
prevent or reverse DN. Furthermore, this proposal will enhance the research and educational
infrastructure at the University of the Incarnate Word, introducing biomedical research experiences to
underrepresented minority students who would otherwise lack such opportunities."
10863056,"This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-23-119: “Catalytic Tool and Technology Development in
Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases (R21 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”. The main goal of our application
is to test the feasibility and define the strategies, reagents, parameters and methodology to perform genome
editing in the urothelium of live mice in order to enhance and accelerate the research of urothelial biology and
diseases. Urothelium of the bladder is a frequent site of chemical and radiation damages, inflammation,
infection and uncontrolled proliferation. Unlike many other epithelial tissues that are difficult to access,
urothelium is readily accessible through transurethral catheterization, a standard procedure for diagnosis,
monitoring and treatment of urothelium-related disorders. Despite its easy accessibility, urothelial research has
been greatly hampered by the lack of efficient, cost-effective and broadly applicable technological approaches.
In the past, the Principal Investigator's laboratory and those of other investigators have relied heavily on
genetically engineered mouse models to investigate gene functions and the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that govern urothelial growth, differentiation and disease pathogenesis. While highly useful and
informative, this technological platform is inherently time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly, and
consequently no longer adequate to fulfill the increasing research needs of the urothelial field. To tackle this
deficiency, we have decided to test whether it is feasible to perform genome editing in vivo in urothelium of live
mice by combining the easy accessibility of the bladder urothelium with the CRISPR/Cas9 technological
platform. We will approach this progressively by (1) delivering gRNAs via transurethral catheterization into
mice that constitutively express Cas9 to knock out, truncate or mutate a select set of genes of interest in
urothelium; (2) restricting gene knockouts specifically to basal urothelial cells versus suprabasal urothelial cells
using conditional Cas9 expression systems; and (3) performing gene knockouts in wild-type mice using all-in-
one adenoviruses bearing Cas9 and gRNAs or using all-in-one plasmids coupled with ultrasound-guided
percutaneous needle-electrode electroporation of the bladder. The success of these experiments should open
doors to brand new possibilities to target genes of interest in urothelium and model a wide spectrum of
urothelium-related human diseases."
10866347,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Increasing evidence supports the existence of tau as an extracellular protein, and the concept of its trans-cellular
propagation as a mechanism for the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, using
antibodies to target tau pathology appeared as an appropriate approach to clear neurofibrillary tangles in AD
models. A conspicuous amount of data has been produced by different laboratories showing reduction of tau
pathology in transgenic animal models using tau monoclonal antibodies, with a different degree of success
according to which epitopes were targeted. Unfortunately, conventional tau immunotherapy has achieved only
incomplete clearance of tau pathology, and presents limitations in terms of potential inflammatory adverse
events, long-term sustainability, compliance and costs. Also, effective blood brain barrier penetration and choice
of the correct tau epitope are still subject of an open debate.
In this application, we will employ scFv (single chain variable fragments), to target pathological tau. scFv are
composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of antibodies, joined by a short linker, preserving
the epitope specificity and affinity of the parent monoclonal antibodies (mAb), but with a much smaller size and
reduced chance of triggering unwanted inflammatory responses. scFv expression will be driven by viral vectors
(adeno-associated virus, AAV) after intracerebral or intramuscular injection. Our published data show that
intracranial administration of vectorized scFv-MC1, the recombinant version of the native anti-tau conformational
mAb MC1, significantly reduces brain pathological tau species in adult tau transgenic JNPL3 mice.
Here, we will try to further potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of scFv-MC1 preventing tau accumulation
(prevention paradigm) and reducing established tau pathology (reversion protocol): we will employ an epitope-
based dual therapy, combining scFv-MC1 with scFv directed against other tau epitopes, according to what
observed in AD pathophysiology.
We will also adopt a dual delivery strategy, intracranial or intramuscular, fulfilling both a proof of concept and a
translational approach.
Finally, our data show that microglia have a role in up-taking the scFv-tau complex and can degrade it, without
an overt inflammatory response. Here, we will deepen our understanding of the role of microglia in this process.
The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a novel therapeutic approach for AD and
tauopathies, with the goal to advance peripheral administration of engineered anti-tau antibodies, which will have
relevant translational potential."
10866372,"Among malignant complications of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most common cancers in
the pre-ART era — Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) — continues to be amongst the most common in the ART era.
With continued incidence of KS in Africa comes both new questions and others that are still not yet
resolved. In the last 4 years in Uganda and Kenya during the course of U54 CA190153, we have
documented two disturbing (and related) findings: advanced stage of disease at time of KS diagnosis and
poor survival. With recent “Treat All” (for ART) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, for
chemotherapy) guidelines now in place, will these outcomes change? A long-standing question is why does
KS occur in HIV infection? Low CD4+ T cell count and high plasma HIV RNA are known determinants in
untreated HIV infection, but these are neither necessary nor sufficient for KS. In the realm of diagnosis,
delays in diagnosis have many manifestations. Thus, can KS diagnosis be more rapid? Finally, can simple
interventions that help patients diagnosed with KS navigate to cancer care improve survival?
 Addressing each of the above questions has one common requirement  swift access to patients
recently diagnosed with KS. During the course of U54 CA190153, we implemented, to our knowledge, the
first use of rapid case ascertainment (RCA) for cancer in Africa when we studied KS. RCA rapidly identifies
persons recently diagnosed with a condition and performs detailed measurements prior to change in
disease, death or loss to follow-up. Our overall objective in the current proposal is to use RCA to answer
relevant clinical, epidemiologic and translational questions about KS in the ART era. Our Aims are to:
 Aim 1: Monitor critical epidemiologic parameters of KS in the ART era among HIV-infected adults
 in East Africa, specifically stage of disease at time of KS diagnosis and survival.
 Aim 2: Evaluate biologic determinants of incident KS in both ART-untreated HIV-infected patients
 as well as those with ART-mediated virologic suppression.
 Aim 3: Assess the predictive accuracy of digital photography of skin lesions, coupled with deep
 learning algorithms, to distinguish KS from non-KS mimickers.
 Aim 4: Determine the impact of “patient navigation”, intended to enhance linkage to oncologic
 care in persons diagnosed with KS, on improving survival after KS diagnosis.
To address these aims, we will leverage skin biopsy services in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania and the field
experience we have gained in U54 CA190153 to perform RCA on all patients with newly diagnosed KS as
well as a well-conceived and novel “test negative” control group. Findings will inform efforts aimed at
controlling KS; improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of KS in the ART era; and evaluate novel
strategies for KS diagnosis and linkage of patients newly diagnosed with KS to cancer care."

The overall objective of the Nutrition, Exercise and phenotype Testing (NExT) core of MNORC
(formerly the “Human Phenotyping Core” (HPC) is to enhance and expand the research
capabilities of MNORC investigators performing clinical and translational studies related to
nutrition, obesity, and/or obesity-related disorders in humans. The NExT core accomplishes this
goal by: 1) Provide consultation services to translational, clinical and population-based
investigators regarding appropriate assessment, testing and/or intervention approaches for their
studies related to nutrition, physical activity/exercise, obesity, or obesity-related cardio-
metabolic disorders, 2) offering expertise and infrastructure for sophisticated and standardized
physiologic testing of human subjects, including children and adults 3) providing services to
directly assist researchers to conduct their nutritional and/or physical activity/exercise
interventions in human subjects, and 4) assisting in the development of new techniques or
acquire new technologies for human metabolic phenotyping. In addition to offering a wide array
of relatively “standard” phenotypic measurements (e.g., anthropometry and body composition
(DXA, PeaPod), blood pressure, fasting blood work, oral glucose tolerance, nutritional and
physical activity assessments via self reports and objective methods (test meals,
accelerometry), and aerobic fitness assessments) the NExT core also offers several more
involved procedures to more thoroughly assess the metabolic phenotype (e.g.,
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, isotope-tracer metabolic studies, resting energy
expenditure, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies). Before beginning their studies,
MNORC investigators may consult with expert NExT core personnel to gain insights on how the
available methodologies may help them to test their hypotheses, and potentially expand their
research questions using the tools made available to them through the Core. NExT core
personnel also consult with MNORC investigators to help optimize their study designs and their
research intervention strategies/approaches. The NEXT core also directly assists MNORC
investigators to conduct their obesity/nutritional interventions by providing services such as:
nutritional consultations with study participants, supervision of exercise training interventions,
assessment of physical activity and dietary behaviors during an intervention, as well as
assistance with conducting interventions specifically tailored to each research participant.
Overall, the services of the NExT core provide well-controlled and standardized phenotypic
testing, state-of-the-art techniques for “deeper” phenotype assessment, as well as assistance to
conduct well-controlled research interventions, all of which greatly enhance and expand on
existing approaches used by researchers in the areas of nutrition and obesity in children and
adults."
10866412,"Abstract/Summary - CORC
The goal of the newly proposed Childhood Obesity Research Core (CORC) is to support a
robust translational research infrastructure for basic, clinical, and translational researchers
focused on childhood nutrition and obesity. The CORC takes advantage of the
accomplishments of Momentum Center, a university-wide and interdisciplinary childhood obesity
center established in 2013, which has provided research infrastructure, funding, and outreach to
childhood obesity researchers and MNORC members. The CORC addresses major barriers
identified by childhood obesity investigators at the University of Michigan, related to following
barriers to research: barriers with accessing electronic health record (EHR) data for research,
barriers with identifying and accessing unique populations of children for observational and
interventional studies, and barriers with developing health IT tools for research tasks/studies.
The CORC therefore leverages the robust health information technology (IT) ecosystem at
Michigan Medicine as a platform for conducting translational research embedded in the
healthcare delivery system. Researchers will be provided with:
(1) Access to a centralized repository of EHR data for over 200,000 children seen at Michigan
Medicine between 2012 to present, and the opportunity to utilize the repository to support
prospective and interventional clinical, behavioral, and health outcomes research in a
longitudinal cohort of over 41,000+ children currently being seen across nine community-based
primary care pediatric clinics, of whom 10,000+ have linkages to maternal health data;
(2) Services to support the integration of childhood obesity research into the delivery system
including the design and development of customized provider- and patient-facing health IT tools;
consultation on study design, IRB, and data analysis; access to newborn screening specimens
and national EHR data; and support for subject recruitment and coordinated biospecimen
collection; and
(3) Access to existing data and biospecimens from local and international pediatric and maternal
cohorts focused on nutrition, obesity, growth, and development."

The Molecular Phenotyping Core will provide analytical tools to the MNORC investigators to
elucidate molecular mechanisms of disease relevant to obesity and nutritional disorders including
structural identification and quantification of metabolites, perform functional metabolic studies
and integrate multi-omic datasets to provide biological context. These include identifying
unknown metabolites, developing new methods for targeted metabolomics in a range of
biological matrices, validating new biological response indicators and providing biological
context to diverse metabolomic measurements by providing bioinformatics analysis and
developing new bioinformatics tools. In addition to providing instrumental infrastructure, the Core
staff will provide consultation and collaboration to apply metabolomics and data analytical
platforms in nutrition and obesity research. The Molecular Phenotyping Core will optimize the
efficiency and cost-effectiveness by providing these services to MNORC investigators through a
centralized laboratory. In the past five years the core has provided standardized analytical
techniques for the analysis of small molecule metabolites such as amino acid, lipid and nucleic
acid metabolites in samples from murine, rodent and human tissues, plasma, and urine, and
cultured cells. New offerings have included novel untargeted metabolomics platforms, metabolic flux
analysis and data interrogation and bioinformatics tools which will enhance the infrastructure available
for the MNORC investigators. Emphasis will also be placed on fulfilling the needs of Investigators
of the MNORC who will gain maximum benefit from the power of molecular analysis. We are
particularly interested in addressing three areas of need: first, applying the unique sensitivity and
specificity of molecular Phenotyping techniques to broaden understanding of nutritional
disorders ; second, the development of innovative techniques for the detection and structural
elucidation of nutrition-related biomolecules; third, provide data integration and bioinformatic tools
relevant to metabolomics studies; and fourt, providing training for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows with an interest in nutrition research. By centralizing and standardizing
procedures, the Core provides a common set of analytical tools that will lead to a unified
understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes
underlying obesity and other nutrition related disorders."
10848426,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deafness and blindness are two of the most common and most devastating neurological disorders. Seldom
fatal, they separate patients from the world they live in and the people they love, for a lifetime. In many cases,
combined deafness and blindness result from a single gene defect, usually with a mutant gene copy inherited
from both parents. Usher syndrome is a devastating hereditary deafness and blindness caused by mutation of
any of nine genes. One gene, PCDH15, when mutated, causes Usher syndrome type 1F, manifesting as
profound congenital deafness, balance disorder and progressive blindness. There is no treatment. New methods
are rapidly being developed for gene therapy to treat monogenic disorders, methods that change patient lives.
Here, we propose to develop a gene therapy strategy for Usher Syndrome Type 1F and to initiate its path to the
clinic to treat different pathologies of the disease.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been found to be efficient and effective for gene therapy in the inner
ear and their application in development of gene addition therapies to treat Usher syndrome type 1F is an
attractive approach. However, the PCDH15 coding sequence of almost 6 kb is too large to fit in AAV, which has
a capacity of ~4.7 kb. Most of PCDH15 resembles a “bead chain” structure of 11 beads, with binding domains
at N- and C-terminal ends. We have developed novel “mini-PCDH15” constructs that retain the binding domains
but lack 4-5 beads, and that consequently fit in AAV vectors. They show normal binding in vitro; at least two
rescue hearing in our Pcdh15-knockout mouse model. We will use these and new mini-PCDH15 constructs to
rescue hearing and vestibular function in Pcdh15-knockout mice. We will also employ in silico and in vitro
structural biology and protein chemistry to carefully characterize each successful mini-PCDH15, and use that for
iterative optimization of engineered mini-PCDH15s. Finally, we will test the best performing mini-PCDH15 for
localization and toxicity in non-human primate ear as part of their preclinical evaluation.
Because mechanical stress on PCDH15 is greater in the inner ear than in the eye, the engineered mini-PCDH15
constructs that successfully rescue hearing or balance will also have the potential to halt or even reverse the
progressive vision loss in patients. In addition, methods we develop in this study using a rational, iterative,
structure-based mini-gene approach to develop Usher 1F therapy will be applicable to many other deafness
genes with coding sequences that do not fit in AAV.

10846079,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescents and young adults with mental, behavioral, or developmental disorders (MBDD) experience a peak
in risk for poor access to care and adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidality, during the transition
from pediatric- to adult-focused care. Despite the clear public health importance of this topic, little research
exists regarding how health care transition is associated with high care quality and improved mental health
outcomes, a deeper understanding of the scope of disparities in transition and downstream outcomes, and
evidence toward the potential role of health policy for improving access to timely health care transition in the
United States. This project proposes to provide new evidence using a novel dataset that links restricted use,
national data on health care utilization and mental health outcomes, and will be unprecedented both in terms
of its coverage and scope. Using this new dataset, we will examine the potential role for state and federal
mental health policy in affecting access to health care transition in terms of occurrence, timing, and gaps (Aim
1) using quasi-experimental techniques that take advantage of the staggered implementation of mental health
parity laws across states over time and the resulting variation in exposure to these policies. This will be the
first evaluation of these policies' impact on health care transition. We will examine the impact of health care
transition on receipt of high quality care for the treatment of specific MBDD (e.g., depression), and evaluate
the extent to which socioeconomic factors moderate this association, potentially exacerbating disparities (Aim
2). Finally, we will use latent class analysis to ascertain mental health outcome patterns and subsequently
identify if and to what extent health care transition is associated with these outcome patterns (e.g., whether
later age at transition is associated with worsening mental health); further we also evaluate the extent to which
socioeconomic factors moderate this association (Aim 3). For Aims 1 and 3, we will obtain estimates for the
overall population with MBDD and for disease subtypes (e.g., depression). The scope and size of our dataset
will allow us to generate precise estimates across these subgroups and will provide important new information
on when and how to intervene to equitably improve mental health outcomes across this critical stage in the
life-course. The analyses proposed under this study will generate new and actionable information for
policymakers aiming to better understand and mitigate the impacts of inequalities across the transition from
adolescence into adulthood."
10863311,"Background: Chronic pain is a major public health problem and a leading cause of disability among Veterans.
As such, addressing chronic pain and opioid safety remain top priorities of the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA). While long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for chronic pain is common, harms of continuing LTOT may
outweigh benefits for many patients. When this is the case, guidelines recommend tapering or discontinuing
opioids; however, recent evidence also highlights the potential harms associated with tapering or discontinuing
opioids. Furthermore, guidelines emphasize the importance of optimizing non-pharmacologic pain treatment
(NPT) options, yet clinicians report several barriers to doing so. For these reasons, managing chronic pain
among patients prescribed LTOT is often challenging and there is a critical gap in evidence-based strategies to
overcome these challenges. To address this gap, the Veterans Pain Care Organizational Improvement
Comparative Effectiveness (VOICE) study compared two models of care to improve pain and support opioid
tapering. This 10-site pragmatic trial enrolling from 2017-2021 randomized 820 veterans with moderate to
severe pain treated with LTOT to two active collaborative care interventions with on average ten study contacts
over a 12-month period; VOICE did not have a control group or usual care condition. While both groups
improved, the VOICE study found no differences in pain-related outcomes or changes in opioid dose
between its two interventions. Thus, a lack of control condition leaves unanswered questions about the
impact of these interventions as compared to usual primary-care based VHA pain care.
Methods: To address these unanswered questions and help inform VA’s decisions about pain care resource
deployment, our overarching aim is to emulate a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial. Emulated trials draw on
observational data to emulate the design characteristics of a randomized trial when randomized trial data is not
available. In the proposed emulated trial, we will examine the impact of VOICE’s two active interventions
against a retrospectively matched “external” usual care control group using a propensity-based matching
approach. This control group will be drawn from the Evaluating Prescription Opioid Changes in Veterans
(EPOCH) study, a national longitudinal prospective cohort launched in 2016 and funded by VA Health Services
Research & Development (HSR&D) to understand effects of changes in opioid prescribing practices on
Veterans treated with LTOT for chronic pain. EPOCH’s large, nationally representative sample (N=9253),
nearly identical timeframe, inclusion criteria and study populations, and similar patient-reported and electronic
health record outcomes to VOICE make it a very compelling source of patients prescribed LTOT receiving
usual VHA pain care.
Specific Aims: By emulating a three-arm RCT and examining outcomes including pain-related interference,
opioid dose, quality of life, and engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatments, we will answer important
questions about implementation of treatments and approaches across VHA to enhance pain care. Thus, Aim 1
is to compare the collaborative care (active) interventions from the VOICE study to a matched usual care
control group drawn from the EPOCH cohort on the primary outcome of pain-related interference and
secondary outcomes of opioid dose reduction, NPT uptake and health-related quality of life. In Aim 2, we will
compare collaborative care (active) interventions from the VOICE study to a matched usual care control group
drawn from the EPOCH cohort on primary and secondary outcomes from Aim 1 among pre-specific high-risk
subgroups. Finally, in Aim 3, among those who tapered opioid dose, we will compare patient-reported rates of
harms (i.e., worsening pain and quality of life) in the collaborative care (active) interventions from the VOICE
study to a matched usual care control group drawn from the EPOCH cohort."
10866817,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT CORE (CORE E)
The overall goal of the Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement (ORE) Core is to improve the health and
wellbeing of persons and families affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias by recruitment
of individuals into Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC)-sponsored studies, disseminating
information, and translating new knowledge into practice for researchers, health care professionals, trainees,
and the general public. The activities of the ORE Core represent a collaborative initiative involving the Divisions
of Geriatrics and Gerontology, the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, the Wisconsin
Alzheimer’s Association Chapter Network (WAACN), Office of Continuing Professional Development in
Medicine and Public Health (OCPD), State of Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), the extensive
outreach, education, and dementia diagnostic clinic programs of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Institute (WAI).
and communities throughout Wisconsin. These collaborations represent the leveraging of resources to expand
the influence of the ORE Core beyond the walls of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public
Health. The ORE Core is fully integrated into the Clinical, Inclusion of Underrepresented Groups, Care,
Neuropathology, Data Management and Statistical, Cores. Working together, Core has been able to identify
and resolve the barriers to research participation by diverse study populations. Our successful recruitment
efforts are matched by our clinical and research education and training programs as well as statewide outreach
and professional education programs of the WAI. In this renewal the ORE Core will focus recruitment efforts on
increasing the generalizability through engagement, recruitment, and retention of individuals more
representative of the population of the State of Wisconsin.
Over the past 14 years, the Core’s outreach, recruitment, and education programs have worked to achieve the
stated goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) by enhancing public awareness and engagement,
optimizing care quality and efficiency, and working with health providers and state government to expand
supports for persons with AD and their families. The Core has made major contributions to NAPA’s primary goal
to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025 by supporting clinical trials and the study of preclinical AD, mild
cognitive impairment, and AD at the Wisconsin ADRC and WAI (Wisconsin Registry of Alzheimer’s Prevention:
Biomarkers of Preclinical AD, RO1AG27161 [2-4]). These efforts and collaborations will be expanded during this
renewal through the guidance of our active participant advisory board."
10866818,"PROJECT SUMMARY - BIOMARKER CORE (CORE G)
The Biomarker core (BMC) of the Wisconsin ADRC represents the capability and infrastructure for assessing
the brain quantitatively in vivo using biofluid and imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
disorders. A major focus of our center’s investigators is the pre-clinical and early symptomatic stages of AD, and
on understanding factors that influence proteinopathy onset and eventual clinical expression. The charge of this
core is to provide the necessary tools and infrastructure to our center’s investigators to characterize as accurately
as possible the in vivo changes of AD across its stages, the effect of risk and resilience factors that hasten or
slow development of symptoms, and the assessment of co-pathology and associated joint impact on clinical
course. The Core will focus on collecting and curating several types of robust and exploratory biomarkers
including: 1) markers indicative of AD defined by amyloid plaques (A) and neurofibrillary tangles (T) from
molecular PET imaging, CSF, and blood-based assays; 2) markers of cerebrovascular diseases (V) —the
second most common set of causes of cognitive decline that are ascertainable by both well-established and
novel MRI methods; 3) direct markers of other proteinopathies as they become available via PET, CSF and/or
plasma; and 4) direct markers of neurodegeneration (N) including synaptic density, neuronal injury, atrophy
patterns, and blood flow that are possible through PET, MRI, CSF, and/or blood modalities. We will closely
collaborate with Cores B, C, D, E, F and H to conduct inclusive and broadly generalizable science by enrolling
participants from underrepresented groups (URG) into the biomarker studies of the Wisconsin ADRC. Aim 1
focuses on obtaining and measuring relevant biomarkers from imaging and biofluids. In Aim 1a we collect the
new mandated SCAN ATN PET imaging protocol on at least 24 ADRC participants per year and upload to
NACC/SCAN. Aim 1b assays plasma samples from the clinical core and registry participants for ptau217,
Aβ42/40, NfL and GFAP. Aim 1c will focus on CSF biomarker quantification. Aim 1d will focus on obtaining the
ADRC standard MRI protocol on clinical core participants with a protocol features sequences for quantifying N,
and aspects of V including ischemic lesions, perfusion, microhemorrhages, and vessel stiffness. Aim 2 will focus
on biomarker interpretation including developing and applying appropriate thresholds for applicable biomarker
modalities, which are needed to conduct the operations of the center and serve the needs of participants and
investigators. Aim 3 will focus on providing infrastructure (such as image file management, image quality control,
standard pipelines, and access to the fluid biomarker portfolio) and expertise to investigators for implementing
appropriate biomarkers from our portfolio in research. Aim 4 will focus on sharing images and derived data with
the local and national AD research community. Finally, Aim 5 will focus on expanding the core’s biomarker
capability using exploratory and targeted approaches, and adopting promising new technologies."
10866819,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT (REC)
The goal of the Research Education Component (REC) of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
(ADRC) is to support educational activities that ensure rigorous comprehensive training in AD and related
dementias (ADRD) research and promote the training of a multifaceted workforce to meet the nation’s
biomedical, behavioral, and clinical needs in ADRD research. The Wisconsin ADRC REC will achieve this goal
by providing a program of training to all ADRC-affiliated trainees, in addition to identifying exceptional junior
investigators who will be specifically supported in their development into independent Alzheimer’s researchers
(Wisconsin ADRC REC Scholars). The REC will provide trainees with individualized career coaching and
mentorship to support their growth and training to achieve proficiency in core research competencies and eight
Wisconsin ADRC content areas (Life Course Exposome, Clinical and Neuropsychology, Care Research, Basic
Science and Neuropathology, Data Analytics, Community Based Research, Omics, and Neuroimaging and Fluid
Biomarkers). Training will occur through seminars, degree and certificate programs, workshops, and mentored
research experiences. To develop the next generation of research leaders, we must attract junior faculty and
trainees—at every level and with a variety of perspectives and backgrounds—to this field. Accordingly, we will
work with training programs across the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus to infuse AD-related research
concepts into predoctoral, postdoctoral, and junior faculty training programs, as well as work with partners
beyond campus, to inspire early career investigators to build research careers in ADRD. Moreover, we will
intentionally recruit and support researchers from populations underrepresented in the ADRD workforce to
cultivate the next generation of ADRD research leaders in our field. In order to ensure our aims are met, the REC
will evaluate the effectiveness of the research training program through a collaboration with the Wisconsin Center
for Education Research, a national leader in education evaluation. We will use mixed methods approaches to
assess the efficacy of the REC, to ensure our goals are met. The last four years of the Wisconsin ADRC REC
have been tremendously productive and impactful, and in this renewal application we propose enhanced
activities to carry our mission yet farther."
10866820,"PROJECT SUMMARY – INCLUSION OF UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS CORE (Core F)
The Inclusion of Under-Represented Groups Core or the IURG Core currently works with the Clinical; Outreach,
Recruitment and Engagement (ORE); Data Management and Statistical (DMS); and Biomarker Cores to identify
and resolve the barriers to research participation for African and Native Americans. The IURG has made inroads,
allowing us to enroll 290 individuals from URG, comprising 26% of the overall cohort, and we are poised to
expand this Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) focused work. The IURG Core will continue to be fully
integrated with the Center, assisting investigators to engage Native and African American, and Veteran
communities, ensuring adequate inclusion to answer scientific questions and optimize generalizability of findings.
The work proposed in this application will promote research focused on the biological underpinnings of healthy
aging, preclinical AD and the transition from MCI to AD dementia and ensure that science conducted at the
Wisconsin ADRC includes groups traditionally under-included in research. Briefly, the IURG Core will ensure
that participants from under-represented groups (URG) are included in the Wisconsin ADRC Clinical Core. In
support, we propose the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: In collaboration with the Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) Core, the IURG Core will
adapt and tailor outreach, recruitment, and engagement activities to reach groups under-represented in
research. Specifically, efforts will focus on tailored approaches for African American and American
Indian/Indigenous groups. We will build on our Center’s work with military Veterans and will support ORE Core
efforts to expand Registry participation. Sub-Aims include supporting Community Advisory Boards (CABs),
leading community-specific outreach and engagement programs, developing culturally-safe, community-based
data collection processes, and developing stakeholder engagement opportunities.
Specific Aim 2: The IURG Core will provide consultation to support community engaged research with
individuals from URGs at two levels – both of which will grow Center-wide capacity for JEDI-centered research.
Sub-Aims include working with the Biomarkers and Neuropathology Cores to promote participation of individuals
from URG in biomarker sub-studies, and the Center’s Brain Donor Program, and to provide programed
consultation for teams seeking to increase inclusion of racialized groups into research studies.
The aims and activities described here align with and support the Center’s overarching scientific theme by
applying the JEDI principles – Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in service of inclusive ADRD research."
10858290,"This application is submitted in response to PAR-23-040 with the goal of integrating cutting-edge in vivo
imaging technologies and key immunologic assessments to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of
translational nonhuman primate models for genetic and regenerative therapies. The proposal meets the
objective of PAR-23-040, which is focused on “…developing and implementing broadly applicable
technologies, tools, and resources for...enhancing rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research”.
We will support translational research by incorporating total-body positron emission tomography (PET) and
correlative assessments of the immune system. The investigations proposed will enhance the rhesus monkey
model system by creating or improving study protocols that provide a high level of sensitivity and reproducibility
for assessments that are important to clinical translation. The Specific Aims are: (1) Use total-body PET
imaging to longitudinally monitor gene transfer and biodistribution in preclinical studies of fetal or juvenile
rhesus monkeys for clinical translation, and (2) Explore new readouts of immune responses to innovative
therapeutics in tissue sites using T-cell tracking in translational nonhuman primate studies. These
investigations will address relationships between local T-cell infiltration and circulating immunophenotypes with
correlative in vivo imaging, which will enhance models and provide new methods to assess the primate
immune system. Monitoring inflammation and immunity in targeted and non-targeted tissues is critically
important to ensure safety as new therapeutics transition to the clinic for a range of common and rare
diseases. These studies will provide predictive protocols and tools which will inform preclinical and IND-
enabling studies for future human applications across age groups."
10862685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Defective morphogenesis of arteries, veins, capillaries, and lymphatic vessels results in vascular
malformations, a relatively common congenital malformation. Current therapies are primarily invasive and can
produce significant morbidity. Most vascular malformations are due to post-zygotic (mosaic) activating
mutations in a few oncogenes (PIK3CA, KRAS, MAP2K1, others) in the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK pathways.
These mutations are never present in DNA derived from white blood cells, the most common sample for
genetic testing, making molecular diagnosis challenging.
 Long-term, our goal is to improve treatment of individuals with vascular malformations. The proposed
experiments advance that goal by expanding diagnostic options for VM patients and dissecting cellular and
spatial heterogeneity in vascular malformations, using novel, cutting edge technologies.
 Our first aim is to determine if non-invasive “liquid biopsies” of plasma derived cell-free DNA can detect
mosaic mutations in individuals with vascular malformations. Since mutations driving vascular malformations
are typically present only in the malformation itself, an invasive surgery or biopsy is currently required for
diagnosis. Since a molecular diagnosis is required to guide targeted drug therapies (such as PI3K or AKT
inhibitors, for which clinical trials are currently open), developing non-invasive diagnostics for vascular
malformations would have immediate patient impact.
 Next, we will study how gene expression changes in single cells in vascular malformation tissues and
integrate this information with each cell's mutation status, using a novel, multi-omics method. We will also use
techniques that allow us to visualize how gene expression changes in two and three dimensional space within
vascular malformations. Since only a small fraction (1-10%) of cells inside vascular malformations typically
possess the driving mutation, these experiments will help us understand how small cell populations can
produce large, multicellular malformations.
 We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with non-overlapping areas of expertise to accomplish these
goals. Our experiments will be performed using samples from a large, pre-existing biorepository of vascular
malformation samples rich in clinical data. We expect this work to expand our understanding of vascular
malformations and vascular biology specifically, and the nature of mosaicism more generally."
10862819,"SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive and standard cytotoxic chemotherapies (e.g.
anthracycline-taxane) are the main treatment strategies in clinics. Our previous research and literature
demonstrated that poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) as single agents or in combination with
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRi) induced a contextual synthetic lethality and reduced TNBC
metastsis by inhibiting the repair of DNA damage. Our clinical trial showed that veliparib (PARPi)/lapatinib
(EGFRi) achieved a 24% response rate in TNBC patients with wildtype BRCA1/2. Despite these achievements,
TNBC cells often develop drug resistance to chemotherapies, have low patient response rate, and regrow after
primary treatment. Novel strategies that can effectively treat TNBCs are urgently needed. Mitochondria are the
powerhouse of cells and play a pivotal role in regulating cell functions, rendering them a promising oncological
target. Destroying mitochondrial function, such as directly depolarizing the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)
potential via synthesized heterologous genes, can bypass the repair of signaling transduction pathways, trigger
a point-of-no-return cancer cell death, and subsequently prevent the development of drug resistance. We
recently developed a mitochondrial luminoptogenetics (mLumiOpto) technology by synthesizing the
heterologous light-gated channelrhodopsin in IMM and an engineered luciferase in cytoplasm, which induces
IMM depolarization through opening mitochondrial channelrhodopsin with luciferase-luciferin emitted
endogenous blue bioluminescence. Preliminary studies showed that mLumiOpto effectively depolarized
mitochondria in TNBC cell lines representing multiple subtypes, resulted in persistent DNA damage, and
significantly reduced tumor burden in three TNBC xenograft models. Applying our dual-targeted delivery vehicle,
i.e. EGFR/CD276 monoclonal antibodies tagged exosome-associated adeno-associated virus (mAb-Exo-AAV),
and cancer-specific promoter (cfos) in mLumiOpto achieved high TNBC specificity, functional expression, and
minimal undesirable systemic toxicity. The objective of this project is to harness the combination of targeted
mLumiOpto that is delivered with mAb-Exo-AAV and PARPi to eliminate TNBC cells in vivo. The hypothesis is
that the combined mLumiOpto/PARPi integrates multiple anti-cancer mechanisms, i.e., IMM depolarization, DNA
damage and inhibition of repair, and tumoral immunity. Specifically, large-scale dual-targeted mLumiOpto will be
generated and characterized; treatment dosage and strategy will be optimized; and anti-cancer efficacy will be
evaluated in TNBC primary xenograft model and distant metastatic model (Aim 1). Furthermore, the synergistic
effects of mLumiOpto/PARPi will be assessed and the underlying mechanisms will be investigated in
immunocompetent models (Aim 2). Finally, the metastasis reduction and heterogeneous TNBC treatment
efficacy will be fully tested in metastatic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and toxicology will also be
investigated (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will provide a new strategy to treat TNBCs."

in biomedical informatics and data science to advance the life sciences and improve clinical care. Our proposal
for the future of BMI training at Stanford harnesses the opportunity to produce the next generation of researchers
who will enable precision medicine through innovations in translational bioinformatics, health care informatics
and clinical research informatics. We request annual support for training 11 pre-doctoral candidates (including
two candidates in HIV informatics), 6 postdoctoral candidates, and 4 short-term diversity candidates, for a period
of 5 years. Our trainees will benefit from a rich curriculum that consists of specially-designed core courses in
biomedical informatics and data science, technical electives from companion fields of computer science,
statistics, mathematics and engineering, domain electives in biological and clinical sciences, and instruction on
the principles of responsible conduct of research and the methods of rigor and reproducible research. Our
trainees will be provided with outstanding mentored research opportunities offered by 34 investigators who
collectively represent 16 departments and divisions across 3 schools at Stanford University. Beginning in August
2021, our BMI program will benefit from the recent establishment of the Department of Biomedical Data Science

the event requiring testing for biological testing of food or drug products, the UNLVDC will
perform selected analyses of diagnostic samples collected and supplied to the laboratory by
FDA or other agencies as required. Although UNLVDC lacks a dedicated toxicology section,
UNLVDC can contribute to the overall mission through support of microbiological and
pathological testing as needed. The overall goal of the cooperative agreement is to support,
utilize, and enhance university, state, and federal veterinary diagnostic laboratory testing

10862567,"ABSTRACT
Solid tumors lead to 580,000 deaths annually in the US, and safe and effective therapeutics for many late-
stage solid tumors are lacking. Ovarian cancer alone kills 14,000 people each year, and many patients do not
respond to currently available treatments. The tight junction protein Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is a validated
therapeutic target for many solid tumor types, including ovarian, endometrial, testicular, gastric, and pancreatic
cancer. CLDN6 is differentially expressed on cancer cells with almost no expression in normal, healthy tissue.
Despite being an attractive target, therapeutic MAbs targeting CLDN6 are difficult to discover due to an
absolute need for high specificity. There are 26 human CLDN family members in total and most are broadly
expressed and highly conserved, making drug specificity when targeting the CLDNs critically important but
especially challenging. The extracellular region of CLDN6 closely resemble the widely expressed CLDN9 (3
amino acids different). The few CLDN6 MAbs discovered by others have demonstrated significant binding to
other CLDN family members and most have now been halted in development. Here, we will develop a CLDN6
therapeutic for solid tumors."

 2 Cooperation and reciprocation are a hallmark of human behavior and key for creating and maintaining
 3 social bonds. Yet despite their importance to both normal and abnormal social function, little is known
 4 regarding their single neuronal and population underpinnings.
 5 We propose to study, for the first time, how representations of recent social experience are formed
 6 and maintained, then retrieved and updated with the goal of elucidating how these ultimately guide social
 7 cooperative behavior. We will quantify cooperation using rhesus macaques playing the well-studied
 8 iterated Prisoner’s dilemma game (iPD). In iPD, players can repeatedly cooperate for the common good
 9 or exploit the other for their own benefit, and change their choices based on the other’s preceding move.
10 Using this approach, we previously described a neuronal circuit in the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex
11 (dACC) where subsets of neural populations encode cooperative decisions and expected reward of other
12 individuals, distinct from neurons encoding one’s own decisions and reward.
13 Here, we build on these findings to investigate how the brain integrates recent interactions to support
14 cooperation. We will use large-scale simultaneous recordings in the primate Prefrontal Cortex to study
15 representations of one’s own and others’ actions, to delineate the functional neural architecture that
16 allow dynamic responses in ever-changing social contexts, and to study inter-brain neural synchrony
17 between monkeys cooperating while playing iPD. Such understanding is crucial for parsing how social
18 behavior falls apart in an array of neurological and psychiatric disorders and for devising future targeted
19 treatment of debilitating social disorders."
10864000,"Approximately 32-44% of the adult US population has hypertension, with one of the many complications
being hypertensive retinopathy. In one study, the prevalence of retinopathy was found to be 85% amongst
those with severe hypertension, and 25% for those with mild hypertension. Retinal consequences of
hypertension include arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (localized hypoxia), and optic
disk swelling. Other retinal changes include hyalinization of arteriolar walls, thickening of the vascular
basement membrane, closure of capillaries, smooth muscle degeneration, and blood-retinal barrier
dysfunction. Additionally, hypertension is a major risk factor for the highly threatening events of retinal artery
or vein occlusion. The primary treatment for hypertensive retinopathy is to reduce blood pressure; however,
consequences of the disease including narrowing of arterioles persist even following anti-hypertension
medication. Therefore, a better knowledge of the mechanisms of the disease could lead to the development
of additional and more effective therapeutic options. Our overall hypothesis is that the vascular
complications of hypertensive retinopathy are due phenotypic changes in endothelial and smooth muscle
cells, with vessel wall remodeling limiting recovery even with anti-hypertensive medication. The specific
aims are to: (1) determine the sex-dependent expression of the glycocalyx in the retina, and determine the
consequences of hypertension on this expression, (2) examine the sex-dependent expression of platelet
endothelial adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin in the retina, and test the hypothesis
that changes in these junctional molecules in the hypertensive retina are due to endothelial-to-
mesenchymal transition, and (3) test the hypothesis that remodeling of blood vessel walls in the SHR retina
induces susceptibility to poor retinal perfusion when high blood pressure is reduced to normal."
10863818,"Genetics of CKD and Hypertension—Risk Prediction and Drug Response in the MVP
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide. Preventing the development
of CKD and slowing its progression is critical to reducing premature death and end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) in this growing population. Risk prediction and early treatment of people at risk
for or with CKD is of upmost relevance to reduce the complications of kidney disease. First, we
will generate weighted Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) for the prediction of incident and
progressive CKD, and test if we can improve prediction beyond common clinical risk factors. Our
primary approach to generating GRSes will include loci from the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
trait genome wide association scan (GWAS) (270 participants,156 SNPs), and Blood pressure
(BP) trait GWAS (781,119 participants, 498 SNPs) that reached genome wide significance,
allowing us to evaluate the shared genetic contribution of these traits to CKD severity. The genetic
information we will include in the GRS is far more extensive than previously included in CKD
studies, and should improve risk prediction when added to incident and progressive CKD risk
equations. As a secondary approach, we will generate and test polygenic risk scores (PRS)
to evaluate the benefit of including even a larger set of variants (not limited to the ones that reach
GWAS significance) in risk prediction. 2) Second, we will extend our work in resistant
hypertension (RH), a potent risk factor for the development of CKD and ESRD. In our RH GWAS
(17000 cases) 9 we identified three loci with either predicted gene expression10 in the adrenal
gland [relaxin (RXFP2), fibrillin-2 (FBN2)] or located in a gene (CACNA1D) whose mutations have
been recognized in aldosterone producing adenomas11,12. It has been recently acknowledged
that there is a broad spectrum of manifestations of subclinical primary hyperaldosteronism,
whose prevalence is much greater than previously recognized13, and may precede future severe
hypertension (HTN) and incident CKD.4 13 We propose a series of pharmacogenomic studies to
identify the association between these variants and specific clinical drug response phenotypes
related to primary hyperaldosteronism (mild or subclinical forms), including thiazide-induced
hypokalemia14 with the goal of early detection and prevention of CKD. 3) Finally, mineral
metabolism disorders of CKD are important predictors of CKD progression and CV events. In this
aim, we will study the genetic determinants of mineral metabolism markers. This information will
help us to understand in the future the share genetic contribution of these traits to CKD. We will
accomplish our goals with the following specific aims: Aim 1a) To build a series of weighted
GRSes/PRS to summarize the genetic effects of markers derived from large GWA studies from
the MVP and test their ability to predict incident and progressive CKD. Aim 1b): To evaluate if the
addition of the weighted GRS improves the performance of CKD clinical risk predicting models
for incident and progressive CKD. Aim 2: To evaluate the association between candidate genes
(RXFP2, FBN2, and CANAN1D) and the potassium response in incident users of
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 15 to 180 days after therapy initiation. Aim 3: To discover new
associations of common and rare genetic variants with serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium
among adults with and without CKD using a genome wide approach. The current proposal will
promote personalized medicine for the care provided to patients with or at risk of CKD in the VA.
We have assembled a multidisciplinary team and we are well poised to conduct the work proposed."
10863840,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transgender women have some of the highest rates of HIV in the world and are the highest HIV risk group in
the United States and Brazil. Transgender women experience multiple stigmas that complicate their access to
and adherence to healthcare, resulting in intersectional stigma and negative health outcomes. Intersectionality
is a critical theory which posits that power relations construct our perspectives and experiences and has the
potential to meaningfully inform research with transgender communities as well as an approach to mentorship
across differences. Using novel applications of the framework of intersectionality, Dr. Jae Sevelius, Associate
Professor in Residence, University of California, San Francisco, proposes (1) a plan for their own career
development that will expand their research to include substance use and implementation science, (2) a plan
to expand their program of research to provide ample training opportunities for mentees, and (3) a plan to
provide mentoring focused on supporting mentees who are underrepresented in medicine (URM) and/or are
launching a program of research focused on addressing health disparities among sexual and gender minorities
(SGM). Their community-based, patient-oriented research is focused on the investigation of risk and protective
factors in transgender communities and the relationship between stigma, discrimination, and health-related
behaviors and outcomes. Dr. Sevelius' efforts have been dedicated to developing, implementing, and
evaluating health promotion interventions that decrease health risks, including HIV transmission and
acquisition, and improve treatment through behavioral changes, community programming, and increased
access to culturally appropriate health care. Their research and scientific contribution of the trans-specific
Model of Gender Affirmation is recognized nationally and internationally in the field of transgender health and
HIV prevention and treatment. Mentee training will leverage the infrastructure and resources of Dr. Sevelius'
ongoing intervention research and their collaborations with multidisciplinary and international researchers in
the areas of HIV, substance use, and transgender health domestically and in Brazil. In order to expand the
scope of their mentoring program, they propose to launch a group-based distance mentoring program, conduct
facilitated writing intensives with their mentees, and produce scholarship and training in the area of
intersectional mentoring. Lastly, Dr. Sevelius proposes to conduct K24 supported research studies that will
serve as training vehicles for mentees and develop their research by (1) expanding their research experience
and scholarship to include the characterization of substance use among transgender women within the context
of HIV treatment, (2) cultivating expertise in implementation science to identify best practices for
implementation of efficacious HIV prevention interventions among transgender populations who use
substances, and (3) gaining experience assessing and contextualizing intersectional stigma among
transgender populations in Brazil."

There are an estimated 50 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the care provided to
people with CKD and end stage kidney disease exceeds $114 billion annually. Despite these numbers, recent
data indicates that there is a significant workforce shortage in the field of nephrology and urology and the total
number of grants submitted to the NIH focused on kidney and urologic diseases and disorders has decreased
over the past decade. This dichotomy creates a significant need to reverse the current trends and increase the
number of trainees interested in pursuing a career in nephrology and urology that includes an NIDDK-related
research focus. To begin to address these important issues, we propose to create a predoctoral student
research program that combines the educational, clinical, and translational research expertise at The Ohio
State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital. The long-term goal of this program is to increase and
diversify the number of physician-scientists and basic-scientists submitting grant applications to the NIDDK in
the fields of pediatric nephrology and urology. To accomplish this goal, we propose the development of a new
Student Urinary Tract Program in Education and Research (SUPER) Summer Training Program for graduate
and medical students. This program will expand established research programs and partner with local
resources to create new educational and research experiences promoting the understanding of kidney and
urinary tract diseases. We strongly believe that creating this innovative and well-structured summer research
program focused on nephrology and urology related topics will capture predoctoral student interest early in
their career development - thereby increasing the potential workforce population and creating the next
generation of NIDDK-research focused clinicians and scientists."
10862260,"Background: Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among men in the United
States, accounting for one third of VA’s new cancer diagnoses. The United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF) and VHA Clinical Preventive Services guidance recommend a Shared Decision Making
(SDM) approach to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening due to the tradeoff between modest population-
level survival benefits and the cost of over-detection of low-risk disease.
Significance: The limited time available for primary care office visits makes covering all the beneficial
USPSTF recommendations challenging. USPSTF and VHA Clinical Preventive Services recommend a SDM
approach for PSA screening decisions where patients discuss the best evidence for and against screening with
clinicians and are supported to make high quality decisions. SDM is underutilized in clinical practice and is
rarely achieved in prostate cancer screening decisions. Veteran peer navigators are ideal decision coaches to
improve patient knowledge and promote SDM among Veterans. We propose a Veteran-peer-navigator-led
decision coaching (PDC) program for PSA screening to promote SDM and potentially lighten the burden of this
type of counseling for VA primary care providers. Preliminary data will be collected to inform workflow
improvements addressing HSRD priorities of access and quality of care, since SDM is a required quality of
care goal that is yet to be universally implemented among PCPs.
Innovation and Impact: 1) The novel use of Veteran peer navigators in a “deliberative” role to promote and
facilitate SDM with Veteran patients and their providers is responsive to the USPSTF and HSR&D research
priorities. 2) The project will assess the PDC intervention’s workflow effects from the perspectives of key
stakeholders, including Veterans, peer navigators, and clinicians. This study will comprehensively assess the
effects of a PDC intervention among Veterans and providers, additionally exploring workflow considerations
and factors critical to dissemination. 3) The project will address the cost implications and sustainability of the
decision coaching intervention. 4) The intervention is tailored for current health care delivery, including the use
of telehealth.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the effect of PDC on decision quality, Veteran-provider communication, and
screening experience for Veterans considering PSA screening using validated surveys and theory-based
qualitative interviews. Aim 2: Evaluate PDC’s effect on provider and administrator experience with PSA
counseling and clinic workflow using validated surveys and theory-based qualitative interviews. Aim 3:
Determine the cost and budget impact of a PDC program for PSA screening.
Methodology: The objective in this proposal is to test the efficacy of a PDC program to facilitate SDM for PSA
screening among Veterans at VA New York Harbor Healthcare System. We will randomize Veterans seeking
primary care to receive 1) a standard of care screening decision aid along with PDC on PSA screening
(intervention), or 2) the same decision aid without counseling (control). To accomplish this goal, a mixed
methods approach will be used combining quantitative data (collected from surveys and patient records to
understand healthcare utilization) and qualitative methods (to explore stakeholder experience and perspectives
on PSA screening and clinic workflow).
Next Steps/Implementation: To promote the implementation of USPSTF and VHA Clinical Preventive
Services PSA screening recommendations, we propose a PDC program in VA with high potential for scalability
and public health impact. We will study the intervention across communication format and race to ensure its
compatibility with health system goals and initiatives. We will determine efficacy, participant experience, and
cost outcomes critical to system-wide implementation."
10824695,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria is a deadly disease that affects nearly half the world’s population. In 2021, there was an estimated
619,000 deaths due to malaria. Currently, the front-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria is Artemisinin-based
Combination Therapies (ACTs), where an artemisinin-related compound is paired with a slower acting partner
drug. Despite successful use of this drug regimen, resistance has been identified to all clinically approved
antimalarials. Because of increasing antimalarial resistance, there is an urgent need to discover new targets and
chemotherapies potent against malaria, in addition to understanding mechanisms of resistance to antimalarials.
A common form of resistance occurs with mutations in the parasite’s multidrug resistance protein (PfMDR1).
PfMDR1 is located on the surface of the digestive vacuole, an acidic organelle where the parasite digests
hemoglobin. While PfMDR1 is a major driver of antimalarial resistance, we currently do not understand how
different mutations of pfmdr1 modulate resistance in the malaria parasite. The current hypothesis is that PfMDR1
can non-specifically import drug into the digestive vacuole, thus making the compound inactive or preventing it
from reaching its molecular target. However, this hypothesis is not fully explanatory of the collateral drug
sensitivity that we observe in parasites with PfMDR1 mutations. For example, copy number variation and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on this gene can result in resistance to certain antimalarials while
simultaneously increasing sensitivity to other compounds. We have discovered a novel compound, PRC1590,
potent against malaria that recapitulates this collateral drug sensitivity. Through in vitro selection of resistance
to this compound, we have identified that its resistance is due to a SNP on pfmdr1. We hypothesize that the SNP
causing resistance to PRC1590 results in decreased import of the drug into the digestive vacuole. In Aim 1, we
will characterize resistance of PRC1590 and its localization in the malaria parasite with fluorescence microscopy.
We will also perform cross-resistance screening to better understand how compounds like PRC1590 modulate
resistance through PfMDR1. For Aim 2, we will use chemoproteomic approaches to determine the mechanism
of action (MOA) of PRC1590. A better understanding of PRC1590 resistance, along with its localization and
mechanism of action will allow us to better understand how compounds modulate resistance through PfMDR1
mutations, which will be informative for partner drug pairings that exploit collateral drug sensitivity associated
with PfMDR1 resistance. This research will take place in Dr. Belen Cassera’s lab at the University of Georgia
(UGA), who has expertise in drug discovery, and target identification and validation which will allow us to
determine the mechanism of action of PRC1590. Additionally, UGA houses the Center for Tropical and Emerging
Global Diseases, which has one of the largest concentrations of parasitologists at a US university. Completion
of this project will allow for the trainee to develop into an independent scientist by gaining molecular and chemical
biology techniques, and mentorship experience through training of undergraduate researchers."

Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that grows within a lysosome-derived vacuole.
The formation of a replication-permissive vacuole by C. burnetii requires a type IVB secretion system called
Dot/Icm, and the >130 effector proteins delivered by this system into the host cell. While it is established that
the collective activities of these effector proteins remodel host signaling networks to create a replication-
permissive environment, the molecular targets and biochemical mechanisms of most of these effectors are not
known. My studies have established that C. burnetii inhibits the activation of the host RIG-I pathway, a
cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, and that this process requires two effectors, EmcA and
EmcB. Although these proteins do not have predicted sequence or structural homology that would indicate
possible biochemical functions, we established that EmcB has cysteine deubiquitinase activity. EmcB directly
targets RIG-I and preferentially cleaves long, K63-linked ubiquitin chains that are potent activators of RIG-I
signaling. The goal of this study is to determine how EmcB functions to cleave ubiquitin chains from RIG-I
during infection and identify how C. burnetii infection is sensed by RIG-I. To achieve this goal, I will use
biochemical assays, pull-down experiments, and infection studies using a newly engineered emcA, emcB
double mutant to determine how EmcB functions to inhibit the RIG-I pathway during infection (Aim 1). Next, I
will identify the specific RNAs sensed by RIG-I during C. burnetii infection and test the relative capacity of
these RNAs to activate the RIG-I pathway (Aim 2). Together, these studies will enhance our understanding of
how intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate host signaling networks for productive infection. By
understanding the molecular details of how an intracellular pathogen modulates host processes, fundamental
details of C. burnetii infection will be uncovered which could provide insights that lead to improved treatments.
These studies will be complemented by a rigorous and comprehensive program of professional training, clinical
training, and scientific skill building to provide preparations necessary to pursue a career as a physician-
scientist investigating molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis."

10828413,"There is an urgent need to establish the etiology and improve diagnostics of HIV-associated
meningitis in countries like Zambia given the high rates of mortality. A lack of post-mortem studies
in low and middle-income countries prevents in-depth studies on tissue from confirmed meningitis
patients. Central nervous system (CNS) co-infection frequently occurs in HIV-associated
meningitis, but no study has investigated its impact on mortality. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM),
one of the most common causes of HIV-associated meningitis, lacks a sensitive cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) lateral flow assay to serve as a simple point of care diagnostic. The best candidate
lipid biomarker for a point of care assay has not been established. Best practices and expertise
for CSF and brain tissue handling, processing, and analyses are also lacking in many sub-

Aim 1) Establish comprehensive etiologies of HIV-associated meningitis
Aim 2) To improve CSF diagnostics for patients with HIV-associated meningitis in
resource-limited settings, we will explore more optimal candidate CSF lipid biomarkers to
diagnose TBM.
Aim 3) Strengthen laboratory services to improve the diagnosis of meningitis
The approach is innovative, because it systematically uses post-mortem tissue from an endemic

Infecting an estimated one quarter of the world’s population, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is an ongoing threat to human
health worldwide. Mtb infection can lead to a wide range of outcomes ranging from an asymptomatic latent
infection to severe disease. These disease states are the function of bacterial, host, and environmental factors.
Despite ongoing selection to adapt to the host environment, the contribution of Mtb’s genetic variation is an
underappreciated variable in this equation.
Evolution acts on regulation of gene expression to create large phenotypic diversity from small genetic change.
Our long-term objective is to understand how evolution in Mtb’s regulatory network contributes to variation in
disease outcome. In a preliminary study, we used a high-throughput transcriptomic pipeline we built to capture
transcriptomes from 284 clinical isolates from Vietnam and Peru; we identified ~10% of well-transcribed genes
were highly variable across isolates and linked expression outliers to mutations in transcriptional regulators or
nearby regulatory regions. Unexpectedly, we identified an up to 17-fold range in expression of ESX-1 secreted
effector proteins; a key virulence pathway, ESX-1 is required for productive infection. Based on these results,
we propose two aims for this study. In Aim 1, since transcriptional regulation responds to the environment, we
will capture transcriptomes from our isolate library during in vitro acid stress and hypoxia, environments from
establishment of infection and survival in granuloma, respectively. By searching for convergent evolution in gene
expression across the phylogenetic tree, we will identify expression programs and genetic variants that drive
adaptive change in host. In Aim 2, we will build on our discovery of ESX-1’s expression variation and integrate
natural variants driving four distinct expression states across two secreted effector operons. Next, we will use
these engineered strains in a macrophage and mouse model of infection to determine if and how they drive
different disease phenotypes.
Mtb is under constant selective pressure to survive the host environment. This work uses Mtb’s natural variation
to illuminate the genetic pathways and molecular strategies that evolution bends to this goal. This work will
explore the mechanisms of Mtb genetic variation that contribute to variable disease outcomes. It is critical that
we expand our understanding of pathogens beyond a few strains: if we limit ourselves to laboratory strains, we
risk designing treatments that will not work outside the laboratory."

 Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit
by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to
an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective
is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale
interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution
of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we
will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher
accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex
groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional
query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data
and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline
rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models
and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management
program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid-
management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and
institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information
technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform
(i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that
we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML
will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study
will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby
enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at
BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a
large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The
methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential
incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of
population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a
platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes
are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care."
10864060,"My lab develops and applies new approaches at the interface of molecular evolution and protein
biochemistry . We have played a lead role in developing ancestral protein reconstruction (APR) with
molecular experiments as a powerful strategy to decisively identify the genetic, biophysical, and evolutionary
mechanisms by which extant proteins evolved new functions. We recently expanded this approach by
conducting the first studies to use deep mutational scanning of massive protein libraries to characterize the
distribution of functions in the sequence space around ancestral proteins; this allows us to compare the
trajectories taken during history to the vast number of alternative paths that could have been taken, thus
providing insight into the roles of functional optimization, neutral chance, epistasis, and historical
contingency in shaping the trajectories and outcomes of protein evolution. In the next 5 years, we will
further develop these approaches and apply them to two major problem areas:
 1) Evolution of complex protein features. Many proteins assemble into specific multimeric
complexes and are functionally regulated by binding to allosteric effectors. These features usually many
interacting residues, so it has been difficult to identify the evolutionary genetic and biochemical mechanisms
by which they originate during evolution. We will use APR and vertebrate hemoglobin as an ideal model
system to dissect the particular historical mutations and consequent changes in physical properties that
cause this essential protein to acquire multimerization and allostery from a simpler precursor.
 2) Comprehensive assessment of the functional, fitness, and epistatic effects of
substitutions during long-term protein evolution. Targeted experiments have shown that mutations
often epistatically modify the effects of other mutations in the same protein; theory and case studies suggest
these dependencies can make evolutionary paths and outcomes contingent on chance events. There have
been no comprehensive studies, however, to characterize the extent of epistasis among the full set of
substitutions that occurred during history, their effects on evolutionary processes, or the temporal dynamics
by which these effects emerge. We will use high-throughput protein library assays on ancestral proteins to
measure the functional and fitness effects and epistatic interactions of all substitution that occurred across
long, well-resolved historical trajectories, determine how shifts in these effects over time affected
evolutionary processes, and analyze how underlying biophysical mechanisms mediated these effects.
 As in our past work, we expect these new strategies to generate strongly supported new knowledge
concerning the mechanisms and forces that drive protein evolution, and that our approaches will be adopted
by other groups to deepen our evolutionary and biochemical understanding of other protein families."
10864061,"ABSTRACT
 Our multidisciplinary research team has been studying the function and effects of neurotensin (NT), a
tridecapeptide localized to specialized enteroendocrine cells predominantly in the small bowel, for almost three
decades. The most potent stimulus for NT release is ingestion of dietary fats. NT facilitates fatty acid (FA)
absorption in the intestine, stimulates growth of cancers that have the high affinity NT receptor 1 (NTR1), and
contributes to overall metabolism although its precise role in these processes has not been clearly delineated.
Recent studies have identified a significant association of increased fasting pro-NT (a stable NT precursor
fragment produced in equimolar amounts relative to NT) levels with the development of diabetes, increased risk
of cardiovascular disease and mortality, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and increased risk of breast
cancer in women. These findings identify a possible role for NT in lipid metabolism and link increased NT levels
to various metabolic diseases, certain cancers and increased morbidity and mortality. The signaling pathways
and role for NT in the absorption and storage of ingested fats represents a major gap in our current knowledge.
 Epidemiological evidence clearly shows a direct linkage between overnutrition and obesity; however, the
molecular mechanisms linking adiposity to overnutrition remain unknown. We have shown that NT deficiency
(using an NT knockout mouse model) decreases body weight gain, insulin resistance and NAFLD associated
with high fat consumption; we further demonstrated that NT attenuates the activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) and stimulates FA absorption through a mechanism involving NTR1 and NTR3/sortilin.
Importantly, in humans, we show that increased levels of pro-NT strongly predict new onset obesity in a graded
manner, which is independent of body mass index and insulin resistance, suggesting that NT may provide a
prognostic marker of future obesity and a potential target for obesity prevention and treatment. Therefore, to
extend the findings made during this grant period, the central hypothesis for this renewal application is that NT
promotes triglyceride synthesis and suppresses FA oxidation in the intestine and liver likely through a mechanism
involving AMPK inhibition; moreover, NT contributes to high-fat diet-disrupted adipocyte lipolysis via inhibiting
activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). We speculate that
overconsumption of dietary fats, which leads to excess NT secretion, results in obesity (from continued fat
storage) and metabolic disorders (e.g., NAFLD and insulin resistance). To examine our long-term goal of better
defining intestinal NT function, we have assembled a highly collaborative team with defined expertise in NT
physiology and function; signal transduction, metabolism and systems biochemistry; and biostatistics and
computational biology. Ultimately, our findings will: i) significantly advance the fields of gastrointestinal
physiology, endocrinology and metabolism; ii) change existing paradigms regarding the systemic effects of NT;
and iii) revolutionize our concept of gut hormones and their role in metabolic diseases."
10864063,"Thermogenesis is the principal mechanism through which mammals dissipate energy. Pioneering work dating
back to the 1930s demonstrated that neurons within the hypothalamus are sensitive to ambient and local
deviations in temperature, and that in turn, these neurons could outcome a potent change in body temperature.
A basic goal of neuroscience has been to identify the neural substrates underlying thermoregulation.
Significant progress has been made on understanding how hypothalamic cell types regulate thermogenesis
and thermogenesis related processes such as shivering; however, what populations outside of the
hypothalamus regulate temperature and how they accomplish this feat is incompletely understood.
 Mentored work will focus on establishing the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as a critical regulator of
thermogenesis. In particular, we plan to delineate the neural circuits embedded within the DRN that regulate
energy expenditure through changes in thermogenesis. Preliminary data using whole-brain activity mapping,
demonstrate activation of GABAergic DRN neurons in heat environment. Furthermore, through a combination
of chemogenetic approaches, we proof that activation of these neurons directly regulate thermogenesis
through autonomic and/or behavioral mechanisms. Together, through a combination of functional, molecular,
and anatomic approaches, we will dissect whether the DRN bidirectionally controls thermogenesis and its
specific upstream and downstream neurocircuitry in thermal regulation. Previous identified roles in feeding
regulation for this region together with these results opens a new horizon in obesity treatment. On the
independent phase, I plan to identify the molecular identity of neurons in premotor areas of the CNS
responsible for a thermogenic response. My overarching hypothesis is that one subset of premotor
neurons in the CNS drives a coordinated response to control thermogenesis through sympathetic
nervous system mediated outflow to specific peripheral tissues. Furthermore, after corroborating that
direct modulation of these neurons modulates body temperature, the proposed research will focus on defining
if there is neuronal molecular heterogeneity in these premotor areas regarding the sympathetic nervous system
mediated coordinated thermogenic response. I will take an interdisciplinary approach, using a combination of
novel, state-of-the-art molecular technologies, such as optogenetics, neuronal tracing, calcium imaging and
molecular phenotyping, together with metabolic assessments. This work will ultimately identify how the CNS
orchestrates a thermogenic response. The proposed work will set the grounds for my own laboratory on central
nervous system (CNS) mediated regulation of thermogenesis. Altogether, this work seeks to better understand
thermogenesis regulation and establish the framework of my career as an independent investigator.
Additionally, future molecular profiling studies of these neurons will allow us to perform cell-type specific
targeted pharmacology mimicking the metabolic outcomes of cold exposure to ultimately treat obesity.

Pelvic pain syndromes are one of the most prevalent and challenging conditions for clinicians today. They have
a higher incidence in women than men and are estimated to affect 6.4 – 25.4% of adult women worldwide.
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as nonmalignant persistent pain perceived in structures or organs of the
pelvis for at least 6 months and can have a wide variety of etiologies. CPP has a debilitating effect on quality
of life, equivalent to those on dialysis, and is associated with psychological comorbidity including depression,
anxiety, and sleep disorders. Identifying the origin of the pelvic pain is typically the first step when choosing a
treatment strategy. However, identifying the etiology can be challenging in part because pain associated with
CPP is thought to become centralized over time and the dysfunction of one organ system often resulting in
pathologies in other organs.
Given the complex co-morbid conditions that define the phenotype of most patients with CPP, any treatment
that may potentially improve several downstream pelvic organs and/or symptoms is desirable. As such, we
propose to use sacral neuromodulation (SNM) as a treatment for CPP. SNM is a safe, effective, and minimally
invasive procedure used to treat urinary and fecal incontinence, frequency, urgency, and urinary retention.
Numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in pelvic pain as a secondary outcome
measure with SNM. However, to date, no prospective placebo-controlled trial has been performed to assess
the effectiveness of SNM for pelvic pain specifically, in part because SNM is currently not an FDA approved
treatment for CPP. Thus, we hypothesize that sacral neuromodulation is effective at reducing pain in
patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We further hypothesize that single stage SNM
implantation is more cost-effective and provides higher benefit to pelvic pain patients than the
standard-of-care 2-stage approach.
Our hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1. Assess effectiveness of SNM in treating chronic
pelvic pain syndrome in women; 2. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of single stage versus standard-of-care
2-stage SNM. Beaumont Urology is internationally recognized for its expertise in neuromodulation and a large
number of women with CPP seek care at our Women’s Urology Center annually. Thus, our team is well-suited
to successfully complete these aims.
The outcomes of this study will have a far-reaching impact as it has the potential to significantly improve care
for CPP and simultaneously address many unknowns in the field of neuromodulation, such as determine the
placebo and carry-over effects. As such, study falls within the mission of this RFA to foster new and improved
treatment and pain management strategies for patients and to address specific NIDDK disorders of key
importance, namely Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome."
10839303,"SUMMARY
Organ transplantation has become the standard of care for many end-state diseases, but currently
requires life-long administration of potent immunosuppressive drugs. This results in increased morbidity
and mortality from infection, malignancy and other metabolic disorders. Establishing a reliable method
to achieve allograft survival without ongoing immunosuppression (I.S.) remains an important goal.
We previously reported achievement of long-term I.S.-free renal allograft survival in humans after
induction of only transient hematopoietic chimerism through donor bone marrow (BM) transplantation.
To expand the application of our approach, it is imperative to improve the levels and consistency of
hematopoietic chimerism without increasing myelosuppression associated with the current conditioning
regimen. We have identified a novel strategy in nonhuman primates that addresses this obstacle by
enhancing intrinsic apoptosis of selective hematopoietic cells using a B cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor (Bcl-
2i). This approach significantly improves chimerism levels and duration and achieves I.S.-free renal
allograft survival without neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. These studies did reveal that
costimulatory blockade (CB) remains essential for tolerance induction with Bcl-2i. Therefore, we will
first define a protocol using only FDA approved (or in the process of being FDA approved) CB, including
1) anti-CD2 mAb, 2) Fc-modified anti-CD154 mAb, and 3) Belatacept. More recently, with the support
of an exploratory R21 grant, we have found that induction of hematopoietic chimerism appears to be
possible even without any chemo/radiation therapy, if hematopoietic stem cells are adequately depleted
from BM niches with a Bcl-2i in combination with another proapoptotic agent that inhibits Myeloid cell
leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). In our proposal, we will therefore further pursue the ultimate goal to induce
hematopoietic chimerism without any radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.
Also of major importance for more widespread clinical applicability, we will extend the most successful
Bcl-2i based protocol to our novel “delayed tolerance” approach. This will, for the first time, make
tolerance induction strategies available to recipients of deceased donor allografts using cryopreserved
BM, as well as to ongoing living donor transplant recipients whose kidney donor is available to provide
hematopoietic stem cells.
Finally, we will elucidate the mechanistic pathways involved in successful I.S.-free renal allograft
survival by transient hematopoietic chimerism and proapoptotic agents, utilizing extensive in vitro and
in vivo experiments with novel immunological approaches."

The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the
candidate with training and research experiences that will promote her development as an independent
clinician-researcher, with particular emphasis in the field of intervention research addressing hypertension
control, specifically self-management (home blood pressure monitoring and self-titration of medications) as a
tool to deal with cardiovascular disparities related to displacement in refugees. This training will provide her
with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in: 1) hypertension epidemiology and disparities focusing
on migration as a social determinant of health,; 2) acquire knowledge in the theory, development,
implementation, and adaptation of theoretically driven community-based interventions to improve blood
pressure (BP) control through self-management; 3) acquire skills in qualitative (social network analysis)
multilevel modeling of longitudinal data to assess the efficacy of interventions and hypertension self-
management clinical trials. Training activities will include didactic coursework and specific workshops, directed
readings, one-on-one tutorials with mentors, and instructions in the responsible conduct of research that
focuses on vulnerable populations. The candidate will capitalize on her previous clinical and research
experience with refugees, and leverage mentorship from a Training Committee comprised of globally
renowned experts in the fields of CVD disparities, community interventions, hypertension trials, social
determinants of immigrant health, and advanced biostatistics. The present K23 research project emerges from
the existing research infrastructure and extensive experience of her mentors’ self-management trials in CVD
disparities, epidemiological research and clinical trials, to carve out a niche for me to specialize in CVD clinical
trials and prevention in refugees and vulnerable immigrants. The specific aims are to conduct a structured
feasibility study through: 1) Understanding knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to self-management of
hypertension among refugees; 2) Developing, adapting and implementing a culturally-sensitive hypertension
self-management intervention in refugees in San Diego; and 3) Identifying factors affecting the feasibility and
acceptability of such an intervention to estimate effect sizes and outcome measures to be used in a future
powered trial. This work will lay strong foundations for the first powered randomized clinical trial of refugee
hypertension self-management ever conducted. While the specified initial goal of this work is to adapt an
evidence-based hypertension self-management intervention model adapted from recent large clinical trials, we
hypothesize that this intervention will be feasible in refugees; they can do it, accept it and give us leads on
designing a future clinical trial to learn more about CVD disparities science and implementation research. The
candidate’s longer-term goal is to develop expertise necessary to become a leading trialist in understanding
and addressing cardiovascular health disparities."
10839320,"Project Summary/Abstract:
A major contributor to altered gene expression and chromatin reorganization in endocrine-related cancers is
nuclear receptor signaling. Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that
regulate diverse physiological functions including development, reproduction, homeostasis, and metabolism.
They also represent an important group of prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets in hormone-driven
cancers.
In the F99 phase of this proposal, my focus is on studying the impact of dysregulation of the transcription factor
TRβ, a member of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) family in dedifferentiated thyroid tumors. The current
prognosis for patients with resistant or recurrent thyroid cancer is extremely poor. Due to the lack of effective
therapies, patients with advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer have a higher mortality rate than all other
endocrine cancers combined. Importantly, restoration of TRβ function in malignant cells decreases tumor growth
in xenograft studies. Despite a recognized role as a tumor suppressor, the mechanisms by which TRβ regulates
tumor growth are not clear. Therefore, I will address the critical need for a deeper understanding of thyroid
hormone receptor beta (TRβ) tumor suppressor mechanisms to inform the development more effective therapies
for aggressive thyroid cancer. The directly regulated genes of TRβ will be defined through an integrated analysis
of genome-wide binding and global gene expression data in thyroid cells. I will also determine the role that BRG1
plays in facilitating thyroid hormone induced chromatin remodeling, and its importance for maintenance of a
normal transcriptional profile in thyroid cells. These data will provide us with key insights into thyroid cancer
growth and progression, and allow for new target pathways to be explored as therapeutic options.
In the K00 phase, I propose to pursue my broader interests in nuclear receptor mediated epigenetic programming
and crosstalk in cancer in an environment which will allow me to expand my expertise hormone-mediated gene
regulation and my technical skill set. I have identified a critical gap in our current understanding of the impact of
hormone signaling on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and changes in chromatin in structure. I plan to build
upon my current training to develop a project that addresses the epigenetic mechanisms by which hormone
signaling affects cancer cell identity, and translate these findings into clinically meaningful signatures. This work
will add depth to our current understanding of nuclear receptor biology, and advance our ability to effectively
treat hormone-dependent cancers with therapies that target nuclear receptors."

The Mission of the MADRC Clinical Core parallels that of our Center as a whole: to detect clinically
meaningful changes in cognition and function in culturally, linguistically, and educationally diverse
older participants whose cognition ranges from normal to dementia, and who have syndromic Alzheimer’s,
Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), or Frontotemporal Dementia (FTLD). We aim at integrating standard and novel
clinical measures with advanced imaging and fluid biomarker data to evaluate clinical progression in the
context of disease markers, in order to accurately predict future trajectories. To accomplish these goals, we
have three Aims. Aim 1 CONTRIBUTES to the Center’s ability to carry out clinical research on Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD), focusing on developing and maintaining a diverse Research Cohort of
men and women with enhanced recruitment of our prioritized minority participants (Black or African American
and Hispanic), facilitating the collection of neuroimaging studies and fluid biomarkers, and developing a
protocol for disclosure of research findings. Aim 2, DEVELOPS new strategies, focusing on achieving universal
deep phenotyping of our Research Cohort and developing and testing novel clinical instruments, with an
emphasis on digital methods, for early disease detection and tracking of minimum clinically meaningful change
that can readily translate into primary care and community-based settings. We will also work closely with the
newly created MassGeneral Brigham Alzheimer Therapeutic program – a centralized program focused on
equitable access and monitoring of all patients undergoing newly FDA-approved medications for AD in our
institution– to implement standard UDS and validated novel measures in those patients. We will continue to
share our data and discoveries with other ADRCs and the broader scientific community for validation and
implementation. Aim 3 TRAINS clinical fellows and offers immersive experiences of clinical ADRD to REC
trainees in clinical diagnosis and provides cutting-edge training in clinical research methods. Aim 4
DIVERSIFIES the Clinical Core staff and Research Cohort participants by fostering recruitment, training, and
retention of diverse staff, and fully engaging and facilitating access to our growing minority participants and
their local communities to all research, education, and treatment and prevention efforts on ADRD. Overall, our
ultimate goal is to engage and promote equity across all stakeholders - patients, caregivers, clinicians and
researchers- as direct partners to accelerate toward a cure for ADRD."
10864397,"The Data Management and Statistics Core (Data Core) of the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (MADRC) provides state-of-the-art data management and statistical expertise for the
MADRC and affiliated research studies, for collaborative efforts with other ADRCs, and for national
AD/ADRD research initiatives. The Data Core is an essential component of the MADRC research enterprise
as it facilitates scientific rigor, regulatory-compliance, and strong connectedness across cores within our
Center, and with NACC and others outside our Center. It serves to minimize the burdens of research by
optimizing study efficiencies through subject selection, endpoint selection, facile and adaptive designs, as
well as provides guidance on rigorous study design and analyses. The Data Core provides informatics
expertise and assistance, including data-management, timely data transmission to NACC, and query and
reporting support to all the MADRC Cores.
 The Core will play a major role in helping MADRC achieve its overarching goal of understanding
drivers of clinical progression. The Core aims to contribute easily accessible data resources and
statistical expertise to local, regional, national, and international ADRD research (Aim 1); to develop,
implement, and share new statistical, machine learning, and bioinformatics methods to better understand
inter-individual variability in the pace of change. We will utilize data from natural history studies combined
with computational approaches to better understand how new treatment modalities affect clinical progression
and impact research. (Aim 2); to train clinical and translational researchers from diverse backgrounds in
quantitative methods and attract quantitative scientists to ADRD research by collaborating with the Research
Education Component (REC) to train clinical and translational researchers in quantitative methods and to
attract quantitative scientists to AD/ADRD research (Aim 3); and to diversify the Research Cohort and other
ADRD research participants by optimally leveraging data and technology for recruitment into research
studies and clinical trials, as well as to diversify staff and faculty engaged in ADRD data science (Aim 4). We
will freely disseminate our methodological innovations to the scientific community and promote open and
reproducible science through data and software sharing.
 The Data Core provides guidance on scientific rigor: it assists MADRC researchers with study design
and ensures valid and accurate analyses of studies across all MADRC Cores. The Data Core also advises
MADRC researchers on data quality, version control and tracking measures. It ensures all systems are
secure and within the Mass General Brigham (MGB) IT Infrastructure. The Core promotes open and

10864398,"The Neuropathology (NP) Core serves both the Massachusetts ADRC (MADRC) and the broader research
community by providing diagnostic validation of clinical assessments and providing deeply characterized tissue
to investigators. The availability of tissue from the Core has been widely used by investigators working on
AD/ADRD. It is well accepted now that a combination of pathologic processes underly cognitive impairment in
most individuals and this is likely to also influence aspects of symptom progression and responses to emerging
therapies. With our robust experience and resources, we are well positioned to use insights from autopsy
tissue to understand drivers of clinical progression. The Core remains an outstanding environment in which
to train clinical and experimental neuroscientists, neurologists and neuropathologists to work on ADRD and
drive future advances. To complete these missions, we have four Aims.
The first Aim is to contribute to neuropathologic diagnosis and tissue resources by the collection,
diagnosis, collection of data, full reporting of findings – to families and relevant physicians with a CLIA-
compliant autopsy report through the Clinical Core, and to the Data Core for research purposes -- and the wide
distribution of samples in support of the research community.
The second Aim is to develop new methods and reagents for prediction of molecular phenotyping and
prediction of pace of change using cell-based methods, including patient-specific iPSCs, and cell-free
aggregation methods with intention of translation to individuals along the course of their illnesses. This aim
also includes extension of on-going work using RNA and proteomic analyses as part of a search for additional
potential biomarkers. Finally, the Core will contribute to the development and extension to human autopsy
tissue of novel tissue preparation methods including expansion microscopy and tissue elasticization.
The third Aim is to train the next generation of neuropathologists and investigators, building off the Core’s
long history of guiding individuals towards work in ADRD. These efforts are done with the MADRC REC.
The important fourth Aim is to diversify staff and points of view with continued efforts to ensure broad
representation among Core staff, through educational outreach in collaboration with ORE and Clinical Cores,
and through Spanish language support for autopsy consenting and reporting."
10864399,"ORE Core: Abstract
Research on Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) has advanced significantly in recent years,
with the development of new knowledge and treatments across the ADRD continuum. But lack of education
about ADRD in the community contributes to ongoing fear and stigma such that those at risk or living with
ADRD often delay seeking care and are reluctant to participate in research, leading to knowledge gaps on the
meaning of clinical, fluid, and imaging biomarkers, and on the impact of pharmacological and other treatment
modalities on outcomes. Many clinicians also describe low levels of confidence around dementia diagnosis and
management, slowing referrals of persons to appropriate resources or research. These issues are particularly
marked among Black or African American (hereafter referred to as Black) and Hispanic groups, who are at 2-3-
fold higher risk for developing dementia than non-Hispanic Caucasian Americans yet remain underrepresented
in research studies. The MADRC Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core will support the overall
theme of the MADRC - Understanding Drivers of Clinical Progression through: 1) working with each of the
Cores to further expand and diversify participation in ADRD clinical research, 2) acquiring new strategies to
find ways to bring research into the community; 3) further strengthening community partnerships, and 4)
training diverse clinicians, scientists, and research staff in community engaged research to increase dementia
knowledge and improve care. It will 1. Contribute to the MADRC’s ability to support and carry out clinical
research in ADRD by building, maintaining, and retaining our Research Cohort, working with partner
community organizations to increase understanding of dementia and dementia research participation, and
disseminating effective recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies; 2: Develop, in partnership with the
Clinical, Neuropath, Biomarkers, Data and Imaging Cores, new tools and strategies to bring educational
materials and research into the community; 3. Train the next generation in the science of community-engaged
research and in identification of at-risk persons or those living with dementia and provision of diagnostic
disclosure, and anticipatory guidance based on growing understanding of drivers of disease progression in
high-risk communities and minority populations; and 4: Increase the diversity of staff and research
participants so that studies are representative of the spectrum of race, ethnicity, gender identity, and ability
characterizing our community. We will harness input from our Community Advisory Board and other community
partners to both recruit and effectively retain participants from diverse backgrounds."

The Biomarker Core provides state-of-the-art biofluid processing, biobanking, and biomarker assays in blood
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to advance diagnostic, prognostic, mechanistic and therapeutics research for the
Massachusetts ADRC (MADRC) and the broader ADRD research community. A particular interest of ours is
the qualification of biomarkers that are fit-for-purpose to characterize heterogenous pathophysiological drivers
of ADRD at group and individual participant levels. Through this we contribute to MADRC’s goal to understand
disease and clinical progression as we integrate, analyze and interpret these data with all of MADRC's Cores'
data. Our focus on precision and individual-specific biomarker profiling moves us closer to personalized
medicine for ADRD and it enables research with broader inclusion of diverse peoples. In the course of this
work, we train and mentor students, trainees, junior faculty and collaborators in the rapidly evolving use and
growing value of biomarkers in ADRD research and clinical translation. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1)
Contribute to the diagnosis and biological characterization of ADRD for the MADRC and be a resource for
biofluids, technologies and expertise in biomarkers research. We will bank blood and CSF constituents,
measure amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration biomarkers in all MADRC specimens and share these biofluids
and data for use by MADRC, collaborating and national and international ADRD research efforts. Aim 2)
Discover new candidate biomarkers and develop new assays to fulfill unmet needs for characterizing
heterogenous pathophysiological drivers of ADRD beyond amyloid and tau. We will focus on developing blood-
based biomarkers of synaptic loss, use two new, large, deep proteomic datasets in CSF and in plasma to
identify new candidate biomarkers for ADRD research, refine our multi-pathophysiology panels of CSF and
plasma biomarkers to characterize the relative contributions of vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and other
processes, and work with the Neuropathology Core to develop novel seeding assays of α-synuclein and tau
proteoforms for CSF. Aim 3) Train the next generation of clinical laboratory and translational investigators. We
will train scientists in biomarker research for ADRD with the REC and educate professionals with the ORE and
Clinical Cores in the use and interpretation of biomarkers in evaluation and management of ADRD. Aim 4)
Diversify ADRD researchers, research participants and research. We will continue to enhance opportunities
for trainees and junior faculty from underrepresented in medicine (UiM) groups and increase underrepresented
group participation in blood and CSF research via engagement with ORE Core activities, relationship-building
efforts, dissemination and a focus on biomarker tools for personalized medicine."

of lower division Biomedical Engineering (BME) and Chemical Engineering (CME) undergraduates (UGs), who
are underrepresented (UR) racially, economically, or through disability. Trainees will bring diverse viewpoints
and approaches to address these healthcare challenges. ESTEEMED trainees will develop strong academic and
research foundations, as well as the drive and vision to complete doctoral training programs and launch into
impactful biomedical research careers. UTSA is an excellent training ground for these future scientists, with a
large UR student population, excellent academic programs, and laboratories that perform high quality biomedical
research and embrace UG researchers. The first ESTEEMED program laid strong foundations for success. Now
the program will be refined to serve students with a bioengineering focus. The proposed ESTEEMED program
requests 13 training positions in its first year and 12 thereafter to support first- and second- year students. We
hypothesize that we will build strong foundations for our trainees and start their trajectory to a doctorate, through
accomplishment of the following Specific Aims: #1 support academic achievement with science refreshers,
tutoring, and mentoring; #2 support growth as a scientist and science communicator; #3 instruct trainees about
diverse doctoral-level career options; and #4 promote leadership development and address known barriers to
UG and Ph.D. degree attainment in UR populations. The activities designed to achieve these Aims will
commence in a pre-Freshman Bridge Program, extend throughout all semesters of the freshman and sophomore
years, and include part-time research through the academic years and two full-time intramural and extramural
summer research programs. Eighteen diverse UTSA research mentors (8 Hispanic and 6 women) with active
biomedical-focused research programs have been recruited because of their strong passion for mentoring UGs.
UTSA was awarded a new MARC Honors Research Training Program in 2022 that will provide upper division
training. The success of ESTEEMED will be measured quantitively by the following outcomes: 95% of trainees
will complete their degree, 75% will progress to MARC and 75% of MARC matriculants will pursue a PhD, 90%
trainees will keep a GPA>3.4, all sophomore trainees will present at several local and one national conference,
and 30% will gain authorship by graduation. Qualitatively, success will be reflected by reported increases in
confidence and integration into science culture. Program success will provide evidence for inclusion of additional
freshman interventions on campus. ESTEEMED will be run by a leadership team that has an established record
of success in UG research training programs. UTSA’s administration has committed substantial financial and
operational support for ESTEEMED."
10862236,"With successes in cancer treatment becoming more common, treating patients with metastatic melanoma
(MM) is still grim. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy, particularly, has revolutionized the
promise of generating more durable responses; however, the 5-year survival rate for patients with MM remains
only ~23%. Due to therapy resistance and persistence of tumor-initiating cell (TIC) subpopulations, there is a
vital need for predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response and novel therapeutic targets to augment current
treatments for MM. Our laboratory has recently pioneered investigations on the signature features of the
human MM cell glycome and how these discrete glycans and glycan-binding factors impact melanoma
progression. The MM glycome is characterized by an abundance of cell surface i-linear poly-N-
acetyllactosamines (linear poly-LacNAc) via loss of I-branching poly-LacNAc enzyme GCNT2 and elevations in
LacNAc-binding lectin, galectin (Gal)-8. In fact, low melanoma cell GCNT2/I-branching corresponds with
human MM progression, whereas detection of Gal-8 in serum directly correlates with a diagnosis of melanoma.
Exciting, published data show that elevations in MM cell Gal-8 and Gal-8-binding linear poly-LacNAcs directly
result in expression a key TIC factor, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)/CD271, a known driver of therapy
resistance and MM progression. Engagement of this Gal-8 – Gal-8 ligand axis enhances TIC potential, pAKT
activity, and in vivo tumor-forming activity of human MM cells. Our guiding hypothesis is that the MM
glycome helps govern the malignant traits and capacity for melanomas to metastasize. Expression of
Gal-8 and its glycoprotein ligands bearing linear poly-LacNAcs may help predict which melanomas will
metastasize and even provide new opportunities to treat patients with MM. In this grant, we will conduct
molecular characterization of the MM cell Gal-8 – ligand axis, probe the role of Gal-8 in melanoma growth and
metastasis, and determine whether melanoma-intrinsic or host Gal-8 impacts melanoma immunity and alters
anti-tumor responses to ICI therapy. The Specific Aims are: 1.) To examine the functional role of the Gal-8
– ligand axis in melanoma progression, and 2.) To analyze the growth- and metastasis-promoting roles
of Gal-8 in melanoma. We are implementing: 1.) a strong investigator team consisting of glyco-analytics
experts, clinical investigators, melanoma pathologists, and galectin biology experts; 2.) primary human
melanoma tissues and stage-specific melanoma patient serum samples; 3.) innovative Gal-8 ligand/glycan
assessment methods; and 4.) pre-clinical mouse and MM cell Gal-8-deficient models to impart the most
impactful comprehensive data in this project. Results from this transformative proposal will illuminate how MM
glycome regulates MM TIC factor, NGFR, and melanoma growth and metastasis, implicating Gal-8 and linear
poly-LacNAcs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets of MM progression."

The general goals of this proposal are: (1) to establish robust, consistent, and safe states of ART-free
remission (‘functional cures’) in SHIV- and SIV-infected rhesus macaques through sustained expression of
antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors, (2) to understand the role of the macaque immune system and
antiretroviral therapy in facilitating these functional cures, and (3) to determine if these functional cures can
also help accelerate the decay of the reservoir of latently infected cells. The Administrative Core will
provide all the logistic, scientific, managerial, statistical, regulatory and financial support necessary to
facilitate and coordinate the studies of this program, thus ensuring the successful completion of these goals.
The Administrative Core will also establish and facilitate the activities of a Governing Committee with broad
experience in non-human primate studies and in the application of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to
the treatment and prevention of viral infection. This Governing Committee will meet quarterly, twice with an
appointed Scientific Advisory and NIH Program officials, and twice independently. The Administrative Core
will facilitated these meetings. The Core will also promote cross-project collaborations by covering the
publication costs of all manuscripts involving multi-project collaborations central to the goals of this
proposal, and ensure statistical support for all studies described in this program. Finally the Core will
assume responsibility for compliance with animal care and use, financial, and reporting requirements
associated with this program."

10864993,"Project Summary:
The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system is one of the most widely-used models in neuroscience to study how
information about movement and touch are combined. During many exploratory behaviors, rats and mice
sweep their whiskers back and forth in a rapid, rhythmic motion called “whisking” to actively gather touch
information. Although whisking is rhythmic, rodents can also change how their whiskers move depending on
the desired sensory information, and on their particular behavior. Researchers are nearly able to begin to
“close-the-loop” between movement and touch for the whisker system, except for one critical gap: we do not
yet have a three dimensional (3D) model of rodent facial musculature. Without such a model, we cannot
identify how the rat changes its muscle activity to change whisker motion and acquire particular types of
sensory information. We cannot know which whisker motions are fixed via the biomechanics, versus which
motions the rat can actively control. We cannot fully understand the motor commands sent to the whisker
muscles. The central goal of this proposal is to develop three-dimensional (3D) models of rodent facial
musculature that close this gap. We will first use a novel combination of tactile profilometry, histology, MRI, and
CT-scans to quantify the anatomy of rodent facial muscles and the follicles that hold the whiskers. Using this
anatomy, we will then construct 3D biomechanical models of the whisker muscles and follicles to simulate the
motion of all whiskers. These models will be validated and tested in several different complementary software
systems, and then be used to test eleven specific predictions for the particular function of each whisker-related
muscle. Finally, we will integrate the 3D models of rodent facial muscles with existing models that describe the
sensory, tactile side of whisker motion. These combined muscle-sensory simulations will be directly compared
with active animal behavior. This work takes a step towards closing the loop between motor action and the
sensory data acquired, and helps disentangle the relative roles of biomechanics and neural control during
different types of whisking. The proposed work will inform all levels of study of whisker neural pathways, from
primary sensory neurons to sensory and motor cortical areas, to brainstem regions involved in controlling
whisker motions. More generally, whisking represents a unique window into how volitional control can
modulate or override centrally-patterned movement. The transition between varieties of rhythmic and non-
rhythmic movement has important implications for the coordination of sniffing, breathing, olfaction, chewing,
swallowing, and suckling, and the proposed work could thus shed light on the neuromechanical basis for some
pediatric and geriatric dysphagias."

Modern day drug discovery is a long and expensive process requiring teams of scientists, multiple years of
research, and millions of dollars to identify preclinical drug candidates suitable for clinical tests. The incorporation
of computational tools into drug discovery has proved an effective means to reduce these costs. All-atom
molecular dynamics simulations coupled with alchemical free energy calculations have been extremely beneficial
tools for studying structural and thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand complexes and optimizing drug
candidates for improved binding affinity to a target of interest. Lambda dynamics (LD), a newer alchemical free
energy method, facilitates the sampling of multiple perturbations to a chemical system, simultaneously, within a
single molecular dynamics simulation, overcoming inherent scalability limitations associated with conventional
free energy methods. To date, a variety of chemical perturbations, including diverse ligand functional group
transformations and protein side chain mutations, have been performed with (LD) on a single chemical entity,
e.g., a small molecule or protein, with much success. Tens to hundreds of chemical states have been efficiently
sampled using an order of magnitude less computational resources compared to conventional methods. This
proposal seeks support to build upon these findings and apply LD-based techniques to explore multifaceted
design problems in drug discovery featuring chemical modifications on multiple binding partners. Specifically,
three challenging areas of drug discovery will be investigated: (1) understanding and overcoming drug resistance
originating from missense mutations in a drug target, (2) characterizing protein-protein interactions and binding
specificities, and (3) automating the generation of novel, target-specific lead compound analogs by integrating
LD calculations with machine- or deep-learning algorithms. Success in these efforts will require searching
through large combinatorial chemical spaces that can only be accomplished with LD-based techniques. Model
protein-target systems of high therapeutic importance from Multiple Myeloma or Alzheimer’s Disease will be
investigated in accomplishing our goals. Thus, this work will assist in accelerating preclinical structure-based
drug design by enabling complex molecular design scenarios to be addressed in these devastating diseases."
10864995,"Abstract. Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a universal problem in the growing
elderly population. To design effective interventions we need to better understand the mechanism(s) responsible
for initiation and progression of muscle atrophy and weakness in aging. Studies from our lab and others have
shown that loss of innervation is a key driver of muscle atrophy with age. The goal of this proposal is to test
a novel hypothesis that bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins and oxidized phospholipids (oxPL)), are
primary effectors for muscle atrophy and weakness. Our hypothesis is strongly supported by our data
showing that denervation induces activation of phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), releasing arachidonic acid (AA) from
muscle membranes that can promote generation of oxidized lipids, either non-enzymatically or via 12/15
lipoxygenase (Alox15) dependent generation. We have also shown that denervation-induced muscle loss is
decreased when AA release and oxidized lipids are blocked by inhibition of cPLA2 or Alox15, or by scavenging
of LOOH using liproxstatin-1 or Gpx4Tg mice, thus supporting oxPL/oxylipins as a critical mechanistic link
between denervation and muscle wasting. However, the mechanisms by which oxPL/oxylipins cause muscle
atrophy have not been defined. Based on previously identified targets of these lipid mediators, we are specifically
testing the hypothesis that oxPL/oxylipins induced by denervation cause damage to membranes,
promote mitochondrial changes and activate proteolytic and cell death pathways to induce age-related
muscle atrophy. In Aim 1, we will define the effect of modulating oxylipins on atrophy related targets by inhibiting
generation of oxPL/oxylipins (using cPLA2KO and Alox15KO mice) and by altering reduction of lipid
hydroperoxides (using Gpx4/Tg and muscle specific Gpx4KO mice and treatment with liproxstatin-1) on
membrane oxidative damage, mitochondrial function, muscle degradative and cell death pathways and muscle
mass after denervation. These experiments will identify the primary oxylipins produced in denervated muscle
and identify the critical targets of oxylipins that lead to muscle atrophy and weakness. In Aim 2, we will measure
the effect of key oxylipins identified in Aim 1 in vitro in C2C12 muscle cells on oxidative damage, mitochondrial
function, protein degradation pathways and muscle fiber diameter. These experiments will provide new
information on the effect of specific oxylipins on muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function. Finally, in Aim
3, we will test whether inhibiting oxylipin generation in vivo in muscle specific Alox15KO mice or reducing levels
of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) in mice with elevated levels of Gpx4 expression can protect against age-related
muscle atrophy in vivo in aging mice. We predict that reduced generation of oxPL/oxylipins and enhanced
detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) will modify the atrophy targets outlined in Aim 1, reducing muscle
atrophy and weakness in aging mice. Overall, these experiments will be the first to investigate the role of oxylipins
in sarcopenia and their potential as a target for intervention in muscle loss and weakness."
10864996,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly 250,000 patients annually undergo surgical coronary revascularization and/or valve repair or replacement
in the US. Despite improvements in operative care and technology, patients remain at substantial risk of
postoperative complications that adversely impact quality of life and survival. Healthcare-acquired infections
“HAIs” (e.g., pulmonary, bloodstream, deep-sternal wound) occur in ~10% of patients undergoing these
operations and significantly increase 90-day payments by $10-$13K. Patients at higher versus lower HAI tercile
hospitals have higher (18% versus 9%) risk of major morbidity and mortality, p < 0.001. Despite existing efforts
focused on in-hospital HAI prevention practices (e.g., appropriate timing and type of antibiotics, nursing intensive
care unit bundle adherence), substantial interhospital variability persists in HAI rates. Only 2% of hospital
variation in HAI rates is explained by traditional factors, highlighting the need to identify significant determinants.
Our team has mapped provider care delivery networks serving cardiac surgery patients that reflect coordination
of patient disease management and care optimization (e.g., communication and information exchange) to
accomplish collaborative tasks (e.g., patient selection, timing of surgery, intensive care unit recovery, post-
discharge care) across multiple provider specialties and settings. We have merged national administrative claims
with clinical registry data among patients undergoing durable left ventricular assist devices and found: (1)
networks serving racially segregated communities display greater care fragmentation (i.e., weaker connectivity
among care providers) than those serving more integrated communities; (2) increased care fragmentation of
these networks operating at the hospital level is significantly associated with an increase in the probability of 90-
day HAIs and (3) the relationship between care fragmentation (a measure of network performance) and post-
discharge payments is significantly mediated by postoperative HAIs. Understanding the barriers and facilitators
for enhancing care delivery networks across phases of care delivery (pre-admission, index admission, post-
discharge) for the most commonly performed cardiac surgical operations would serve as the foundation for
targeted improvement strategies to address interhospital HAI variability. Community-based partnerships, that
help patients access community and health system resources as well as address healthcare inequities, would
serve as a novel focus for developing evidence-based, action-oriented HAI prevention recommendations. The
objective of this proposal is to identify areas of intervention within care delivery networks that enhance HAI
outcomes. This large-scale mixed methods proposal addresses the following aims: (1) Evaluate provider care
delivery networks as significant determinants of postoperative infections after cardiac surgery; (2) Develop a
comprehensive understanding of structural barriers and facilitators to optimal care delivery and (3) Develop a
best practices toolkit to address the impact of provider care delivery networks on infections after cardiac surgery."
10865101,"PROJECT SUMMARY. We have recently developed a label-free biological and chemical sensing system known
as a frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator (FLOWER) that integrates microtoroid optical
resonators with frequency locking feedback control, which aids the suppression of noise. FLOWER is currently
capable of highly sensitive and rapid (under 30 seconds) label-free detection down to the single macromolecule
level, as demonstrated by the detection of single human interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecules. To date, FLOWER has
achieved a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 using an anti-IL-2 antibody layer immobilized on a microtoroid to specifically
capture IL-2. In addition to its high sensitivity, FLOWER has an advantage over other nanoscale sensing
platforms such as cantilevers or nanowires in that it possesses a relatively large capture area, increasing the
probability of analyte detection.
 We propose (1) using FLOWER to target a large number of current biomedical problems which would
benefit from a rapid, sensitive, and accurate means to identify key microscopic, nanoscopic, or molecular
markers specific to the problem; (2) miniaturizing and multiplexing FLOWER and making it part of a self-
contained, compact portable device to quickly establish the prognosis of various conditions; and (3) further
increasing FLOWER’s sensitivity and selectivity, making it capable of detecting even smaller molecules with
societal interest such as insulin or more capable of detecting the small signal changes mentioned in (1). As such,
FLOWER may be used to understand the process of olfaction in synthetic optical noses or disease progression
in Alzheimer’s. FLOWER is a new method that has not been applied to these questions before and, with proof
of concept, has great potential to advance several fields.
 If successful, this project would allow for a robust, extremely sensitive, and portable device that could be
given to an EMT or a solider in order for them to rapidly detect diseases or viruses and bacteria in drinking water
or food. These devices could empower citizen scientists to monitor their drinking supply or breathing air.
Furthermore, these devices could be easily translatable to other labs, enabling robust assays for drug library
screening, cell signaling studies, and clinical assays. Eventually, we envision these devices to be prevalent in
drug stores throughout the country, creating a convenient, inexpensive, routine, accessible, and non-invasive
means to impact the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s, cancer, pain from multiple
sclerosis, diabetes, addiction, and depression."
10865102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human microbiome is an essential mediator of health and influences important metabolic functions through
production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These compounds have been shown to independently predict risk
for developing tuberculosis (TB) – a leading cause of death in South Africa. Antibiotics may profoundly impact
the microbiome yet the impact of treatment on the microbiome remains completely uncharacterized in patients
with rifampicin-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB; resistance to the two most effective
TB drugs). In response to the RR/MDR-TB epidemic, the South African National Programme rolled-out an all-
oral shorter course regimen (SCR) which is being investigated within the funded observational prospective cohort
study (SHIFT-TB; PI: Dr Graeme Meintjes) that this proposal (NASCENT; PI: Dr Charissa Naidoo) will leverage.
We hypothesize that the SCR, though comprising lifesaving antibiotics for TB, also contain others which could
plausibly affect the commensal microbiota (≤540 broad-spectrum antibiotic doses given over 9 months). Using
16S rRNA gene sequencing, we will longitudinally characterize the sputum and stool microbiota in 260 RR/MDR-
TB adults and adolescents (≥ 15 years) initiating the SCR at Nkqubela Hospital, Eastern Cape Province, South
Africa, at five intervals before, during, and after treatment. We will correlate the microbiota with important clinical
metadata measured in the parent study, including repeated pharmacokinetic (Pk) data and pre-defined clinical
outcomes. This work will lay the foundation for future trials where the microbiome is monitored as a diagnostic
tool for clinical outcomes or modulated (through dietary supplementation, host-directed therapies) to improve
long-term health (i.e., post-TB lung sequalae).
Specifically, Aim 1 will evaluate changes in the sputum and stool microbiota in patients receiving treatment for
RR/MDR-TB. Aim 2 will, using targeted as chromatography-mass spectrometry in stool, longitudinally quantify
microbially-produced SCFAs (butyrate, propionate, acetate) and correlate SCFAs with the microbiota in co-
occurrence network analyses. Aim 3 will evaluate longitudinal associations between the microbiota and drug Pk
(where we expect greater drug absorption to result in greater microbial shifts and loss of diversity), and whether
distinct microbiomes reflect favorable vs. unfavorable outcomes.
Together, the proposal will achieve the following: 1) promote an independently funded research career for the
candidate at Stellenbosch University (through structured mentorship with scientific experts), 2) strengthen South
African analytical capacity for microbiome research in a low-middle income country (LMIC) research priority (TB),
3) and enhance long term collaboration with leading US scientists."
10865105,"Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is a common systemic disorder characterized by progressive accumulation of
abnormal fibrillar protein aggregates and that is associated with glaucoma (XFG), pre-mature cataract
formation, and complications during cataract surgery as well as several systemic conditions. Our goal is to
elucidate the pathogenesis of exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and the associated glaucoma (XFG), which will
facilitate effective screening and prevention strategies and the development of novel therapies. Aggregated
LOXL1 is one component of the pathogenic fibrillar aggregates, and LOXL1 is a major genetic risk factor for
XFS/XFG, with LOXL1 risk variants occurring in up to 98% of patients. However, XFS/XFG is genetically
complex, and these same common risk variants are also present in many unaffected individuals, indicating that
additional genetic and/or environmental factors are necessary for disease development. During the previous
funding period we have made significant progress defining environmental exposures influencing XFS/XFG risk
including time spent outdoors, residential latitude, UV light exposure, heavy coffee consumption and low folate
intake. In collaboration with our international consortium, we have identified new genetic factors influencing risk
including protective LOXL1 variants. We have also completed a metabolomics study using pre-diagnostic
samples from the longitudinal Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS)
that identified 2 plasma metabolites classes (lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamine
plasmalogens), measured as much as a decade before disease onset, associated with increased XFS/XFG
risk, and the individual metabolite cortisone and the metabolite classes of steroids and triglycerides inversely
associated with risk. For the next funding period, we will build on these results using data from the NHS, NHS2
and HPFS, Mass Eye and Ear clinical case control set, and UK Biobank, to further define the complex set of
risk factors contributing to this important blinding disease. We propose the following specific aims: 1)
Investigate associations between steroids, lipid metabolites, environmental factors and XFS/XFG risk; 2)
Investigate the contributions of rare/low frequency LOXL1 variants to XFS/XFG risk and 3) Evaluate integrated
metabolomic and genomic effects on XFS/XFG risk. This unique study with comprehensive prospective
environmental, genetic and metabolomic data and a multi-disciplinary team (expertise in genetics,
metabolomics, epidemiology) will cost-efficiently address a significant cause of ocular morbidity. The findings
will be directly relevant for clinical and public health practice."

Obstetrician-gynecologists have an integral role to play in women’s reproductive health research. However, Ob-
Gyn investigators have historically been underrepresented in the field, leading to critical missed opportunities to
generate clinically-relevant research questions and to translate new findings into clinical practice. To address
this important gap, we propose to re-establish the Women’s Reproductive Health Research Career Development
Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Our aims are to catalyze early career development of
promising Ob-Gyn clinician investigators and to support collaborative, cutting edge research that advances the
field of women’s reproductive health. This program provides mentorship, structured career development
activities, and at least 75% protected research time for two Ob-Gyn scholars annually. Building upon prior WRHR
success (2005-2010), we have designed a program that addresses the needs of early career Ob-Gyn
researchers. First, our scholars are embedded in a vibrant research environment within our Department of Ob-
Gyn, which is supported by $14 million in annual research funding from NIH, other federal agencies, and
foundations. Our scholars will conduct mentored research within emphasis areas designated in the application,
at their intersection with women’s reproductive health. These include established research domains led by
program faculty and supported by multiple NIH awards (complications of pregnancy, mood disorders and
substance use, obesity and cardiometabolic disease, sexual and reproductive health). Opportunities to work in
emerging areas with individual, funded investigators will also be offered. Second, our scholars will be mentored
by experienced faculty. Mentorship committees are led by NIH-funded Ob-Gyn investigators and supported by
collaborating faculty from the UNC Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Nursing, and Social Work.
Third, we have developed a robust career development curriculum that leverages existing K12/KL2 resources
at UNC, while remaining distinct in its goals and purpose. This broader community of early career, research-
oriented faculty provides opportunities for networking, shared learning, and peer-to-peer mentorship, and
minimizes the risk of academic isolation. Fourth, our program has exceptional institutional support from the UNC
School of Medicine. This includes a commitment of significant cost-sharing to ensure competitive junior faculty
salaries, commensurate with specialty and subspecialty faculty in the department. Scholars will also have access
to additional institutional resources through university-wide centers and institutes. The overarching goal of the
UNC WRHR Program is to support promising early career Ob-Gyns during the often tenuous transition to
research independence. Through access to an unparalleled group of experienced faculty mentors and the
strength of its career development curriculum, our program will develop the next generation of independent NIH
investigators in women’s reproductive health."
10865131,"Project Summary
After myocardial infarction (MI), the ensuing inflammatory response spearheaded by neutrophils is essential for
removal of cellular debris and tissue repair; but if unregulated, it may confer more long-term harm than actual
benefit. We know elevated neutrophil count is a strong predictor of heart failure and death in MI patients, yet
strategies aimed at suppressing neutrophil function have not been successful in improving outcome. This is due
to the lack of knowledge of neutrophil function and its cross-talk with other pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling
components in the heart post-MI. We recently reported that the initial wave of infiltrating neutrophils amplify the
inflammatory response post-MI by deploying key damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as
S100A8/A9. Here, we provide promising findings to show that while S100A8/A9 participates in instigating
inflammation, they may also have a potential role in the resolution of inflammation. We performed global
transcriptomic analysis (RNA seq) of cardiac leukocytes obtained at day 3 post-MI, and found a robust
upregulation of class A scavenger receptors (SRs) such as Msr1 and Marco via MafB, and phagocytosis
receptors (Mertk, CD36 via Nr4a1) that are crucial for the clearance of DAMPs and dead cells, respectively. We
further show that S100A8/A9 could upregulate SRs and Mertk by engaging the toll-like-receptor (TLR4) on Ly6Chi
monocytes, the second-in-line cell type to infiltrate the infarcted heart. These novel findings support the premise
that neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 orchestrate the resolution of inflammation by engaging monocytes for
effective clearance of DAMPs, as well as facilitating the maturation of monocytes into macrophages to enhance
efferocytosis and final resolution of inflammation after MI. We will test this hypothesis using two specific aims: In
Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms underlying the interaction between S100A8/A9 and Ly6Chi monocytes for
the initial clearance of DAMPs. We will specifically focus on characterizing the time-dependent phenotypic and
transcriptomic changes in monocytes following their interaction with neutrophils or S100A8/A9 using mass
cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing. We will then decipher the role of the TLR4-MafB-SR
signalling cascade in the endocytic uptake of DAMPs including S100A8/A9 during the initial phase of
inflammation. In Aim 2, we will define the paracrine function of S100A8/A9 in orchestrating the transition of
Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes/ macrophages for the final clearance of dead cells and the resolution of inflammation.
Here, we will use lineage-tracing studies to map the conversion of Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes and study the role
of Nr4a1, and the impact of neutrophils or S100A8/A9 on such conversion. For each strategy, the clearance of
DAMPs, dead cells, cardiac remodeling and function will be studied as endpoints. The outcome of our studies
will yield new insights into the mechanisms by which neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 induce pro-resolving signals,
and also unravel novel targets to suppress inflammation associated with MI."

 Epigenetic regulation serves as a fundamental mechanism that bridges the genome with the
environment, and is a key determinant of longevity. C. elegans uses conserved modes of epigenetic regulation,
including histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, has a short normal lifespan and a vast toolkit for
molecular and genomic analyses, and represents a powerful model for unraveling the major principles of the
epigenetic basis of longevity. The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate how epigenetic regulation
bridges the genome and the environment to modulate aging. In this proposal, we build on original discoveries
made in our lab and will investigate the mechanistic connection between epigenetic regulation and longevity in
C. elegans using three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which SET-26, a
H3K4me3 reader, regulates DAF-16 transcriptional activity. We recently revealed that SET-26 binds to the
histone modification H3K4me3 (histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation) and requires DAF-16 to modulate stress
response and lifespan. In this aim, we will test whether recruitment to H3K4me3 sites in the genome is key for
SET-26 functions, and whether SET-26 collaborates with HCF-1 to regulate DAF-16 occupancy at target gene
promoters. Our study will illuminate how SET-26 links H3K4me3, a highly conserved histone modification, and
DAF-16, a highly conserved master transcription factor, in stress response and aging. In Aim 2, we will
elaborate the molecular characteristics and functional consequences of the unique patterns of histone
modification changes in aged C. elegans. Ongoing investigations in our lab have revealed interesting
patterns of histone modification changes in the somatic cells of aged C. elegans. Specifically, we observed a
combined pattern of low H3K36me3 and dynamic H3K4me3, two major histone marks associated with active
gene expression, to strongly correlate with RNA expression change with age. We will investigate whether this
unique pattern is tissue-specific, correlates with physiological aging, and reflects increased cryptic transcription
with age. We will also further characterize the observed gain of the repressive H3K27me3 and heterochromatin
H3K9me3 on particular chromosome arms with age. Our study will provide an invaluable resource for the
community and will point to the gene regulatory programs key to aging. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
epigenetic mechanisms of hormesis in aging. Hormesis in aging, where transient exposure to a mild stress
early in life can confer improved vitality later in life, is well known but much remains to be learnt about the
molecular basis of its long-lasting beneficial effects. We will compare two stress regiments that have been
demonstrated to increase stress resistance, improve proteostasis, and extend lifespan. We will investigate the
sustained transcriptional changes that confer the protective effects long after the initial stress exposure, and
the chromatin and transcription factors, and possible histone modifications, that regulate the transcriptional
memory."

Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in the regulation of anti-tumor immune responses. In both mice and
humans, DCs consist of distinct subsets with intrinsic differences that lead to functional specialization in the
generation of immunity. Compared to mice, little is known about the functional classification of human tissue-
resident DCs, and how subset distribution is altered in disease. My laboratory has published pioneering studies
on the identification and functional characterization of human DC subsets with respect to their control of cellular
and humoral immunity. This application focuses on our recent discovery of a new human DC subset that is
delineated by CD5 expression and that we discovered initially in human skin, blood and lymph nodes. CD5+ DCs
are present in both mice and humans. They efficiently polarize T cells into helper and cytotoxic responses, and
their number is reduced in melanoma affected compared to healthy tissue. Preliminary data using human DCs
and pre-clinical mouse models are provided to demonstrate that CD5 is a critical molecule on DCs that sustains
T cell activation and tumor rejection in vivo.
Although the survival of advanced melanoma patients has been extended by interventions that enhance T cell
activation, the response is limited to a minority of patients. Thus, we hypothesize that harnessing the CD5
costimulatory system on DCs will contribute towards the generation of a broad T cell response and
immunological memory that is required to completely eliminate melanoma cells. To address this
hypothesis, we will 1) harness novel murine models developed in our laboratory to define the requirement of
CD5 on either DCs or T cells in tumor immunity, anti-tumor vaccination and in shaping response to checkpoint
blockade therapy; 2) determine the molecular interactions underlying the activation and anti-tumor T responses
by CD5+ DCs; 3) determine whether the distribution and the function of the CD5+ DCs is restored in patients with
melanoma that respond to checkpoint blockade therapy.
These studies will advance our understanding of a novel mechanism by which dendritic cells function to target
cancer cells and will provide a rationale for harnessing CD5+ DC biology in a therapeutic setting."
10870109,"The human body is colonized by a complex microbial community with critical roles for health. This microbiota 
educates the immune system, helps digest our food, and protects us against pathogens. The diversity of 
microbes and encoded functions is significant. Our group showed that the gut microbiota is also a source of 
great chemical diversity, and that most of the compounds produced are unknown. Bacteria produce and 
respond to small molecules to communicate and adapt to their environment. Chemical signaling controls 
functions that are critical for host adaptation in most pathogens. Therefore, small-molecule signaling is an 
attractive target for the development of anti-infectives. Given the chemical complexity of the gut, microbiotapathogen 
crosstalk must be common. In fact, we previously showed that an organic extract of human feces 
elicits a significant transcriptional response in Salmonella enterica, with ~100 regulated genes. Interestingly, 
virulence genes were abundant among those repressed by the extract, suggesting that microbiota-derived 
metabolites can dampen virulence. We then determined that a single commensal, Enterocloster citroniae, 
can repress S. enterica virulence gene expression. More recently, we studied the transcriptional impact of 
the human fecal metabolome on other pathogens. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, the 
effect was even more pronounced, with ~900 genes being regulated. Motility was the main category of 
repressed genes, and the effect was confirmed by phenotypic assays. As with S. enterica, the effect could 
be recapitulated with E. citroniae. Given the importance of V. cholerae as a human pathogen and the critical 
role played by motility in its pathogenesis, it is our goal to determine the impact of microbiota-derived 
metabolites on V. cholerae pathogenicity. We will generate a collection of gut commensals with anti-motility 
properties to characterize the genetic and chemical nature of the bioactivity. Genomes and transcriptomes 
of active and inactive strains will be compared, giving insights into the synthetic apparatus involved. 
Bioactivity-guided purification will be performed, and compound characterization using mass spectrometry 
and nuclear magnetic resonance will ensue. Lastly, we will study the impact of active strains and compounds 
on host resistance to V. cholerae using infection models. Results from this work will shed light on the chemical 
biology of microbiota-pathogen interactions and may reveal strains and compounds with potential therapeutic 
applications."

the cellular composition of multi-synaptic circuits. As a consequence, this technique is providing fundamental
new insights into the functional architecture of sensory, motor, cognitive and affective circuits in the central
nervous system. The Center for Neuroanatomy with Neurotropic Viruses (CNNV) was created in 2004 to
provide the neuroscience community with access to the highly specialized reagents, training and facilities that
are necessary to use neurotropic viruses as transneuronal tracers.
We document in this application that the CNNV has become an essential national and international resource for
an important segment of the neuroscience community. Users of the Center are funded by 15 different institutes
of the NIH, by NSF and by private foundations and international research organizations. The Center has
established a strong history of providing well-characterized reagents, training and guidance in the use of the
method, and specialized biohazard facilities for performing experiments using neurotropic viruses. The Center
has served as an essential technical and intellectual resource for those interested in using this novel method.
The goal of the Resource Component of this competitive renewal is to continue these essential functions of the

10848235,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with
a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the
underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of
HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially
reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each
individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be
necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies
characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical
gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of
the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need
in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training
to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor
MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber
orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are
fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a
clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that
overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo
DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis
is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve
as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending
previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The
proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology
and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling
of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy."

provides evidence that likewise to TS; chronic e-Cigarette (e-Cig) vaping can promote loss of BBB integrity
and vascular inflammation as well as act as a risk factor for the onset of stroke and worsening of post-
ischemic brain injury. In addition, recent reports have shown that metformin (MF) treatment before and after
ischemic injury reduce stress and inhibit inflammatory responses. Preliminary data provided in this grant
suggests that MF promotes Nrf2-mediated counteractive mechanisms which drastically reduce TS toxicity
at the brain and cerebrovascular levels while protecting BBB integrity. We provide additional in vivo
evidence showing that MF can effectively reduce the oxidative and inflammatory risk for stroke and
attenuate post-ischemic brain injury promoted by TS and e-Cig vaping. We propose that MF could be
repurposed to prevent/reduce BBB damage and subsequent stroke injury by TS and e-Cig exposure in
chronic smokers/vapors. Thus, the objectives of our study are:
 1) Assess and validate the brain microvascular molecular mechanisms by which MF can protect the
BBB from TS/e-Cig including ischemic/reperfusion (IR) injury. We will unravel the molecular target through
which MF can positively impact the BBB and reduce the burden of ischemic stroke and cerebrovascular
impairments in chronic smokers and vapors.
 2) Evaluate in vivo the effect of prophylactic versus therapeutic (post-ischemic) administration of
metformin in reducing TS/e-Cig - promoted cerebrovascular impairment and/or post-ischemic neuronal
damage. In vivo investigations will define a mechanism of BBB transport and CNS entry for MF along with
major ischemic injury endpoints; including infarction and edema volume, histological endpoints and
behavioral recovery after stroke. Ultimately, we will characterize MF's efficacy and therapeutic time window
for stroke treatment in mice exposed to TS or e-Cig vapor."

The typhoidal Salmonellas (TS), primarily Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A, are a major cause of global
morbidity and mortality, particularly in Asia where widespread antimicrobial resistance is an increasing concern.
The Indo-Pacific is endemic for TS and vulnerable to these infections due to suboptimal surveillance networks,
insufficient sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, and lack of support for interventions to reduce TS burden
(vaccine only targets S. Typhi, is not widely accessible, and indirect protection may be modest). This region is
at increased risk for TS due to disproportionate susceptibility to hydrologic events (drought, flooding)
associated with climate change. Predicting TS transmission and evaluating interventions to reduce TS risk in
the setting of a changing climate is critical. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) improvements decrease TS
burden through reduced fecal contamination of the environment. However, trials of WASH interventions often
target the household-level (e.g., behavioral interventions, kitchen water filters) and are limited in reproducibility
and generalizability, frequently using non-specific surrogate markers of human health. Revitalizing Informal
Settlements and their Environments (RISE) is a cluster-randomized controlled trial of community-level WASH
infrastructure upgrades currently underway in 24 informal urban settlements in Indonesia and Fiji, two
countries with high TS risk. RISE provides an ideal opportunity to study targeted solutions to reduce TS burden
and evaluate their impact. Utilizing RISE-collected samples, the research detailed in this proposal uses: Aim 1)
novel serosurveillance techniques to estimate “seroincidence” as a surrogate for TS incidence and Aim 2)
genomic methods to identify TS in human and environmental microbiomes. To inform improved future
interventions under different scenarios, these data will be used to: Aim 3) establish compartmental modeling
approaches to predict and assess the impact of WASH interventions on TS transmission and ultimately
disease reduction. The candidate is an infectious diseases fellow with a background in molecular biology,
genomics, computational biology, and global health research. The candidate’s primary career goal is to be an
independent NIH-funded physician-scientist committed to developing, assessing, and implementing
interventions aimed at controlling TS and other infectious diseases that disproportionately impact populations
in resource-constrained settings. To achieve independence, the candidate requires targeted mentoring and
additional training in: 1) laboratory methods and field research management, 2) advanced bioinformatics
analysis and infectious diseases modeling, and 3) research communication and impact. The proposed
research and training plans will be supervised by primary mentor Dr. Stephen Luby, a global health clinical
research expert and PI of RISE. Dr. Jason Andrews (seroepidemiology, modeling) will serve as co-mentor,
providing additional focused expertise. The candidate will also meet quarterly with advisors Dr. Richelle
Charles (laboratory methods, seroepidemiology) and Dr. Ami Bhatt (genomics, bioinformatics)."
10863453,"Project Abstract
Aphasia is an acquired neurologic language disorder that is among the most challenging long-term disabilities
for stroke survivors, often leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life. Recovery from aphasia relies
on plasticity in residual brain networks. However, neuroplasticity varies substantially across individuals, making
the presence, severity, and phenotype of language impairments challenging to predict. A vital step toward
post-stroke precision medicine is identifying neuroplasticity-related biological markers that can improve
prognostic models and targeted neurorehabilitation therapies for people with aphasia. The proposed research
will test the central hypothesis that individual differences in neuroplasticity, measured through genetic
polymorphisms and longitudinal neuroimaging connectivity biomarkers, will account for significant variance in
post-stroke aphasia recovery. This 5-year project will include three specific aims. Aim 1 is to index
spontaneous recovery by determining relationships between genetic biomarkers of plasticity, longitudinal
neural network connectivity, and changes in language during sub-acute to chronic stroke recovery. Aim 2 is to
identify genetic and MRI biomarkers predictive of chronic post-stroke aphasia severity and phenotypes. Aim 3
is to characterize genetic and MRI biomarkers associated with verbal learning variability in chronic aphasia.
These data will support the development of a larger, multi-site R01 study to examine interactions between
multiple biomarkers of neuroplasticity that inform longitudinal aphasia prognostics and treatment efficacy.
This career development proposal is designed to provide Haley C. Dresang, Ph.D., a clinical neuroscientist
and aphasiologist, with the training required for success as an independent patient-oriented scientist
conducting neurotranslational aphasia research. As a junior faculty member at the University of Wisconsin–
Madison, Dr. Dresang is in an ideal environment with extensive infrastructure to support early-stage
investigator training and research. The proposed career development plan includes both coursework and
mentored training in the areas of 1) MRI neuroplasticity biomarkers, 2) genetic polymorphisms associated with
neuroplasticity, 3) longitudinal clinical trials design and analysis, and 4) professional skills for an independent
translational neuroscientist. To ensure success, she has identified committed, expert mentors in these
disciplines and secured protected time for this work. This award addresses a significant clinical dilemma and
serious gap in neurobiologically motivated aphasia research, while affording the education and mentored
research experience critical for Dr. Dresang to lead an independent aphasia research program."

There are two main objectives for this 5-year career development plan: 1) define the role and mechanistic basis
of skeletal muscle actin mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 2) transition the principal investigator
(PI) to independence through professional and scientific mentorship. Despite current therapies, many patients
with DCM progress to end stage heart failure possibly due to a lack of treating changes in contractility which
needs further exploration. The basis of all contraction in cardiac and skeletal muscles is myosin pulling on actin
filaments. Skeletal muscle actin is the minor actin isoform in the heart, and it has never been mechanistically
explored in DCM. In this proposal, the PI establishes a multiscale experimental platform that utilizes biochemical,
biophysical, and in vivo methods to robustly study the effects of the skeletal muscle actin mutation R256H on
heart and skeletal muscle. The PI previously found that R256H exceptionally associates with DCM without
skeletal myopathy unlike all other skeletal muscle actin mutations. His preliminary data demonstrates that R256H
has a dominant negative effect on contractility only in the presence of the actin-binding proteins troponin and
tropomyosin which is a novel mechanism that was discovered using a new technique of recombinant actin
purification created by the PI. He also establishes that R256H causes hypcontractility in human cardiomyocytes
and mouse hearts. He hypothesizes that R256H causes DCM without skeletal myopathy due to tissue-specific
expression of different isoforms of troponin and tropomyosin. This hypothesis will be tested by elucidating the
biochemical and structural effects of R256H in the context of cardiac and skeletal muscle troponin and
tropomyosin (Aim 1), defining the effects of R256H on cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and engineered tissues
(Aim 2), and analyzing the effects of R256H on cardiac and skeletal muscles of mice (Aim 3). Completing these
aims will establish the role of skeletal muscle actin mutations in DCM for the first time and create a multiscale
platform to study additional skeletal muscle actin mutations in cardiomyopathy for the PI’s first R01. Moreover,
with guidance of a formal mentoring committee, the PI will complete a curriculum that will build his biochemistry
and biophysics knowledge and techniques, teach him cryoEM structural analysis to connect structure to function,
and expand his understanding of cardiac and skeletal muscle disease modeling in animals. Finally, he will
improve his professional, logistical, and educational skills to fully transition to an independent investigator and
productive member of the scientific community capable of training future physician-scientists."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and other brain functions.
Modern large-scale high-throughput multi-omics data may provide a unique opportunity to detect omics biomark-
ers that are involved in the process of neurodegeneration in the preclinical and early clinical disease stages,
which is highly relevant for both early diagnosis and targeted interventions. Hidden confounding bias is a major
threat when using observational multi-omics data for detecting causal omics biomarkers for AD. Mendelian ran-
domization is a powerful causal inference approach to removing hidden confounding bias by leveraging omics
quantitative trait loci (xQTL) as instrumental variables (IV) to obtain unconfounded causal effect estimates. How-
ever, current MR methods may not be well suited for analyzing high-dimensional multi-omics data. First, xQTL
may have a horizontal pleiotropic effect on the outcome not mediated by the omics variables, violating the IV
exclusion restriction assumption. Second, the genetic associations between xQTL and omics variables might be
highly nonlinear and thus traditional linear exposure models might introduce bias and lose power; and there is a
lack of MR methods to account for the heterogeneity of AD etiology for personalized intervention. Third, current
MR methods may not handle high-dimensional omic exposures well. To address those pressing methodological
challenges, we will develop a new robust Mendelian randomization framework with multi-omics data using xQTL
as IVs to detect omics biomarkers causally associated with AD outcomes. We will construct uniformly valid and
informative conﬁdence intervals for the causal effect accounting for weak and IV selection errors in ﬁnite-sample
settings. We will develop machine learning algorithms to capture nonlinear structures of the omic exposure model
for more robust identiﬁcation and enhanced xQTL IV strength, and to estimate heterogeneous exposure effects
on the AD outcomes for personalized medicine. We will also develop a new double deconfounding framework for
the joint analysis of high-dimensional omics biomarkers in a common biological pathway. We will develop software
suitable for both high-performance computing clusters and cloud computing platforms following the Findability, Ac-
cessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability principle. Finally, we will apply the proposed methods to multi-omics
data in multi-ethnic cohorts including Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project, the Alzheimer's Dis-
ease Sequencing Project Functional Genomics xQTL project and UK Biobank. Our proposal will provide the best
available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns for multi-omics data, and will pave the way
towards innovative research on establishing causal relationships between omics biomarkers and AD outcomes."
10857945,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma represents the most common primary malignant brain tumor with a median survival of less than
2 years. Despite extensive molecular characterization, precision oncology has had little penetration in clinical
neuro-oncology, suggesting that novel therapies are needed. Many cancers, including glioblastoma, display
accelerated protein synthesis associated with upregulation of major oncogenic pathways, including
RTK/RAS, PI3K/AKT, MYC and β-catenin/WNT. In preliminary studies, we find that increased translation is
heterogeneously distributed between tumor cells. Translation is regulated by post-transcriptional
modifications of transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The human genome encodes ~500 tRNAs that recognize 61 codons
for 20 amino acids, on which more than 100 types of tRNA modifications have been identified. Dysregulation
of tRNA modifications is prevalent in cancer and often leads to altered tRNA abundance or function, resulting
in global or codon-biased translational reprogramming. We performed a CRISPR screen of tRNA regulators
to reveal critical dependencies in glioblastoma. Preliminary results suggest that tRNA regulators that integrate
metabolites may be critical to glioblastoma growth.
Dietary restrictions have been proposed as oncologic interventions. For example, high levels of methionine
are required for the growth of many cancers, and dietary methionine restriction enhances cancer treatment
through one-carbon metabolic remodeling. To date, dietary interventions for glioblastoma treatment have not
been successful, of which the most studied approach is the ketogenic diet, based on the hypothesis that
glioblastoma cells cannot utilize ketones efficiently and must rely on glucose as primary energy source.
However, response rates have varied in different trials, limiting effective clinical translation. We recently found
that dietary lysine restriction inhibits tumor growth through epigenetic remodeling of endogenous immune
responses in preclinical studies. Here, we propose to interrogate metabolic rewiring and the cellular response
to microenvironmental nutrients to regulate cellular translation in glioblastoma to inform the development of
effective dietary intervention strategies."
10858313,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sensing viral infections in epithelial cells plays a crucial role in the frontline defense against enteric viral
infections. The RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) act as critical sensors for RNA viral infections by inducing interferon
signaling. While there has been extensive research on the cell intrinsic regulation of the RLR sensing pathway
and viral evasion, the role of neighboring bystander cells in robust interferon (IFN) responses from the RLR
sensing pathway remains understudied.
 This research proposal aims to utilize a murine norovirus (MNoV) infection model in mice to demonstrate
a key immune evasion strategy for the global suppression of the RLR sensing pathway. Preliminary results from
this study propose a novel concept of intestinal epithelial sensing of viral infection and evasion of viral RNA
sensing, highlighting the importance of non-tuft bystander enterocytes for IFN-λ responses as well as the viral
counteraction through the utilization of a cellular receptor for the secreted viral protein NS1 to suppress the RIG-
I/MDA5 pathway.
 We identified Syndecan-4 as a putative cellular receptor for the virokine NS1. The central hypothesis of
this research proposal is that the secreted virokine NS1 achieves tissue-wide suppression of the antiviral RIG-
I/MDA5 sensing pathway through direct binding to the cellular receptor SDC4 on the epithelial cell surface. The
proposal aims to explore how NS1 mediates the suppression of RIG-I/MDA5-IFN-λ immunity and the
physiological relevance of this host-virus interaction."
10858392,"This proposal aims to explore the metabolic advantages and mechanisms of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists (GLP-1Ra) in individuals with stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1DM) undergoing treatment with teplizumab,
an immunomodulatory therapy. Stage 2 T1DM represents a critical juncture where interventions could
potentially slow β-cell decline, delay the need for exogenous insulin therapy, and improve long-term outcomes.
Our study seeks to address current knowledge gaps concerning the role of GLP-1Ra in modifying the disease
progression of T1DM. We are particularly interested in understanding how the insulinotropic and
glucagonostatic effects of GLP-1Ra can rectify metabolic derangements during this early stage in T1DM.
Our study's significance lies in challenging the current treatment paradigm, primarily centered on
immunomodulation, by proposing an innovative combination of GLP-1Ra and teplizumab in stage 2 T1DM. The
capacity of GLP-1Ra to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppress glucagon release could
present beneficial metabolic outcomes for T1DM patients, especially when combined with teplizumab.
Addressing the current knowledge gaps about this combined therapy could pave the way for the development
of more effective and personalized treatment strategies.
Our proposal introduces several novel elements in the treatment of early-stage T1DM and the understanding of
disease mechanisms. The research explores a new use of GLP-1Ra in early-stage T1DM, repurposing a
treatment initially developed for T2DM. By investigating the potential benefits of combining these therapies in a
population where their combined effects have not been fully explored, our study contributes to shifting the
prevailing paradigm of early-stage T1DM treatment.
To achieve our objectives, we have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic
crossover study. We will quantify postprandial hyperglycemia, disposition index, and nitric-oxide mediated
endothelial function during mixed meal tolerance test studies. We will recruit volunteers from Vanderbilt's Type
1 Diabetes Immunotherapy Clinic. The goals of this study will yield novel insights into GLP-1Ra’s insulinotropic
and glucagonostatic effects and their individual contributions to improving metabolism outcomes in stage 2
T1DM patients.
As a pilot and feasibility study, this research will provide key information and experience for the design of a
future, fully-powered study. This includes refining the recruitment process, optimizing the study design, and
generating preliminary data to inform the full-study’s data analysis plan. Our findings will help address the Dual
Derangements of diminishing insulin secretion and detrimental hyperglucagonemia present in stage 2 T1DM,
guiding the development of more effective, personalized treatment strategies. Thus, our research will lay the
groundwork for future therapies and significantly contribute to the broader field of T1DM management."

SWOG is an adult clinical trials cancer group within the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) of the National
Cancer Institute (NCI). SWOG clinical trials include a range of cancer types (e.g., breast, lung, colon, prostate,
leukemia, melanoma, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). The SWOG Biospecimen Bank (Biobank), located in
the Biopathology Center (part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute of Nationwide Children's Hospital), was
designed to procure, process, bank, and distribute biospecimens collected as a major component of NCI-
sponsored clinical trials. These biospecimens are linked to demographic information, surgical and pathological
reports, and treatment and follow-up data of study participants enrolled on SWOG protocols. Upon review and
approval, biospecimens are prioritized for distribution to the specific SWOG investigators defined in the clinical
trial protocols. After the needs of the planned research have been addressed, residual (legacy) banked
biospecimens can be distributed to other investigators within and outside SWOG via the NCTN Navigator. The
SWOG Group and Biobank Concierges can also facilitate access to SWOG legacy biospecimens that are not
currently uploaded in Navigator. This process has been designed to mirror the process for legacy
biospecimens on the Navigator system and includes a feasibility assessment by the SWOG Biobank and the
SWOG Statistical and Data Management Center prior to proposal submission. The Biobank is a functioning
and viable part of SWOG's clinical and translational medicine program, and focuses on the integration of
diagnostic, therapeutic, laboratory, and clinical data to answer questions in clinical and translational research.
The SWOG Biobank works under the hypothesis that banking of high quality, clinically-annotated and cancer-
related human biospecimens, linked to molecular signatures/markers, will significantly facilitate and further
advance clinical cancer research. To support this effort, the SWOG Biobank manages these biospecimens
under strict guidelines and standard operating procedures based on current Best Practices for biorepositories
and the latest laboratory technologies. The Biobank's experience, coupled with a firm commitment to quality
and integrity operations, makes it uniquely able to provide an accurate and effective resource of tumor and
normal samples with associated clinical, epidemiologic, and protected health information. The SWOG Biobank
aims to harmonize and expand general banking practices and innovative technologies, which will continue to
facilitate molecular biology research and increase investigator participation in clinical research trials via the
NCI-sponsored Group Banking Committee (GBC). The SWOG Biobank also plans to support the processing,
banking, and distribution of biospecimens to the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs)."
10862824,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Generating separate intracellular pools of cAMP allows various G protein-coupled receptors to elicit distinct
functional responses in a same cell. For instance, while stimulation of either β-adrenergic receptors or E-type
prostaglandin receptors leads to cAMP production, only β-adrenergic receptors regulate cardiac myocyte
contractility. Dysregulation of cAMP compartmentalization has been linked to several cardiovascular diseases,
including cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophy, and heart failure. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible
for creating compartmentalized cAMP are not completely understood. Most previous studies have focused on
activities of phosphodiesterases, the enzymes that breakdown cAMP, to explain cAMP compartmentation.
However, several mathematical studies have predicted that PDE activity alone is not sufficient. These studies
have suggested that the mobility of cAMP must be slower than free diffusion to prevent cAMP from reaching
non-specific target proteins. We have recently demonstrated that the intracellular mobility of cAMP is markedly
hampered by buffering mediated by mitochondria-associated protein kinase A. Now, a new computational study
has predicted that, in addition to slow diffusion, physical barriers imposed by anatomically restricted spaces
within a cell are key to hindering cAMP movement. In cardiac myocytes, mitochondria occupy 30% of the cell
volume, and form constrained spaces through interactions with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal
proteins. The overall aim of this proposal is to explore the concept that the tight spaces associated with
mitochondria regulate cAMP compartmentation. Glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75) and muscle LIM protein
(MLP) have been shown to regulate the compact arrangement of mitochondria between the surrounding SR and
myofibrils. Moreover, previous studies have shown a marked widening of the space between mitochondria and
the neighboring structures in failing ventricular myocytes. In the FIRST AIM of this study, we will test the
hypothesis that GRP75-induced tightening of the space between mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum
hinder cAMP movement and contribute to cAMP compartmentation. In the SECOND AIM, we will determine if
MLP-mediated intracellular arrangement of mitochondria regulates cAMP compartmentation. In the THIRD AIM,
we will test the hypothesis that the compromised compartmentation of cAMP signaling is due the removal of
obstruction as a result of the widening of the gap between mitochondria and adjacent organelles in failing
myocytes. To accomplish these aims, we will adopt multipronged and complementary approaches to study cAMP
compartmentation. Using a variety of advanced techniques, we will measure changes to cAMP mobility, receptor-
mediated compartmentalized cAMP responses within specific intracellular locations, Ca2+ channel currents,
intracellular Ca2+ transients, and cell shortening. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the fundamental
mechanisms responsible for facilitating cAMP compartmentation. We believe that this approach will ultimately
lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome the burden of cardiac diseases in humans."
10863005,"SUMMARY, Project 4
Alphaviruses regularly threaten global health, including long-established emerging viruses like Venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, the most important of the encephalitic alphaviruses) and chikungunya virus
(CHIKV, the most important arthritogenic alphaviruses) that unexpectedly emerged and spread globally.
Moreover, other alphaviruses also threaten to emerge into urban epidemic cycles and spread extensively. To
control these outbreaks and prepare for future alphavirus pandemics, we developed a new vaccine platform that
uses the insect-specific, vertebrate cell replication-incompetent alphavirus, Eilat virus (EILV), as a genetic
backbone for chimeras containing the structural polyprotein of target alphaviruses. CHIKV, VEEV, and eastern
equine encephalitis virus chimeras are thermostable and provide rapid, durable, single-dose protection,
advancing our goal of bridging the tradeoff between safety and rapid protection. A single dose of EILV-
CHIKV induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against CHIKV challenge one year after
administration in non-human primates (NHPs). Here, in Project 4, we will extend these promising findings to
demonstrate that the EILV platform can be applied rapidly and predictably to diverse alphaviruses to quickly
generate safe and effective vaccines for future outbreak control. First, we will optimize the production protocols,
doses, and routes of vaccination for EILV-VEEV. We will perform detailed assessments of EILV-VEEV
immunogenicity in mice by measuring serum IgG binding and neutralization titers, and specific T cell responses.
We will also test the ability of EILV-based vaccines to prime germinal center (GC) B cell, T follicular helper cell
(Tfh), long-lived plasma cell (LLPCs), and memory B cell (MBC) responses. To identify early predictors of
immune durability, we will measure longitudinal serum neutralizing antibody titers as well as the induction,
magnitude, and specificity of antigen-specific MBC and GC B cells, recovered via fine needle aspirate of lymph
nodes at early and late time points post-vaccination. To demonstrate an efficient, rapid workflow leading to a
completely new, safe and immunogenic EILV-based vaccine for future outbreak control, we will develop a new
chimeric EILV-based vaccine for western equine encephalitis virus vaccine, which is in a different antigenic
alphavirus complex from CHIKV and VEEV. Finally, we will evaluate optimized EILV-based vaccines as a
platform for cross-protection against diverse alphaviruses by developing blended formulations and prime-
boost regimens. Lead multivalent (blended) candidates identified with mouse experiments with pan-alphavirus
potential will be advanced to NHP efficacy testing with Core D, and a lead nanoparticle or mRNA vaccine
candidate developed in Project 3 will be tested with the lead EILV-based vaccines in heterologous prime-boost
regimens. By the end of this project, a rapid, safe, refrigerator-stable, and highly efficacious, single-dose
vaccine platform will generate vaccines poised for final preclinical testing and a modular approach to address
future alphavirus threats."

Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are insect-transmitted RNA viruses that globally cause severe
human syndromes, including acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease, hemorrhagic fever,
hepatitis, and encephalitis. Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are pathogens with pandemic potential
because of the geographical expansion of their vectors, urbanization and population density
increases, and their capacity for epidemic transmission. In Project 5 of the Flavivirus and
Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE) Center, we propose to use multiple orthogonal antibody
discovery approaches to generate and validate best-in-class human monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) against prototype flaviviruses (West Nile virus [WNV] and dengue virus [DENV]) and
alphaviruses (chikungunya virus [CHIKV]). Using these mAbs, we aim to determine the principles
that govern the design of optimal mAb combinations to elicit synergistic responses and create
barriers to genetic resistance in vitro and in vivo. In collaboration with the Structure,
Computational, and Protein Engineering Core C, we also will develop novel computational
methods to improve upon mAb neutralization potency and breadth. We will refine a high-efficiency
screening platform to rapidly discover human mAbs against prototype flaviviruses and
alphaviruses that then can be genetically modified to endow extended half-life properties,
enabling them as vaccine-like treatment options. Identification of key protective and neutralizing
epitopes of mAbs (with Core C) also can inform immunogen design in Projects 1-3 through
reverse vaccinology approaches. In Aim 1, we will perform structural and function synergy studies
to determine the principles governing the selection of optimal mAb combination therapies against
the alphavirus, CHIKV. In Aim 2, we will use innovative computational approaches (with Core C)
to functionally mature the paratope-epitope interactions of human mAbs against DENV to
enhance potency and breadth. In Aim 3, we will perform a new discovery screening campaign to
identify potently neutralizing anti-WNV mAbs that can be partnered with a computationally
modified version of WNV-86 to enhance inhibitory potency and prevent neutralization escape. In
Aim 4, as a proof-of-concept, we will demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our workflow
by performing a ‘sprint’ to rapidly identify an optimal combination therapy of potently neutralizing
mAbs against Mayaro virus, an emerging alphavirus with pandemic potential. Overall,
experiments in Project 5 will refine our understanding of the correlates of mAb protection against
flaviviruses and alphaviruses to enable the design of a modular ‘
plug-and-play’ workflow
that can
respond to potential pandemics by rapidly generating optimized combinations of mAbs."

 Hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers are a group of rapidly fatal malignancies with poorly understood
etiology and biology. These cancers are often diagnosed at a late stage, after the primary tumor has spread to
adjacent or distant organs, precluding curative therapy. Africans have higher incidences of these cancers than
Americans, Asians, or Europeans. Africans are also more likely to be diagnosed with these cancers at younger
ages and have a higher mortality from these cancers than many other racial/ethnic groups worldwide.
Significant limitations to the advancement of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer research in Africa are limited
continuous training in emerging research among clinicians and scientists, limited diagnostic capabilities, and
the modest resources allocated to the liver, biliary and pancreatic cancer research despite the growing public
health burden attributable to these cancers. To address the increasing problem of higher incidence and
mortality of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers in Africa, there is a pressing need to (1) identify and empower
emerging cancer researchers and clinicians with the most current knowledge and research skills in the field to
contribute meaningfully to understanding the etiology and prognostic factors associated with these cancers,
and (2) help develop sustainable, practical actions for early diagnosis and to reduce the incidence and
mortality of these cancers in Africa. There an urgent need to harness our collective expertise and resources in
the United States with African investigators to advance the science of hepatopancreatobiliary cancers in Africa.
 This proposal will organize a series of workshops on scientific research in hepatobiliary and pancreatic
cancers led by experts in the field. The workshops will comprise of knowledge delivering lectures on the
pathobiology of these cancers, design appropriate research experiments specific to hepatobiliary and
pancreatic cancers, manuscript writing workshops, designing joint research projects among investigators in
African and the United States, project management training for research coordinators, and training in new
laboratory techniques/technology.
 At the conclusion of the three-year R13 grant, we will have enhanced the expertise in Africa and the
United States to address the perennially high mortality rates of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. Through
this project, we will develop a vibrant and collaborative group of investigators in Africa, equipped with the skills
to meaningfully contribute to advancing the science of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. The expected
deliverable also includes joint publications and joint grant applications among African and American
investigators to augment the research collaboration that will be achieved under this R13 application. The
results of our research collaborations will improve the understanding of the etiological factors, biology, and
outcomes of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers in African and African-descent populations in the United

10862825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Young adults (ages 18-24) have the highest and fastest growing rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors,
but the lowest rates of mental health care. Attitudinal barriers, such as a low perceived need for treatment, time
constraints, and preferences for self-management, are the primary reasons for low rates of mental health
treatment among this age group. Despite low utilization of traditional mental health care, young adults are
interested in using self-directed digital technologies to help manage their mental health symptoms. Digital
suicide prevention interventions represent a key opportunity to overcome many of the major attitudinal barriers
young adults face when seeking suicide-specific care. They can be short, private, and provide on-demand
preventive care in the context of an individual’s everyday life.
 My career goal is to become a leading clinical scientist with an independent research program focused on
designing and evaluating technology-enabled suicide prevention interventions that increase access to suicide
prevention care. This proposal builds on my experience in depression intervention and suicide assessment
research. It includes training and research activities that will enable me to develop: (1) expertise in formative
and summative user centered design methods and scalable intervention designs, (2) expertise in suicide
prevention interventions for adults, (3) expertise in efficient trial designs for digital mental health interventions,
and (4) aptitude in implementation science research methods. In partnership with Mental Health America, the
nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization, and individuals with lived experience of suicidal thoughts
and behaviors, I will design an automated text message-based safety-planning intervention for young adults.
My proposed intervention will operate by targeting suicide-related coping via a highly used communication
pathway.
 To design this intervention, I will pursue the following specific aims: (1) conduct user centered design
research activities, including elicitation workshops, design surveys, and usability testing to develop and refine
the text message-based safety planning intervention. I will also produce an implementation plan to ensure that
the developed safety planning intervention is sustainable and scalable within Mental Health America’s
organizational infrastructure. (2) I will conduct a feasibility randomized controlled trial of my text message-
based safety planning intervention among 60 young adults with current suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Results from this study will provide the data necessary for an R01 that tests the efficacy of the text message-
based safety planning intervention in online community settings. The training achieved through this award will
allow me to develop the necessary specialized knowledge that will launch my career as an independent
investigator of technology-enabled suicide prevention interventions for adults."
10862848,"Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular diseases and a leading cause of death worldwide.
Diabetes prevalence is on the rise globally, with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as the main cause of mortality
among diabetic patients. Minimizing the risk of CVD is a critical clinical goal in the management of diabetic
patients. In turn, hyperglicemia induces a large number of alterations in the vascular tissue at the cellular level
that accelerate the atherosclerotic process. In fact, prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia is recognized as a
major factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis associated with diabetes. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction
is a hallmark and initial step of atherosclerosis and is aggravated in diabetes. Nonetheless, there is a paucity in
available treatments to target atherosclerosis associated with diabetes. Transcription factor-EB (TFEB), a
crucial regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, has beneficial effects in various diseases. Our
systematic studies to address TFEB function in ECs uncovered that TFEB promotes autophagy and inhibits
oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro. In models of CVD, we demonstrated that in EC-specific TFEB
transgene promotes post-ischemic angiogenesis and plays an atheroprotective role in laminar flow. TFEB
inhibits endothelial inflammation resulting in reduced atherosclerosis in vivo. We recently reported that EC-
TFEB regulates plasma glucose. Our preliminary studies indicate that GPNMB may be a novel transcriptional
target of TFEB mediating its downstream effects. Collectively, these data suggest that TFEB activation might
contribute to ameliorate atherosclerosis in association with diabetes concurrently. Conjugated linoleic acid
(CLA) is the preferential substrate for fatty acid nitration in humans. Gastric CLA nitration upon oral delivery of
CLA and inorganic nitrite (NO2) renders NO2-CLA in the nanomolar range in humans and mice, making it an
attractive intervention for CVD. Our preliminary data reveal that NO2-CLA regulates autophagy in a TFEB-
dependent manner and enhances TFEB transcriptional activity in ECs. Based on these evidences, we will test
the central hypothesis that direct activation of endothelial TFEB by NO2-CLA protects against atherosclerosis
associated with diabetes through GPNMB. Through gain- and loss-of-function strategies in vitro and in vivo,
using unique animal models generated specifically for these studies and NO2-CLA treatment, we will address
two comprehensive specific aims. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that NO2-CLA enhances TFEB-dependent
protective effects in vitro via GPNMB and focus on the underlying mechanism, while showing the critical role of
TFEB Cys212, a potential direct S-nitroalkylation site in TFEB. In Aim 2, we will establish that NO2-CLA inhibits
atherosclerosis through TFEB and GPNMB in a diabetogenic atherosclerosis model in vivo. By establishing
oral delivery of NO2-CLA as a feasible new therapeutic strategy operating through TFEB and GPNMB, this
study will likely accelerate translation of these findings into preclinical trials for the treatment of atherosclerosis
in diabetic patients, contributing to change current clinical paradigms for the treatment of metabolic diseases."
10862850,"Metastasis to distant organs is the major cause of breast cancer-related death. Bone is the most frequent
destination of metastasis. Over 45% first-site metastases occur to bone, as compared to 19% to lung, 5% to liver
and 2% to brain. Patients with skeleton as the first site of metastasis usually have better prognosis than those
with visceral organs as first site. However, in more than two third of cases, bone metastases will not be confined
to the skeleton, but rather subsequently occur to other organs and eventually kill patients. This raises the
possibility of secondary metastatic dissemination from the initial bone lesions to other sites. In fact, some
metastases first found in non-bone organs may be seeded from subclinical bone micrometastases as well, as
suggested by the finding that cancer cells arrived in the bone can acquire more aggressive phenotypes even
before establishing overt metastases. Recent genomic analyses indeed concluded that the majority of
metastases result from seeding from other metastases, rather than primary tumors. Thus, it is of imperative
importance to investigate further metastatic seeding from bone lesions, as it might lead to prevention of the
terminal stage, multi-organ metastases that ultimately cause the vast majority of deaths. Despite the potential
relevance, we know very little about metastasis-to-metastasis seeding. Current pre-clinical models focus on
seeding from primary tumors, but cannot distinguish further dissemination. Taking advantage of a recently
developed approach that selectively deliver cancer cells to hind limb bones, we have uncovered frequent
metastatic seeding from established bone lesions to multiple other organs. This seeding is hypothetically enabled
by the bone microenvironment-induced effects that confer more stem-like properties through a combination of
clonal selection and epigenomic adaptation. In this application, we will elucidate the underlying mechanisms and
temporal course of this process in order to provide the first ever insights into time window and strategies of
potential therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that clonal selection and epigenetic adaptation driven by the
bone microenvironment engender the ability of disseminated breast cancer cells to further metastasize and
blockade of the microenvironment-induced alterations may confine bone metastases and prevent further
dissemination to other fetal organs. Our specific aims are 1) to characterize the kinetics of metastatic seeding
from bone lesions and determine potential therapeutic windows accordingly, and 2) to identify key druggable
targets and design therapeutic strategies against secondary metastatic seeding from bone lesions. This project
is innovative and impactful because it is the first in the field that focuses on secondary metastasis and the
profound reprogramming effects of bone microenvironment on metastatic seeding. The outcome will likely
generate significant impact on our understanding of metastatic evolution and provide insights into novel therapies

10862577,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is evolving rapidly, growing in both technology development and range
of applications. The rapid evolution of computer and hardware technology and the growing processing capacities
and cloud based opportunities, are stimulating rapid evolution of MR capabilities. Meanwhile, MR has long been
an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, while the value proposition of
clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.
 There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and
focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual
scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary
breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short
focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.
 The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is
ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The eleventh Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 17 to 22, 2022, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH.
Our GRC will also be associated with a trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS)
on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 16,17, 2022). The
trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for MRI research in a rapidly evolving
landscape by combining focused learning with networking and mentorship. We request funding to support
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings.
 The GRC, subtitled “Identifying the next 20 years of need in In Vivo MR,” will celebrate this, the 20th
anniversary meeting with presentations of state of the art knowledge as well as brainstorming of the needs for
the next 20 years. The Chair, Jeff F Dunn PhD, and Vice Chair Kim Butts Pauly PhD, will build upon a rich history
of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS will be led by Manushka Vaidya, Ph.D. (University of California San Francisco)
and Melissa Haskell, Ph.D. (University of Michigan and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored
opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.
 Specific aims of our 2022 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:
 1. Build on experience from the past 20 years to brainstorm the MRI development and application needs of
 the next 20 years
 2. Foster connections between MR programs in and outside of the USA
 3. Prepare young scientists for career progression and to make a difference in the field of MRI"
10862696,"ABSTRACT
Follicular lymphomas (FL) are germinal center (GC) B-cell derived, slow-growing tumors. Although initially
indolent, FLs are essentially incurable with many cases undergoing progression and a relapsing course during
which they become increasingly resistant to therapy. Additionally, as many as 45% of cases undergo histologic
transformation to an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma, that is generally refractory to chemo-immunotherapy.
Hence there remains a critical unmet need to understand how low-grade FLs survive and are maintained, and
to develop rational therapeutic regimens able to prevent disease progression and transformation and eradicate
these tumors. The genetic hallmark of FLs include BCL2 translocations and somatic mutations of epigenetic
modifier genes such as EZH2. Histologically, FLs typically feature a rich microenvironment, most notably
featuring extensive follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks with dendrites making extensive contact with
lymphoma cells. In recent work we showed that the main effect of EZH2 gain-of-function mutations in GC B-cells
is to enable them to become less dependent of T-cell help and strengthen their immune synapse formation with
FDCs, which induces aberrant proliferation and survival of GC centrocytes and hence formation of FLs and their
unique lymphoma-permissive immune niche. It is notable that even though GC B-cells are highly T-cell
dependent, FLs are generally resistant to T-cell augmentation therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. EZH2
mutant GC B-cells do not require T-cell help and are unable to form stable interactions with T-cells that might
otherwise suppress these tumors (which might explain checkpoint inhibitors failure). However, we find that EZH2
inhibitors can recruit CD4 and CD8 cells back into these lymphomas, which we propose may represent the major
anti-tumor mechanism of this now FDA-approved treatment in FLs. Moreover we have shown that EZH2
inhibitors reduce apoptotic thresholds in primary human EZH2 mutant lymphoma cells and are highly synergistic
with BH3 mimetics in vivo and are implementing a clinical trial combining Tazemetostat and Venetoclax for FL
and DLBCL patients. Based on these considerations and other preliminary data we hypothesize that EZH2
mutant FLs are dependent on signals received from FDCs, most notably BAFF receptor. We propose that
therapeutic targeting of the FDC-FL B-cell immune synapse will yield a lethal blow to FLs, especially when
combined with EZH2 inhibitors to restore T-cell anti-lymphoma immunity and BH3 mimetics such as Venetoclax.
We expect these treatments to prevent FL progression and transformation. Our goals for this proposal are to
determine whether EZH2 mutant FL B-cells depend on FDCs for their survival, whether EZH2 inhibitors act
through restoring interactions of FL B-cells with T-cells, and to leverage this information to test novel combination
of therapeutic approaches to prevent progression of EZH2 mutant FLs and transformation to aggressive
lymphoma."

10862858,"Abstract:
Autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (ADEOAD) is associated with numerous
genetic mutations, including those in amyloid precursor protein (APP), and presenilin (PSEN) 1
and 2 genes. Growing evidence indicates that patients with AD often experience undiagnosed
focal seizures. Indeed, over 30% of AD patients with the most common PSEN2 gene variant
(N141I) report seizures and patients with APP duplication have a similarly high incidence of
reported seizures, suggesting an unexplored role of hyperexcitability in the pathophysiology of
AD. Both epilepsy and AD are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric comorbidities.
Limited clinical evidence suggests that AD patients with reported seizures may have worsened
long-term disease trajectory. However, few studies have directly addressed how chronic
seizures in the presence of AD-associated risk genes affect long-term neuropsychiatric and
behavioral comorbidities. Even less data exists to directly define the age-dependent impact of
chronic seizures on neuroplasticity processes, which may also underlie neuropsychiatric
comorbidities of AD. This proposal will thus demonstrate how chronic seizures age-dependently
impact neuropsychiatric comorbidities and neuroplasticity-associated protein expression in
several preclinical models of AD that do and do not demonstrate amyloid-beta accumulation
(APP/PSEN1 and PSEN2-N141I, respectively). This proposal will definitively address whether
and when chronic seizures impact the functional and neuropathological sequelae of AD so as to
elucidate whether seizures are a contributor to worsened AD trajectory. It is currently unclear
when in the course of AD seizures occur. It is also unclear whether these seizures exacerbate
neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD. ADEOAD-risk genes represent underexplored
molecular contributors to network hyperexcitability, which may accelerate disease progression
in the context of AD. The major goal of this project is to thus define the age-dependent additive
impact of ADEOAD-associated risk factors and chronic seizures on the development and
severity of neuropsychiatric comorbidities and neuroplasticity-associated protein expression."
10859396,"Plasminogen (Plg), well-known for its fibrinolytic role in clotting, has emerged as a multi-functional protein that
transports lipids and small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) as a lipoprotein-like particle in circulation. Extracellular
sRNAs have been demonstrated to be transported by classical lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles; however,
a large fraction of extracellular sRNAs are likely carried by currently unknown small lipid-bearing
ribonucleoproteins. In preliminary studies, size-exclusion chromatography and lipid-binding agents were used to
isolate lipid-based ribonucleoprotein complexes for their identification by mass spectrometry proteomics.
Strikingly, Plg was identified and subsequently confirmed as ribonucleoprotein with moderate binding affinity
towards single-stranded microRNAs and viral sRNA fragments. Preliminary studies based on sRNA-sequencing
demonstrated that the Plg-sRNA profile a) includes both host and non-host sRNAs, b) is distinct from other
lipoproteins, and c) is altered in hypercholesterolemia. We also observed that Plg has the capacity to delivery
sRNAs to recipient macrophages and potentially facilitate intercellular communication between myeloid cells.
Plg treatment of immune cells elicits strong gene expression and cytokine changes, and we hypothesize that Plg
regulates macrophage gene expression, functions, and sub-phenotypes through extracellular sRNA transfer and
ligand-receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, we aim to define the mechanisms and impact of Plg-sRNA
cargo on macrophage phenotype and intercellular communication. We will confirm Plg-sRNA uptake across
myeloid cell types and assess selectivity in Plg-sRNA transfer to macrophages. We will define the role of
receptor-mediated endocytosis for Plg-sRNA uptake and determine the necessity of Plg/Pla protease activity for
sRNA delivery to macrophages. We will assess the roles of known Plg receptors, as well as identify novel Plg-
sRNA receptors and binding proteins, for macrophage sRNA uptake and storage. We will assess the impact of
sRNA cargo on classic Plg functions, including inflammation through quantifying changes to cytokine gene
expression and secretion from recipient macrophages. We aim to establish macrophage mediated Plg-sRNA
intercellular communication between myeloid cells. Furthermore, we aim to define the impact of
hypercholesterolemia and post-transcriptional modifications (PTxM) on Plg-sRNAs and their regulation of
macrophage polarization and functions through ARM-seq, LC-MS/MS, and Nanopore-based direct sRNA-
sequencing. Successful completion of these aims and objectives will open an entirely new direction for
hematology research and advance the status quo for multiple fields."

10864807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dopamine is a neuromodulator with a critical role in vascular diseases of the eye. Our recent studies show that
dopamine can directly signal to the vasculature via dopamine receptors and act as a developmental timing cue
for hyaloid vascular regression through its regulation of VEGF. Here, we now extend these studies to the retina
vasculature. Our preliminary data show that increasing dopamine signaling in the developing retina decreases
vascular density, while decreasing dopamine causes vasculature overgrowth. We further identify retinal
ganglion cells as novel dopamine producing cells and show that they directly modulate vascular growth. This is
an important finding because dopamine was previously thought to be produced only by a subset of amacrine
cells. To understand the mechanisms by which RGCs become dopaminergic and the vascular pathways
through which they signal, we propose three experimental aims. We test whether dopamine has a direct (Aim
1) or indirect (Aim 2) effect on retinal vascular cells using vascular and neuron cell-specific strategies to
remove dopamine receptors. We also ask whether dopamine and VEGFA function in trophic feedback within
the retina to establish causation. In Aim 3, we determine the neuronal mechanisms by which RGC-derived
dopamine modulates the vasculature through examination of the temporal and genetic pathways that regulate
these unique cells. Identification of a dopaminergic-RGC dependent mechanism for modifying vasculature
development and homeostasis is unexpected, so when completed this work will change the way we
understand dopamine signaling and its distinct cellular roles. This work will also guide future efforts aimed at
developing new therapeutic options to target retina vasculopathies."
10863946,"HIV cure has proven elusive given the persistence of HIV in tissue sanctuaries including the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphoid follicles in people living with HIV (PLWH). Re-emerging data now indicate that myeloid cells in addition to CD4 T cells represent a key population contributing to HIV persistence in tissues and are a major source of viral rebound after antiretroviral therapy (ART) cessation. A better understanding of myeloid reservoirs are needed in order to guide effective cure strategies. Our long-term goals are to 1) understand HIV/SIV reservoirs in myeloid cells in the CNS, and 2) develop a cellular immunotherapy that targets virus-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to tissue reservoirs of HIV in the CNS and lymphoid tissues to durably suppress HIV replication. Our emerging data suggests that whilst most vRNA+ cells are CD4 T cells during chronic SIV infections, after analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI), the majority of vRNA+ recrudescing cells may be of myeloid origin in lymphoid tissues. It is unknown what cell types recrudesce HIV post-ATI in the CNS and this will be crucial if we are to have successful remission. In order to achieve sustained HIV remission our group is currently developing a one-time immunotherapeutic for durable remission of HIV in the absence of ART. This treatment is an autologous HIV-specific CAR (specifically CD4-MBL-CAR) T-cell therapy that targets B cell follicles, and may also penetrate the CNS and target cellular viral reservoirs. B cell follicles and the brain are immune protected sites that may permit viral persistence due to low levels of virus-specific CD8 T cells. We will investigate the capacity of CAR-T-cell immunotherapy to clear SIVmac251 in both CD4 T cells and myeloid cells in lymphoid and CNS reservoirs as this will be crucial for an effective HIV cure strategy either alone or in combination with other immuno and non-immunotherapy based approaches in humans. Therefore we hypothesize that myeloid cells in lymphoid and CNS tissue sites represent the predominant cell population responsible for viral recrudescence and using engineered CAR T cells that express CXCR5 will facilitate T-cell egress into both the CNS and lymphoid follicles and lead to durable remission. These pioneering advances will permit the development of animal model systems for cure research that are challenging and impossible to perform in human studies of the CNS for translatability to human clinical studies. Specifically, we propose to 1) To characterize the source of SIVmac251 rebound virus post-antiretroviral therapy treatment interruption (ATI) in the CNS and peripheral tissues, 2) To determine the location, abundance, and persistence of rhesus CAR/CXCR5 T cells in the CNS and their impact on SIVmac251 cellular reservoirs post ART release, and 3) To determine the ability of rhesus CAR/CXCR5 T cells to kill SIV infected myeloid cells in vitro."
10863822,"Project Summary/Abstract
This program is focused on leveraging two innovative developments in medicine and clinical science to
enhance the predoctoral training of psychological and brain scientists to make breakthroughs in understanding,
preventing, and treating severe psychopathology. One development, the NIH initiative to foster clinical
translational science (CTS), is motivated by the unmet critical need to move clinically-relevant scientific
discoveries along the translational pipeline–from basic science to controlled research with clinical populations
to dissemination and implementation–in order to make a substantive public mental health impact. A second
development, the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, is motivated by the critical need to
develop multi-dimensional, multi-unit of analysis approaches to understanding psychopathology. Advances in
clinical psychological science will come from a new generation of investigators with expertise at the
intersection of these two NIH-driven developments. The ultimate goal of this training program is to maximize
the likelihood of producing independent clinical research scientists and leaders with expertise in cutting-edge
translational research designs, frameworks, and methodologies that will usher in breakthroughs in the
identification of mental illness mechanisms, prevention, and treatment. Following a successful initial training
period (years 1–4; 13 trainees), federal funds are requested to continue supporting six predoctoral trainees per
year, along with two new institutionally supported trainees, for up to two years. Training opportunities center
around four basic aims for each trainee: (1) to gain exposure to foundational concepts, theories, and
methodologies, as well as exemplars of both CTS and multiple units of analysis informed by the RDoC; (2)
apply this integrated framework to research addressing a public health issue; (3) to learn to foster collaborative
opportunities that stretch the boundaries of research both along the CTS continuum and across multiple units
of analysis; and, (4) develop professionally to continue this line of research as an independent clinical scientist.
Trainees begin their intensive training by identifying a public health issue on which to focus their research
efforts. These aims are then realized through: (a) structured research activities under the dual mentorship of a
primary and a “stretch” mentor (designed to extend the research either along the CTS continuum or across a
unit of analysis); (b) dual research mentoring of the trainee leading to submission of an NRSA application; (c)
peer, advanced trainee, and expert guidance and feedback on their research through participation in a year-
long seminar; (d) tailored doctoral qualifying examinations; (e) coursework and advanced seminars focused on
addressing mental health issues within the CTS and RDoC frameworks; (f) workshops in professional
development, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; and (g) colloquia series and conference
attendance to encourage networking and collaborative opportunities. Trainees work with their dual mentors to
design an individualized program of study in combination with the activities listed above."
10863846,"Abstract
Myopia (nearsightedness) is one of the foremost causes of visual impairment worldwide, with severe myopia
being linked to several serious eye diseases that can result in permanent blindness. The prevalence of myopia
has been increasing and is estimated to affect 50% of the world’s population by 2050. Despite the identification
of many risk factors for myopia progression such as age of onset, genetics, visual environment, and peripheral
defocus, causes of myopia are not fully understood. Current interventions have shown some success, but
without a clear explanation for their mechanism of action. It is therefore critical to investigate the mechanisms
underlying myopia development in order to design effective interventions to control the progression of myopia
in children, and to delay or ultimately prevent onset altogether. Our long-term goal is to understand the
influence of peripheral optical and neural factors on myopia development. The specific objective of this
proposal is to test the central hypothesis that optical and neural anisotropy in the human peripheral visual
system plays an important role in axial elongation. To achieve these goals we will develop and implement
innovative optical tools including a compact scanning ocular wavefront sensor, an open-view scanning
adaptive optics vision simulator, and individually-customized contact lenses. Aim 1 is directed at characterizing
how different aberration profiles impact through-focus retinal image quality and neural functions. First,
measuring lower and higher order ocular aberrations across retinal eccentricity will characterize individual
retinal image quality and blur orientations. Neural anisotropy at the same eccentricities will then be evaluated
by administering psychophysical tasks while bypassing the ocular optics using a scanning adaptive optics
vision simulator. Aim 2 will focus on determining how intrinsic peripheral aberration profiles and eye shape
change over time in school children. To do this, we will develop a compact portable scanning wavefront sensor
that can be transported to and used in a clinic for measuring longitudinal changes of school children’s optics
across retinal eccentricity. This will allow us to delineate relationships between changes in peripheral
aberrations at the crucial stages of myopia development, in those children who develop myopia. Aim 3 is
proposed to further investigate a role of blur orientations in detecting the sign of defocus and altering
directional neural sensitivity in the peripheral retina. To achieve this goal, the retinal response in term of
changes in choroidal layer thickness (short-term) and neural sensitivity (long-term) will be examined during and
after the peripheral retina is exposed to specific blur orientations."

10862488,"Background: VA recommends all eligible Veterans be offered lung cancer screening (LCS) using annual low
dose computed tomography (LDCT). VA is working to increase the number of Veterans screened in VA-settings
but many of them will continue to receive LCS care in non-VA settings. There are several gaps in care processes
in both VA and non-VA settings, including low uptake and adherence to recommended follow-up. Non-VA LCS
radiology facilities, especially in rural areas, often do not have adequate resources to ensure high quality.
Significance: Our proposal has the strong potential to improve care for millions of LCS-eligible Veterans and
non-Veterans. The vast majority of eligible patients have not undergone LCS. Of those that have, many are
engaged in LCS programs with poor records of adherence that will expose them to harms of screening without
the benefits. We will examine data and procedures to help VA and non-VA facilities evaluate LCS processes
and identify modifiable components that can positively affect patient outcomes.
Innovation/Impact: First, this proposal will be the first to evaluate LCS processes among Veterans in non-VA
settings. Second, our study will be the largest to date to evaluate patient-centered outcomes among patients
who receive care at likely hundreds of radiology facilities nationwide. Third, we will use a systems dynamics
stock-and-flow modeling approach and thematic qualitative analysis to identify modifiable factors for improving
outcomes for Veterans engaged in LCS and change components to visualize their effects.
Specific Aims - Aim 1a: Among all Veterans, characterize their involvement in lung cancer screening
processes including eligibility assessments, referral and receipt of LDCTs for LCS, and adherence to
recommended follow-up.
Aim 1b: Among Veterans referred for lung cancer screening in VA and non-VA settings, stratify the adherence
to recommended follow-up based on facility-level LCS program availability.
Aim 2: Among Veterans undergoing lung cancer screening processes, evaluate the association of VA and non-
VA communication components with patient-centered outcomes.
Aim 3: Among Veterans, VA clinicians, staff, and leaders, and non-VA radiology facility staff, use qualitative
methods to elicit their perspective on determinants of providing guideline-concordant care to Veterans referred
to VA and non-VA settings for lung cancer screening.
Methodology - Aim 1: Conduct a national audit of Veterans eligible for LCS to evaluate care processes and
adherence to follow-up based on the Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System. We will link these data
with facility-level information of LCS programs’ characteristics obtained through the National Center for Lung
Cancer Screening, to develop models of the association of VA and non-VA LCS program factors with
adherence to recommended follow-up.
Aim 2: Conduct a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of Veterans referred for LCS in VA and non-VA settings.
We will use validated instruments to measure Veterans’ attitudes about care coordination, decision-making
about choosing LCS community care, communication with VA and non-VA staff, and patient-centered
outcomes such as adherence, decisional regret, satisfaction, and smoking cessation resource utilization. We
will conduct in-depth EHR audits of survey respondents to determine adherence to recommended follow-up.
Aim 3: Guided by a theoretical model of care coordination, we will conduct qualitative interviews of Veterans
and VA and non-VA staff engaged in LCS to collect their thoughts on care coordination and communication
practices. We will also use a stock-and-flow modeling approach and thematic qualitative analysis.
Next Steps/Implementation: We have very engaged partners who will use our results to guide care processes
and plan multiple manuscripts and presentations based on this proposal."

Behavior is the product of cortical and subcortical interactions. This is epitomized by the primate circuitry that
controls eye movements. Decades of study have enumerated the seemingly redundant contributions of cortical
areas like the frontal eye fields (FEF) and subcortical areas like the superior colliculus (SC) to eye movements.
However, the field has largely ignored how these two areas communicate, coordinate, and transform information
between them to drive precise movement of the eyes. This proposal disentangles the independent and
coordinated activities of FEF and SC in the control of two prominent eye movements: saccades and smooth
pursuit. Saccades are rapid eye movements that redirect the focus of vision multiple times a second, while
smooth pursuit consists of slow, continuous movements that keep the eyes focused on a moving target. The first
aim of this proposal will reveal the independent contributions of FEF and SC to isolated eye movements. I will
simultaneously record the activity of FEF and SC during saccades directed towards a target, away from a target,
and while linear motion is pursued. By simultaneously recording from both FEF and SC, I will account for the
shared variability in FEF-SC firing rates and extract the movement related activity private to each region. I
hypothesize that SC will account for behavioral variance of saccades towards a target, FEF will account for
behavioral variance of saccades away from a target, and both SC and FEF private activity will explain different
portions of linear pursuit (e.g., initiation and maintenance). The second aim of this proposal probes how FEF and
SC coordinate their activity during more naturalistic eye movements. In natural behavior, primates rapidly and
precisely switch between saccades and pursuit. I will simultaneously record from FEF and SC while the eyes
track simple linear motion and realistic biological motion trajectories. I will extract the shared activity across FEF
and SC as a function of eye movement complexity. I hypothesize that as eye movement interactions increase in
complexity the shared activity between FEF and SC will increase in dimensionality and explain a greater portion
of behavioral variance. This would indicate a strong modulation of FEF by SC and of SC by FEF during rapid
and precise switching of eye movement regimes. Overall, this proposal marshals modern neuronal population
recordings and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics to disentangle cortical and subcortical interactions
in the production of behavior, and facilitates our understanding and development of eye movement based clinical
evaluations of disease."

Successful anti-tumor immune response requires coordination between the arms of immunity against multiple
tumor antigens, as shown through studies of animal models and human immune responses. Key to cancer cell
elimination are T lymphocytes, and in particular cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which serve to recognize antigens
presented on tumor cells on an HLA class I molecule, through their T cell receptors (TCRs). Correspondingly,
recent advances in immunotherapy geared at boosting T cell cytotoxicity through immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) have transformed the treatment landscape for many patients suffering from solid tumors. However, in
melanoma, ICB induces an objective response only in around 40% of patients. The limited efficacy of ICB has
been previously linked to the presence of dysfunctional T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME),
persisting in a state of terminal exhaustion. There is thus a pressing need to better understand the determinants
of T cell responses against tumors. To investigate these mechanisms, our lab has extensively characterized the
landscape of anti-tumor T cells infiltrating melanoma and RCC biopsies, establishing that tumor-specific T cells
are found overwhelmingly in the exhausted T cell compartment. Still, the required antigenic diversity and spatial
interactions of such tumor-specific T cells determining anti-tumor response in vivo is poorly understood.
Additionally, the relative importance of antigen class, particularly neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens
(TAAs), to effective anti-tumor T cell responses is incompletely understood. In Specific Aim 1, I thus propose to
generate patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine models of 3 melanoma patient tumors, to test the required
diversity of TCRs chosen from tumor-infiltrating T cells using markers associated with tumor specificity to exert
immune pressure on a heterogeneous tumor like melanoma. By infusing T cells transduced with varying numbers
of putative patient tumor-specific TCRs, or control non-tumor-specific TCRs, I will be able to assess the diversity
of TCRs required to control tumor growth. Further, in Specific Aim 2, I will investigate the role of antigen class
in tumor control using one of these melanoma PDX models, in combination with a cell-barcoding system, to track
the relative immune-induced selection on the tumor of TCRs specific against either neoantigens or TAAs in vivo.
Finally, in Specific Aim 3, I will utilize spatial sequencing techniques to study the localization of CD8 T cells first
within my T cell-challenged PDX models, to characterize tumor-intrinsic immunosuppressive interactions and
infiltration of T cells in my PDX models. I will then investigate the interactions and associated phenotypes of
tumor-specific T cells in the native TME of patient melanoma biopsies from recurrent tumors. Achievement of
these aims will lead to a pipeline that could isolate putative tumor-specific T cells through cellular markers to
identify their TCRs, followed by re-expression of these putative tumor-antigen-specific TCRs into non-exhausted
T cells primed in an optimal cell state for anti-tumor cytotoxicity as an autologous adoptive cellular therapy."

Recent advancements in neural recording/imaging technologies and computational methods have generated a
renewed interest in studying coordinated population activity. Understanding the population code can help us
better understand the complex mechanisms behind substance use disorders (SUD). One leading idea is that
high-dimensional neural activity, such as simultaneous recordings from hundreds to thousands of cells, can lie
on low-dimensional manifolds, such that a handful of latent variables can accurately describe the activity of all
recorded neurons. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a brain area well-known for its functional diversity – individual
cells respond with great heterogeneity to a wide range of appetitive behaviors, and LH stimulation can evoke a
variety of actions ranging from feeding to social interaction. This project proposes to use the latest nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques to extract the low-dimensional manifolds representing population activity
patterns that geometrically organize the heterogeneous single neuron activity. These manifolds can then be used
to achieve this project’s main goal – differentiating LH neural population encoding of natural reward-seeking
behaviors and maladaptive drug-seeking behaviors. In addition, novel computational modeling methods will be
used to perform unsupervised detection of internal neural states that guide animals switching between these two
reward-seeking behaviors. Finally, state-of-the-art cellular-resolution simultaneous stimulation and imaging
microscopy will be used to casually perturb animal behavior and/or neural activity patterns by activating
sequences of neurons along trajectories on the low-dimensional manifolds. Importantly, Aims 1 and 2 support
these goals by offering training in the use of the necessary computational and instrumentation techniques.
Ultimately, results obtained from this project will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms
separating harmful drug-seeking behaviors and useful natural reward-seeking behaviors, such that SUD
treatments with more precise targets can be developed that minimize unwanted side effects."

Multiple sequential waves of T-cell development in the fetal and post-natal thymus give rise to discrete T cell
subsets, each with its own functional properties. Compared with all subsequent waves, the first wave of T-cell
differentiation proceeds very rapidly and gives rise to unique lineages of innate lymphocytes and innate-like
γδT cells. These cell-intrinsic characteristics of first-wave fetal thymocytes suggests that they have their own
separate developmental program. T-cell development is coordinated by a dynamic set of transcription factors
(TFs) with stage-specific activity, through a complex network of regulatory interactions. Significant progress
has been made in recent years in understanding the T-cell differentiation program; however, whether first-wave
fetal thymocytes use the same T-lineage differentiation program is unknown. Through direct comparison of the
transcriptional program of murine adult and first-wave fetal thymocytes by single-cell RNA-seq, as well as
reanalysis of a public scRNA-seq atlas of thymic organogenesis (GSE107910; Kernfeld et al, 2018), I observed
that the first wave of fetal T-cell development occurs simultaneously along two separate trajectories. One
trajectory follows the well-established T-cell development pathway, while the other is used exclusively by first-
wave fetal thymocytes and gives rise to innate lymphocytes and innate-like γδT cells. Cells on this trajectory
appear to use a distinct differentiation program consisting of many TFs typically associated with innate
lymphocyte development—including PLZF and Lmo4—alongside shared T/innate TFs, such as TCF1, GATA3,
and Bcl11b; as well as GATA1 and Meis1, two TFs with no known role in differentiation of either lineage, and
the pan-fetal hematopoiesis regulator Lin28b. I hypothesize that this computationally-inferred population
consists of immediate precursors of innate lymphoid and innate-like γδT-lineage cells, and that their
differentiation is guided by this unique TF network. In Aim 1, I will fate map the progeny of this
hypothesized innate lymphocyte/innate-like γδT cell precursor. Within thymocytes, it is the only population that
expresses Gata1; therefore I will use Gata1CreERT2 x Rosa26lsl-tdT mice to fate map the progeny of Gata1-
expressing cells at embryonic gestational day E13.5. Additionally, I will use clonal barcoding and scRNA-seq at
multiple timepoints to construct a full lineage hierarchy of fetal thymocyte differentiation, and I will perform
scATAC-seq to determine whether lineage priming is occurring in this population or in an upstream precursor at
the level of chromatin accessibility. In Aim 2, I will use CRISPR/Cas9 to delete constituent factors in the innate
lymphocyte/innate-like γδT-lineage program in fetal progenitors and assess the impact of each on
developmental speed and lineage choice. I will also perform scRNA-seq on TF-deleted cells in order to identify
the effect each TF has on the overall program, including how it regulates other members of the program. In this
way, I will use perturbations to construct a network of the regulatory interactions dictating the characteristic
developmental speed and lineage choice of first-wave thymocytes."
10825834,"Cell and tissue mechanical properties play critical roles in physically shaping animals, organs, and tissues
during development, growth, maintenance, regeneration, and disease. Early embryonic development and later
growth utilize cell-generated physical forces to sculpt the body and organs. The micro-architecture and
composition of these tissues is spatially, geometrically, and temporally complex. Adjacent tissues can differ
widely in elastic modulus and can change greatly in a few hours as cells differentiate and gene expression
changes. However, real-world knowledge of these properties is limited to a few model systems, where
physical access and size of samples allow direct measurement.
This gap is not due to lack of effort. Numerous technologies have been developed to sense these properties,
but the applicability of these technologies has been limited by the need for samples with regular shape or with
a quasi-planar geometry that is amenable to scanning with table-mounted mechanisms. To advance our
understanding of embryonic development, there is a great unmet need for mechanical testing instrumentation
that can handle more complex 3D geometry.
We propose to address this problem by developing a handheld tissue force microscope. Our team has
experience in atomic force microscopy and related techniques, and has developed an actuated handheld
micromanipulator that enhances accuracy by performing active compensation of physiological hand tremor and
that incorporates force sensing, highly accurate optical tracking of both the handle and the manipulated
instrument tip, and camera-based visual tracking through the optical microscope. Based on our expertise in
this area, we propose to develop a convenient and easy-to-use active handheld instrument that can perform
dynamic mechanical analysis of embryos, organoids, and small tissue samples. Tremor compensation
provided by the instrument will enable the user to precisely target desired locations for testing. Frequency
sweeps will be performed automatically by the instrument. The sensing capabilities of the instrument will
automatically ensure that the sinusoidal oscillation is applied perpendicularly to the local tissue surface. In
data analysis, optical tracking of the instrument handle will allow the system to automatically correct for any
residual motion disturbance that remains after active tremor compensation. Visual tracking will automatically
register local point measurements to photographic images of the sample, enabling scans of any area of
interest, up to and including the entire surface if desired.
The specific aims are to develop a prototype capable of manipulating with accuracy of approximately 1 μm.
(This will represent the “coarse” portion of a coarse-fine manipulation system); to develop a “fine” manipulator
and sensing system for the tip of the instrument; and to integrate and evaluate the full prototype."

 Diabetes accounts for 10% of healthcare spending in the United States. A growing portion of this cost is
spent on treatments for diabetic eye disease, the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults in the
developed world. Early nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is driven by hyperglycemia that promotes
injury to the retina microvasculature. On the other hand, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) develops after
progressive microvascular damage ultimately results in retinal ischemia and subsequent hypoxia, driving the
expression of factors that promote angiogenesis. Several labs have demonstrated that the regulation of
angiogenic genes in late stages of diabetic eye disease is mediated by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF) in patients with retinal ischemia and PDR. However, a role for HIF in early stages of diabetic
retinopathy (DR) is unclear.
 We recently demonstrated that transient episodes of hypoglycemia promotes the nuclear accumulation
of HIF-1α, independent of hypoxia. This, in turn, results in an increase in expression of the angiogenic mediators
that promote the growth of abnormal, leaky vessels in patients with DR. More recently, we have observed that
activation of the p38 signaling pathway is necessary for HIF-1α accumulation in response to transient
hypoglycemia. These observations implicate the p38/HIF-1 pathway in early. Events in the promotion of DR
progression, independent of retinal ischemia. Based on these observations, we propose that inhibiting the
p38/HIF-1α pathway will be an effective approach to prevent the progression of DR. In this proposal, we use a
combination of genetic and pharmacologic approaches to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapies that target
HIF-1 (SA1) or p38 (SA2) to prevent the progression of DR."

Phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferases are bacterial inner membrane proteins that catalyze the addition of
PEA from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) donor substrate to the 1- or 4’-phosphate groups of lipid A, as a result
conferring resistance to a class of last-resort, positively charged antibiotic drugs known as polymyxins.
Polymyxins treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections by electrostatically interacting with the
anionic lipid A anchor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules on the outer membrane (OM), in turn disrupting the
membrane and leading to cell death. Hence, by cleaving and adding cationic PEA from PE to lipid A, PEA
transferases reduce the overall negative charge on the OM and interfere with the ability of polymyxins to interact
with lipid A. While most of these enzymes – including the lipid A PEA transferase (EptA) – are chromosomally
encoded, the recent discovery of the first variant of mobilized colistin resistance (MCR-1) on plasmids in China
entails that, for the first time, bacteria are capable of using horizontal transfer to confer plasmid-mediated
polymyxin resistance between different strains, thus constituting a significant additional public health risk. Indeed,
the mcr-1 gene has already been reported worldwide in livestock, food, and humans, underscoring the need to
better understand the molecular mechanism by which PEA transferases generally and MCR-1 specifically modify
lipid A to confer polymyxin resistance. The recently reported crystal structure of EptA from Neisseria meningitidis
(NmEptA) has shown that PEA transferases exist as monomers comprised of distinct C-terminal soluble and N-
terminal transmembrane (TM) domains with five TM helices. The presence of a small cavity in the NmEptA
crystal structure harboring residues conserved among PEA transferases, and the absence of an obvious
additional binding cavity, suggests that these enzymes may bind PE and lipid A sequentially, whereby a major
conformational change between the soluble and TM domains enables the larger lipid A to bind in the same cavity
as PE. However, the lack of a full-length, substrate (either PE, lipid A, or both)-bound structure in a native-like
lipidic environment precludes a full understanding of this molecular mechanism. I hypothesize that such a
structure would be able to validate the proposed mechanism-of-action and reveal the extent to which residues
in the putative substrate binding cavity or elsewhere play a role in donor (PE) and acceptor (lipid A) substrate
binding as well as coordination of the PEA intermediate. To address these questions, I will utilize structural and
functional analyses of full-length MCR-1 in lipid-filled nanodiscs by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) in addition to well-established lipid A modification and polymyxin-resistance assays in whole cells.
Two aims are proposed: (1) to determine the structure of substrate-bound MCR-1; and (2) to investigate the
specific interactions of MCR-1 with PE and lipid A. Together, these data will provide molecular-level insight into
the mechanism that MCR-1 uses to bind its substrates and coordinate and transfer PEA to modify lipid A, which
in turn will be critical for drug design efforts to inhibit MCR-1 function and treat polymyxin resistance."

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), many of which might affect genes that are involved in pancreatic β cell
function and survival. However, the exact biological functions and the mechanistic nature of these genetic
variants remain unclear. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide, in theory, unlimited resources to
generate differentiated cells to study the role of genetic factors in human diseases. Of the diabetes-associated
genes identified so far, GLIS3 is the only one (other than insulin) associated with both T1DM and T2DM, and
neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). Recently, we reported an optimized strategy to efficiently derive GLIS3+
pancreatic β-like cells. Using this platform, we found that loss of GLIS3 causes impaired differentiation toward β
cells and increases β cell death.
Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that genetic and environmental factors caused loss or reduction of
GLIS3 impairs human pancreatic β cell generation, survival, and proliferation in both healthy and disease
conditions. In preliminary studies, we have created 2 isogenic T2DM-SNP-hESCs, 2 isogenic NDM-M-hESCs,
and 2 isogenic KO (knockout)-hESC lines. In addition, we identified a TGFβ inhibitor that rescues the increased
death rate in GLIS3-/- β-like cells. In this proposal, we will systematically study the differentiation of isogenic
T2DM-SNP-hESCs, NDM-M-hESCs, and GLIS3-KO-hESCs, exploring the generation, function, and survival of
the endocrine cells in the disease conditions. Additionally, we will explore the downstream mechanism of GLIS3.
Finally, we will develop approaches to improve β cell survival in T2DM conditions by targeting GLIS3 and its
downstream pathways. Toward these goals, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of
GLIS3-associated genetic variants in the generation and survival of human pancreatic β cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Aim 2. Decode the molecular mechanism of GLIS3 controlling human pancreatic β cell survival. Aim 3.
Rescue T2DM islets survival by targeting GLIS3 and its downstream mechanisms.
This proposal will systematically analyze the biological function of GLIS3 and associated variants in human β
cell's generation, survival, and proliferation. It will significantly enhance our knowledge of β cell biology, which
will pave the road for developing novel therapies for T2DM patients."

Hepatic fuel fluxes underly numerous processes critical to whole-body physiology that become dysregulated in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among these is the basic biosynthetic process of gluconeogenesis (GNG), which increases during and contributes to the pathophysiology of T2D. Thus, understanding the regulation of the fuel fluxes supplying hepatic GNG is important for understanding both normal and T2D whole-body physiology and metabolism. The TCA cycle anaplerotic (refilling) mechanisms sustaining carbon flux into GNG have been investigated intensively. However, the greatest hypothesized net TCA cycle cataplerotic (withdrawing) pathway, malate export through the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier (DiC), has received sparse direct experimental attention in vivo. Elegant, early, ex vivo biochemical studies suggest that mitochondrial malate export through the DiC supports hepatic GNG. However, this idea has been almost totally unaddressed in the molecular era. The overall goal of this application is to understand how the DiC contributes to hepatic GNG in normal and T2D states and the mechanisms by which hepatic DiC function is altered during T2D. Based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this application is that the DiC feeds hepatic GNG by supplying carbon and reducing equivalents, becomes misregulated during T2D and contributes to excessive GNG, and may be disrupted to attenuate T2D. Using mouse genetics, primary cell culture systems, stable-isotope metabolomic tracing, luciferase reporter assays, and proteomic analysis, we will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of the DiC in hepatic gluconeogenesis (GNG) in normal and T2D states; and 2) Define the mechanistic regulation of DiC abundance and gluconeogenic activity. This research is significant because successful completion will delineate the role of the hepatic DiC as a fundamental regulator of liver and whole-body metabolism and in the elevated GNG of T2D. This research is innovative because it will utilize novel genetic DiC loss- and gain-of-function models to finally test the role of the DiC in linking mitochondrial metabolism and GNG in T2D. The consequence of not doing this research is that the role of the DiC in hepatic GNG and its contribution to T2D will remain undefined."

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron
degeneration. While the presentation of ALS involves progressive loss of motor function, the mechanistic
cause(s) of ALS are unknown. Patients diagnosed with ALS may have one of several identified genetic mutations
which predispose them to ALS, or they may present no known genetic variation; they may have a familial history
of disease, or they may be the first known case in their family. This heterogeneity has complicated our ability to
model ALS, obscuring the identification of causative mechanisms in this disease. Current model systems of ALS
are limited to exploring the resulting pathologies in animals or cell lines with a single mutation, which ultimately
is not representative of the ALS patient population. Furthermore, findings in these models have failed to translate
in the vast majority of clinical trials. Remarkably, cortical hyperexcitability is an early biomarker of ALS regardless
of genetic background, and it precedes motor symptoms and diagnosis. Despite the well-documented evidence
of this early, common phenotype, no study has demonstrated the consequences of this phenomena in human
tissue. Cortical projection neurons are in close contact with interneurons, motor neurons, and astrocytes at the
cortico-spinal synapse, and we hypothesize that cortical hyperexcitability can induce ALS phenotypes in these
populations. Completion of this proposal will determine the effect of cortical hyperexcitability on these
three cell-types key to ALS pathology. This proposal will leverage the growing field of human organoid
systems to address the lack of access to functional human tissue. Cortico-motor assembloids are formed by
assembling human stem cell-derived cortical, spinal, and muscle spheroids. Neurons from the cortical spheroid
project to the spinal spheroid. Motor neurons from the spinal spheroid functionally project to the muscle spheroid
and induce its contraction. By chronically stimulating the cortical spheroid using optogenetic paradigms informed
by findings in the ALS literature, I will recapitulate an early phenotype of ALS within a model derived from healthy
control cells, detangling the potential contribution of genetic background. In Aim 1, I will interrogate changes in
interneuron and motor neuron populations in the spinal spheroid after stimulation. Drawing from findings in ALS
patients and models, we will measure changes in the proportion of inhibitory synapses in the spinal spheroid, as
well as changes in muscle innervation and contraction. In Aim 2, I will isolate astrocytes from the spinal spheroid
after stimulation and evaluate their ability to transport glutamate, an essential astrocyte function which is
compromised in ALS patient-derived tissue. Completion of these aims will begin to elucidate the relationship
between disparate ALS pathologies, paving the way towards the identification of disease-modifying targets which
are sensitive to the early cortical hyperexcitability phenotype."

 Asthma, characterized by airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness, is
an increasingly common inflammatory airway disease that affects 10% of the world's population. Given that anti-
inflammatory treatment only partially controls asthma symptoms, it is urgent to understand the involvement of
non-immune systems in the disease. Emerging evidence suggest that lung interoceptors, sensory nerves
monitoring the internal states, play a key role in the development of asthma symptoms. Our recent studies
discovered that MrgprC11+ jugular sensory neurons control cholinergic bronchoconstriction and airway
hyperresponsiveness. Ablation of MrgprC11+ neurons reduced airway hyperresponsiveness without affecting the
allergic inflammation in a mouse asthma model. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that asthmatic
cytokines modulate the neuronal activity of MrgprC11+ neurons and sensitize cholinergic bronchoconstriction. In
this proposal, we will use Cre-dependent labeling, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and mouse airway mechanic
analysis combined with a novel calcium imaging technique to investigate how MrgprC11+ neurons contribute to
airway hyperresponsivness in asthma. Aim 1 will focus on the transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of
MrgprC11+ neurons in asthma to understand how lung interoceptors respond to allergic airway inflammation.
Aim 2 will investigate how the airway inflammation modulates the electrophysiological properties of MrgprC11+
neurons and changes the neuronal responses of airway-innervating nerves. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
neuro-immune interactions between MrgprC11+ nerves and asthmatic cytokines and examine if these
interactions contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. These studies will reveal novel neural mechanisms
controlling asthma symptoms."

10827880,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The underpinnings of sudden cardiac death are related to genetic and acquired ion channel abnormalities and
many are related to potassium channel variants. Gains in phenotype-genotype correlative studies have
revolutionized our understanding of a range of sudden arrhythmic death syndromes, yet currently, identification
of coding variants has far outpaced our ability to correctly classify the variant, and for most genes there are more
unclassified variants (variants of unknown significance, VUS) than classified. This creates barriers for clinical
care, familial cascade screening and, moreover, a functional link to disease. The importance of physiologic and
functional analysis for variant classification has been emphasized, yet contemporary methods are cumbersome
(time and resources) decreasing efficiency in unraveling the arrhythmic risk associated with genetic variants.
Our lab’s work focuses on functional genomics of abnormal cardiac repolarization and cardiac arrhythmic sudden
death syndromes, and we have developed high volume assays to understand variant pathogenicity. Yet most
variant characterization proceeds in a reactive manner (clinical variant identification followed by functional study)
and clinical association is often lacking (siloed research); this creates gaps in optimal and efficient variant
classification. We aim to address these major gaps in knowledge by creating a pro-active, data driven and
mechanistic variant classification scheme cross-validated with clinical data. In Aim 1, Deep Mutational Scanning
(DMS) of Kir2.1, a K+ channel essential for repolarization, and MAVE (multiplexed assay of variant effects)
creation will unveil functional annotation of all possible variants simultaneously to create a comprehensive fitness
landscape. In Aim 2 MAVE will be applied to all K+ channel variants identified from TOPMed and the UK Biobank
that have effects on repolarization to triangularly validate phenomic-genomic-functional data for genetic variant
classification. Lastly, in Aim 3 we integrate genetic variant and MAVE results with traditional cellular markers of
abnormal repolarization using an iPS-cardiomyocyte model and molecular computational modeling. Our central
hypothesis is that DMS will uncover loss of function variants in regulatory regions of Kir2.1, MAVE of low
frequency K+ channel coding variants from the TOPMed and UK Biobank will reveal common thematic and
mechanistic readouts, and these can be validated in iPS-CMs and computational molecular modeling. The
outcomes of this study will allow the field of functional genomics to begin to keep pace with rapidly evolving
genetic discovery through high integrity, high throughput, and highly reproducible and unbiased techniques. We
will create a methodologic template to catalog all other high-impact repolarization associated variants as a vital
step to transition from reactive to proactive classification. Moreover, we will help establish the methodology to
correlate clinical findings with variant characterization using parallel mechanistic techniques. This is an
innovative proactive, data-driven approach, usable by clinicians and research teams alike to determine
actionability of a given variant and to inform predictive models to reveal new structural-functional insights."

Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and
ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many
patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical
evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic
Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of
cardiothoracic disease.
The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces
the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC.
The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective
agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to
valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the
design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the
coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort.
In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient-
centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data
capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a
strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada,
training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data
management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the
infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed
through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and
dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact
journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be
further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should
decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread
practice."

Allergic diseases including food allergies and allergic asthma represent a substantial health and economic
burden, with the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimating more than 50 million people within the US
suffering from some form of allergic disease. The natural history of allergic diseases suggests immunological
crosstalk between mucosal organs contributes to the co-occurrences of allergic diseases (e.g. food allergy and
asthma) within the same individual, although the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly this process
have not been defined and represent a critical knowledge gap. Using in vivo mouse models we have shown
that intragastric administration of allergen (ovalbumin, OVA) to OVA-sensitized mice not only elicits local
eosinophilic inflammation within the allergen-exposed intestine, but also increases the frequency and alters the
activation phenotype of tissue eosinophils within the allergen non-challenged, remote lung. Presence of
inflammatory eosinophils within the remote lung are associated with mucous metaplasia and airway priming;
the latter evidenced by generation of an exacerbated allergic airway inflammatory response upon subsequent
inhalation of sub-optimal doses of an unrelated antigen (house dust mite). In contrast, intragastric OVA failed
to enhance mucous metaplasia or airway priming in the remote lungs of eosinophil deficient mice. Collectively
these prior data suggest intragastric challenge affects allergic susceptibility of the airways through
dysregulation of lung tissue eosinophils. This proposal builds on these findings to investigate lung- and
eosinophil-intrinsic mechanisms that underly intragastric allergen-driven dysregulation of remote lung
eosinophils that lead to remote airway priming. We have found intragastric allergen challenge transiently alters
the lung transcriptome, including induction of gene signatures implicated in eosinophil recruitment. Correlative
analyses of serum proteins and blood eosinophil-expressed receptors further suggest systemic mediators and
eosinophil-intrinsic factors contribute specifically to lung homing, including an eosinophil-derived subset of
extracellular vesicles (EVs). Specific Aims test the central hypothesis: Intragastric allergen challenge
activates 1) an IL-13:CCL11 axis in the remote lung via gut-derived type 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2s), and 2) IL-5/IL-33:ST2-dependent effects on circulating eosinophils that synergistically underly
the dysregulation of tissue eosinophils within the remote lung. Our approach utilizes unique genetically
modified mouse strains, including cytokine reporter mice and cell-targeted gene disruption, competitive
adoptive transfer studies and innovative approaches to characterize eosinophil-derived extracellular vesicles.
Translational approaches utilize human blood eosinophils. Completion of this proposal may offer important
insights into immunological mechanisms that drive mucosal remote organ priming within the context of allergic
inflammation, and as such is highly relevant to the development of better diagnostic and interventional
approaches for patients with allergic diseases."

10827949,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to determine the regulation and functions of immunoproteasome (IP) during
rhinovirus infection in airways with type 2 inflammation, a hallmark of the type 2 (e.g., interleukin 13 [IL-13]) high
asthma. Rhinovirus (RV) infection remains a significant healthcare burden due to its contribution to exacerbations
of asthma and other lung diseases. Because there is no effective therapy for airway RV infection, it is imperative
to define novel mechanisms (e.g., IP) that clear RV from the infected airway cells (e.g., epithelial cells). We found
reduced IP expression in airway epithelial cells of severe asthma patients with airway type 2 inflammation.
Importantly, our preliminary data strongly suggest that IP expression in human primary airway epithelial cells
was significantly up-regulated by RV (RV-A and RV-C) infection, and that knockout or inhibition of key IP
components (e.g., LMP2 and LMP7) increased airway epithelial viral load. Type 2 cytokine IL-13 significantly
reduced IP induction by RV. RV-infected LMP2 knockout (vs. wild-type) mice were unable to clear the viruses
effectively, and increased lung inflammation. We will test the hypothesis that airway IP induction during RV
infection serves as a critical host defense mechanism to eliminate viral infection, but is impaired in airways with
type 2 inflammation, leading to persistent infection and excessive inflammation. In Aim 1, we will determine the
role of the interferons (IFNs)/IFN receptor (IFNR)/STAT1 axis in IP regulation by RV and type 2 inflammation by
performing gene knockout experiments in human primary airway epithelial cells, and using the human precision-
cut lung slices or gene (e.g., IFNAR or STAT1) deficient mice exposed to IL-13, allergen and/or RV. In Aim 2,
we will determine the role of IP in RV-mediated asthma exacerbation and underlying mechanisms by using IP
deficient mice (whole body or airway epithelial conditional gene knockout) and human primary airway epithelial
cells with IP gene knockout. We will test if IP’s antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions depend on its regulation
of RV 3C protease and A20, a negative immune regulator. In Aim 3, we will determine the efficacy of IP as an
antiviral agent in airways with type 2 inflammation. By delivering a single low-dose of IFN-l or a viral mimic (i.e.,
polyI:C) into cultured human airway epithelium or mouse airways with type 2 inflammation, we will test if
enhancing IP expression promotes resolution of airway acute RV infection and inflammation. Research findings
will significantly improve our understanding about host defense mechanisms against RV infection, and likely
provide a new opportunity to treat RV infections in patients with asthma and other diseases."
10862008,"OVERALL - ABSTRACT
COVID-19 is a world-wide health problem caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in the lung with
long-term symptoms in at least one third of patients. Many COVID-19 patients suffer from silent
or identified thrombi in major organs such as the lung and the brain and have increased
occurrence of cardiac events. They also experience high levels of inflammatory cytokines
collectively called cytokine storm. Combined, these reactions lead to organ damage and long-
term sequelae of infection commonly termed Long-COVID. Our Program team will join forces to
determine the host cell mechanisms underlying tissue damage in the lung and how SARS-CoV-
2 alters immune responses (Project 1), as well as in the brain and blood circulation (Project 2).
Identification and targeting of host mechanisms that control the multi-organ inflammatory
pathologies of COVID-19 will synergize with the targeting of cellular enzymes that control SARS-
CoV-2 replication (Project 3). Together, our team will reveal and test novel therapeutic targets to
collectively tame inflammation, neuroinflammation and thrombosis and to restrict viral replication.
To achieve such a comprehensive overall goal, the three Projects by four Cores that will offer
administration, biostatistical and bioinformatic support, animal models and purified viral strains,
and relevant primary cell types with genetic manipulations to perform the planned experiments.
Our Program will spearhead efforts to better understand the mechanisms of COVID-19 pathology
in different organs and to identify novel drug targets to limit the severity of COVID-19 and the
development of Long-COVID."

Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells comprise up to 10% of human peripheral blood T cells, and are
enriched in the liver, lungs and gastrointestinal mucosa. This indicates that MAIT cells are key players in
immunity. However, their roles in immune protection, and in immunopathology are yet to be fully established.
Nevertheless, MAIT cells are implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases including tuberculosis, peptic
ulceration, periodontal disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Central to the function of MAIT cells is the MAIT
T cell antigen receptor (TCR). Consistent with their innate-like phenotype, MAIT cells express a very restricted
T cell repertoire. Namely, human MAIT cells are characterized by an invariant TCR a-chain (TRAV1-2-TRAJ33)
paired with a limited array of TCR b-chains (TRBV6 or TRBV20). The MAIT TCR is restricted to the monomorphic
Major Histocompatibility Complex class I related protein, MR1. A very high level of conservation of MR1 in
mammals and the restricted MAIT TCR usage strongly indicate an important and evolutionarily conserved
function for the MAIT TCR-MR1 axis in immunity. Based on our previous work and preliminary findings, we aim
to: (i) Investigate novel MAIT cell antigens and their impact on MAIT TCR diversity; (ii) Define the cellular
machinery involved in acquisition and presentation of MR1 antigens; (iii) Investigate the structural basis of MAIT
cell antigen potency and selectivity. Our proposed studies will advance our understanding of MR1 presentation
and subsequent recognition by the MAIT TCR, which is a fundamental precursor for harnessing MAIT cells for
future immunotherapeutics."

 Malaria exerts a heavy public health burden, and the emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and
drug-resistant parasites, along with the lack of a broadly effective vaccine, necessitates the development of new
methods for disease control. While Wolbachia has been successfully developed for arbovirus control and
shown a promising potential for malaria control, the limited choices of Wolbachia-transinfected Anopheles
mosquitoes and the lack of knowledge on how external environmental factors and both mosquito and parasite
genotypes may influence Wolbachia-mediated parasite-blocking, along with a lack of understanding of the
blocking-mechanism, are remaining hurdles for the development of effective Plasmodium transmission-
blocking approaches. Compared to other mosquito biological control strategies, Wolbachia-based population
replacement is advantageous because it has the potential to provide sustainable disease control at a relatively
low cost. To date, only a single Wolbachia transinfected anopheline line has been published, with the
establishment of the wAlbB strain in Anopheles stephensi, and this transinfection confers a greater resistance
to infection with Plasmodium. We aim to develop novel Wolbachia transinfected lines with enhanced
Plasmodium suppressing effect (Aim 1), tolerance to high temperature, and minimal fitness costs, and assess
how external environmental factors influence both Wolbachia infection and its ability to block Plasmodium
infection (Aim 2) and how both mosquito and parasite genotypes may influence Wolbachia-mediated parasite-
suppression and whether the mosquito’s REDOX system is a determining blocking-mechanism (Aim 3).
Importantly, this project will develop new tools such as novel Wolbachia transinfected Anopheles lines, and
further our knowledge on crucial factors for Wolbachia symbiosis with the Anopheles mosquito vector, and
mechanisms involved in Wolbachia-mediated Plasmodium suppression, thereby facilitating the development
of Wolbachia-based biocontrol strategies."
10855884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep disorder and a recognized risk with an estimated
worldwide prevalence of one billion people. The ensuing repeated episodes of nocturnal hypoxia and hypoxemia
are at the core of the disorder’s pathogenesis, leading to upregulation of neuro inflammation and oxidative stress,
which predispose OSA patients to cardiac and neurovascular disease along with impaired cognitive function and
neurodegeneration. The investigators have previously examined the neurovascular-metabolic alterations in
terms of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) at rest and in response to apneic challenges during
wakefulness in the form of repeated cued breath-holds mimicking the hypercapnic-hypoxic events of
spontaneous apnea, by means of temporally-resolved MRI-based brain oximetry. Although this work provided
new insights into chronic and acute neurometabolic consequences of the disorder, the response to coached
volitional apneas likely differs from that of spontaneous apneas during sleep. Also unknown are the upper
airway’s morphologic changes that occur during apneas (full airway closure) and hypopneas (partial closure)
that cause the metabolic alterations. Leading up to the proposed project we have been able to monitor cerebral
oxygen metabolism in healthy subjects in the scanner with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and
designed an imaging procedure that returns the vascular-metabolic parameters and upper airway morphology
during continuous scanning. We illustrate the method’s potential with model apneas induced in test subjects
involving the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing, causing airway closure and the expected hypoxic-hypercapnic
response and, more recently, in a patient with OSA during 90 minutes of continuous scanning at six seconds
temporal resolution during sleep in the scanner. The key hypothesis underlying the proposed research is that
the method can evaluate state-dependent O2 brain metabolism and airway anatomy in OSA patients during
wakefulness and sleep and during spontaneous apneas and further, that the acute airway structural
manifestations during apneas and hypopneas correlate with the metabolic response to apneas. The project
comprises three specific aims: (1) Optimize the temporally resolved interleaved structural and metabolic MRI
protocol and synchronized airway plethysmography to confirm the method’s ability to simultaneously detect the
metabolic and airway structural changes during induced apneas; (2) examine the state dependence of O2
metabolism and upper airway anatomy in OSA patients differing in disease severity, with the method of aim 1
and concurrent EEG monitoring; (3) evaluate the hypothesis that the transient brain metabolic and upper airway
changes during apnea can be predicted by baseline measurements during respiration in the awake state along
with the subjects’ biological profile obtained from blood markers of oxidative stress and neuro inflammation. The
proposed research should provide new insight into the structural and neurometabolic implications of OSA and
the disorder’s biological underpinnings, and ultimately guide the development of improved treatment methods."

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are a critical cell population in the homeostasis of the lung, needing to clear
pathogens and debris from the alveoli without compromising long-term lung health. However, our
understanding of their unique phenotype and cellular pathways remains incomplete. This is despite their great
importance in diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) carves out its
niche inside these cells. As one of the leading causes of death from a single infectious agent and becoming
increasingly drug-resistant, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches against TB. The overall
goal of our laboratory is to identify intracellular master regulators of inflammation and metabolism that dictate
human macrophage responses to M.tb and exploit them as potential host-directed therapy targets. Our lab has
identified an understudied family of nuclear receptors, the NR4A family, that is highly expressed by human
AMs. Previous work as well as our own data reveal a connection between these transcriptional regulators and
expression of surface lipid scavenger receptors (SRs) implicated in M.tb pathogenesis. NR4A members are
upregulated in response to M.tb infection of macrophages and function to control M.tb growth. The proposed
research plan will use a newly developed AM model to investigate the hypothesis that one or more NR4A
family members negatively regulate SR expression and therefore lipid uptake, and decrease M.tb growth in
human macrophages. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the role of individual NR4A family members in
SR expression and lipid uptake in human macrophage models, 2) Determine whether the NR4A family is
protective against M.tb infection using macrophage models, and 3) Establish how NR4A family members
regulate NFB and PPAR signaling pathways in mediating M.tb macrophage resistance. In addition, this
project uses CRISPR (to complement siRNA knockdown) for specific macrophage knockout of single family
members to decrease off-target effects. Investigation of the NR4A family may ultimately identify new,
druggable host cell targets for TB therapies. This research plan, under Dr. Schlesinger’s mentorship, affords
me the ability to learn new scientific techniques, new models to study infectious diseases, detailed data
analysis and the training to shape the direction of this project and my career. The training plan outlines career
development activities including opportunities to improve my scientific presentation and communication skills,
technical skills, critical thinking, and grantsmanship. The research and training will take place at the Texas
Biomedical Research Institute with a deep commitment to scientific training, evidenced by numerous journal
clubs, seminars and full support of the Texas Biomed Association for Trainees. Texas Biomed has various core
facilities, high containment research labs for M.tb work both in vitro and in mice and NHPs, and all resources
needed for excellent scientific training. At fellowship completion, I will be prepared to design and perform
research independently and move to the next phase of my training."
10828339,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable, X chromosome-linked muscle disease that exhibits
skeletal muscle wasting/weakness and the associated inflammation and dysfunction. Though available data on
anti-inflammatory drugs in DMD patients and animal models are promising in diminishing inflammation and
promoting muscle healing in patients, further understanding the inflammatory mechanisms and DMD
pathogenesis is critical to develop the next generation of DMD drugs. The lymphatics have emerged as a central
player in the process of inflammation and play active roles in both the resolution and progression of inflammation.
This proposal brings a novel perspective for treatment of DMD. Since the lymphatic system plays active roles in
both the resolution and progression of inflammation, the idea is that further increasing lymphangiogenesis in
muscle tissues will augment lymph transport, and consequently, lessen inflammation and improve muscle health
in DMD muscle. Preliminary data demonstrate: i) lymph transport in the distal pelvic limb is decreased while
lymphatic vessel density is increased in tibialis anterior muscle from the severely affected, D2mdx mice; ii)
skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D increases
lymphangiogenesis in normal muscle, with an increase in muscle weight and a positive trend in improving
forelimb grip strength and iii) augments lymph transport in denervated muscle. Hence, central hypotheses
are: 1) Inflammatory lymphangiogenesis combined with a decrease in lymphatic contractile activity cause a
decrease in lymph transport, thereby causing chronic inflammatory status in muscles of DMD animals and 2)
further augmenting lymphangiogenesis with VEGF-D overexpression beyond the level of inflammatory
lymphangiogenesis observed in dystrophic muscle will improve lymph transport in skeletal muscle, and
consequently, resolve the inflammation and attenuate muscle weakness and dysfunction in DMD animals.
Specific Aims are: 1) To determine the changes in lymphatic structure and function in skeletal muscle of DMD
mouse and canine models and 2) To determine whether experimentally increasing lymphangiogenesis in skeletal
muscle improves muscle health in D2.mdx mice and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs. Different
age groups of D2.mdx mice and wildtype control DBA/2J mice will be used. GRMD dogs and muscle biopsy
collections from muscle dystrophy patients of various dog breeds will also be used. Overexpression of VEGF-D
in D2.mdx mice and in GRMD will be achieved by genetic or adeno-associated virus approaches.
Lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, lymphatic contractility and lymph transport, muscle health and function will
be evaluated in controls and experimental animals. This proposal will provide novel information regarding the
therapeutic role of lymphangiogenesis in improving muscle health in DMD animal models."

Neurodegenerative dementias, including Alzheimer’s disease, inflict devastating cognitive decline, for which
there is no cure. Metabolic stress is hypothesized to contribute to the development of dementia: glucose
hypometabolism is an early feature in Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), and diabetes is a
substantial risk factor for developing dementia. However, how metabolic stress combines with genetic
neurodegenerative disease risk factors to lead to neuronal death is not well understood, and there are no known
ways to boost metabolic resilience in susceptible neurons. To address these knowledge gaps, we have identified
genetic targets that maintain cellular energy levels, using a unique screening paradigm that combines cutting-
edge, genetically encoded sensors for ATP, the main energy-carrying molecule in cells, with whole-genome
CRISPR-based gene manipulations. With this approach, we have identified gene pathways that have a
prominent impact on ATP levels when cells are under metabolic stress. In particular, our preliminary data
indicate that knockdown of AD/PD disease risk genes associated with endocytic recycling lead to neuronal death
specifically when glucose is scarce. One of these genes is SORL1, a risk gene that is potentially causal for AD.
SORL1 is known to interact with APOE, and the APOE4 variant is the largest genetic risk factor for AD. But the
interaction between APOE and SORL1 or the endocytic recycling pathway is not well understood. Under the
mentorship of Dr. Ken Nakamura and Dr. Robert Mahley, in collaboration with Drs. Martin Kampmann and
Thomas Graeber, and with the support of the vibrant research community and cores at the Gladstone Institutes
and UCSF, I will test the hypothesis that AD risk mutations in endocytic recycling create an energy failure and
increases the susceptibility of neurons to lipid deficits and the deleterious effects of APOE expression and
APOE4 genotype. I will investigate this hypothesis through the following Aims: 1) Determine the impact of
disrupting endocytic recycling on energy consumption and respiration, 2) Determine the effect of impaired
glucose metabolism on endosomal protein trafficking, 3) Determine how APOE expression and genotype
contribute to metabolic vulnerability and endosomal protein trafficking in endocytic recycling deficient neurons.
The proposed studies will also determine if maintaining ATP levels via genetic manipulations or by addressing
metabolic deficits have therapeutic potential for treating neuron vulnerability and functional decline. The
proposed research and career development plan will build on my previous training and enhance my trajectory
toward becoming an independent investigator by developing skills to study energy metabolism and proteostasis
in individual neurons, mastering analytical techniques to study metabolic dysfunction and response to metabolic
stress on a systems-level, gaining experience with experimental design, communication, and mentorship, and
building a foundation of biological understanding of dementia and neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex meshwork of hundreds of proteins that constitute the scaffold that
holds our cells together. However, the functions of the ECM extend far beyond its structural roles. ECM proteins
provide biochemical signals, either directly, by binding to cell surface receptors, or indirectly, by modulating
growth factor signaling, that regulate many essential pathways controlling cellular functions, from proliferation
and survival to migration and differentiation, all key to tissue and organ functions. Alteration of the ECM is linked
to many diseases, including congenital diseases (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos
syndrome), musculo-skeletal diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, myopathies), cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, and
cancer. Yet, despite its importance, the ECM remains largely underexplored. For example, we have yet to
decipher the ECM protein composition (or “matrisome”) of organs, of tissues, and, within tissues, of specialized
niches. We also do not fully understand which cell types produced which ECM proteins, nor do we know how
the composition of the ECM changes over time and during diseases. These gaps in knowledge are mainly due
to the lack of adequate methods to study the ECM. The secretion and post-translational modifications that
accumulate in the ECM over time are critical for proper ECM functions and cannot be fully studied by RNA-level
observations only. Thus, protein-level evidence is key to understand the function and dynamics of the ECM.
However, ECM proteins, being typically very large, heavily post-translationally modified, and, overall, highly
insoluble, are under-represented in global proteomic datasets. We propose to fill these gaps in knowledge by
contributing our expertise in ECM biology, ECM proteomics, and computational biology to the technology-
development and mapping efforts of the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), and ultimately build
spatially-resolved maps of the matrisome of all organs. To achieve this goal, we will pursue the following aims:
1) re-analyze the vast amount of single-cell RNA-seq data generated by HuBMAP to identify the cell populations
expressing ECM and ECM receptor gene transcripts for all organs, 2) integrate existing imaging data and mass
spectrometry data generated by the HuBMAP to build a model to predict protein co-expression and create
spatially-resolved tissue maps of the ECM, 3) contribute our 10+ years of expertise in ECM proteomics to ensure
the effectiveness of future data collection, to capture ECM-relevant information, by members of the HuBMAP.
For our efforts to benefit the entire scientific community, we will deploy all datasets and technologies via the
HuBMAP portal and via MatrisomeDB, the ECM protein knowledge database we have previously developed.
This mapping effort will constitute a first step toward understanding the roles of the ECM in health and diseases
and toward the development of future ECM-focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
10826851,"Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease,
diabetes mellitus and stroke. One region essential for the control of meal size is the nucleus of the solitary
tract (NTS) in the brainstem. Vagal afferent fibers carrying different types of satiety information from the GI
terminate in the NTS, and NTS neurons process this information before relaying it on to other brain regions
to terminate a meal. Activation of NTS neurons therefore critically impacts meal length. However, NTS
neurons are extremely heterogeneous in their expression of peptides and receptors. Activation of most NTS
neuronal populations inhibits FI, including general activation of NTS neurons expressing catecholamines
(NTS-CA). However, recently a subpopulation of NTS-CA neurons that express NPY and project to the
arcuate nucleus were found to stimulate FI. Interestingly, intra NTS injections of NPY stimulates FI.
Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that both NPY and NE inhibit vagal activation of NTS neurons
and that stimulating NTS NPY neurons inhibits neighboring NTS neurons. Taken together, these are
intriguing results, but there are critical gaps in our knowledge about how these neurons impact the
activity of other NTS neurons, how NTS NPY neurons are activated and if their function changes with
metabolic state. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that NTS NPY neurons release NPY and NE
locally to inhibit anorexigenic NTS neurons and the level of release is determined by a balance of excitatory
vagal drive and GABA inhibition, which is impacted by fasting and diet. We will test this hypothesis
rigorously and comprehensively by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the effects of
locally released NPY and NE on NTS neuronal function. Aim 2. Elucidate what determines the activity of
NTS NPY expressing neurons. Aim 3. Determine whether the activity of NTS NPY neurons and the effects
of NPY and NE are altered during a fast and following a high fat high sugar (HFHS) diet. These studies are
conceptually innovative because they focus on an under-investigated area: how orexigenic neurons
integrate with other NTS neurons and the effect of metabolic state. They are rigorously and comprehensive
as they use multiple complementary approaches. These results are expected to positively impact the field
as they will elucidate underappreciated circuitry in a brain region well established for being critical for the
control of food intake. This is anticipated to help direct and improve therapeutic strategies for the prevention
and treatment of obesity."

Centromeres are chromosomal loci that bind to meiotic or mitotic spindles to facilitate chromosome segregation
and faithful inheritance of genetic information. Errors arising during chromosome segregation can be detrimental
to the cell and cause aneuploidies. The location of the centromere is well maintained; however, how centromeric
DNA encodes the centromere position is not well understood. Centromeric DNA is defined by the presence of
unique centromeric nucleosomes that act as a molecular loading dock for other protein complexes involved in
chromosome segregation. Centromeric nucleosomes contain a histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-
A). All human centromeres contain repetitive DNA elements known as alpha satellites; however, alpha satellite
sequences vary within a chromosome and between chromosomes. Despite the lack of conserved sequences,
the identity of the centromere is highly maintained. In rare cases, centromeres can form outside of their native
locus, causing the formation of a stable centromere elsewhere in the genome. The formation of ectopic
centromeres, also called neocentromeres, is often associated with chromosomal rearrangements that are found
in developmental disorders and cancers. Patient-derived neocentromeres exhibit a non-random distribution in
the genome, indicating a targeting mechanism to these sites; however, conserved features of the DNA or
chromatin at these sites and at the endogenous centromere have not been discovered yet. This raises interesting
questions about how centromeric DNA is encoded. I hypothesize that the CENP-A nucleosomes that define the
location of the centromere are targeted to unique DNA structures. To address the existing gap in knowledge,
this proposal will use a genomic-based approach to investigate DNA structures and centromere specification.
Understanding the requirements for centromere formation that is necessary for chromosome separation can be
applied to the development of gene therapies and will provide valuable insights into genomic instability that
contributes to disease. This work will allow us to address longstanding questions in the field about how the
localization of centromeres is determined in humans, and through this we will better understand how unique DNA
structures contribute to cellular function and disease."
10928746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The hippocampus plays an essential role in encoding long-term episodic memories. However, because
many of the experiences we encode share similar features (people, locations, objects), a critical challenge
for the episodic memory system is to prevent interference or confusion between these memories. Recent
human neuroimaging studies have revealed that highly similar events can trigger a “repulsion” of
corresponding representations within the hippocampus such that nearly identical events are associated with
markedly different activity patterns. Critically, there is evidence that hippocampal repulsion is adaptive in
that it is associated with reduced memory interference. However, a fundamental open question is whether
or how hippocampal repulsion impacts the actual contents of memories. Addressing this question requires
methods for precisely characterizing potentially subtle differences in behavioral and neural expressions of
memory content. In this proposal, I will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to
transform measures of verbal recall into text embeddings (i.e., numerical vectors) within a multidimensional
semantic space. These text embeddings will allow me to quantify the similarity of memories for highly similar
natural scene images. Additionally, I will gain new training in advanced fMRI methods and computational
analyses that will allow me to characterize and relate behavioral expressions of memory to corresponding
representations within the hippocampus. My central hypothesis is that repulsion of hippocampal
representations will be associated with the exaggeration of differences between similar scene stimuli when
they are verbally recalled. This hypothesis and the feasibility of my approach is supported by a preliminary
study I have conducted which validates that NLP methods are sensitive to subtle distortions in how similar
scene images are remembered. In Aim 1, using NLP methods and a behavioral memory paradigm, I will
test the hypothesis that distortions in memory content are explained by a targeted “movement” of competing
memories away from each other in a high-dimensional semantic space. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis
that changes in memory content (measured by NLP methods) are predicted by the degree of repulsion of
hippocampal representations. In addition to supporting my training with new neuroimaging and
computational methods, this project will yield important new insight into how the hippocampus resolves
interference between similar memories. Moreover, the specific combination of techniques and approaches
that I will employ have the potential to open up new avenues of research in the field of episodic memory. In
summary, this research will support my long-term objective of developing innovative methods to understand
how the hippocampus supports the efficient storage of episodic memories."
10828373,"Progressive metastasis is the proximate cause of cancer-related mortality for the majority of patients with solid tumors. Identifying gatekeepers of late stage progression and defining their mechanisms of action is therefore crucial. Thyroid cancer provides an outstanding model to identify regulators of late stage cancer progression due to its typical long latency and the often rapid pace of end-stage progression. We have focused on defining unique genomic alterations in distant metastatic lesions in thyroid cancer and identified Regulator of Calcineurin 1.4 (RCAN1.4) as a new metastasis suppressor. This function has subsequently been reported in other solid tumors. Through a combination of unbiased genomic analysis and confirmatory studies of human tissues, and functional studies in human cell lines, mouse xenografts, and newly-developed genetically engineered mouse models, we have identified the Cap-N-Collar transcription factor, NFE2L3 (Nrf3) as a critical downstream functional regulator induced by RCAN1.4 loss. In addition, NFE2L3 itself functions to promote thyroid cancer cell growth and invasion and is associated with poor prognosis. We also have shown that RCAN1.4 loss and NFE2L3 overexpression are associated with immune activation in vitro and in vivo, that overexpression of NFE2L3 is associated with a permissive type 1 immune environment in human thyroid cancer, that IL-8 release and gene expression are regulated by NFE2L3, and that NFE2L3 directly binds to the IL8 promoter and regulates its activity, suggesting a mechanistic role in regulation the tumor-immune interface in thyroid cancer. Progressive thyroid cancers are typically not associated with overexpression of PD1/PDL1 or microsatellite instability, despite often robust immune cell infiltrate, thus, checkpoint inhibitors have been largely ineffective. These data highlight the importance of defining regulators of the immune environment that regulate progression of this tumor type. The overall hypothesis is that RCAN1.4 loss and NFE2L3 overexpression induce a tumorigenic and pro-metastatic immune environment that facilitates thyroid cancer progression."

10825162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cerebellum has long been thought to solely process motor information. Yet, there is a growing literature
that points to the role of the cerebellum in cognition and emotion. Individuals with cerebellar lesions can have
deficits in executive functioning, emotion processing, language, and social cognition. Multiple neuropsychiatric
disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia, have been linked to abnormal cerebellar
processing. Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown neural responses in the
cerebellum related to a host of non-motor tasks. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum is
involved in a range of non-motor tasks. The focus of this grant proposal is to investigate cerebellar functions in
a subcomponent of language: syntax.
Computational models suggest that the cerebellum is involved in detecting sequential structure and in
generating predictions about what will come next. Both of these functions are essential for syntax. Interestingly,
case studies have reported agrammatism following cerebellar lesions. In this grant proposal, I will use
functional MRI and dynamic causal modeling to investigate the cerebellum’s role in syntax and verbal working
memory and to investigate the extended functional network that underlies these functions. Syntax will be
compared to verbal working memory because a large body of research suggests an important role of the
cerebellum in working memory, and there is some overlap in the processing demands of syntax and working
memory. Thus, it is important to parse these functions apart. The training plan for this proposal includes
training in functional MRI design and analysis by experts in syntax and the cerebellum. It also includes training
on dynamic causal modeling, a modeling technique used to compare causal models of brain function. Dynamic
causal modeling will allow us to directly test theories on the cerebellum’s connectivity with the cerebrum. These
findings will provide insight into the cerebellum’s mechanistic role in syntax. With this better understanding, a
new framework can be developed for linguistic processes that have long been nebulously linked to cerebellar
function."

The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision, which eliminated federal
protections for abortion rights, is an unprecedented policy change with implications for fertility, maternal health,
and infant health in the US. Abortion is currently banned in 12 states and severely restricted in 14 others.
Approximately one in three people who can become pregnant in the US reside in a state with little or no access
to safe abortion services since the ruling, predominantly in the South and Midwest, where a disproportionate
share of the population is Black or Hispanic. Restricting safe abortion services may differentially impact fertility
rates of disadvantaged groups, with long term implications for population health and persisting disparities.
Populations with the highest abortion rates are also at greater risk of poor pregnancy and birth outcomes,
including late entry into prenatal care, preterm birth, low birthweight, and severe maternal morbidity. Abortion
restrictions imposed following Dobbs may increase rates of negative pregnancy outcomes and widen
disparities simply because more people who reside in those states, especially disadvantaged populations, are
exposed to the risks associated with carrying a pregnancy to term. Post-Dobbs abortion restrictions may also
directly impact risks of these outcomes via changes in clinical practice, accessibility of timely maternal care,
and increases in stress. The proposed research will estimate the impact of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs
decision on fertility and maternal and infant health outcomes over time and by subgroups in states that recently
banned or restricted abortion services. We will use high-quality, state-specific monthly data from 2016 through
2024 from several sources, including state birth certificate data compiled nationally by the CDC, Census
Bureau data, and administrative hospitalization data from State Inpatient Databases. For each Aim, we will
estimate the impact of Dobbs on outcomes using a comparative interrupted time series design with control
locations, establishing a strong counterfactual to support causal inference while also accounting for recent
trends (e.g., declining fertility) and perturbations (e.g., COVID-19). For Aims 2 and 3, we will use a difference-
in-difference decomposition approach to determine how much of the observed change in outcomes post-
Dobbs is attributable to shifts in the composition of the birthing population versus changing risks, comparing
restrictive and non-restrictive states. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the impact of the
Dobbs decision on fertility; 2) Determine the impact of the Dobbs decision on severe maternal morbidity; 3)
Assess the impact of the Dobbs decision on infant birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birthweight, and
small for gestational age. This work will address major gaps in the literature regarding the causal impact of
abortion restrictions on population health, in particular post-Dobbs abortion restrictions, for which we currently
have limited knowledge. This research will also determine how anti-abortion policies may especially harm
disadvantaged populations and produce time-sensitive results to inform reproductive health policies in states."

While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the
human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior
remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities,
spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of
present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated
Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to
measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals,
we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively-
parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify
the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop
scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in
establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single-
cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical
challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological
systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to
encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in
Genomics and Systems Biology."

Sleep  disturbances  predict  risk  of  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD).  Sleep-­wake  cycles  critically  regulate  brain 
interstitial  fluid  (ISF)  levels  of  Aβ  and  tau,  two  critical  proteins  that  accumulate  in  AD.  Both  Aβ  and  tau  are 
released  by  neuronal  activity,  which  is  higher  during  wakefulness  than  in  sleep.  Moreover,  sleep  is  a  critical 
phase  during  which  factors  in  the  ISF  are  cleared  from  the  brain.  Therefore,  sleep  disturbances  affect  daily 
function  and  also  contribute  to  disease  progression.  However,  little  is  known  about  which  brain  regions  are 
affected  in AD  to  give  rise  to  sleep  disturbances, making  it difficult  to  identify the  circuit  level  mechanisms that 
drive  dysfunction,  or  to  design  targeted  therapeutic  strategies.  This  project  tests  the  hypothesis  that  the 
thalamic  reticular  nucleus  (TRN)  is  a  critical brain  region  in  AD, and  that  impairments  in  its activity drive  sleep 
disturbances  and  exacerbate  disease  progression.  The  TRN  is  a  major  component  of  the  thalamocortical-­
corticothalamic  network  that  regulates  sleep,  attention,  and  memory,  which are  all  affected  in  AD.  However, 
little  is  known  about  the  state  of  TRN  in  AD  patients  or  in  animal  models.  We  found  that  in  transgenic  mice 
expressing  mutant  human  amyloid  precursor  protein  (APP  mice),  TRN  activity  is  strikingly  reduced,  in  the 
absence  of  cell  loss.  Such  reductions  in  TRN  activity  led  to  sleep  fragmentation  and  reductions  in  slow  wave 
sleep (SWS), and predicted the magnitude of Aβ deposition in both hippocampus and cortex, which may relate 
to the fact that SWS is the phase of sleep during which activity-­dependent production of Aβ is reduced, and Aβ 
is  cleared  from  the  brain.  Moreover,  deficits  in  SWS  and  sleep  maintenance  manifest  early  in  disease  in  APP 
mice,  prior  to  hippocampal  deficits,  suggesting  that  TRN  impairment  may  both  predict  and  contribute  to 
disease  progression.  The  goals  of  this  proposal  are  to  identify  cellular  mechanisms  that  impair  TRN  activity, 
and  test  if  selectively  manipulating  neuronal  activity  in  the  TRN  can normalize  sleep,  reduce Aβ  accumulation, 
and  improve  memory.  To  achieve  these  goals,  in  Aim  1  we  will  use  electrophysiology  and  pharmacology  in 
thalamic  slices to  identify the  intrinsic,  synaptic,  and network properties  of  TRN  that  result  in  its  hypoactivity  in 
APP  mice.  In  Aim 2,  we  will use  DREADDs  to  acutely  activate  TRN  cells  in  APP  mice  to test  if  TRN  activation 
affects  dynamics  of  interstitial  Aβ,  and/or  memory  consolidation.  In  Aim  3,  we  will  use  DREADD-­mediated 
activation  of TRN  in  APP  mice  to  test  if  chronic  activation of  TRN  can normalize  sleep parameters,  reduce Aβ 
accumulation, and improve memory. Results from this project will have major impact because they: 1) highlight 
a  vulnerable network early  in  disease that  may predict  and  contribute to  disease progression,  and 2)  identify a 
novel  therapeutic  strategy  with  potential  to  normalize  sleep,  improve  memory,  and  delay  disease  progression 
in  Alzheimer’s  disease.  Insights  gained  will  also  be  used  to  derive  general  principles  about  the  dynamics  of 
AD-­related proteins like Aβ and tau in the brain, which will impact our ability to treat this complex disease. "

Congenital and acquired craniofacial defects are not uncommon. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been
widely used for the orthopedic repair. However, more extensive use of DBM is limited due to its particulate nature
after demineralization and rapid particle dispersion following irrigation, resulting in unpredictable osteoinductivity.
Viscous excipients are often employed to produce stable suspension of DBM particles, but such carriers are
rapidly dissolved in a body and the localized effect of osteogenic components present in DBM such as bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) may not expect at the defect site. Although exogenous BMPs can be combined
to enhance DBM capacity, its clinical application requires supraphysiological doses and has revealed significant
adverse effects. Thus, there is a need to develop alternative strategies that can enhance the osteogenic potency
of DBM. This study seeks to enhance bone regeneration capacity by incorporating DBM into a self-healing
dynamic polymer network that combines physiological stability and pro-osteogenic properties. Upon BMP
stimulation, BMP efficacy is greatly reduced due to the enhanced expression of natural BMP antagonists such
as noggin. Thus, this study will further enhance the potency of BMPs present in DBM by abrogation of BMP
antagonism through RNA interference for noggin. Cell-derived exosome mimetics (EM) will be applied as a bio-
vector to deliver RNA interference molecules in a localized and efficient manner. The overall objective of this
proposal is to devise a robust bone graft composite that can effectively repair bone defects by integrating DBM
and noggin-silencing EM into polymeric carrier systems. To achieve this goal, we propose three aims. In Aim 1,
we will develop a malleable and self-healing hydrogel based on the self-assembly of phytochemical-grafted
chitosan with silica-rich nanoclays, where the decorated phytochemical drives dynamic intermolecular
interactions for gelation and nanoclay works as physical crosslinker with osteoinductive property. By varying the
ratio of phytochemical to nanoclay and the content of DBM particles, hydrogel/DBM composites will be designed
and prepared by evaluating gelation kinetics, injectability and self-healing characteristics. The osteoinductive
activity of the developed composite will be determined in vitro and in a rat calvarial defect. Next in Aim 2, we will
harvest EM from MSCs transfected with noggin-directed siRNA and evaluate the synergistic effect of EM on
DBM-induced bone formation. We will also conjugate EM to hydrogels via a click crosslinking reaction for more
localized and prolonged noggin silencing effects. Finally in Aim 3, we will integrate DBM and EM loaded with
noggin siRNA into self-healing hydrogels of phytochemical and nanoclay developed from Aim 1 and evaluate
the ability of the bone graft composite to promote bone regeneration in more challenging environments using a
mandibular defect model. Successful bone formation will be evaluated compared with commercial DBM products
and recombinant BMP-2. Successful completion of these studies will identify a new strategy to improve clinical
efficacy of current bone grafting by maximizing activity of BMP signaling in DBM-mediated bone regeneration."

Stroke is the second highest cause of death and the leading cause of disability globally. Intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most prevalent form of stroke with a high mortality of ~40% and high rates of
long-term cognitive decline in surviors.1-4 The B cell response to stroke is well established, and in ischemic
stroke models in mice B cells have been linked to slow cognitive decline.5 However, the B cell response to ICH
is currently unknown and represents a major gap in knowledge. Our preliminary work has demonstrated an
influx of IgA+ B cells into the brain starting 8 weeks post-ICH, similar to the IgA+ B cell aggregates in the brain
and spinal cord in multiple sclerosis patients and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse
models.8 While IgA+ B cells are traditionally associated with mucosal tissues like the small intestine, their
presence in the CNS is spurring new inquiry into the function of these cells in the context of neuroinflammation.
I hypothesize that there is a late influx of IgA+ B cells from the meninges into the brain post-ICH that
serves a neuroprotective role in post-stroke recovery. The goal of this project is to utilize a murine
collagenase injection model of ICH to elucidate the origin and function of brain-infiltrating IgA+ B cells in post-
ICH inflammation and recovery in the following aims. Aim 1. To determine the timing of the IgA+ B cell influx
into the post-ICH brain over 16 weeks, investigate whether these cells are locally proliferating or constantly
recruited, determine whether tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) exist in the post-ICH brain, and identify the
brain regions IgA+ B cells localize to. Aim 2. To elucidate the origin of brain-infiltrating IgA+ B cells post-ICH
using both meningeal plasma cell depletion and clonal analysis of B cells from blood, gut, meninges, and brain
B cells using B cell receptor sequences generated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Aim 3. To determine the
effector functions of brain-infiltrating IgA+ B cells on post-ICH recovery. These experiments will provide much
needed insight on the role of B cells in the brain in the weeks and months after ICH, and specifically on IgA in
the context of stroke and neuroinflammation more broadly. My results therefore have the potential to shape our
understanding of the adaptive immune response to ICH and inform therapeutic approaches to mitigate the
long-term effects of this disease on patients and families."

A central goal of biological research is to understand how the diversity seen throughout fauna is generated, and
how changes in environment and ecology lead to phenotypic differences. Naturally occurring genetic variation
has instrumental roles in driving phenotypic differences, both in the cases of adaptive changes seen across
evolution, but also in pathological underpinnings of human disease. Indeed, today it is well accepted that genetic
architecture has a fundamental role in disease susceptibility. Model organisms have been essential to our
understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying biological processes, yet our understanding of naturally
occurring genetic variation impacts trait differences and disease susceptibility is limited. A central impediment to
addressing this question is the lack of a model system with naturally occurring differences that is also amendable
to genetic and experimental manipulation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus has been a powerful tool for
addressing how naturally occurring genetic variation alters phenotypes. The model has two distinctly different
forms: There are surface dwelling fish that live in above-ground rivers and streams and have functional visual
systems and pigmentation, contrasting with at least 30 cave-restricted populations which are blind and albino.
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of genetic tools introduced in the system, the number of
phenotypes that are being studied, and the number of labs world-wide that are utilizing this model. Today,
Astyanax is a model for eye degeneration, sleep loss, stress, aggression, metabolism and insulin resistance.
The Astyanax International meeting is a biennial meeting that brings the group of researchers using Astyanax
and other non-traditional aquatic models together to discuss the latest progress in biological research and to set
the direction for the subsequent 2 years. The 4-day meeting draws an international crowd with groups coming
from North and Central America, Europe, and Asia. The 8th biennial meeting will be held in South Florida in Fort
Lauderdale. South Florida is a prime venue due to its large size, ease of access with two major international
airports, and multiple options for the venue. The meeting will be open registration, and we expect 90-100
attendees; The last Astyanax International meeting held in San Antonio in 2022 had 70 attendees, and we expect
that this number will increase as COVID concerns have largely subsided. The meeting will feature two keynote
speakers and over 30 (36 in total) speakers chosen from submitted abstracts. The meeting will also feature a
poster session, and short ‘lighting talks.” All talks (not including Keynote speakers) will be the same amount of
time, and we will focus providing opportunities for junior PIs and trainees to speak. This will give opportunity to
a wide range of students and scientists at different stages of their careers to feature their work. A central focus
of this Astyanax meeting will be on enhancing and promoting diversity, especially for underrepresented groups
(URM) from Mexico and Latin America. Financial support is being requested to help offset registration and other
costs for these URMs. Other costs will be paid from registration fees and vendor donations."

This proposal seeks continued support to expand a powerful new health equity resource, the National Couples’
Health and Time Use Study (NCHAT). NCHAT is the only population-representative study (N = 3,642 ages 20-
60) with large subsamples of sexual and gender diverse (SGD; 45%) and racially and ethnically diverse (RED;
38%) coupled adults fielded during the pandemic with comprehensive measurement including groundbreaking
state and county structural racism, sexism, and cis heterosexism measures. The COVID-19 pandemic and the
co-occurring period of intense racial trauma exacerbated and laid bare the health inequities experienced by RED
and SGD populations in the US. Attacks on the SGD and RED populations are ongoing with alarming numbers
of targeted harmful policies. Health disparities for RED and SGD populations are preventable, and identifying
their social determinants and underlying mechanisms is urgent. Aim 1. Reinterview and refresh the NCHAT
sample. We propose to collect four additional waves of survey data and two waves of time diary and experience
sampling method data. These short and frequent surveys allow flexibility with the inclusion of new content
tracking the impacts of period shocks, such as COVID-19 or the aftermath of racial trauma, and the factors that
exacerbate or mitigate these impacts during an era of growing mental health crises. As nearly 30% of individuals
in their twenties identify as SGD, a refresher and oversample to include 300 new respondents will be added.
Aim 2. Open the NCHAT panel so a diverse body of health equity scholars drive question content. Current
population data infrastructure on health disparities is outmoded because 1) only select researchers decide on
survey content and 2) a focus on repeated measurement can stymie innovation. Working with our inclusive
advisory board, we seek to upend this system and ignite cutting-edge research with the inclusion of items
contributed by health equity scholars across disciplines and institutions. These data will be rapidly released. Aim
3. Assess SGD trajectories of mental health in an era of escalating threats to SGD families. We will test
vulnerabilities (structural and interpersonal discrimination and SES); strengths (social support, SGD
socialization, identity centrality); and family functioning as mechanistic predictors during a period of growing anti-
LGBTQ+ bills. Aim 4. Examine RED trajectories of mental health with a focus on recovery and
deterioration. We will evaluate how couple stability and relationship functioning, social and community support,
and structural and interpersonal experiences of discrimination act as mediators and moderators of trajectories
of mental health in the wake of the pandemic and continuing racial trauma. Without longitudinal data and flexible
measurement, scientific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying RED and SGD disparities will be stymied.
This multi-disciplinary team is deeply invested and committed to ameliorating health disparities for RED and
SGD populations. It is crucial that we expeditiously follow-up on these vulnerable populations and give voice to
a broad range of scholars seeking health equity for all."

As the most common malignancy of the urinary tract among men and women, bladder cancer is estimated to

carcinoma has a dismal survival rate of approximately 5% in the metastatic setting. APOBEC3A (A3A) and
APOBEC3B (A3B) are members of a family of cytidine deaminase enzymes that catalyze the removal of an
amino group from cytosine nucleotides generating a uracil in its place that serve as a source of mutations. A3A
and A3B enzymes are commonly overexpressed in numerous cancer types, including urothelial carcinoma,
with the APOBEC mutation signature seen in most cases of this cancer type. Due to their mutagenic activity,
A3A and A3B have been implicated in altering the genomic landscape of urothelial carcinoma tumors over
time. These alterations have the potential to augment tumor cell clonality that can lead to an enrichment of
cells that are refractory to treatment and drive disease progression. Currently, it is unclear if both A3A and A3B
drive APOBEC-induced mutagenesis, or if one enzyme plays a larger mutagenic role than the other. This
proposal seeks the address the hypothesis that A3A and A3B enzymes differ in mutagenic activity leading to
differences in promotion of intratumoral heterogeneity and response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade
inhibition. To address this hypothesis, two mouse bladder cancer cell lines entitled BBN963 and BBN976, that
are representative of human muscle invasive bladder cancer, will be developed to express either HA-epitope
tagged A3A or A3B, in a doxycycline inducible manner. Utilization of this model will allow for a direct
comparison of A3A and A3B induced mutagenic activity, tumor cell clonality diversification, and modulation of
response to treatment. Experiments detailed in Aim 1 will elucidate the driver of the APOBEC mutational
signatures in urothelial carcinoma using in-vitro assays to analyze the predicted target sequences of
APOBEC3 enzymes. Subsequently, Aim 2 will use DNA barcoding technology to compare the promotion of
intratumoral heterogeneity by A3A and A3B. Lastly, Aim 3 will determine the influence of A3A and A3B on
treatment response to anti-PD-1 therapy and the role these enzymes play in altering the tumor-immune
microenvironment utilizing an in-vivo approach. Completion of the work outlined in these aims will result in the
identification of the driver of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in urothelial carcinoma and highlight a potential target for
inhibition for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockade in patients with elevated APOBEC3
mutagenic activity."

In the US, 42.4% of the adults are classified as obese. Obesity associated metabolic diseases, including type 2
diabetes (T2D), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive stage nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), severely impact human quality of life and mortality. Current anti-obese and diabetic drugs are often
associated with different side effects, and currently there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
drugs for NAFLD/NASH. The long-term goal is to meet this critical unmet need for innovative novel
pharmacological therapies with improved safety profiles and durable treatment effects for obesity and its
complications. Bile acids (BAs) play important roles in regulating lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism.
CYP8B1, is exclusively expressed in the liver and it functions specifically to control the ratio of 12α-
hydroxylated (OH)/non-12α-OH BAs in the-BA pool. CYP8B1 deficiency leads to reduction 12α-OH)/non-12α-
OH BAs ratio, resulting in metabolically beneficial effects including weight loss, ameliorated fatty liver and
inflammation, with insulin sensitivity, in mice and humans. The central hypothesis is that CYP8B1-specific
inhibitors may provide a unique pharmacological approach to treat obesity and related metabolic diseases. The
rationale for the proposed research is that no CYP8B1-specific inhibitors exist and the lack of high-throughput
screening (HTS) methods hinders the identification of CYP8B1-specific inhibitors. The objective of this grant
application is to develop strategies for CYP8B1 inhibition by identifying potent CYP8B1-specific inhibitors to
pharmacologically alleviate metabolic disorders in mouse disease models. We have established a high-
throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify and optimize CYP8B1-specific inhibitors with potent in vivo
efficacy in metabolic disease models toward drug development. The HTS was implemented for a ~45,000-
compound library that led to the identification of potent, specific CYP8B1 inhibitors with biochemical and
functional validation. Most importantly, we found that a lead CYP8B1 inhibitor compound that displayed strong
efficacy in inhibiting CYP8B1 in vivo. The novel HTS-assay and the identified candidate CYP8B1-inhibitors will
be used to test two Specific Aims: 1) identification and characterization of CYP8B1-specific inhibitors; and 2)
Determination of CYP8B1-specific inhibitor therapeutic effects in metabolic disease models. The completion of
this grant proposal will help us generate first-in-class candidates for drug development. The results will
positively impact efforts to improve obesity, T2D and NAFLD/NASH clinical outcomes."

Rhythmic fluctuations of electrical activity in the brain are frequently observed during cognitive tasks. In many
cases these oscillations are synchronized across brain regions. Synchronization in the gamma-frequency (~30-
100 Hz) range has been hypothesized to promote communication between brain regions, thereby facilitating
cognitive functions. Conversely, deficits in gamma synchrony have been hypothesized to contribute to
cognitive deficits at the heart of schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and related disorders. However, whether
gamma synchrony actually contributes to brain function remains highly controversial. The specific circuit-level
mechanisms through which gamma synchrony acts are also unclear. This proposal will take advantage of two
recent developments in our laboratory. First, we have developed a new method for analyzing signals from
genetically encoded voltage indicators in order to quantify changes in gamma synchrony within freely behaving
mice. Second, using this method and optogenetics, we have found that interhemispheric gamma synchrony
between parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex plays a key role when mice learn new cue-
reward associations. We hypothesize that: 1) gamma-frequency activity in PV interneurons entrains activity in
prefrontal neurons which project to specific targets; 2) the activity of these projection neurons encodes key
information related to learning; 3) thus, gamma-frequency synchronization allows prefrontal output to converge
constructively in specific downstream targets, facilitating the transmission of critical task-relevant information
across an extended prefrontal network that mediates learning. This proposal will test these hypotheses by
studying whether gamma synchrony is transmitted from prefrontal PV interneurons to various classes of
prefrontal projection neurons which encode task-relevant information and/or to downstream regions. We will
then construct a computational model to test which hypothesized functions of gamma synchrony are consistent
with our experimental observations. This will reveal circuit-level mechanisms whereby gamma synchrony is
transmitted across neural networks in ways that can facilitate inter-regional communication and learning."

10839059,"This proposal aims to develop an effective therapy to achieve HIV remission by improving the magnitude,
breadth, and function of anti-viral CD8 T cells and reducing viral reservoirs using the SIV/macaque model.
Dysfunctional anti-HIV immunity and the persistence of viral reservoirs represent two major issues that must be
addressed by therapeutic approaches targeting functional cure for HIV. We believe that these two issues can be
addressed effectively using a combination of vaccination and inhibiting the programmed death-1 co-inhibitory
pathway (PD-1 blockade). Accordingly, during the past 9 years of this R37, we invested major efforts to
comprehensively define the influence of the timing of PD-1 blockade at different stages of chronic SIV infection
and during anti-retroviral therapy (ART) on restoring CD8 T cell function and diminishing viral reservoirs. We also
tested the influence of combining PD-1 blockade with vaccination. These results showed that a combination of
therapeutic vaccination under ART and PD-1 blockade post analytical treatment interruption (ATI) leads to a
profound control of reemerging viremia with some animals suppressing viremia to below the level of detection
for up to 24 weeks. These results demonstrated the utility of this combination approach towards achieving HIV
remission. Our recent data in mice showed that the addition of IL-2 cytokine therapy to PD-1 blockade markedly
enhances the induction of highly functional effector cells and modulates their differentiation program leading to
better control of LCMV infection. Based on these exciting results, we propose to improve the therapeutic potential
of PD-1 blockade by combining it with IL-2 cytokine therapy. We propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the safety and therapeutic efficacy of a combination of PD-1 blockade and IL-2 cytokine therapy post
ATI in SIV infected and vaccinated macaques. In Aim 2, we will define the heterogeneity of exhausted CD8 T
cells during chronic SIV infection and define how PD-1 blockade with and without IL-2 will modify the T cell
exhaustion program. In Aim 3, we will test if an improved therapeutic vaccine combined with PD-1 blockade plus
IL-2 therapy can enhance control of reemerging SIV viremia. This will be a collaborative effort between Amara
(Emory), Ahmed (Emory), and Freeman (Harvard) laboratories. All three labs have worked together for over 15
years to optimize the PD-1 blockade to treat chronic SIV infection. By the completion of these aims, we hope to
develop potent immunotherapy to achieve profound and sustained control of SIV infection in the absence of ART
therapy."

Current estimates project that roughly one in six new HIV infections in East and Southern Africa, where the
majority of all incident HIV infections occur, are among key populations; including sex workers and their partners
among others. In Uganda, HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) is about 35%. Male clients of
FSWs are a high-risk group for HIV infection, yet are unware of their HIV status and are a hidden population.
Secondary distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits by women (including FSW) to their male partners has
shown to be a promising strategy for increasing male testing including couple testing, HIV disclosure status and
safer sexual behaviors. In addition, WHO recently recognized HIVST as an “important tool” to generate demand
for PrEP for populations with low access to health facilities such as male clients of FSW. However, there is little
evidence on how HIVST affects PrEP uptake, adherence and persistence, particularly among male clients of
FSWs We propose to develop and pilot test an intervention (Kayungirizi) which will involve secondary distribution
of HIVST by FSW to their male clients as an entry point to generate demand for PrEP, followed by an FSW-led
intervention to address ongoing structural, interpersonal, and individual-level barriers (convenience,
confidentiality/stigma, flexibility) to promote PrEP initiation, adherence, and persistence among male clients of
FSWs in Kampala, Uganda. Our aims are to; i) Create the proposed Kayungirizi (“to connect”) intervention to
promote PrEP initiation and persistence among male clients of FSW through qualitative research informing
adaptation and integration of components of local models and evidence-based care engagement interventions.
We will conduct qualitative research with male clients, FSW, and other stakeholders to elicit their feedback on
the intervention and understand their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators for PrEP initiation and
persistence, and preferences and barriers regarding oral vs long-acting injectable PrEP. ii) Conduct an initial
(stage 1a) small pilot of the intervention and refine it in preparation for the stage 1b pilot trial. iii) Determine
acceptability, feasibility, and safety of the intervention and preliminary estimates of the potential for the
intervention, compared to the control, to promote PrEP initiation, adherence, and persistence among male clients
of FSW (stage 1b). We will randomize geographic areas to the intervention or a control consisting of vouchers
for free HIVST pick-up from a clinic and referrals for PrEP and enroll 140 male clients (70 per arm) across
clusters. We will assess outcomes at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Study findings will be used to guide a
subsequent R01 proposal to test the intervention in a larger clinical trial."

 The impact of infections transmitted by mosquitoes is global. Arboviral diseases such as dengue,
chikungunya, and Zika are a significant health concern due to the expanding geographical range of many
mosquito species. Emphasis on disease surveillance systems is central to evaluate the effectiveness of primary
and secondary dengue prevention methods and strategies, including the introduction of dengue vaccines and
new vector control methods. In the current application, the study team will address specific and fundamental
gaps in the diagnosis and clinical management of dengue and other acute febrile illnesses (AFI); ultimately,
evaluating the efficacy of vector control strategies in reducing the incidence of arbovirus infection through a
combination of both clinic- and community-based surveillance systems. The study team’s long-term goal is to
mitigate arboviral and other AFI disease burdens by improving diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention
strategies. The study’s central hypothesis is that arbovirus infections and AFI disease surveillance, through the
continuation of SEDSS and COPA, will promote evidence-driven public health policy decisions and reduce the
burden of disease. The rationale for the current study is that understanding the etiology, epidemiology, and
severity of arboviral diseases will allow the United States to be better prepared and respond to critical vector-
borne disease outbreaks. The study team will test the central hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Explore the natural history of dengue and arboviral infections and other acute febrile illnesses in their differential
diagnosis to understand their epidemiology, spectrum of disease, and outcomes to provide recommendations
for diagnosis and clinical management, and; 2) Define the correlates of risk and protection of arbovirus
transmission in the setting of vector-reduction strategies. Under Specific Aim 1, the team will strengthen hospital
surveillance of acute febrile illness (AFI) and maintain an AFI platform for conducting clinical research. For
Specific Aim 2, the team will maintain a community-based cohort to assess the incidence and prevalence of
arboviral infection, as well as, evaluate the incidence, prevalence, and etiology of other AFIs in selected
communities. Central to both aims is the establishment of a data management system and the continuation of
strengthening collaborations with the local government, community leaders, and other stakeholders to ensure
continuity of the established program. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to deliver
robust and broad knowledge regarding the epidemiologic patterns of common arboviral diseases in the context
of other AFI of the present and those that may emerge in the geographical setting. Such results provide evidence-
based responses to critical questions regarding dengue (and other arboviruses) diagnosis, immune response,
and clinical management. Also, the community-based system will be central to evaluate the efficacy of vector
control strategies in reducing the incidence of arboviral diseases in humans and assessing its potential use
among other populations."

The DNA replication machinery is constantly challenged by impediments that stall the replication fork. Replication
stress and stalled forks are a major source of genomic instability, which underlies a number of diseases including
cancer. Replication-repair pathways known as the replication stress response serve to stabilize and restart
damaged forks. However, the molecular mechanisms of these pathways are poorly understood, in part because
of a dearth of structural information for the proteins involved. Our long term goal is to understand the molecular
mechanisms of the replication stress response and how the pathways are interconnected to ensure faithful
completion of DNA replication. Our strategy is to couple structural information of the enzymes and multi-protein
complexes operating at the replication-repair interface with their biochemistry and cellular functions. We are
currently focused on three poorly understood activities at stalled forks—(1) fork reversal and template switching
as a mechanism to stabilize damaged forks and restart replication, (2) protection of labile abasic (AP) sites from
strand cleavage or mutagenic bypass, and (3) priming of DNA synthesis. Fork reversal by the ATP-dependent
DNA translocases HLTF, SMARCAL1, and ZRANB3 involves remodeling of stalled fork into four-way junctions
to prevent fork collapse and facilitate replication restart. Our work will address critical gaps in knowledge related
to how these enzymes provide unique repair activities at damaged forks, their mechanisms of fork reversal, and
how the ubiquitin ligase and DNA remodeling activities of HLTF are coordinated and regulate fork reversal in
cells. Secondly, we are working to understand how the SOS Response Associated Peptidase (SRAP) protein
HMCES forms a stable DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) with AP sites in ssDNA as a means to protect them from
error-prone polymerases and nucleases during replication. AP sites are the most abundant form of DNA damage
and thus it is critical that we understand how cells deal with these potent replication blocks. Our recent structure
of a SRAP DPC forms the basis for further experiments to understand the chemical biology behind this novel
repair pathway. Third, DNA polymerase α-primase (pol-prim) is a core component of the eukaryotic replisome
that initiates de novo DNA synthesis at every Okazaki fragment by synthesizing RNA-DNA primers of defined
length. Despite the importance of this critical activity at the replication fork, its mechanism of action is unknown.
We are addressing this gap in knowledge by trapping complexes of pol-prim with relevant nucleic acid substrates
and intermediates at various stages of its catalytic cycle and visualizing conformational states by electron
microscopy and biophysical approaches. Fundamental knowledge of the conformational dynamics that occur in
pol-prim during de novo DNA synthesis will be the first step toward understanding the coordination of enzymatic
activities at stalled forks."
10856068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming stand as two noteworthy cancer hallmarks. Lineage
plasticity, in particular, has been recognized as a key mechanism that enables cancer cells to evade targeted
therapies. Prostate cancer (PCa), especially its most aggressive form, metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC), exemplifies lineage plasticity-based resistance to Androgen Receptor (AR) targeted therapies.
This resistance significantly constrains patient clinical outcomes, rendering mCRPC incurable, underscoring the
critical demand for elucidating the mechanisms of resistance and identifying actionable therapeutic targets to
overcome resistance. We identified ZNF397 as a pivotal coactivator for AR expression, essential for the
transcriptional program governing AR-driven luminal lineage in various cancers. ZNF397 deficiency, a prevalent
event observed in 25-40% of PCa patients, enables the transition of cancer cells from an AR-driven luminal
lineage to a TET2-driven lineage plastic state, consequently leading to AR therapy resistance. Preliminary results
also suggest that both genetic and pharmaceutical inactivation of TET2 eradicates AR targeted therapy
resistance, highlighting TET2 as a potential therapeutic target to combat AR targeted therapy resistance in
advanced PCa, including mCRPC. Therefore, the Overall Objective of this study is to comprehensively decipher
the molecular mechanism of ZNF397-deficiency in promoting lineage plasticity and AR-targeted therapy
resistance, with a goal to develop innovative therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance and benefit patients
suffering from this devastating disease. We proposed three aims to test the hypothesis that the frequently
observed ZNF397-deficiency is a molecular driver that promotes the transition of cancer cells from an AR-driven
luminal lineage state to a TET2-driven lineage plastic state, which subsequently becomes non-responsive to AR-
targeted therapy. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively assess the effect of ZNF397-deficiency in PCa
tumorigenesis, therapy responsiveness and lineage plasticity, using our uniquely generated GEMM with
ZNF397-KO, as well as single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular
mechanism of TET2-driven epigenetic rewiring and lineage plasticity in ZNF397-deficient PCa. In Aim 3, we will
assess the predictive potency of ZNF397 expression as a biomarker for AR targeted therapy response and
examine the efficacy of two novel strategies to overcome resistance in ZNF397-deficient tumors: TET2 inhibitors
and ZNF397-DUBTACs. The proposed aims will capitalize on our laboratory's expertise and that of our
collaborators to comprehensively define the molecular function of ZNF397. Completion of this project will not
only refine our understanding of the mechanisms propelling AR-targeted therapy resistance but also lead to a
new predictive biomarker and two innovative therapeutic strategies to combat this lethal complication of modern
targeted therapies, thereby improving the clinical outcomes for patients."

Renal cancer is a source of severe mortality and morbidity, not only due to the primary malignancy but also due
to loss of renal function (sometimes leading to chronic kidney disease) after partial nephrectomy. Methods to
noninvasively monitor renal function and predict its robustness against this decline of function are therefore in
high demand. Diffusion-weighted MRI is well poised to play this role as an adjunct to renal cancer patients'
existing clinical MR workup. Our group has been at the forefront of research into advanced renal diffusion MRI
contrast, including methods to separate microstructure from microcirculation (intravoxel incoherent motion
(IVIM)) and assess microscopic anisotropy (diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). A recent comprehensive approach
(REFMAP) collects these contrasts jointly, allowing assessment of microstructural and microcirculation
anisotropy. We propose to apply this composite dataset both to classify aggressiveness of the primary renal
lesion and to assess and predict post-surgical renal function.
IVIM-MRI will be performed to characterize the aggressiveness of the primary lesion. The REFMAP-MRI protocol
will be used to evaluate renal cancer patients before surgery and at 1 year follow up, in comparison with standard
clinical workup (measured glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria). Cross-sectional correlation will validate the
markers of the REFMAP-MRI technique as probes of renal function, and those baseline values predicting which
patients experience renal function decline will be identified."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), accounting for 90% of all pancreatic cancers, is among the
deadliest, due largely to late-stage diagnosis and the aggressive nature of the disease. The critical challenge
lies in early detection, which is currently not viable for the general population due to low annual incidence and a
significant risk of false positives even with highly specific tests. While current risk assessment tools rely on static
factors such as age, obesity, and diabetes, recent studies suggest the potential for imaging biomarkers derived
from pre-cancerous computed tomography (CT) scans to predict PDAC. Our project aims to develop a
comprehensive and scalable risk prediction model that fuses imaging and non-imaging data to enable early
detection of PDAC in asymptomatic individuals. The model, termed ""PRECISE"" (PancREas Cancer multImodal
riSk prEdiction), will employ novel algorithmic adversarial debiasing techniques to ensure fairness, meaning it
should perform accurately across different demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. In Aim 1, we will develop
deep learning models that segment imaging biomarkers from abdominal CTs, applying adversarial debiasing to
ensure fair representation across diverse patient factors and image acquisition techniques. Validation will be
done using data from Mayo Clinic, Cornell University, and UCSF. Aim 2 involves the creation of the PRECISE
fusion model. It will combine imaging biomarkers from CTs with clinical data from electronic medical records
(EMRs) to predict the risk of PDAC. We will employ a graph neural network model to capture the semantic
relations between multimodal data. The model's prognostic performance will be compared with baseline models.
In Aim 3, we plan to deploy and evaluate the PRECISE model prospectively across disparate geographical sites.
The model's performance will be assessed by comparing its predictions with patient outcomes collected at
regular intervals. This proposal's overall goal is to create a fair and effective PDAC risk prediction tool, PRECISE,
that leverages both imaging and non-imaging data to calculate unbiased risk estimates. If successful, our
scalable automated risk stratification could potentially transform PDAC early detection, enabling opportunistic
screening for patients undergoing routine abdominopelvic CT scans for non-pancreatic cancer indications. This
could significantly improve PDAC survival rates by enabling earlier intervention and treatment."
10861747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An estimated 50-70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder, which is commonly comorbid with many
psychiatric illnesses, such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). Individuals with AUD frequently report insomnia, and
sleep difficulty significantly increases the likelihood of relapse. Despite the overwhelming need to control sleep
disturbances to aid in the prevention of relapse, the underlying physiology of wakefulness, particularly in the
context of acute and chronic alcohol use, is not well understood. The brain’s noradrenergic system mediates
many behavioral states, such as arousal, alertness, and stress. Acute and chronic alcohol exposure
differentially alter the activity of noradrenergic neurons as well as the release, synthesis, and turnover of
norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. Recently, our lab alongside collaborators delineated a novel arousal circuit
from the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) to dopaminergic neurons in the ventral periaqueductal gray
(vPAGDA), where stimulation of this circuit promotes wakefulness. Acute ethanol exposure also increases
excitatory drive and the activity of wake-promoting vPAGDA neurons; however, the mechanism is unknown.
Specific activation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors (α1ARs) increases excitatory drive onto vPAGDA neurons and
subsequently causes arousal. Interestingly, α1AR expression is particularly enriched on vPAG astrocytes, and
activation of astrocytic Gq signaling is sufficient to promote wakefulness. While astrocytes are essential in
mediating synaptic transmission in other brain regions through purinergic signaling, the role of neuron-
astrocyte interactions in the vPAG during ethanol exposure requires further investigation. This F30 aims to
test the central hypothesis that purinergic transmission from neighboring astrocytes mediates the
noradrenergic modulation of vPAGDA neurons, and that ethanol potentiates this signaling. The goal is to
elucidate the mechanistic details mediating the increase in excitatory drive onto the wake-promoting vPAGDA
neurons by activation of α1ARs and the pathologic changes to the noradrenergic system following acute and
chronic alcohol exposure. In Specific Aim 1 I will utilize pharmacological and viral genetic approaches
combined with ex vivo fluorescence imaging and whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the
neuron-astrocyte interactions underlying noradrenergic modulation of vPAGDA neurons. In Specific Aim 2 I will
use similar approaches in addition to a mouse model of chronic intermittent ethanol exposure to determine the
changes in synaptic transmission onto vPAGDA neurons following acute and chronic ethanol exposure. The
results of these studies will allow our lab, our collaborators, and others to further investigate the role of neuron-
astrocyte physiology related to sleep dysfunction in alcohol use disorder. This will further the work towards
identifying possible therapeutic targets for the development of novel therapies to alleviate disordered sleeping
and aid in relapse prevention."
10861750,"Although advances have been made in the treatment of cancer, therapy is inadequate for many patients, and it
is projected that there will be over 607,000 cancer deaths in the US in 2019. Many of these deaths will result
from cancers that develop as solid tumors, which are particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy or with
biological drugs. Sub-optimal efficacy of anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and antibody-drug conjugates
(ADC) has been explained, in part, by poor uptake and distribution of these agents within solid tumors.
Pathophysiologic characteristics of solid tumors include their chaotic cellular growth, dense extracellular
matrices, poor and disorganized vascularization, decreased lymphangiogenesis, and high interstitial fluid
pressure. These characteristics limit the convective and diffusive transport of mAb and ADC within tumors,
leading to poor and heterogeneous intra-tumoral distribution. This proposal tests three new platform strategies
designed to improve the selectivity and efficacy of anti-cancer monoclonal antibody-based therapy by enhancing
the distribution of mAb and ADCs within solid tumors. Aim #1 introduces a novel strategy for overcoming the
“binding-site barrier” within tumors through transient inhibition of antibody binding to antigen, as achieved co-
administration of anti-idiotypic agents that allow short-term and reversible antagonism of mAb binding. Aim #2
will investigate the use of antibodies with pH-dependent, “catch-and-release” binding to bypass the catabolic
sink associated with receptor-mediated endocytosis of anti-cancer mAb. In Aim #3, targeted delivery of matrix-
modulating enzymes will be employed to achieve selective depletion of collagen in tumors, and to enable
improved intra-tumoral distribution of mAb and ADC. Each aim is strongly supported by mechanistic
mathematical modeling and by preliminary data demonstrating utility and feasibility. Pharmacokinetics, efficacy,
and safety of optimized anti-HER2 mAb and ADC therapy will be assessed using mouse models of HER2-
positive human cancer. The novel agents developed in this work may be suitable for immediate translation toward
optimization of trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric
cancer patients. Additionally, the approaches introduced in this proposal may be extended for use in optimizing
therapy with all mAb and ADC applied to the treatment of solid tumors, potentially providing benefit to hundreds
of thousands of patients."

Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) benefit from specialized services throughout their lifespan.
However, autism assessment, treatment, and care are bottlenecked by clinician availability. While it is
important to continue to seek to expand the ASD-healthcare workforce, recent efforts have begun to assess
alternative approaches such as crowdsourcing and computational methods for their potential to accelerate and
increase accessibility to the diagnostic and therapeutic process. The development and evaluation of these
methods requires access to rich data on children with ASD, specifically, audiovisual recordings, i.e., videos.
However, videos contain identifiable information: the face and voice of the child. Our long-term goal is to
address the technical challenge of protecting facial and vocal identity for child subjects while enabling access
to rich data to improve our understanding of ASD and expand availability of treatment and care. Our current
objective is to elucidate the privacy-utility tradeoffs for three approaches to privatization in the use case context
of behavioral assessment of children. The premise of this study is that recent strides in generative models and
adversarial machine learning have yielded deep neural network architectures that can modify faces and voices
to change identity; however, these architectures have been developed and tested for contexts that involve
typically developing adults. We hypothesize that these architectures can be adapted to privatize video
recordings of children with ASD while retaining information essential to the quantification of ASD-associated
behaviors. The significance of this study comes from the value of adapting the neural network models
appropriately and specifically to the autism context as this requires the preservation of attributes that would not
have an equally high importance in other use case contexts. In this proposal, we will (1) generate a rich multi-
camera, multi-microphone dataset of children (5-12 years old) undergoing behavioral assessment for autism,
(2) determine the impact of adaptations on the efficacy of anonymization relative to baseline implementations
for three classes of anonymization methods, (3) evaluate how well ASD-associated behaviors are preserved
during the privatization process for the purpose of upcoming approaches to aid the diagnostic process,
specifically, crowdsourced assessments and computational assessments, and (4) conduct user centered co-
design to surface guidelines on making a privatization toolkit easy to use for parents and clinicians. The
outcome of this study will be a framework for evaluating facial and vocal anonymization in the context of
children with ASD, development of a rich and annotated shareable video research dataset for computational or
behavioral investigation, evaluation of specific methods that can make rich, diverse, heterogenous data more
easily available to the autism community, and development of practical, usable workflows for anonymization for
care providers. More generally, this study will pave the way for worry-free video data sharing for mental health."
10828013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neurons and endocrine cells release signaling molecules through Ca2+‐triggered exocytosis. Ca2+ enters a nerve
terminal or endocrine cell, binds to a Ca2+ sensor protein, and triggers the fusion of vesicle and plasma membranes to
expel neurotransmitters and hormones. To investigate the mechanisms of exocytosis our research focuses on fusion
pores and Ca2+. Ca2+ triggers the opening and evolution of the fusion pore; the fusion pore is an aqueous passage
between the vesicle interior and cell exterior. All secreted molecules pass through a fusion pore, which is strategically
situated to exert finely tuned control over secretion. We use biophysical techniques to probe fusion pores at the
single‐pore level, track their transitions, and monitor their responses to biological signals. Studies of the fusion pore
have given us valuable insights into the roles of specific proteins in the control of exocytosis. We showed that SNARE
protein transmembrane domains alter flux through initial fusion pores in both endocrine and synaptic exocytosis. We
have made important advances in understanding the nascent fusion pores of endocrine exocytosis, but progress has
been slow in understanding endocrine fusion pore expansion, and how fusion pores impact synaptic transmission.
Innovations from this laboratory have created opportunities to take on these new challenges. Project 1. We have
developed a new method for analyzing amperometric recordings to probe the dynamics of late‐stage endocrine fusion
pores. This method tracks fusion pore permeability as vesicles lose catecholamine, and led to the novel findings that a
fusion pore sequentially expands, contracts, and settles into a metastable state. We will use measurements of late‐
stage fusion pores to address long‐standing questions about the biological control of secretion. We will probe late‐
stage fusion pores for control by lipid bilayer elasticity, Ca2+, synaptotagmins, and synaptophysin/dynamin. Project 2.
To study synaptic fusion pores we developed a co‐culture system with neurons and HEK293 cells expressing 4
postsynaptic proteins, neuroligin 1, GluA2, stargazin, and PSD95. These HEK cells serve as sensors of synaptic release,
yielding miniature synaptic current data of exceptional quality in which fusion pore contributions are more clearly
resolved. In parallel with Project 1, we will use HEK cell‐neuron co‐cultures to determine how synaptic fusion pores are
controlled by bilayer elasticity, Ca2+, synaptotagmins, and synaptophysin/dynamin. The results on endocrine and
synaptic fusion pores will be synthesized into a comprehensive framework for regulated secretion. We will then adapt
this co‐culture system to the study of synaptic kiss‐and‐run and presynaptic contributions to synaptic plasticity. Project
3. We will adapt HEK cell synaptic sensors to the study of synaptic release from neurons derived from human stem
cells. Collaborators have been recruited to provide neurons, which we will use to evaluate synaptic release and fusion
pores in Down syndrome, fragile X mental retardation, aging, Parkinson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis complex. This
work will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis, illuminate its molecular control, and show us
how synaptic release goes awry in diseases."

 Bacteroides spp. are Gram-negative, gut commensals that comprise ~40% of the human gut microbiota.
Previous studies have shown that Bacteroides spp. produce large quantities of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)
believed to shape the enteric landscape. Bacteroides OMVs have been shown to modulate host immunity and
function as “public goods” to digest dietary and host glycans. However, the physiological relevance of
Bacteroides OMVs in the gut remains controversial because the mechanism by which OMVs are produced in
Gram-negative bacteria is currently unknown. To begin unraveling the mechanism of OMV biogenesis in
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), I designed a system to enable the identification of Bt mutants with altered
OMV production. This was achieved by developing an OMV reporter consisting of BACOVA_04502 (Inulinase,
INL), a protein previously found to be enriched in Bt OMVs, fused to Nanoluciferase (Nluc). Once constructed, I
used my reporter strain to conduct a transposon mutagenesis screen to identify genes that modulate OMV
biogenesis. Given that INL-Nluc is almost exclusively present in OMVs, mutants displaying abnormal levels of
Nluc activity corresponded to mutants producing abnormal levels of OMVs. While screening, I identified four
independent transposon mutants in the gene BT_4721. I demonstrate that BTΔ4721 produces significantly more
OMVs than the wild type (WT). BT_4721 is annotated as an OMP_b-brl_2 domain-containing protein of unknown
function and is encoded in an operon with a putative extracytoplasmic function (ECF)-type sigma factor,
BT_4720. ECF-type sigma factors are a family of transcriptional regulators that modulate gene expression in
response to extracytoplasmic signals. These are typically encoded adjacent to their cognate anti-sigma factor,
which negatively regulates the activity of the sigma factor. Indeed, disruption of BT_4720 reverts the phenotype
of BT∆4721. Structural analyses predict that BT_4721 encodes an eight stranded β-barrel domain, an intrinsically
disordered region, and an alpha helical transmembrane region. The predicted domain architecture suggests that
BT_4721 spans both the inner and outer membranes to function as a cell surface receptor and anti-sigma factor,
all in a single polypeptide. In addition, RNA sequencing of BT∆4721 revealed three genes of unknown function,
BT_1287, BT_4005, and BT_4719, are most significantly upregulated. BT_4005 and BT_4719 are both
annotated as NigD-like proteins, and I show that BT_4005 is necessary for the hypervesiculation phenotype
observed in BT_4721. Interestingly, BT_4005 is encoded in the chromosome next to genes involved in the
synthesis of lipids and lipopolysaccharides. Based on my findings, we hypothesize that BT_4721 is a novel anti-
sigma factor that modulates OMV biogenesis through its sigma factor-controlled regulon. In Aim 1, various
methods will be employed to confirm that BT_4721 functions as a structurally novel anti-sigma factor. In Aim 2,
I will determine the role of BT_4005 in inducing OMV production. Results from this proposal will provide critical
information to develop our understanding of OMV biogenesis in Bt."
10824977,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. At least 75% of all drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are related to
opioids. Further, opioid-related mortality rates have increased alarmingly among Black and Latino populations.
People with opioid use disorder have high hospitalization rates, and those who inject opioids have additional
barriers to services and needs that lead them to receive the majority of their care in hospitals. Consequently,
the hospital is a crucial point of contact for people who use opioids (by non-injection or injection), including
Black and Latino individuals. Harm reduction services (HRS) in hospital settings (psychosocial/environmental
and pharmacological HRS) are relatively new, but they have the potential to substantially reduce opioid-related
mortality rates. However, HRS are rarely offered in hospitals, and when offered, may not be offered equitably.
Thus, inadequate and unequal distribution of HRS in hospital settings may be significant impediments to the
health, quality of life, and equitable prevention of overdose among those who use opioids. Addiction medicine
consult programs in hospitals are based on harm reduction theory, but their success in providing HRS
comprehensively and equitably is not well understood. The proposed study builds on such a program located
in public hospitals in New York City, called Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH,
R01DA045669). CATCH examines rates of initiation of medication for opioid use disorder and post-discharge
services, but not HRS or inequities by route of use (non-initiation vs. initiation) and race/ethnicity. Yet
information on HRS can be found in the clinical notes section of the electronic health record (EHR), although
efficient methods of using EHR data are needed. The proposed study will use natural language processing
(NLP) and EHR data from the three largest sites enrolled in CATCH (N=982 patients, N≈ 3930 notes, N=9
providers/site.) This proposal has two objectives: Aim 1 will develop and validate a NLP system to identify
patterns of harm-reduction language and other relevant data, using a subset of clinical notes (N=300 notes).
Aim 2 will use the NLP system and entire collection of clinical notes to characterize providers’
recommendations of psychosocial/environmental and pharmacological-based HRS (as well as MOUD). First,
rates of MOUD and HRS recommendations by providers will be described. Then, racial/ethnic differences on
HRS and MOUD recommendations will be modeled using conditional logistic regression, followed by an
examination of route of drug use differences (non-injection, injection). To evaluate the secondary outcomes,
patients’ uptake of psychosocial/environmental and pharmacological HRS and MOUD, the study will describe
the uptake of HRS and MOUD and examine rates of uptake by race/ethnicity and route of drug use through
fixed-effects multinomial logit models. This F31 application aligns with NIDA's strategic plan. If funded,
statistical and research methods training will be a key component of this study, providing vital training in NLP,
harm reduction, and hospital-based interventions for overdose prevention."
10824927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, afflicting approximately 5.7 million people, or
60–80% of cases of dementia in the United States, and is predicted to triple to 16 million by the year 2050.
Diagnosis is made after the age of 65 in 90-95% of patients, with the remaining 5-10% considered early-onset.
Symptoms usually begin with difficulty learning new facts or recalling recent memories. In the middle stage of
AD progression, language becomes more difficult, memory continues to deteriorate with long-term memory
now also being affected, patients may not recognize close relatives, and will need assistance with most
activities of daily living. During the late stage of AD, language is eventually lost, muscle atrophies to the degree
that patients cannot get out of bed or feed themselves, and pneumonia or infection of pressure ulcers usually
leads to death. Thus, AD is clearly a significant health problem. The biochemical basis for AD pathophysiology
is thought to be the aggregation of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles
of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These markers correlate with the severity of clinical signs and symptoms
of the disease, and it is thought that they may be directly neurotoxic. However, a more recent paradigm is that
these aggregates of misfolded proteins may lead to a state of chronic neuroinflammation, and that this
inflammatory state is responsible for loss of neuronal function and neuron death. This inflammatory state is
achieved through activation of the innate microglia, as well as the relatively understudied (in this context)
activation of adaptive T lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells that dampen immune
responses and promote tissue repair after injury in various tissues including the brain. Recently, regulatory T
cells have been suggested to play an important role in AD. However, important gaps in our understanding
of Tregs in AD remain: What types of Tregs are found in the brain in AD mice relative to wildtype mice?
and, What role do Tregs play in the progression of AD? I will address this knowledge gap in two specific
aims. In Aim 1, I will characterize the types of Tregs and their spatial localization in the aging WT and AD
brains, while in Aim 2 I will establish the effect of increasing or decreasing Treg numbers or function. My
hypothesis is that brain-specific Tregs play a critical role in preventing or delaying AD progression, and that
increasing their number and function will lead to improved outcomes in AD. Successful completion of the aims
of this grant will provide insight into the role of Tregs in AD. These studies will enhance my training in
computational and hypothesis generating experiments (Aim 1), as well as hypothesis driven functional studies
(Aim 2)."
10824929,"Project Summary: Opioid overdose deaths and other substance-related mortality remain at an all-time high in
the United States, and evidence suggests that mortality will continue to worsen without significant changes to
the landscape of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. Overdose mortality is the leading cause of death in the
first two weeks post-release due to a variety of factors including changes in drug tolerance during incarceration
and volatility of the illicit drug supply, leading to a more than 100-fold increased risk of overdose death
compared to the nonincarcerated population during this period. Despite advances in addiction health services
and clinical addiction medicine, many people with OUD do not have access to healthcare or medications for
opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment, which remain the most effective treatment strategies to reduce OUD-
related mortality. Correctional facilities such as jails are a critical healthcare access point for people with OUD
who may not receive healthcare in other settings. However, MOUD treatment availability in jails is highly
variable across the United States, leaving many people with OUD without access to evidence-based treatment
while incarcerated. Implementation of MOUD treatment in jails is critical to improve accessibility of MOUD
treatment and reduce OUD-related mortality in this vulnerable population. There is need for further research
elucidating strategies that lead to successful and sustained implementation of MOUD in jails and other
correctional settings. This proposal uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze implementation of MOUD from
multiple perspectives. The proposal utilizes data from the Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation
Network (MassJCOIN) study, a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of MA Chapter 208, which
established a pilot program to expand all FDA-approved forms of MOUD in MA county jails. Aim 1 will
qualitatively assess organizational factors related to MOUD implementation in jails and post-release overdose
risk through thematic analysis of interviews with jail staff and people who received MOUD while incarcerated in
MA jails. Aim 2 will investigate the association between staff perspectives of MOUD and organizational factors
such as staff training and readiness for change. Aim 3 will compare MOUD retention outcomes for people who
screened positive for OUD while incarcerated between different types of MOUD treatment using the Public
Health Data (PHD) Warehouse database created by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The
proposed research and training plan will provide rigorous education in addiction health services research,
which will be integrated with the robust clinical training of UMass Chan Medical School and supported through
a multidisciplinary team of mentors with significant expertise in implementation science and OUD research in
criminal-legal settings. This proposal will provide valuable insights into strategies that lead to effective and
sustained MOUD treatment in jail settings with the goal of increasing accessibility to evidence-based MOUD
treatment and reducing opioid-related mortality for people who experience incarceration."

COVID-19 is caused by pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and has become a world-
wide health problem. More than 6 million people passed away and among the survivors, 33%
complain from symptoms that do not disappear after the acute phase of infection which is called
Long-COVID. Notably, during infection, patients with COVID-19 suffer from thrombi in the lung
and the brain which were implicated in the symptoms of long COVID. Our project will improve
our understanding for the contribution of our innate immune system to thrombus formation and
cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain and the blood circulation. We will also
test suitable inhibitors in collaboration with other projects in this Program. Together, this project
will provide novel information on immunothrombosis and brain pathology during COVID-19 that
will allow the design of new therapeutic targets."

Patients with long standing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer
(CRC) as a consequence of chronic inflammation. To reduce morbidity and mortality from IBD-related CRC,
surveillance for precancerous dysplasia with colonoscopy is recommended every 1-3 years beginning 8-10
years after diagnosis for most patients with IBD. However, the most effective way to perform dysplasia
surveillance has not been definitively established. IBD-associated precancerous dysplastic lesions may
represent a field effect from chronic inflammation and are difficult to see with standard definition white light
colonoscopy. Fortunately, the advent of high-definition white light colonoscopy (HDWLC) improved our ability
to visualize and remove precancerous dysplastic lesions. Nonetheless, the historical practice of collecting four
untargeted random mucosal biopsies every 10 cm throughout the colon continues to be widely employed for
patients with IBD. The rationale is that random biopsies may help detect these difficult to see precancerous
lesions. However, the recommendations for this practice are based on uncontrolled observations and ex-vivo
studies of resected specimen. In the one small randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of random biopsies,
the rate of dysplasia detection was numerically higher in the patients only getting targeted biopsies. This has
led to equipoise regarding random biopsies. The proposed Utility of Random Biopsies in Inflammatory Bowel
Disease (URBI) trial will be a multicenter pragmatic randomized clinical trial among 1642 patients to definitively
assess whether a limited biopsy strategy obtaining only two random biopsies from two locations is non-inferior
to the practice of obtaining four random biopsies every 10cm throughout the colon among patients with IBD
undergoing dysplasia surveillance with HDWLC. The primary outcome will be the average number of dysplastic
and sessile serrated adenoma lesions detected per colonoscopy.
The URBI trial will also present an opportunity to study the biology of colitis-associated dysplasia. Dysplasia is
graded as absent, low-grade (LGD) or high-grade (HGD). Indefinite for dysplasia (IFD) is used when there is
uncertainty whether or not there is LGD. Better understanding the biology of the dysplasia sequence could
improve pathologic classification and minimizing the need for the IFD category. Yet, little research has been
done to understand the progression of inflammation to dysplasia or the molecular characteristics of IFD using
modern omics technologies. We will utilize spatial transcriptomics and an integrative analytic approach to
inform the biologic progression from inflammation to HGD, including the biology of IFD. The biopsy samples
and linked clinical data collected in the URBI trial will provide an ideal resource to study the molecular biology
of colitis-associated dysplasia and IFD. Thus, the URBI trial will establish best practices for IBD dysplasia
surveillance and advance our understanding of the biology of colitis-associated dysplasia."
10856514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPPN) significantly reduces quality of life. Patients often
require tapering or cessation of chemotherapy, resulting in treatment failure and poor survival. Key mechanisms
include mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, and sustained neuroinflammation, which lead to neuronal
hypersensitivities and chronic pain. There are no satisfactory treatment or preventative therapies available. The
research on CIPPN has largely focused on sensory neurons, however, peripheral glia Schwann cells (SCs),
emerge as an essential component of the functional unit with sensory neurons that regulate pain states. Yet,
despite being highly susceptible to chemotherapy toxicity, mechanisms underlying SC contributions to CIPPN
are largely unknown. We discovered a key reciprocal signaling system mediated by peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) that regulate
SC survival, bioenergetics and inflammation. We hypothesize that PPARγ and LRP1 signaling governs the
metabolic homeostasis in SCs, and boosting their activity is pro-survival, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative,
and thereby reduces neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability induced by
chemotherapeutic agents. Our hypothesis is based on published data showing that PPARγ and LRP1 agonists
prevent the development of pain-related behaviors after nerve damage and compelling new preliminary data
showing that PPARγ and LRP1 regulate bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics in SCs in response to
chemotherapeutics. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of PPARγ and LRP1 in cell survival, mitochondria
dynamics and heterogeneities in primary mouse SCs. We will examine ultrastructural and bioenergetic changes
in nerve mitochondria in a tumor bearing oral cancer model treated with chemotherapeutics. In Aim 2, we will
examine the role of SC PPARγ-LRP1 in chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation using
primary mouse SCs and tumor bearing models of CIPPN. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of SC PPARg and
LRP1 signaling in chemotherapy-induced changes in nociceptive behaviors, sensory neuron metabolism and
hyperexcitability. We will use two chemotherapeutics: paclitaxel and oxaliplatin for generalizability. All key
findings from mouse studies will be validated in human cells and tissues including SCs, nerves collected from
cancer patients, and novel SC-dorsal ganglion neuron cocultures. Abuse liabilities are determined by monitoring
mouse behaviors. The potential effect of SC PPARγ-LRP1 signaling on tumor’s response to chemotherapeutics
will be evaluated by monitoring tumor growth and histopathology. Proposed studies will validate the role of
PPARγ in CIPPN, address new cellular and molecular mechanisms of PPARγ regulation of CIPPN, and identify
LRP1 as a novel target for CIPPN. Clinical relevance is predicated on recent reports demonstrating that a
selective PPARγ agonist is protective against nerve degeneration and inflammation in patients with rare
neurological disorders. SP16, an innovative LRP1 agonist has shown safety and tolerability in clinical trials."

Significance: Over 15,000 children aged <20 years will be diagnosed with cancer in 2023, but due to
advancements in treatments and therapies, 85% of these children are expected to join the growing population
of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) currently living in the US. On average, CCS will experience over 17
chronic health conditions by age 50, contributing to health complications (physical, mental, psychosocial) and
early mortality. Access to specialized long-term healthcare is a barrier in achieving equity in quality and
longevity of life, especially in disadvantaged populations, and this barrier is magnified as the population of CCS
continues to expand. Existing research has shown that proximity to providers confers advantages in frequency
of care and better health outcomes. However, partially attributable to the availability of adequate datasets,
these studies have only examined the role of distance as it relates to cancer incidence rather than post-
treatment survivorship. For CCS, and especially adolescent and young adults (AYA), survivors’ communication
between and/or fluctuation of care providers adds complexity to sustained healthcare treatment across the life
course.
Aims: This project will (1) characterize the proximity of AYA survivors to Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
survivorship care across the US, (2) determine the association between distance to care and early mortality,
and examine whether this is influenced by socioeconomic status (SES) and/or race/ethnicity in AYA survivors.
Approach: The proposed secondary analysis will leverage AYA cancer patient data from the COG’s Children’s
Cancer Research Network (protocol #ACCRN07). Previous work to geocode patient residence and complete
(pre- and post-diagnosis) residential history has allowed for study of patient residence in relation to
survivorship care. Aim 1 analysis will measure distance to care and characterize patients’ residential
environment (individual- and area-level characteristics). Poisson regression will be used to assess the number
of survivorship care contacts per unit area (density). Aim 2 will assess the relationship between distance to
care and early mortality (<5 years post-diagnosis) using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age
and sex. Mediation analysis will be used to explore the influence of SES and we will evaluate race/ethnicity as
a confounder.
Fellowship Information: The applicant is a PhD student in Epidemiology at the University of Minnesota and a
predoctoral trainee in the NICHD-funded T32 training program in Population Health Science. Through
coursework and mentoring on pediatric cancer epidemiology, geospatial analysis, and health disparities along
with guidance on communicating findings and writing grants, the proposed training plan will build on Ms.
Thomas’ existing research skills. This training will enhance her ability to complete her dissertation research
and become an independent cancer epidemiology researcher with expertise in childhood cancer survivorship."
10827369,"The development and maintenance of neurons and synaptic connections are highly complex processes, in part
due to the massive cytoplasmic volume and complex branching morphology of axons and dendrites. As one
mechanism, it is well appreciated that RNA localization and local translation are required to precisely regulate
protein homeostasis at synapses. Indeed, loss of FMRP in Fragile X Syndrome, or other impairments to RNA
localization and local translation at synapses, likely contribute to brain disorders. To better understand RNA
localization and local translation in neurons, we must elucidate the RNA cis-elements, RBP trans-factors, and
cytoskeletal motors mediating these processes. Although ongoing efforts have demonstrated how RNA binding
proteins (RBPs) can regulate local translation at post-synaptic sites, there still exists a major gap in our
understanding of how RBPs transport RNAs to regulate synaptic function. Fortunately, recent observations
provide clues about fruitful lines of investigation. For example, multiple studies report that distally localized
RNAs are enriched for cis-elements targeted by Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. Although these
observations suggest that MBNL may be a major player in localizing RNAs to the pre- and post-synapse, we
still lack a mechanistic understanding for how MBNL proteins may achieve this task, or what functions depend
on MBNL-mediated RNA localization. This line of research has important implications for the neurological
disease myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica, DM), in which MBNLs are depleted by toxic CUG repeats.
Therefore, an emerging hypothesis is that RNA localization functions of MBNL are important for proper
synapse function, and that mis-localized RNAs might account for some neurological features of DM patients,
particularly early in disease. Here, using MBNL depletion and DM-associated models, we propose to identify
specific functions for the localization of MBNL targets. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of MBNL-mediated
mRNA localization in neurons. We will define the RNA targets that are localized by MBNL in the pre- and post-synapse. We will characterize dynamic properties of motile MBNL RNA granules in live neurons and identify
cytoskeletal motors and adaptors associated with these granules. Using genomics, live cell imaging, and
biochemical approaches, we will establish mechanisms of how MBNL-interacting RNAs are transported. Aim 2
will define functions conferred by MBNL-dependent RNA localization using models of synapse development
and function, and models of myotonic dystrophy. By depleting cytoplasmic MBNL and other proteins required
for MBNL-dependent RNA localization, we will assess cellular functions dependent on this process. We will
identify specific neuronal functions, such as synaptic vesicle release, that depend on proper localization of
mRNAs by MBNL proteins. The impact of this research is to better understand how RNA localization and local
translation confers important synaptic functions and how they may go awry in DM. As few RNA binding
proteins have been linked to motors, this may evolve into a unifying model for mRNA transport to synapses."

Uncovering factors influencing progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease and
Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) represents a valuable opportunity to prevent clinical
AD/ADRD and prolong functional independence of people along the AD/ADRD continuum. Identifying this
progression is particularly difficult due to the diverse clinical criteria used to diagnose MCI and extensive
underdiagnosis leaving a nebulous path for researchers attempting to learn from its phenotypic characteristics.
Leveraging informatics tools to identify MCI cases in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) offers a great
opportunity to mitigate the heterogeneity and underdiagnosis of MCI. Risk factors exacerbating the progression
from MCI to AD/ADRD have been previously studied in the context of clinical measures. However, few have
included neighborhood context measures as risk factors, which may be key to understanding the higher
AD/ADRD incidence rates among underrepresented populations. The objective of this F31 proposal is to equip
me with the necessary skills to pursue a career as an independent investigator using clinical data and other
large, complex information systems to identify opportunities to prevent and delay progression to AD/ADRD. To
achieve this goal, I will use longitudinal data from a large, diverse EMR system to identify MCI cases using
structured and unstructured data to evaluate whether neighborhood measures of resource availability and
indicators of cardiovascular risk factors predict time to progression from MCI to AD/ADRD. Aim 1 will identify
patients with MCI diagnosis via diagnostic codes and MCI early symptoms in clinical notes using EMR data
from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) through the construction of a specific natural language
processing (NLP) algorithm. This will be validated by comparing association with future AD/ADRD diagnosis
and ground-truth chart review on a selected sample. Aim 2 evaluates the independent and mediated effects of
neighborhood deprivation indices and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors on time to progression from
MCI to AD/ADRD. Independent effects will be evaluated with time-varying-models of repeated measures of
CVD factors and neighborhood deprivation indices. Mediation will be used to determine whether place-level
deprivation effects are mediated by CVD risk burden on time to progression from MCI to AD/ADRD. The
proposed research contributes to the NIA goals to improve assessment of MCI and AD related conditions and
understand the effects of societal factors and health disparities on AD/ADRD. Under the guidance of a highly
qualified mentorship team, my training aims will augment my research aims by enhancing my understanding of
MCI and AD/ADRD clinical processes and phenotypes, provide training on causal inference methods using
longitudinal data with integration to machine learning models. With my highly committed mentorship team and
training environment at UCSF, I will succeed in my F31 proposed research, training plan, and acquire the skills
to emerge as an accomplished, independent clinical translational researcher in the field of AD/ADRD."

The prostate is a secretory gland that interacts with the urinary tract microbiome, including bacterial and viral
pathogens, which can cause inflammation conducive to the development of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer,
which is often proceeded by prostatitis, affects 1 in 8 men during their lifetime, resulting in around 34,500 deaths
annually. Despite the link between long-term inflammation and cellular transformation, the resident immune cells
within the prostate tissue, in particular CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM), have not been characterized. As
CD8+ T cells play key roles in controlling inflammation and tumor growth, understanding the mechanisms by
which prostate-resident memory CD8+ T cells are formed and maintained in response to infection is critical to
understanding prostate biology. A detailed understanding of the regulatory programs and transcriptional
networks that govern T cell adaptations to residency in the prostate tissue will inform the ability to ‘program’
tissue-tailored immune responses, where immune cells that promote or regulate inflammation can be
transcriptionally engineered for trafficking to, retention in, and function within the prostate tissue. Therefore,
understanding the tissue-specific adaptations of T cells to the prostate environment will inform strategies to treat
prostate-specific disease, including prevention and treatment of prostate inflammation, prostate tumorigenesis,
and immunotherapy for prostate tumors. Importantly, our preliminary work establishes that TRM possess tissue-
specific adaptation to unique tissues. Understanding the cues regulating prostate TRM is the focus of my F31
application. We find memory CD8+ T cells that express markers consistent with tissue residency within the
prostate epithelium up to 500 days following LCMV Armstrong infection, demonstrating the generation of a stable
TRM population. These prostate TRM have features that are distinct from other TRM populations, including
expression of functional nuclear androgen receptor (AR) and unique dynamics of the retention molecule CD103.
We hypothesize these features are part of prostate-specific TRM adaptations. To test this hypothesis, I propose
two independent aims. The first aim will examine the dependence of prostate TRM on the cytokine TGFβ and the
functional and protective capacity of prostate TRM. The second aim will determine the role of androgen receptor
in prostate TRM differentiation and homeostasis. In summary, the goal of this proposal is to provide insight into
the environmental cues that impact prostate TRM formation. This application outlines my training plan, which has
been discussed and curated with Dr. Ananda Goldrath and includes advanced coursework, training in new
techniques, and training in science writing and communication. The research and training plan outlined in this
proposal will provide me with the skills necessary to develop into an independent scientist prepared to pursue a
career in academic research."

Individuals with thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) can lose up to 50% of hand function.
Unfortunately, current conservative and surgical treatments do not provide the pain relief, strength, and mobility
needed to restore both fine and gross motor function. Improvements in clinical treatments are limited by a lack
of understanding regarding the complex relationship between thumb biomechanics and musculoskeletal pain. In
this proposal, we address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of thumb muscles in modulating the
two primary symptoms of CMC OA: pain and joint instability. Individuals across the full spectrum of disease
severity and healthy controls will be studied to evaluate individuals who present with only joint instability, only
pain, both, or neither. In Aim 1, to what extent muscle structure changes in the presence of CMC OA and how
these changes affect muscle force-generating capacity will be evaluated. Collected data will include fascicle
length and cross-section area measured in vivo through ultrasound imaging and thumb muscle operating ranges
calculated through musculoskeletal simulations. Completion of this aim will identify changes in muscle structure
that mitigate versus aggravate CMC OA symptoms and also establish baseline data describing healthy targets
for thumb muscle force-generating parameters. In Aim 2, how thumb muscle activity influences pain will be
examined through an experiment that integrates biomechanical techniques (e.g., electromyography) and
quantitative pain testing (e.g., movement-evoked pain, quantitative sensory testing). Completion of this aim will
enhance our understanding the relationship between muscle activity and pain, thereby elucidating protective
versus detrimental compensatory movement strategies adopted by individuals with CMC OA. In Aim 3, how
thumb muscle activity influences joint stability will be examined. Collected data will include experimental
measurements of muscle activity, thumb kinematics, and thumb kinetics during functional and range of motion
tasks as well as biomechanical assessments of joint instability in the presence of active versus passive muscle
contraction. Completion of this aim will identify how CMC OA and muscle activity influences CMC joint stability,
thereby informing clinical decisions regarding how muscles should (or should not) be considered during CMC
OA treatment. Overall, this study will critically advance our mechanistic understanding of how the structure and
function of thumb muscles change in the presence of CMC OA. By evaluating muscle mechanics (Aim 1), pain
(Aim 2), and joint stability (Aim 3) in individuals with and without CMC OA, we will elucidate the co-evolution of
muscle mechanics, symptom severity, and disease severity. This knowledge will inform current and future
treatment of CMC OA, thereby improving the quality of life of individuals living with this disease."

The larynx is richly innervated with nerves, forming neuroimmune niches that constitute the basis for
bidirectional interactions in mucosal defense and physiology. Idiopathic sensorimotor abnormalities of the
larynx, such as acute vocal fold paralysis and chronic hypersensitivity (chronic cough, episodic laryngospasm)
are attributed to upper respiratory tract infections with a viral etiology. However, a causal link for viral-induced
laryngeal pathophysiology remains tenuous. In this application, I will employ an established model of influenza
A virus (IAV) infection to interrogate laryngeal mucosal remodeling and map afferent/efferent neural
circuits/cells in naïve and virus infected tissues. I will investigate the central hypothesis that viral infection of the
larynx will activate neurosensory cells, remodel both afferent and efferent nerves, contributing to mucosal
inflammation and hypersensitivity. I will test this hypothesis utilizing a combination of mouse genetics, whole
tissue clearing and imaging, single-cell transcriptomics and live animal functional testing. We anticipate that
these activated neural inflammatory signals are detected via a unique population of ASCL1+ neuroendocrine
and CHAT+ cells that drive a neurosensory-immune circuit for laryngeal neuropathy. Together, these
experiments are expected to ascertain neural sensorimotor circuits and reveal neuroimmune interactions for
coordinating repair pathways following viral-induced mucosal inflammation. We expect findings will guide the
field in new directions for innovating treatments for laryngeal and vocal fold inflammatory diseases and
sensorimotor neuropathies."

The ‘apple-shaped’ anatomical pattern that accompanies visceral adiposity increases dementia risk in humans,
but the 'pear-shaped' distribution that reflects subcutaneous adiposity does not predict cognitive impairment and
may be protective. Several recent studies, including from our lab, have outlined signaling cascades linking
peripheral and central inflammation in obesity in males, but vulnerability to obesity-induced metabolic pathology
is sexually dimorphic, and susceptibility to neuroinflammation follows similar patterns. Adult females exhibit
stronger innate immunity, and evidence from clinical and experimental studies suggests that this dimorphism
involves sex differences in anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, current understanding of tissue-specific anti-
inflammatory signaling remains rudimentary due to the scarcity of approaches for selective manipulation.
Moreover, regionally heterogeneous responses to dietary obesity in different brain areas remain incompletely
characterized, leaving open questions surrounding feedforward neuroimmune control versus immunological
feedback. The proposed experiments will generate a comprehensive topographical map of neuroimmune
responses to chronic overnutrition and elucidate the role of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 in these
effects. We will use light-inducible cre drivers and direct delivery of tamoxifen metabolites to selectively
manipulate immune cells in cerebrospinal fluid. These technically innovative approaches will be followed by
anatomical mapping of lymphocytes and myeloid cells in cleared tissues, single-cell flow cytometric analysis, or
analysis of neuronal function at the behavioral and electrophysiological level. Understanding circuit-specific
sexual dimorphisms in obesity could yield fundamental insights into the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation in
different microenvironments, and could also identify target structures for noninvasive therapeutic modulation."
10828419,"Accumulating evident support intercellular transmission and subsequent amplification of pathological tau as a
key mechanism for the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Blocking this
transmission process is a promising therapeutic strategy to slow down disease progression. However, the
molecular mechanisms that regulate pathological tau transmission remains largely unknown. Previous studies
of tau transmission have been focused on pathological tau or the ‘seed’ itself. But, the amplification of
pathological tau requires both the ‘seed’ and soluble tau, the ‘substrate’. What has generally been ignored is
the potential effect of soluble tau on the amplification of pathological tau. Our preliminary study demonstrated
that soluble α-synuclein (a-syn) post-translational modifications (PTMs) would dramatically affect the
amplification of pathological a-syn, which highlights for the first time that PTMs on soluble protein would affect
amplification of the corresponding pathological protein. Since many PTMs were identified on soluble tau, we
hypothesize that soluble tau PTMs will also affect pathological tau amplification. Indeed, our preliminary data
demonstrated that soluble tau acetylation could dramatically modulate the amplification of pathological tau
prepared from AD brains (AD-tau). More interestingly, this effect is highly pathological tau conformation
dependent. Pathological tau from corticobasal degeneration brains (CBD-tau) shows very different responses
to soluble tau PTMs compared with AD-tau. Here, we propose to systematically explore how soluble tau PTMs
would modulate the amplification of pathological tau in AD and other tauopathies.
Firstly, PTMs on soluble tau from tauopathy brains has not been systematically identified and quantified.
Therefore, we propose to systematically identify and quantify soluble tau PTMs in AD and other tauopathies by
LC-MS/MS. Secondly, we will explore how soluble tau PTMs and PTM combinations would affect the
amplification of pathological tau in AD and other tauopathies. Thirdly, the effects of soluble tau PTMs are highly
pathological tau conformation dependent. Therefore, we propose to evaluate whether pathological tau in
different disease subtypes, brain regions, and cell types (neurons and glial cells), would have different
responses to soluble tau PTMs. Fourthly, it has been shown that different intracellular environment in neurons
and glial cells would affect the amplification of pathological proteins. We propose to test whether different
intracellular environment would also change the effect of soluble tau PTMs. Finally, the effects of soluble tau
PTMs on AD-tau amplification will be evaluated in mouse. In summary, the proposed study represents the first
to systematically explore how soluble tau PTMs would affect the amplification of pathological tau in AD and
other tauopathies, which is a novel mechanism that modulates tau transmission. Successful performance of
the proposed study will not only provide critical new insights into tau transmission but also dramatically
facilitate the development of novel therapies targeting soluble tau PTMs for AD and other tauopathies."

 The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) is seeking funding from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under RFA-FD-23-027 to support the maintenance of
Virginia’s Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) and Food Protection Task Force
(FPTF) Projects. The VDACS Food Safety Program meets all eligibility requirements for this funding
opportunity, has a current food safety inspection contract with the FDA, and an active FPTF. The amount
of funding requested is $306,000 per year, a total of $918,000 over the three-year project period.
 Since first obtaining these funds in 2009, the VDACS Food Safety Program has made great strides
to advance efforts toward a nationally integrated food safety system supported by high-quality
regulatory programs. Virginia’s Manufactured Food Program achieved full implementation and full
conformance of all ten standards in August 2019. A reduced-scale, remote audit of Standards 2, 3, and 6
was conducted in July 2021. The results of the assessment indicated that the VDACS Food Safety
Program maintained full conformance status with the 2016 MFRPS. The Program has a current food
safety inspection contract with the FDA and has maintained this contract for several years. Furthermore,
the Program’s Field Operations Manual (FOM) that contains the procedures used by the field staff to
perform their duties was created and implemented in line with the MFRPS.
 The Virginia FPTF’s diverse membership is comprised of stakeholders from across the state and
includes representatives from VDACS, the Virginia Department of Health, the Virginia Division of
Consolidated Laboratory Services, Virginia Tech, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. The VA FPTF continues to extend membership invitations to stakeholders from
regulatory agencies, industry, academia, and consumer groups; works to develop educational support
training/exercise opportunities; and hosts periodic educational and training opportunities regarding
pertinent food safety topics for the Commonwealth."
10828377,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards
to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such
as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic
assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are
further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial
elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools
are needed.
Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of
CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability,
as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow
for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non-
invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from
clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require
trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate
novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR
exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific
absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and
the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR,
improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging,
simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions
with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient-
specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and
validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our
approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with
invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential
to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the
healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually."
10828378,"Project Summary
Before the 1986 enactment of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), emergency
departments (EDs) could legally turn away patients with emergency conditions based upon condition or ability
to pay. EMTALA imposed a duty to treat, requiring that all patients presenting to an ED receive a timely medical
screening evaluation, stabilization, and transfer if specialized stabilizing services are needed, regardless of
condition or ability to pay. Hospitals are required to accept transfer of patients from other EDs if the receiving
facility has specialized services required to stabilize their condition. Compliance with EMTALA is a condition of
Medicare participation, and failure to comply with EMTALA can result in termination of a hospital’s Medicare
provider agreement, a serious consequence that can result in hospital closure. EMTALA is actively enforced with
a quarter of U.S. hospitals cited for violating the law within the past decade. Faced with an EMTALA citation,
hospitals have two principal options to improve EMTALA compliance. First, they could enhance policies,
procedures and service availability - improving access to and quality of care. Alternatively, hospitals could
eliminate service lines reducing both responsibilities under EMTALA as well as access to care for the population
served by the hospital. Indirect evidence suggests that some hospitals have responded to EMTALA enforcement
in ways that might paradoxically reduce access to or quality of emergency care, likely exacerbating disparities.
However, no publications directly evaluate how EMTALA enforcement impacts access to or the quality of
emergency care. Nor is it known how hospitals responded to EMTALA enforcement in the wake of the COVID-
19 pandemic. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to build on an existing dataset and create a file
including all EMTALA citations from 2011-present and link with data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project (HCUP) State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD), the State Inpatient Databases (SID), Hospital
Compare data to complete a study with the following Aims: (1) To evaluate whether access to emergency care
improves following EMTALA citation (2) To assess whether disparities in access to care change in response to
EMTALA citation, (3) To determine if quality of emergency care changes in response to EMTALA citations, (4)
To quantify whether these effects varied during the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally (5) To characterize
corrective action plans proposed by hospitals in response to citation to determine which actions and operational
changes are associated with change in access to or quality of care. Understanding whether EMTALA
enforcement impacts access to and quality of emergency care, and which corrective action plans serve as likely
mechanisms for observed changes will be imperative to informing future efforts to enhance or improve the statute
to ensure access to quality emergency care for historically underserved populations, and in particular low-income
and minority groups, all AHRQ priority populations."
10861714,"Project Summary: Over 81,000 new individuals are diagnosed each year with urothelial carcinoma
(UC) of the bladder and 17,000 will die from their disease. Most have non-muscle invasive disease
(NMIBC) at diagnosis. Despite standard treatment with the live, attenuated mycobacterial strain Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instilled into the bladder, two-thirds of NMIBC patients will develop relapsed
tumors after BCG treatment. While curative, cystectomy is associated with life-altering quality of life
impact and is not feasible, or is refused, in many. Nonsurgical curative options for BCG-relapsing NMIBC
patients are lacking. In metastatic UC, durable responses with low toxicity rates have been observed with
checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapies aimed at the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) / programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway leading to the FDA approval of five agents. Examining novel combination
approaches including CPIs in BCG-relapsing NMIBC represents a natural next step. In this proposal, we
plan to define the safety and clinical activity, assess the point-of-care diagnostic potential of several genomic
biomarker platforms, and perform initial mechanistic investigations of novel combinations of CPI therapy
with both BCG and radiation in the multi-arm, multi-stage ADAPT-BLADDER phase 1b/2 clinical trial,
with the long-term goal of informing the design of future practice-changing phase 3 trials.
Objectives: 1) To demonstrate safety and clinical efficacy of immunotherapy combination regimens in
patients with BCG-relapsing NMIBC; 2) To identify conserved candidate genomic signatures associated with
clinical benefit and/or treatment resistance to novel immunotherapy regimens in NMIBC patients with recurrent
tumors after prior BCG therapy; 3) To demonstrate the existence of tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses and
correlate such responses with clinical outcomes to novel immunotherapy regimens in NMIBC patients with
recurrent tumors after prior BCG therapy.
Methods: We will assess each objective prospectively through the multi-center phase 1 b / 2 ADAPT-
BLADDER trial in over 170 patients with BCG-relapsing NMIBC. Specifically, we will document the safety
of each regimen in phase 1 and clinical efficacy in phase 2. We will correlate baseline and post-
treatment genomic biomarker signatures with clinical benefit. Lastly, we will interrogate the ability of
personalized neoantigen peptide libraries to expand antigen-specific T-cell clones.
We hypothesize that immunotherapy combination regimens will be safe and effective. Moreover, we
anticipate the identification of point-of-care genomic biomarker signatures that can distinguish patients
most likely to benefit; we expect to identify novel gene expression signatures predictive of therapy
response and resistance; and we suspect the planned functional tumor immunology investigations will
yield illuminating discoveries."

Species exhibit stereotypic lifespans, suggesting an intrinsic hardwired limit. Our preliminary data
shows that a population of mouse T cells can be iteratively boosted in vivo and passaged among
young mice for >11 years (~4 mouse lifespans). This multi-lifespan T cell population remains
functional, does not undergo unrestrained cell division, and like young memory T cells, undergoes
rapid proliferative bursts upon further antigen/mitogen stimulation. We have now generated 10
indepdent ongoing cohorts of cells, ranging from 6-66 total boosts over 1-11 years, to study
mechanisms by which functional cells can exceed their species’ lifespan while retaining cell
identity, functional and proliferative competence, accumulating perhaps 100s or even 1000s of
cell divisions, while not exhibiting signs of uncontrolled proliferation. Specific aims will reevaluate
the Hayflick Limit, assess mutational burden and the accumulation of transcriptional noise, test
whether a young host environment is responsible for maintaining everlasting functional
persistence of transferred T cells, and evaluate metabolic adaptations that may support extreme
longevity and maintenance of proliferative potential. Our long-term goal is to understand how a
population of mammalian somatic cells has adapted the capacity to maintain vitality despite multi-
lifetime chronological aging and an excessive history of proliferation, and to ultimately apply newly
learned concepts and mechanisms to extend human health span.

10825281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uterine fibroids, benign tumors of the uterus, affect 77% of women by menopause in the U.S. and account for
up to $34 billion in annual healthcare costs. Black women have at least a two-fold higher risk of fibroids than
White women, develop fibroids at younger ages, are more likely to have a clinical diagnosis, and are more
likely to have a hysterectomy. Black women are also more likely than White women to have larger and more
numerous fibroids. Fibroids are also highly heritable. We have shown associations between increasing African
ancestry and fibroid risk that risk varies by African geographic region. We will leverage VUMC’s extensive
research infrastructure in Nigeria, our state-of-the-art tissue collection, -omics expertise, and the high level of
genetic diversity within Africa-origin populations to test the hypothesis that Nigerian women have stronger risk
for fibroids than US Black women. Nigeria is an ideal locale to study these issues as ancestry from Nigerian
populations represents a large proportion of the African American genome. Several large-scale genome- wide
association studies (GWAS) of fibroid risk have identified multiple fibroid risk loci. However, the mechanisms by
which these genes function in the uterus or in fibroid tumors remain poorly defined. Within this grant we will
use bulk RNA (RNAseq) and single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) to better understand the mechanisms by which
GWAS identified loci function in fibroid risk in African ancestry women. We will conduct the following specific
aims: 1. Test for the association of known and novel fibroid GWAS loci among Nigerian women and
identify loci associated with gene expression in myometrium. We hypothesize that effect sizes are larger
for fibroid risk loci among Nigerian women and these loci associate with gene expression. We will run bulk
RNAseq on 1,000 myometrium samples (500 discovery and 500 validation) and conduct germline low pass
sequencing from whole blood from the 3,000 with 1,000 overlapping individuals. 2. Detect cell-specific gene
expression unique to normal or fibroid tissue in African ancestry women. We hypothesize that there are
differences in cell-type specific gene expression across normal and fibroid uteri. Using overlapping samples
from Aim 1, we will run scRNAseq on fibroid tumors and normal myometrial tissue (75 non-fibroid, and 75
fibroid tissues from US Blacks, age-matched). 3. Build a myometrial tissue eQTL atlas and gene
expression prediction models. We hypothesize that eQLTs identified from Aim 1 and 2 can be used to
develop predicted gene expression models. Combining genotypes and bulk RNAseq data generated in Aim 1
and scRNAseq data from Aim 2, we construct bulk and cell-specific predicted gene expression models. We will
then conduct a multi-stage predicted gene expression association analyses using GWAS summary statistics
and data. We propose an efficient and cost-effective approach to identify functional loci associated with fibroid
determinants by developing a uterine tissue gene expression reference in Black women."

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) has a long history of working
cooperatively with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on food safety issues and shares
the commitment to the development of an integrated food safety system.
There is a very diverse group of agencies, expertise, disciplines, capabilities and sources of
authority that protect our food supply, our citizens and the economic benefits of a safe food
supply. The Missouri Rapid Response Team (MRRT) combines those capabilities to respond
quickly, efficiently and effectively when an emergency threatens the food we eat. The MRRT
includes DHSS, FDA and the Missouri Department of Agriculture. The MRRT also has strong
partnerships and proven capabilities from different responses coupled with a commitment to
continuous improvement. The MRRT proposes to offer its expertise by continuing a rapid
center for subject matter experts who can help not only in Missouri, but also reach out as part of
a network to help the entire nation, while also searching for opportunities to create new subject
matter expert capabilities. Sharing expertise offers the opportunity to detect and stop
contamination sooner. Large foodborne outbreaks involve multiple jurisdictions. To meet that
challenge, the MRRT will continue to expand its outreach to the 115 local public health agencies
which include more educational opportunities, training and assistance in emergency response.
The MRRT will also maintain its work to incorporate lessons learned from responses and
exercises and use proven, measurable data to apply it to improved capabilities to strive for
continuous improvement.
In addition, Missouri will continue its work to keep a strong surveillance system so disease can
be detected quickly, while also striving to find and share information to prevent illness and
contamination. The MRRT will contribute information to other states and partners through a
variety of venues while also lending assistance and expertise to national efforts and workgroups
to improve and add to best practices and apprise the larger community about problems and
solutions in foodborne outbreaks and contamination."

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 44 children have autism.
Implementing evidence-based practices (EBPs) is crucial for their meeting their needs. However, there are
challenges to delivering EBPs for autistic children in routine services. This proposal leverages data from the
TEAMS (Translating Evidence-based Interventions for Autism: A Multi-Level Implementation Strategy) Hybrid
Type III trials. TEAMS aimed to improve implementation of EBPs by testing multi-level implementation
strategies in children’s mental health services (Study 1 PI: Brookman-Frazee, R01-MH111950) and schools
(Study 2 PI: Stahmer, R01-MH111981). Specifically, the TEAMS trials applied the Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and utilized the Leadership and Organizational Change for
Implementation (LOCI) strategy to test the effectiveness of two multi-component implementation strategies.
TEAMS targeted organizational and provider level mechanisms. The organization level implementation
strategy (TEAMS Leadership Institute, TLI), an adapted version of the Leadership and Organizational Change
for Implementation (LOCI) strategy, targeted organizational implementation leadership and climate as
mechanisms. The proposed study will supplement the primary study aims by exploring a new potential
mechanism of TLI – climate embedding mechanisms (CEM). The construct of CEM refers to tools that leaders
utilize to teach their organizations how to perceive, think, feel, and behave. This study aims to identify which
individual CEM are most impactful to promote successful implementation and whether use of specific CEM
mediates the associations between TLI and implementation and child outcomes.
 The objective of this NRSA application is to foster my development as an implementation scientist with a
focus on organizational implementation factors and autism services research. The proposed project will
examine climate embedding mechanisms as potential mechanisms of action of an organizational
implementation strategy within two linked randomized controlled trials. Specifically, Aim 1 will identify individual
climate embedding mechanisms associated with implementation (provider) and clinical (child) outcomes. Aim 2
will utilize quantitative methods to examine whether the individual climate embedding mechanisms identified in
Aim 1 mediate the effects of TLI on implementation and clinical outcomes. Lastly, Aim 3 will use qualitative and
mixed methods to complement and expand quantitative findings on additional climate embedding mechanisms
and explain how individual mechanisms facilitated implementation of autism EBPs. The present proposal
represents an important step in further understanding mechanisms of organizational implementation strategies.
With support of my mentoring team, this proposal will launch my development toward a career as an
independent implementation scientist focusing on organizational level strategies and mechanisms to improve
EBP implementation in autism services settings."
10931389,"Muscle atrophy (or wasting) is defined by reduced myofiber size and number, which increases morbidity and
mortality and decreases quality of life. One of the mechanisms of muscle atrophy is the loss of proteostatic
balance. When protein degradation exceeds synthesis, protein content is decreased to reduce myofiber size
and muscle mass. How the balance between protein synthesis and degradation is disturbed in diseased and
aged skeletal muscle in unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in skeletal muscle atrophy
under many disease conditions and during normative aging, with the underlying mechanism remaining poorly
understood. Perturbations in oxidative phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in reactive oxygen
species production, collectively termed “bioenergetic defects”, have been proposed to drive muscle loss.
However, accumulating evidence suggests that substantial levels of bioenergetic deficiency and oxidative
stress are insufficient to cause muscle wasting. Therefore, if mitochondrial dysfunction does indeed result in
muscle loss, it may involve bioenergetically independent factors. The Chen lab recently found that various
forms of mitochondrial damage can reduce mitochondrial protein import. This causes proteostatic stress in the
cytosol, termed mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation Stress (mPOS), followed by global remodeling of
proteostasis. We recently generated a transgenic mouse line that moderately overexpresses the mitochondrial
inner membrane protein, Ant1. We found that Ant1-induced mitochondrial protein import stress causes
progressive muscle atrophy, accompanied by reduction of mitochondrial respiration. However, whether muscle
atrophy is caused by bioenergetic deficiency or bioenergetic-independent stressors remains unknown.
Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed a robust activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which in
turn represses global protein synthesis and activates autophagy. ISR activation is commonly found in tissues
derived from patients with mitochondrial disease. Using this unique mouse model, we propose to determine the
molecular mechanisms of mitochondria-induced muscle atrophy and ISR activation. In Aim 1, we will determine
the mechanism by which mitochondrial protein import stress induces muscle wasting. In Aim 2, we will
determine whether ISR activation protects skeletal muscle from myofiber death and myopathy in the setting of
mPOS. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how bioenergetics-independent mitochondrial stress
signaling promotes chronic muscle wasting in normative and non-normative aging. The results of this
application may help establish a bioenergetics-independent pathway for treating mitochondria-induced muscle
disease and possibly sarcopenia."
10825175,"Intestinal absorption of dietary nutrients is an important process contributing to the etiology of multiple
metabolic diseases that represent ~30% of worldwide mortality. An organism’s response to a high-fat meal
(HFM) requires coordination between multiple cell types in digestive tissues as well as the gut microbiota.
Enterocytes (EC) are the absorptive cells of the intestine that coordinate this response by temporarily storing
lipids in cytosolic lipid droplets (LD) and ultimately preparing them for circulation to distal tissues in ApoB-
containing lipoproteins (BLP). In parallel, enteroendocrine cells (EEC) sense and communicate nutrient
information to other cells and tissues via calcium-dependent hormone and neurotransmitter release. While the
roles of these cells in postprandial physiology are broadly acknowledged, the specific mechanisms mediating
EC and EEC postprandial responses to high-fat meal (HFM) and how microbiota influence those responses
remain unresolved. Our research team pioneered the zebrafish system for studies of lipid metabolism and
host-microbiota interaction. Over the past 10 years of this award, we have developed and applied highly
innovative tools in the zebrafish system to reveal new mechanisms of lipid metabolism, EEC physiology, and
host-microbiota interaction. The central hypothesis of this renewal is that a coordinated dynamic response to
HFM between EC and EEC is mediated by a suite of microbe-influenced transcription factors that ultimately
alter BLP and LD levels and turnover. Our research team has developed a set of novel tools to measure
digestive organ lipid uptake, transport, storage, and signaling. These include the first family of in vivo reporter
lines to quantify BLP size, numbers and turnover, as well as LD protein dynamics. In Aim 1, we will apply these
new tools along with genetic analyses to define the dynamics underlying LD and BLP responses to HFM and
microbes. We have previously used genetic approaches in zebrafish to identify host transcription factors
mediating responses to HFM and microbiota, and recently performed the first single cell nuclei RNAseq
analysis of an entire animal at a range of timepoints following a HFM. This approach allows us to interrogate
the transcriptional networks driving the postprandial response of digestive organs at unprecedented levels of
cellular and temporal granularity. In Aim 2, we will use these resources to define the transcriptional regulatory
pathways mediating intestinal epithelial response to HFM. We have also established tools for measuring EEC
responses to nutrients and microbes in zebrafish, and used them to reveal a novel microbiota-mediated EEC
postprandial adaptation after a HFM. In Aim 3, we will define the mechanisms underlying this microbiota-
induced EEC adaptation. This competitive renewal leverages long-standing partnerships between three field-
leading labs with a powerful set of mutant and novel transgenic reporter lines to elucidate the relationships
between EC, EEC, and microbiota. The zebrafish displays extensive homologies to that of humans and mice
and provides technical advantages not available in mammals that enable the proposed studies."

This is an Independent Scientist Award (K02) application to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) from Dr.
Alexandru Movila, Ph.D. who is an earlier stage investigator. Dr. Movila is an Assistant Professor in his third year
appointment in the Department of Periodontology at Nova Southeastern University (NSU). Throughout his faculty
career, Dr. Movila has established a strong publication record as an independent investigator in the field of oral
inflammation induced by oral pathogens. His research is currently supported by R01AG064003, R03DE027153,
and R15DE28699 grants addressing molecular mechanisms of ceramide lipids-induced periodontitis in relation
to aging. Because the emerging evidence indicates that virulence factors secreted by periodontal pathogens
may be engaged in initiation and/or progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the scientific goal of Dr. Movila is to
establish a foundation of research for elucidation of pathogenic engagement of periodontal disease in the onset
and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Further, Dr. Movila’s long-term career goal is to become a leading basic
research scientist in the field of aging and Alzheimer’s disease research. Currently, the PI has very limited
experience in the pathophysiology of age-dependent neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease.
However, due to the current workload at NSU that involve teaching and research mentoring of undergraduate
and graduate dental students, he can only allocate a limited time for the research on Alzheimer’s disease
associated with periodontitis. Thus, this career development KO2 award would provide the protected time to
gain expertise in a new field of research. Based on his existing expertise in the oral pathogenesis and preliminary
results, Dr. Movila hypothesized that ceramide lipid produced by the key periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas
gingvalis, is engaged in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis via elevation of the hyper-phosphorylation of tau and
amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. The primary career development goals of this K02
application are: 1) to identify the possible pathogenic factors produced by periodontal pathogens that promotes
progression of the Alzheimer’s disease pathology, 2) to receive hands-on training to learn the pre-clinical
experimental mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, 3) to establish academic collaborations with distinguished
researchers in the fields; and 4) to build up academic credential in the Alzheimer disease research. The proposed
career development training and research studies will help to Dr. Movila not only improving his knowledge and
skill to study Alzheimer’s disease, but also increasing the network for collaborations and reputation in the field."
10826483,"ABSTRACT
Most neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic with unknown etiology that likely stems from the interaction
between genetics and the environment, the latter of which continues to remain poorly understood.
Epidemiological studies have linked environmental exposures to the development of TDP-43 pathology, widely
considered a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but has now
been expanded to a host of other age-related neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD)
(collectively referred to as TDP-43 proteinopathies). To begin addressing some of the major gaps in our
understanding of how environmental risk factors are linked to neurodegeneration, we performed a high-content
microscopy screen to identify environmental toxicants that mediate TDP-43 dysfunction and identified
pathology “promoters” that have never been linked to TDP-43 or dementia, thus opening the possibility that we
can 1) uncover new risk factors that impact the onset or progression of neurodegeneration, 2) identify the
cellular pathways and disease contexts through which they operate, and 3) provide a new paradigm for
therapeutic interventions that are based on environmental susceptibility. We assembled a team of experts
covering TDP-43 pathogenesis, genetic modeling, high-content screening, and computational modeling to
address our overarching hypothesis that distinct classes of at-risk environmental toxicants drive TDP-
43 dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and memory & motor decline. To address this hypothesis, we will
evaluate a high priority subset of environmental toxicants identified in our screen based on their prevalence
and levels of human exposure. In Aim-1, we will examine the pathophysiological relevance of toxicant
exposure using in vivo and neuronal models that allow us to interrogate their functional impact. In Aim-2, we
will evaluate exactly how toxicants mediate TDP-43 dysfunction and will examine direct cysteine-dependent
and indirect stress-responsive mechanisms that would link environmental toxicants to enhanced TDP-43
aggregation. In Aim-3, we will evaluate the extent to which toxicants affect TDP-43-dependent pathways vs.
global disruption of other key FTD/ALS-associated signaling pathways. This study is innovative because it is
the first systematic survey of at-risk chemicals affecting TDP-43, enabling us for the first time to connect
environmental agents to neurodegenerative disease. Our study is also significant because it could radically
transform our understanding of how an environmental agent may drive or perhaps increase susceptibility to
disease, which could logically inform strategies to alleviate or mitigate disease burden."

 In mammalian cells, RNAs are predominantly located within the cytoplasm and nucleus. A recent study,
however, has found that RNAs can be glycosylated, and a fraction of such glycosylated RNAs (referred to as

tissue damage. While the circulation half-lives of neutrophils are relatively short, neutrophils can migrate from
circulation into tissues, a process that involves complex interactions with the endothelial cell layer lining the blood
vessels. Glycan-binding lectins and integrins are known players in neutrophil-endothelium interactions, but the
whole process remains incompletely understood. Based on our preliminary data, we propose the existence of
glycoRNAs on neutrophil cell surface and aim to test that neutrophil cell surface RNAs mediate important
functions of neutrophils including their interaction with endothelial cells. With a team of investigators of
complimentary expertise, we will achieve these goals through four specific aims to decipher the molecular nature,
functions, and mechanisms of neutrophil cell surface RNAs. Successful execution of our proposed project will
add a new dimension to the regulation of neutrophil functions by studying a new class of RNA-containing
regulators. The proposed experiments will also address key questions regarding glycoRNAs. As the field of cell
surface RNA/glycoRNA is at its infancy, there are many exciting questions that cannot be explored in this single
proposal, but findings from this proposal could stimulate both future explorations and the community toward
better understanding of glycoRNAs in neutrophils and in other diverse biological settings."

 1 Cancer survivors that use tobacco are at a greater risk of experiencing negative health outcomes. While many
 2 cancer survivors quit using tobacco at time of diagnosis, available research demonstrates that many
 3 relapse (e.g., 13-60%). The Social Ecological Model (SEM) provides a conceptual framework for
 4 understanding the intrapersonal factors and interpersonal factors that may contribute to tobacco use relapse.
 5 However, to date, few studies have identified intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors of tobacco use relapse
 6 among this patient population. Further, these studies utilize survey designs that are unable to examine the
 7 factors that immediately precede tobacco relapse. Thus, it is relatively unknown how intrapersonal and
 8 interpersonal factors relate to tobacco relapse within the context of cancer survivorship in real-time.
 9 The proposed study aims to address this critical gap and advance cancer prevention and control science
10 through using multiple survey methods (i.e., ecological momentary assessment, longitudinal survey) to
11 examine the momentary and long-term associations between intrapersonal factors (i.e., cancer worry, negative
12 affect), interpersonal factors (i.e., social support, social constraint), and tobacco relapse behavior. Cancer
13 survivors that demonstrate greater risk of relapse (e.g., newly diagnosed, recently quit using tobacco) (N=122)
14 will be recruited from VCU Massey Cancer Center and asked to complete a baseline survey and a 3-month
15 follow-up survey to examine intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors of tobacco use relapse (i.e., continued
16 tobacco use for > 7 days). A subset of 40 participants will also complete a 14-day ecological momentary
17 assessment (EMA) to investigate momentary intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors of greater tobacco
18 relapse risk (defined as higher urge to use tobacco and lower motivation to abstain from tobacco). Specifically,
19 the applicant aims to: (1) examine daily associations between intrapersonal factors (i.e., cancer worry, negative
20 affect) and tobacco relapse risk across a 14-day period; (2) examine daily associations between interpersonal
21 factors (i.e., social support, social constraint) and tobacco relapse risk across a 14-day period; and (3) examine
22 the association between baseline intrapersonal and interpersonal factors and tobacco use relapse at follow-up.
23 The proposed training goals for this NRSA fellowship are: (1) increase the applicant’s knowledge of the factors
24 that contribute to tobacco use and tobacco relapse among cancer survivors; (2) enhance training in advanced
25 quantitative statistical methods; and (3) improve translational research-related skills. This training plan involves
26 a variety of research, didactic and professional development-related activities that will facilitate the successful
27 completion of the proposed project and equip the applicant with the skillset needed to lead a career as an
28 independent researcher. Further, the applicant’s mentorship team includes experts within the field of cancer
29 prevention and tobacco control who maintain a history of collaboration. Overall, results from this project have
30 the potential to inform the development of future tobacco treatment programs for cancer survivors."
10828340,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been successful in settings such as autoimmunity and
cancers, and therefore, treatment options with antibodies especially re-designed molecules based on broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) should be explored in the context of HIV-1. A caveat is that HIV-1 has the ability
to rapidly escape from antibodies by generating mutations in its variable env gene. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to gain insight into HIV-1 escape from bNAbs to aid in more effective combination antibody strategies to
be used towards HIV-1 therapy, cure and prevention. As bNAbs are already being tested in clinical trials, it is
imperative that optimal antibody combinations are evaluated not only for their neutralization capability but also
their ‘ease of escape’ by diverse viruses. The overall objective of this proposal is to measure the ability of
genetically diverse strains of HIV to escape from broadly neutralizing antibodies and design an antibody cocktail
capable of restricting escape. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Lynch, who is an expert in HIV-1 escape from bNAbs
has put together a collaborative team for an interdisciplinary approach using molecular virology (Dr. Lynch),
computational methods (Drs. Barton and Fischer) and a humanized-mouse model (Dr. Klein) to study HIV-1
escape. Our central hypothesis is that HIV-1 escape from combination bNAbs will be limited when the
mutations required to escape all bNAbs exert the maximum replicative fitness cost across diverse
viruses and, therefore, replication cannot easily be restored through compensatory mutations. We will
test this hypothesis by (i) defining a library of viable escape pathways for single bNAbs in diverse viruses with in
vitro and in vivo approaches, (ii) determining the fitness cost or “ease” of escape for virus-bNAb pairings
bioinformatically, and (iii) identifying the optimal combination of antibodies that maximize fitness costs of
resistance in diverse HIV-1 subtypes and testing this combination in vitro and in vivo. Our outcome will be the
identification of optimal combination antibody cocktails to limit the ability of diverse HIV-1 viruses to escape from
antibody pressure. These findings will inform all clinical trials using bNAbs or bNAb-based molecules, and
ultimately, these studies will define a rational pipeline to characterize antibody escape pathways in the future."

 This proposal seeks to identify potential allosteric properties in adhesins of human
enterobacterial pathogens - Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca, Enterobacter spp, Proteus
mirabilis, and Salmonella – that are assembled via a chaperone-usher pathway (CUP). To date, only the
mannose-specific, type 1 fimbrial adhesin of E. coli, FimH, has been demonstrated to be an allosteric protein
that can exist in alternative functional (active/inactive) conformations. This property allows bacteria that contain
FimH as part of hair-like surface appendages, fimbriae or pili, to bind ligand presented on host cells rapidly
from an inactive conformation and to remain bound for very long lifetimes under shear force by transiting to an
active conformation. The long-lived (slow dissociation) binding involves formation of so-called `catch-bonds'
that can be activated and become stronger under tensile mechanical force and involve an allosteric switch. To
date no other bacterial adhesin has been demonstrated to be allosteric and to exist in alternative functional
(active/inactive) conformations. To identify other adhesins that work via similar mechanisms, we will focus on
adhesins that are part of fimbriae or pili and belong to the same CUP structural class as FimH. We recently
identified a set of aliphatic or aromatic residues that act as molecular toggles that control the allosteric switch
between active and inactive conformations by switching their orientation between the protein core and surface.
It is possible to stabilize either active or inactive conformation of the adhesin by “surface locking” such toggles
through substitution to hydrophilic charged residues. We will use putative analogs of the FimH toggles to
identify the existence of allosteric states in other CUP adhesins that are homologous or non-homologous to
FimH, using mutagenesis, various functional assays, and three types of structural analysis – NMR, X-ray
crystallography, and cryo-EM. Success of our studies will contribute to understanding of general mechanisms
of bacterial adhesion to host cells and, ultimately, to the design of optimized vaccines and small molecule
inhibitors. If certain adhesins are found to be allosteric, in-depth analysis of their physiologically-relevant
structure/functional properties and significance for pathogenesis as well as practical implementation of the
findings will be the focus of future studies."
10828344,"Prevention of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is a public health priority because it causes reproductive
sequelae. Since CT control programs have not reduced infection rates, a CT vaccine is needed. Our long-term
goal is to generate knowledge that will advance CT vaccine development. One obstacle to CT vaccine
development had been identifying immune and clinical correlates of protection in humans. We showed that CT-
specific systemic CD4+ IFN-g is a correlate of immune protection in women and that spontaneous clearance of
CT infection before treatment and absence of reinfection after treatment are clinical correlates of protection. With
sparse data on CT-specific mucosal cellular immune responses in women, we developed a novel approach for
studying these responses using mucosal mononuclear cells (MMCs) from menstrual blood (MB). Another
obstacle in CT vaccine development has been identifying CT antigens that induce protective immunity. Using an
immunoproteomic approach, Dr. Brunham’s laboratory identified five CT outer membrane proteins (OMPs) that
elicited strong T helper type 1 (Th1) responses. They tested a CT and C. muridarum subunit vaccine that
combined these OMPs with a Th1 polarizing adjuvant and found it accelerated infection clearance in mice.
 The potential immunogenicity of these CT OMPs and need for a CT vaccine provides strong rationale for
extending immune studies of these promising CT antigens and others to humans. The major objective of our
proposal (in response to FOA PA-19-096) is to study cellular and antibody responses to promising CT vaccine
candidate antigens. Our hypothesis is that Th1 cytokine responses against candidate CT antigens will be
associated with clinical correlates of protection and may correlate with functional antibody responses against CT
organisms (EBs). Our study has 3 aims: Aim 1 - Investigate systemic cellular and humoral immune responses
to candidate CT vaccine antigens and their association with clinical correlates of protection against CT in women.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women with spontaneously cleared vs. persisting CT infection
and women without vs. with CT reinfection will be stimulated ex vivo with promising CT vaccine candidate
antigens and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Sera will be
tested for IgG to CT antigens and functional antibody responses to CT EBs. Aim 2 - Evaluate mucosal T cell
and antibody responses induced by candidate CT vaccine antigens and their association with clinical correlates
of protection against CT in women. From Aim 1 participants, MMCs from MB will be stimulated ex vivo with CT
antigens and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses measured by ICS. Mucosal antibodies to CT antigens will be
tested. Aim 3 - Use an in vitro human dendritic cell / CD4+ T cell co-culture method (MIMIC system) to confirm
antigenicity and immunogenicity of promising candidate CT vaccine antigens in women. PBMCs from CT naïve
women will be used in the MIMIC system to evaluate antigenicity and immunogenicity (when given with adjuvant)
of the candidate CT antigens. Study findings may lead to a CT vaccine formulation for a phase I study."
10828421,"Neurocysticercosis (NCC), the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the
metacestode larva of Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, is endemic in most developing
countries and identified as the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The
parasites cause a chronic neuroinflammation and pathological studies reveal reactive
astrogliosis, fibrosis, angiogenesis, alteration of the brain blood barrier permeability and
overexpression of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Yet to this end we poorly
understand the mechanisms underlying the pathology in NCC patients, and have minimal
clinical means to prevent neurological complications in these patients. Effective treatment for
NCC remains a challenge, as the severity of disease symptoms is thought to be a result of
pathologic inflammatory response induced by the degenerating larvae.
We have pioneered an in vitro model of T. solium larval development, from the infectious stage
(the oncosphere), through large 60-day post-oncospheres. During these stages and until the
parasite reaches a mature larva or cysticerci, the parasite itself changes its protein expression
profile, however we have little to no information on the molecules secreted by each stage.
TGF-β plays a pivotal role in a large spectrum of infections with protozoa and helminths.
Besides the importance of host TGF-β signaling in the regulation of host-parasite interactions,
much evidence has shown that helminth parasites might directly influence the TGF-β dependent
pathway via the expression of TGF-β receptor and ligand homologues. Based on these studies,
we will take advantage of our in vitro model and examine the excretory/secretory (E/S) products
of the different larval stages of development of T. solium to test for immunomodulatory
functions, starting with TGF-β. E/S from the five different stages of T. solium larval development
(oncosphere, postoncospheres at 15, 30 and 60 days of growth and mature cysts), to proteomic
analysis by mass spectrometry, characterize each stage’s secretome and compare the
spectrum of secreted molecules between the stages. We will interrogate this new resource to
identify homologues of members of the TGF-β superfamily. Additionally, E/S proteins from the
different development stages of the larvae will be fractionated using both gel filtration and anion
exchange Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography to provide a resource for use in subsequent in
vitro assays in order to functionally test for and identify new immunomodulators.
We will then test T. solium E/S for TGF-β like activity utilizing in the first instance a sensitive
TGF-β reporter cell line. Positive E/S will then have its fraction profile tested to narrow down the
identification of candidate molecules to screen in vitro, and the active fraction(s) will be subject
to mass spectrometry. Subsequently, E/S will be tested in in vitro cultures of naïve CD4+ Tcells
with IL-2 and anti-CD3 in order to assess the induction of the transcription factor Foxp3, that
indicates that these cells have been induced to Tregs by a TGF-β homologue or mimic.
Molecules with positive activity will be identified and recombinantly expressed, their activity will
be characterized using the reporter MFB-F11 bioassay and in in vitro regulatory T cell induction
assays.
To identify TGF-β mimic proteins in the T. solium larvae has the potential both to change our
understanding of parasite adaptation to the host and to develop possible therapies for immune
mediated disease. In addition, understanding developmental signals required for parasite
maturation may open new avenues for pharmaceutical treatment of infection."
10827017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Investigating genetic differences that lead to significant variation in pain sensitivity and behavioral
responsiveness have contributed to the thorough mapping of the peripheral pain pathway. In contrast, the pain
pathway in the brain and the neural mechanisms underlying affective pain are relatively underexplored. By
looking beyond the commonly used C57BL/6J (6J) mouse line, I have identified a C57 subline, C57BL/10SnJ
(10SnJ), that shows a novel affective pain phenotype of increased pain-linked escape behavior in comparison
to 6J mice. Preliminary work has found that 10SnJ mice show increased neural activity in the ventral lateral
periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during pain-linked escape behavior. A wealth
of prior research has shown that the PAG is responsible for escape behavior initiation, and studies have identified
a glutamatergic circuit from the ACC to vlPAG that modulates pain. My hypothesis is that 10SnJ mice have
heightened ACC to vlPAG circuit activity that drives their massive pain-linked escape behavioral response. This
proposal will utilize the 10SnJ outlier strain and existing genetic tools in 6J mice to elucidate the role of the vlPAG
in pain-linked escape behavior. Studying this novel behavioral phenotype will increase our knowledge of the
circuits and cell types that govern affective pain and heightened pain states. In Aim 1, I will elucidate the vlPAG
cell type responsible for increased pain-linked escape behavior using first RNA in situ of known vlPAG specific
cell types to identify a target. The sufficiency, necessity, and specificity of this cell type for pain-linked escape
behavior will then be determined using excitatory and inhibitory Cre-dependent opsins and an associated 6J Cre
line. Next in Aim 2 I will determine the contribution of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit to increased pain-linked escape
behavior. I will first trace the circuit with anterograde and retrograde viral tracers in 10SnJ and 6J mice and
compare the circuit activity during pain-linked escape behavior using cFos immunohistochemistry. A 6J VGlut
Cre mouse line will then be used to determine the correlation of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit with pain-linked
escape behavior using in vivo fiber photometry targeting the vlPAG measuring a Cre-dependent calcium indicator
delivered via an anterograde tracer injected into the ACC. Finally I will determine the sufficiency and necessity
of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit for pain-linked escape behavior by stimulating in the ACC either an excitatory or
inhibitory cre dependent opsin delivered via a retrograde tracer injected into the vlPAG. The proposed study
would identify a vlPAG cell type and circuit responsible for the novel behavioral type escape behavior in
specifically painful situations. This proposal would add significantly to the field's understanding of how the vlPAG
contributes to the affective aspect of pain, and prepare me for a career as an independent researcher."
10826066,"Abstract:
Mechanically activated PIEZO2 channels are highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons mediating
light touch sensing and proprioception. While PIEZO2 is crucial for these sensory functions, little is known about
auxiliary proteins regulating its mechanosensitivity. We have identified TMEM120A (TACAN) as a robust and
specific negative regulator of PIEZO2 channels. TMEM120A was initially proposed to be a novel ion channel in
DRG neurons contributing to mechanosensitivity. We were unable to reproduce mechanically activated currents
from TMEM120A along with several other groups. TMEM120A’s structure does not resemble any known ion
channel, but it does have structural homology to Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids 7 (ELOVL7). Directly
supplementing cells with dietary fatty acids or activating lipid modifying enzymes can inhibit or prolong the
activation of mechanically activated ion channels. In cells co-expressing PIEZO2 and TMEM120A, we observed
a significant reduction in PIEZO2 mediated peak current amplitudes, but we did not observe any changes to
PIEZO1 or TREK-1 in TMEM120A’s presence. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS), we have identified a robust upregulation of lipids in TMEM120A expressing cells such as
lysophosphatidic acid, and phosphatidic acid. We also began determining whether TMEM120A’s lipid modifying
function is necessary for PIEZO2 inhibition. A single point mutation to a hypothesized catalytic residue within
TMEM120A resulted in significantly less PIEZO2 inhibition compared to wildtype. Supplementing cells with
dioctanoyl-phosphatidic acid (a lipid upregulated by TMEM120A) robustly inhibited PIEZO2 channel activity but
did not affect PIEZO1 activity. Using a light activated phospholipase D (Opto-PLD) that generates phosphatidic
acid from existing lipids in the membrane (predominantly from phosphatidylcholine), we observed significant
PIEZO2 inhibition but not PIEZO1. Our preliminary data indicate that TMEM120A specifically inhibits PIEZO2
channels by upregulating phosphatidic acid. Finally, we show preliminary data indicating that extracellular
application of carbacyclic phosphatidic acid (a cyclic analog of phosphatidic acid) reduces PIEZO2 current
amplitudes. Carbacyclic phosphatidic acid’s head group forms a ring structure with the glycerol backbone
reducing the likelihood of it being metabolized into lysophosphatidic acid or phosphatidic acid. Additionally,
administration of carbacylcic phosphatidic acid has been reported to alleviate mechanical pain in animal models.
The mechanism for this analgesic function remains an intriguing and open question. We propose further
investigation necessary to better assess how TMEM120A’s putative lipid modifying function specifically inhibits
PIEZO2 channels. We also propose further inquiry to determine whether carbacyclic phosphatidic acid
administration is sufficient to inhibit PIEZO2 channels in DRG neurons and reduce PIEZO2 mediated
mechanosensation (light touch and inflammatory mechanical allodynia). Generating additional knowledge of
this robust regulatory event will have a substantial impact in our understanding of mechanosensation."
10932989,"Molecular biology, genomics, and immunology are revolutionizing modern medicine by uncovering key molecular
markers in human diseases. Imaging technologies that can directly visualize these markers, such as immune-
positron emission tomography (immunoPET), are at the forefront of such innovation, reshaping current medical
practice. In this proposal, we take advantage of both the superior targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies
(mAb), and the amplification inherent in cell signaling by developing a T cell-based imaging method. Using
synthetic biology, we will develop engineered T cells with an antibody-derived chimeric receptor called “SNIPR”
that has an antigen-recognizing single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as an extracellular domain and an
engineered transcription factor as an intracellular domain. Upon binding its target antigen, SNIPR releases its
transcription factor, which migrates into the nucleus and induces the overexpression of various exogenous
reporter gene(s). This approach is fully customizable and versatile, and most importantly, can greatly enhance
sensitivity through multiple rounds of signal amplifications.
The main goals of this proposal are to establish the preclinical groundwork for SNIPR-PET in (1) visualizing early
glioblastoma and (2) tracking activated CAR T cells. In Aim 1, we will refine SNIPR T cells targeting EGFRvIII
and optimize SNIPR-PET reporter imaging strategies. In Aim 2, we will apply SNIPR-PET to the molecular
imaging of glioblastoma and compare its sensitivity and specificity with antibody-based immunoPET. In Aim 3,
we will image CD8+ therapeutic T cells, establish a correlation between PET signals and tumor response, and
enhance T cell penetration into brain tissues. The developed technologies will allow non-invasive monitoring of
biological/immunological responses within tumors, as potential biomarkers of successful therapy. This
collaborative proposal between Immunology, Radiology and Neurosurgery will provide a versatile and
customizable tool allowing cancer detection and treatment using engineered T cells.
Our proposal reflects a close interdisciplinary collaboration between Drs. Kole Roybal, (Immunology), David
Wilson (Radiology), and Hideho Okada (Neuroradiologic Surgery) at UCSF. Dr. Jaehoon Shin, an interventional
radiologist and molecular biologist, is another primary driver of this project- integrating molecular biology,
genomics, synthetic biology and biomedical imaging. We believe that our successful execution of the proposed
work will greatly impact human health by introducing novel T cell-based imaging to detect early cancers and to
enhance the safety profile of therapeutic T cells."
10951518,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The notochord is a highly conserved developmental tissue that extends along the anterior-posterior axis of all
chordates, including humans. It is composed of inner vacuolated cells surrounded by an external layer of
sheath cells that secrete a thick extracellular matrix. Inflation of the vacuolated cells within the restrictive
sheath creates a pressurized rod that supports locomotion in chordates and ultimately patterns the spine of
vertebrates. As such, the development of the notochord and spine are intimately linked, and defects in the
formation of notochord cells have been linked to scoliosis and vertebral malformations. The notochord is a
difficult tissue to study in mouse models since it is already replaced by the spine at the time of birth. In
contrast, the external development and optical transparency of zebrafish make them suitable for investigating
processes involved in notochord development and maturation. This proposal will use quantitative image
analysis, zebrafish genetics, and modern proteomics approaches to define the role of the inositol
polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1a (inppl1a) gene in notochord and spine development. Mutations in this gene
cause early notochord defects and thoracic scoliosis in zebrafish. In this fellowship proposal, I will test the
hypothesis that inppl1a regulates notochord vacuole inflation and, ultimately, the mechanical stability of the
notochord with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will determine the role of inppl1a in notochord vacuolation by
quantifying changes in notochord cell size and vacuole inflation (1.1) and internal vacuole membrane dynamics
(1.2). I will also define the temporal and spatial requirement of inppl1a during notochord development using
pharmacological and molecular-genetic approaches (1.3). In Aim 2, I will evaluate the mechanical properties of
inppl1a mutant notochords by manipulating mechanical stress (2.1) and vertebral bone mineralization (2.2-2.3)
during development. Finally, in Aim 3, I will define the protein interactors of Inppl1a in notochord and spine
development. I will use a candidate gene approach (3.1) and a proximity-dependent labeling strategy (3.2) to
identify additional proteins required for Inppl1a-dependent notochord vacuole inflation. To supplement these
approaches, I will also use modern proteomics techniques to build a comprehensive atlas of the notochord
protein interaction network (3.3). In doing so, I will build an invaluable resource for future investigation of
proteins involved in notochord development. Altogether, the work in this proposal will add to the knowledge of
how notochord cells vacuolate and will ultimately benefit our understanding of human skeletal health and
disease. Although the notochord is considered an embryonic tissue, it has been implicated in adult diseases,
including intervertebral disc degeneration and chordoma. Additionally, mutations in INPPL1 cause the rare
endochondral bone disorder, Opsismodysplasia. Therefore, this work in zebrafish will be significant because it
will likely reveal a conserved role for inppl1a/INPPL1 in skeletal development and disease."

1. Overall: Project Summary
The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to advance Yale's clinical research
mission. One year later, YCCI became the home of the Yale CTSA. At YCCIs inception, Yale was a national
leader in T0-T2 translational research, basic/translational science training, and it supported distinctive
fellowship programs such as the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program. Since then, the CTSA has
had a transformative impact linking diverse components of the Yale community in T1-T4 research, providing
the central infrastructure for the effective conduct of ethical, innovative, rigorous, and reproducible research,
and in training the next generation of research leaders. By any metric of scale, breadth, quality, and impact,
both the CTSA's research enterprise and its educational mission have been enormously successful for Yale.
This renewal application does not simply seek to maintain excellence, but to enable YCCI to drive the
continued transformation of the Yale T1-T4 translational research mission and its predoctoral and postdoctoral
training mission and to promote collaboration across CTSA hubs. First, it will support informatics and
computational advances that drive the emergence of a learning health system. In so doing, it will draw on the
Yale New Haven Health System, a six-hospital 2,681-bed consortium that provides more than 2.4 million
outpatient visits from patients from upper Westchester county, throughout Connecticut, and southern Rhode
Island. It will also prepare young scientists to draw on this infrastructure to conduct research that influences the
future of healthcare. Second, it will support technological and scientific advances in areas that will support the
emergence of personalized healthcare, including multi-omics and imaging. YCCI will provide pilot grant support
and training to foster the development of research careers and research teams that can deepen our insights
into pathophysiology and build toward personalized treatments. Third, it will engage a broader and more
diverse group of faculty, trainees, and community representatives to collaborate in the mission of addressing
healthcare disparities that constitute a major burden on patients, their families, and on public health. To
support this mission, YCCI will also foster the development of careers in community-based research from a
diverse group of young investigators and enhance the overall clinical research workforce."

Human immunodeficiency virus infects cells of the immune system and, if left untreated leads to the development
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and death. With the advent of antiretrovirals, HIV infection has turned
into a chronic infection. However, residual viral transcription is associated with increased risk for co-morbidities
in people with HIV infection. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint protein expressed
on latently infected CD4 T cells and in particular T follicular helper (TFH) cells. TFH cells are located in the germinal
centers and are enriched in replication-competent human immune deficiency virus 1 (HIV) provirus in people
with HIV. My proposal builds upon the pre-clinical work I performed in non-human primates in which we
demonstrated that anti-PD1 chimeric antigen receptor T cells eliminated all detectable PD-1 expressing TFH cells;
the first time the elimination of this reservoir of HIV has been reported. Unfortunately, it also depleted memory
CD8+ T cells substantially, which led to accelerated disease progression. Provided we engineer higher safety
and specificity, the high potency of anti-PD1 CAR T cells suggest it offers promise for a functional HIV cure. The
goal of the proposed project is to define the genetic architecture of a safer and more specific second-generation
anti-PD-1 CAR. Aim 1 is divided in two sub aims that describe the development of first, a more specific anti-PD-
1 CAR by integrating its expression under the control of an additional TFH-specific synNotch receptor and second,
a safer CAR by adding an ON switch controlled by a small molecule inhibitor. These experiments will
demonstrate that a second-generation anti-PD-1 CAR is highly specific in depleting TFH cells and has the
potential to abrogate viral replication within B cell follicles more specifically, thereby providing foundational
knowledge to enable further studies towards an HIV cure. My career goals are to become an assistant professor
at a top-tier academic research institution. I aim to lead a research program that investigates cell therapies that
can contribute to end the HIV epidemic by providing a functional cure on an individual level, thereby decreasing
the number of HIV carriers over time. To this aim, I will receive training to use a NHP lentiviral infection model in
to develop next-generation HIV cure therapies, while expanding my knowledge of cell engineering. Dr. Lawrence
Corey (FHCC) will act as the primary mentor, who has substantial experience in HIV persistence, development
of antiviral agents and clinical trials, while supported by an Advisory Committee with expertise in gene and cell
therapies, and NHP models of HIV. I will present my work at international conferences and to my mentoring
committee. I will receive training in laboratory management/leadership, grant writing, negotiation, and mentoring
to help me lead a successful research team. FHCC has superb research facilities, professional development
resources and administrative support, which will provide the infrastructure to support my research and career
development as a mentored staff scientist and ultimately, my transition to independence."
10840346,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CMS expanded telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries in March 2020, removing multiple barriers to the
provision of telehealth in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). While telehealth has the potential to reduce potentially
avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visits for patients in SNFs, there is very limited
evidence on the impact of telehealth provision for Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs. Furthermore, although roughly
25% of Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD),
there is no population-level evidence on the impact of telehealth provision in SNFs for beneficiaries with ADRD.
Although telehealth may improve access to necessary specialty care for patients with ADRD, there are numerous
ADRD-specific barriers to telehealth use. The overall objectives for this proposal are to examine telehealth
growth and the effect of telehealth provision on utilization, cost, and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries
with ADRD in SNFs and for beneficiaries generally in SNFs, and to examine facilitators of telehealth provision in
SNFs. Through the proposed training plan, which includes a combination of formal coursework, workshops, and
clinical rotations, as well as a multi-disciplinary mentorship team of NIH-funded investigators, the applicant will
gain clinical knowledge on the treatment of PAC patients, with a focus on patients with ADRD, expertise in
qualitative and mixed methods, and an understanding of telehealth implementation. Dr. Yu will use the methods
and content knowledge gained through these training activities to achieve the following specific aims: (1)
Examine the patterns of telehealth use for all SNF patients and for SNF patients with ADRD before and after the
expansion of Medicare coverage, and assess the relative change in SNF telehealth and in-person visits; (2)
Estimate the relationship between SNF telehealth provision and utilization, cost, and quality of care for all SNF
patients and for SNF patients with ADRD; and (3) Identify SNF characteristics associated with telehealth
provision, factors supporting or hindering telehealth provision in SNFs, and telehealth tools and technologies for
patients with ADRD. This application is innovative because it leverages a quasi-experimental approach to
estimate the causal effect of telehealth use, as well as a mixed methods approach to provide nuanced insights
into telehealth provision in SNFs, including current and emerging uses of telehealth in SNFs for patients with
ADRD. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new, critical evidence on the impact of
telehealth use for SNF patients, with a focus on patients with ADRD and on how telehealth is provided to patients
with ADRD, which may inform telehealth coverage policies and targeting of telehealth investments in PAC. This
K01
investigator

Award will provide Dr. Yu with the training and mentoring needed to become an R01-funded independent

10856957,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pineoblastoma is one of a family of childhood cancers that can arise through mutations in
microRNA processing genes DROSHA and DICER1. It is unknown whether these tumors
develop through shared or distinct oncogenic pathways, and there are no ways to
therapeutically target such mutations. To understand how these mutations cause cancer, we
developed a mouse model of pineoblastoma by ablating Drosha or Dicer1 in the developing
pineal gland. These mice develop tumors that resemble human pineoblastoma. They are highly
proliferative; they exhibit an expression signature of the embryonic pineal gland; and they
overexpress microRNA target genes. Among the microRNA target genes overexpressed in
these tumors is a set of developmental transcription factors, including Onecut2. Furthermore,
the binding sequences recognized by these transcription factors is enriched in regions of open
chromatin in these pineal tumors. In this project, we will investigate the role of Onecut2 in the
developing pineal gland and in pineal tumor development. In Aim 1, we test whether Onecut2 is
necessary for tumor development. In Aim 2, we investigate how Onecut2 interacts with other
neurodevelopmental transcription factors. In Aim 3, we explore whether ONECUT2 is required
in patient-derived models of pineoblastoma. If successful, this project would demonstrate that
mutations in DROSHA or DICER1 can arrest differentiation through developmental transcription
factors and that impairing the activity of these transcription factors could be a future therapeutic
strategy."

Having a co-occurring substance use disorder is a primary predictor of low treatment adherence and risk for
treatment dropout, and over 50% of people with FEP have a lifetime history of substance use disorder. Though
integrated treatments are available for individuals with substance use and FEP, they cannot be effective if clients
are not engaged in treatment. Clients with co-occurring substance use and FEP have limited reductions in their
substance use, as <20% successfully engage in recommended substance use treatment. These results call for
novel strategies that increase substance use disorder treatment engagement for this vulnerable population.
Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) is an evidence-based treatment that
significantly increases treatment engagement for transdiagnostic substance use disorders. CRAFT
acknowledges that people with substance use disorders may not be ready to change their substance use, and
it capitalizes on the motivation of family members as agents of change. Adapting CRAFT to a co-occurring
substance use disorder and FEP population has the potential to make a significant impact by increasing clients’
substance use treatment engagement and reducing their use. Since elevated family distress is associated with
both substance use and psychosis, reducing family distress may be a potential mechanism by which CRAFT
improves treatment engagement for this population. Many individuals with FEP have frequent contact with family,
but time, transportation, finances, and childcare are barriers to family members accessing additional services.
Utilizing telemedicine (video conferencing) mitigates these barriers, and such tools can achieve similar treatment
outcomes to in-person psychotherapy. To expand my background in cross-sectional substance use and
psychotic disorders research to psychosocial treatment research, I propose to 1) develop and refine a CRAFT
protocol for FEP delivered via telemedicine (CRAFT-FT) and in-person (CRAFT-F), and 2) conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial to test preliminary efficacy of CRAFT-FT with family members of people with
substance use disorders and FEP compared to treatment as usual (TAU) and CRAFT-F. Determining changes
in treatment engagement, substance use, and family distress will provide effect size estimation for larger R01
studies and advanced training. My mentorship team (Drs. Dost Öngür, Roger Weiss, Kim Mueser, Robert
Meyers, Janet Wozniak, and Jim Hudson) will provide comprehensive guidance to address my training gaps: 1)
treatment development, 2) telemedicine, 3) clinical intervention research, 4) advanced statistical methods, and
5) professional development (scientific communication/leadership) as I become an independent investigator. By
achieving my K23 research and training aims, I will gain the necessary expertise for my long-term career goal of
developing and implementing novel and accessible interventions while identifying predictors of treatment
outcomes for people with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders and their families."
10856003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A key feature of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is the excessive
deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and scar tissue. Fibroblasts persist in fibrotic lungs and lay down matrix,
contributing to a progressive and persistent phenotype in patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are
enzymes that cleave and break down ECM during wound repair and the degradation and removal of scar tissue
is essential for fibrosis resolution. The expression of MMP-9 is increased in the lungs of IPF patients. However,
MMP-9 is not present in the active form rendering it unable to cleave collagens. Our preliminary data in MMP-9
deficient mice support that active MMP-9 is necessary for fibrosis resolution. We therefore asked if MMP-9
activation is inhibited in IPF lungs limiting its ability to successfully initiate repair through matrix degradation.
MMP-9 is activated from its latent-form through a series of activating enzymes beginning with urokinase
plasminogen activating enzyme (uPA). uPA cleaves plasminogen into plasmin which in turn is a major activator
of MMP-9. However, in IPF, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibits uPA thus inhibiting the activation
cascade needed for downstream MMP-9-activation and matrix degradation. Due to the poor quality and
significantly reduced life expectancy associated with ILDs, it is becoming increasingly important to identify
molecular pathways that are targetable for therapeutic intervention. This proposal seeks to address this unmet
need by investigating the central hypothesis that MMP-9 activation by plasmin is necessary for fibrosis resolution
and that this pathway can be induced through beneficial TNF-a signaling. Based on our robust preliminary
studies, we propose three specific aims to test this central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
beneficial TNF-a signaling increases urokinase and expression of MMP-9 in fibroblasts. This will be tested using
genetic approaches to determine if conditional deletion of MMP-9 in fibroblasts is sufficient to prevent fibrosis
resolution in a spontaneously resolving fibrosis model and if exogenous TNF-a is sufficient to activate the
uPA/plasminogen/MMP-9 pathway, inducing resolution in a non-resolving fibrosis model. Specific Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that MMP-9 activation by plasmin contributes to the resolution of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. This
will be tested through the generation of a non-cleavable MMP-9 mutant and through pharmacological inhibition
of MMP-9 in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a clinical formulation of recombinant urokinase
(KinlyticTM) promotes the resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis by activating pro-MMP-9 through the
plasminogen/plasmin cascade. This will be tested by treating mice with persistent fibrosis with recombinant
urokinase to induce plasmin and MMP-9 activation as a mechanism of fibrosis resolution. The proposed studies
will provide a novel understanding about how activating an anti-fibrotic pathway (uPA/plasminogen/MMP-9) may
contribute to the resolution of fibrosis. Furthermore, the outcomes of these pre-clinical, therapeutic studies will
significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms that control fibrosis resolution."
10933003,"Genomicand environmental drivers of HCC in Non-Hispanic Blacks: Nature and nurture:
Non-Hispanic Black Americans (Blacks) develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at about twice the rate of
Whites and have far higher mortality. HCC has an atypical presentation in Blacks, with lower cirrhosis stage at
the time of HCC diagnosis and more advanced and aggressive HCC. Blacks have higher exposure to
environmental pollutants than Whites and these exposures are associated with liver damage. Although heavy
metals and toxins are known to cause liver injury and cancer, they are often overlooked. This project addresses
the need to understand the genomic and environmental factors causing the atypical presentation of HCC in
Blacks so that effective prevention and treatment strategies can be implemented. It is responsive to RFA-CA-
23-023 in the topic area: Liver cancer in underserved minority populations. This innovative collaboration between
experts in the Liver Cirrhosis Network and liver cancer researchers is expected to yield actionable mechanistic
insights into environmental exposures, tumor immunophenotype, and genetic factors driving the atypical
presentation of HCC in Blacks and may identify new targets for intervention and prevention. The study will also
yield a polygenic risk score for cirrhosis for use among ancestrally diverse populations. The results will alert
patients and providers to the fact that HCC risk is disproportionate to cirrhosis stage in Blacks, raising awareness
of the threat and encouraging early enrollment in surveillance. This project will expand HCC tumor sequencing
and transcriptomic data from Black patients over 4-fold. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has only 17 HCCs
from Blacks.
Aim I: Hypothesis: Mutational signatures of toxic damage are more prevalent in HCCs of Blacks than in HCCs
of Whites. We will perform whole exome sequencing on paired HCC/non-HCC specimens from Blacks and use
our in-house pipeline to identify somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), to find known and novel mutational
signatures, to define the tumor mutational burden, and to identify mutated genes.
Aim II: Hypothesis: The HCC tumor cells and surrounding microenvironment in Blacks are primed for pro-tumor
activity. We will perform global transcriptomic analysis on paired HCC/non-HCC specimens of Blacks to identify
oncogenic drivers and computationally immunophenotype the microenvironment. Multiplexed IHC will be used
to map the molecular findings onto the histological architecture of the patient's human liver specimens.
Aim III: Hypothesis: Blacks with HCC have a lower prevalence of cirrhosis risk variants than Whites with HCC,
but they have a high prevalence of cancer risk variants, including rare penetrant variants. We will compare the
prevalence of cancer predisposition variants in Blacks with HCC vs. healthy controls, develop
score
cirrhosis
a polygenic risk
for cirrhosis, compare cirrhosis risk between Blacks and Whites with HCC, and explore genetic risks for
in study subjects in the Liver Cirrhosis Network who develop HCC."
10861829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a large and growing worldwide public health epidemic. Because there is no cure
for AD, much clinical effort is focused on interventions targeting potentially modifiable risk factors. Recent
epidemiological studies have identified hearing loss (HL) as a major modifiable risk factor for AD. These
findings have prompted debate over whether HL specifically accelerates AD pathology, or if the link instead
reflects shared risk factors such as age, genetics, or metabolic conditions. Because human studies are
necessarily correlational, an animal model is necessary to determine whether HL specifically influences AD
pathology. We address this question in Aim 1 using the E4FAD mouse model of AD, which is homozygous for
the most prevalent genetic AD risk factor (ApoE4) and co-expresses five additional familial AD mutations. We
will determine whether HL induced by cochlear ablation accelerates AD pathology, including hallmark
accumulations of amyloid β (Aβ) as plaques and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), as well as increased neuronal
hyperactivity and reductions in memory-related sharp wave ripples (SWRs). Because these pathologies
emerge first within entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HC), we will assess cognitive impairment (CI)
reflecting EC-HC dysfunction (e.g., spatial memory). The expected results will be informative for clinical best
practices, e.g., by suggesting whether prevention and treatment of HL could itself mitigate AD, or if instead
targeting a common cause is needed to address both HL and AD. Independent of these outcomes, recent
studies in rodents have shown HL causes long lasting CI reflecting HC dysfunction. Although the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, they may include side effects of noise exposure in rodents (e.g.,
elevated stress hormones in HC), as well as psychosocial factors in humans (e.g., communication difficulty and
social withdrawal). However, recent rodent studies have documented CI following HL induced without noise
exposure (e.g., cochlear ablation), implicating mechanisms other than psychosocial factors and noise side
effects. A leading candidate mechanism in such cases is disrupted neuronal activity in the EC-HC which could
result from altered input from the auditory pathway following HL (e.g., decreased sound-related activity and
increased spontaneous hyperactivity). We address this possibility in Aim 2 through longitudinal physiology
recordings in EC-HC and auditory cortex (ACtx) before and after HL induced by cochlear ablation. We will
examine whether hyperactivity emerges in EC-HC in parallel with upstream ACtx, quantify possible reductions
in SWRs, and determine whether functional connectivity is altered between EC-HC and ACtx. The expected
results will clarify mechanisms of HL-induced CI and may suggest clinical responses to both HL and CI (e.g.,
pharmacological attenuation of hyperactivity). Collectively, our proposal will resolve outstanding unresolved
questions surrounding the role of HL in HC dysfunction including AD-related pathology. These findings will be
highly relevant to large clinical populations suffering disability due to AD and HL."
10861830,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a major class of cell signaling receptors and they play major roles in cancer
progression. In leukemia, and many cancers, aberrant activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal transduction
pathway is often observed. Various RTK mutations, such as those found on PDGFRB and FLT3, are found in
leukemia patients and often lead to hyperactivation of the kinase domain. This activation causes the subsequent
increase in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Because the cancer is driven by kinase domain
activation, many patients are responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment such as imatinib and
sorafenib. However, in a subset of patients, they become unresponsive to TKIs over time due to a resistance in
the cancer cells. One mechanism by which cancer cells can acquire resistance is through gaining a secondary
mutation in the kinase domain that makes the kinase insensitive to the TKI. In response, patients are often given
higher drug dosage or an approach to target multiple pathways simultaneously using combination therapy is
taken. These approaches are often impractical due to cumulative side effects that may be life-threatening. Thus,
further insights into the inner workings of cancer cells and mutations that lead to aggressive cancer phenotypes
are essential to identifying new therapeutic targets, especially, those on which multiple cancer-fueling signaling
pathways may converge. Daple/CCDC88C is scaffold protein that serves as a convergence point for three major
signaling pathways in a cell: Wnts, G-proteins, and RTKs. Because protein scaffolds can serve as central hubs
integrating cellular signaling, this raises the possibility of exploiting these proteins for therapeutic intervention.
Several gene fusion between Daple and PDGFRB or FLT3 have been found in cases of myeloproliferative
disorders and leukemias. The exact mechanism by which these gene fusions lead to constitutive activation of
the kinase domain remains to be tested and whether regions on Daple that is involved in the gene fusion can be
leveraged for therapy remains a mystery. Finally, because these mutations are rare, generating an in vivo model
for therapeutic testing in mice is often seen as unpractical. This proposal seeks to address these questions and
problems. Specifically, it seeks to understand how the Daple gene fusion affects hematopoietic cell expansion
using cell-based models and zebrafish. Also planned in this proposal is to expose how the coiled-coil domain of
the Daple-PDGFRB or Daple-FLT3 gene fusion affects protein subcellular localization and to determine if it is
responsible for the dimerization and activation of the kinase domain in cells. The strategy that will be employed
to target the dimerization point may also serve as a therapeutic strategy. Overall, these studies will give novel
insights into how Daple associated mutations affect leukemia cell signaling and growth and it will also establish
whether targeting this protein scaffold can be leveraged for cancer therapy."

Despite many years of research in humans and model organisms, there remains no clear consensus about which
diet is most compatible with human health. However, the premise of this statement is that a single diet is ideal
for everyone. Yet, among humans, there is a wide range in metabolic response to various diets, including body
weight, glucose tolerance, and plasma lipids. Genetically diverse mice show this same metabolic variability,
suggesting that genetics plays a key role in driving diet-responsiveness. In addition, the microbiome in both
humans and mice contributes to diet responsiveness through its metabolism of dietary nutrients and production
of potent metabolites. The premise of this project is that genetic interactions with diet and the gut microbiome
affect metabolic health. Using an outbred mouse model system that has as much genetic diversity as the entire
human population, the Diversity Outbred population, we will genetically map the gene loci that interact with diet
and the microbiome to affect cardiometabolic phenotypes. We will test two diets, a low-fat/high carbohydrate diet
and a high-fat/low carbohydrate diet. The mice will be phenotyped for glucose tolerance, insulin resistance,
weight gain, and circulating levels of lipids and metabolites. Using 15 stable isotope tracers, we will conduct
metabolic flux measurements using mass spectrometry-based isotopomer analysis, enabling us to interrogate
the major pathways of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism in multiple tissues. This will be the first time
metabolic flux has been subjected to a genetic screen. We will also map gut microbial composition, and gene
regulation in key metabolic tissues: liver, adipose, muscle and intestine. These studies will deliver
comprehensive genetic maps of these phenotypes. Through the identification of phenotypes that co-map, we
will perform mediation analysis to construct causal networks that link gene loci, metabolites, microbiome taxa
and physiological phenotypes. We will prioritize loci that are syntenic to human loci with significant metabolic
associations in GWAS. These results will provide metabolic markers that can help predict an individual’s
metabolic response to specific diets, the first step towards matching diets to individuals."
10861832,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed
world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no
model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study
of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors
secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and
function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but
fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With
advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual
function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in
vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and
wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to
date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging
therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare
normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively
define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular
alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection.
These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in
clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a
paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue-
level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell-
based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and
evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD."
10858748,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Small cell lungcancer (SCLC) is a pulmonary neuroendocrine cancer with very poor prognosis and limited
effective therapeutic options. Chemotherapy has been used for the past 30 years as for the treatment for SCLC.
While most SCLCs initially respond to this treatment, nearly all relapse. Recently, immunotherapies have been
introduced in SCLC treatment. While these treatments have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), they are only effective in a very small subset of SCLCs. Thoracic radiation is recommended in
the course of both limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES) SCLC. Radiation has been shown to induce
durable responses by engaging anti-tumor immunity. However, radiation therapy while effective in some
individuals, does not always convert immunologically non-responsive “cold” tumors to become immune
responsive “hot”. These observations highlight the need to develop new effective treatments for SCLC.
In many cancers, the loss of cell cycle checkpoints, together with oncogene activation, leads to cell survival even
with high levels of replication stress (RS) and DNA damage. Cellular pathways respond to RS, to ensure that
DNA is properly replicated and to prevent cells from prematurely entering mitosis. However, in most advanced
solid tumors, there is an increase in a variety of errors during DNA synthesis, disruption of the DNA damage
response, and mitotic catastrophe. This continuous and high degree of RS and dependence on DNA repair
provides a potential cancer vulnerability and therapeutic opportunity. The vast majority of human tumors
including nearly all of SCLCs are dependent on telomerase holoenzyme to bypass replicative senescence
resulting from telomere shortening with each cell division and this creates a dependency. We are proposing to
utilize a molecule that interferes with the function of telomerase to rapidly stop SCLC growth with minimal or no
cytotoxic side effects in normal telomerase silent tissues. In our preliminary studies, we discovered that this
molecule not only can kill cancer cells in culture dish, it can also activate the immune system when given
intermittently to the mice. We propose to discover how this molecule sensitizes SCLCs to radiation or
chemotherapy treatment (Aim 1), Induce immune responses (Aim 2), and to determine whether it can overcome
resistance to existing treatments (Aim 3). For this goal, we will utilize fully immunocompetent mouse models.
Therapies that activate immune system have been less toxic compared to other treatments and often provide
more durable responses in patients. We hope that our studies with this molecule will generate information to
develop rationally designed clinical trials which utilize combinations with minimal toxicity and maximum
therapeutic efficacy in small cell lung cancer"

Globally, pregnant people from sub-Saharan Africa, including Malawi experience some of the highest rates of
maternal and infant mortality (439 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and 46 infant deaths per 1,000 live
births) as well as high rates of psychological distress. For the health system to effectively reduce these poor
outcomes, it is imperative that quality of care improves during the perinatal period. CenteringPregnancy, an
innovative group antenatal care model recommended by the World Health Organization, addresses gaps in
prenatal care and there is a growing evidence base of positive results. Community building is a core
component of CenteringPregnancy, where women experience a dynamic process of connecting to their peers
and their providers, through consistent group meetings throughout their pregnancy. However, this core
component of the model is not well-defined. Therefore, the purpose of this mixed methods study is to
understand community building in group antenatal care in Malawi. This study will use the research
infrastructure and momentum of the ongoing NINR-funded (R01 NR018115) effectiveness trial for group based
antenatal care in Blantyre district, Malawi, to complete a secondary data analysis of the parent study data as
well as primary qualitative data collection. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Examine the differences in community
building as measured by peer connectedness, provider connectedness, and partner communication, between
the intervention and control group. Aim 2: Determine the difference in outcomes including psychological
distress and birth outcomes, by community building between intervention and control groups. Aim 3: Explore
how women perceive community building within group antenatal care and what changes, if any, they have
experienced in related to community building, specifically in connectedness, communication and decision
making within their relationship with providers, partner, family, and larger community. This study aligns with the
National Institute of Nursing Research’s strategic goal of improving systems and models of care to advance
women’s physical and mental health during pregnancy and postpartum. This training plan will begin a program
of research focused on the promotion of the health and well-being of pregnant and postpartum women living in
low-income settings. This study will inform the expansion of the effective intervention of group antenatal care
both in the US and globally."

 Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a bacterial pathogen that infects the lower
airways and is the main pathogen responsible for exacerbations of chronic inflammatory
pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD affects 6.4% of American adults and is the fourth leading
cause of death worldwide. Due to the persistent nature of NTHi, antibiotic resistance is increasing
and new therapeutic strategies are needed. Recently, a new virulence factor termed NTHI1441
was discovered through genome mining efforts. This protein is expressed as part of the
NTHI1440-1444 operon that contains the putative biosynthetic genes NTHI1443 and NTHI1444,
which show homology to DUF692- and DUF2063-family proteins, respectively. Homologous
operons, such as the methanobactin biosynthesis operon identified in methane-oxidizing bacteria,
encode a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural product
precursor and biosynthetic DUF692- and DUF2063-like proteins that form a complex to modify
the RiPP precursor peptide. Thus, I hypothesize that the NTHI1441 gene encodes a RiPP
precursor peptide that is post-translationally modified by NTHI1443 and NTHI1444 to
generate the mature virulence factor. The goal of this research proposal is to uncover the
molecular details of the maturation, structure, and function of the virulence factor using in vivo
and in vitro approaches. In Aim 1, the biochemical properties of the biosynthetic proteins will be
examined using spectroscopic, structural, and biophysical techniques. Aim 2 involves a mass
spectrometry-based proteomics approach to characterize the post-translational modifications
(PTMs) conferred to the peptide substrate as produced by combinatorial heterologous expression,
in vitro reconstitution, and isolation from the native organism NTHi to provide a detailed
understanding of the molecular structure and biosynthesis of the mature virulence factor. Finally,
in Aim 3, genetic knockouts of the biosynthetic proteins in NTHi will be constructed and used for
invasion assays to assess whether the PTMs are essential for NTHi virulence. The outcomes of
this project will provide insight into the highly conserved yet underexplored DUF692-family of
biosynthetic proteins and will also illuminate the structure and function of a key virulence factor,
which will establish the foundation for the development of targeted therapeutics to treat NTHi
infections."
10824930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Powassan virus (family Flaviviridae) is a reemerging tickborne virus endemic in North America and Russia. In
1997, a POWV-like agent was isolated from Ixodes scapularis in New England and determined to be genetically
distinct from the original human isolate. This revealed the existence of two lineages: lineage I, POWV (POWV
L1) and lineage II, deer tick virus (POWV L2). POWV L1 is maintained between I. cookei and woodchucks and
I. marxi and arboreal squirrels, while POWV L2 is maintained in I. scapularis and small mammalian hosts. This
distinction suggests an evolutionary progression of either POWV L1 or L2 into unique transmission cycles and
subsequent adaption to these new hosts. Tick, mammalian, and human isolates from New York State (NYS) are
typically identified as POWV L2, but for the first time in 45 years three POWV L1 isolates were detected including
isolations from I. cookei and the first known isolation of POWV L1 from I. scapularis. Additionally, within the same
timeframe in NYS, POWV L1 was identified in Dermacentor variabilis and POWV L2 in Amblyomma
americanum. With few available isolates, especially POWV L1, little work has been done to elucidate genetic
correlates that confer tick host specificity or the role of tick host responses in driving host-specific adaptation.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to utilize our emergent POWV isolates to understand genetic
correlates of tick host specificity and to investigate the potential for further adaptation to distinct tick
hosts. My previous work suggests introduction of POWV L1 into new tick hosts like I. scapularis facilitates viral
diversification and emergence of host-driven adaptations in proteins involved in immune evasion and replication.
Therefore, I hypothesize introduction of POWV L1 into distinct tick species leads to emergence of tick-specific
substitutions that contribute to increased viral fitness. Additionally, I hypothesize these changes will be tick
specific with distinct adaptation of POWV occurring dependent on tick species. To test this, I propose to:
AIM 1: Investigate the role of tick-driven, emergent substitutions in NS4b on viral fitness using a novel
POWV L1 infectious clone
AIM 2: perform experimental evolution of POWV in distinct tick species: Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor
variabilis, and Amblyomma americanum to assess changes in viral diversity and describe tick antiviral
responses to POWV
These studies will help further our understanding of POWV adaptation to novel hosts and host-specific, genetic
correlates that influence viral fitness. Additionally, these studies will contribute to the poorly understood tick
antiviral responses to POWV infection. Overall, this work may act as a model for tickborne virus spread and
establishment in new transmission cycles."

 Improve Gene Editing Efficiency
Abstract:
Engineered bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)
systems consist of a single guide RNA (gRNA) and the Cas9 protein forming a
ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) that can scan and cleave DNA. The gRNA consists of a 20
base targeting region complementary to the desired DNA target site, followed by an 80 base
scaffold region that binds and activates the Cas9 protein. Unfortunately, high editing efficiency
only occurs on a small subset of all possible DNA targets. Editing efficiency is hindered by
strong base pairing of the targeting to the scaffold region of the gRNA, and multiple groups have
shown that restoring said efficiency can be achieved via low throughput testing of mutations as
well as chemical modifications at predicted gRNA misfolding sites. Unfortunately, the vast
majority of low efficiency gRNA targets remain unresolved, and while targeting region predictive
tools to avoid low efficiency targets exist, no scaffold optimization tools that can fix said
efficiency have been developed. Our lab has pioneered a novel high throughput gRNA directed
evolution method that can select highly functional scaffolds from libraries of ~1E14 gRNA
variants for the Staphylococcus Aureus (sa) CRISPR system, the ortholog with the leading
editing efficiency used in AAV gene therapy applications. With the advantage of being encoded
for delivery in a single AAV vector. My preliminary data shows improvement of gene editing
efficiency via both RNP delivery and plasmid delivery, evolving hundreds of saCas9 gRNA
scaffold variants with 10 to 30% variation from the wildtype gRNA scaffold. We hypothesize
performing selection with clinically relevant targets will provide the best efficiency scaffolds for
these targets, while also expanding our gRNA toolkit. Furthermore, using these scaffolds in a
high throughput lentiviral screen, to feed into various structure and sequence-based machine
learning and deep learning algorithms, we expect development of a publicly accessible
efficiency prediction algorithm leading to improvement of editing efficiency on targets across the
human genome. This model will aid in finding the best possible match for improved gRNA
efficiency. This will free up time and resources associated with testing gRNAs while also
improving the wildtype efficiency paradigm that has ruled the CRISPR gene editing field since
its inception. The development of gRNA directed evolution in this Cas9 model, will serve as a
proof of concept for the accelerated gRNA efficiency optimization for the use in new CRISPR
systems. Furthermore, developing of Strong computational skills, especially in machine learning
and deep learning, will enhance an already productive career in academia, where I aim to
rapidly optimize CRISPR systems such as Cas9 guided transposons in my postdoctoral studies."

The prevalence of adolescent obesity continues to rise, with parallel increases in obesity-related comorbidities
such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our lab has demonstrated that youth onset
T2D (Y-T2D) appears to be a more aggressive disease than in adults, thus dedicated studies investigating
comorbidities of obesity such as CVD and T2D are critical. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral fat
depot that has anatomical proximity to the coronary arteries surrounding the heart and has been suggested as
an independent cardiometabolic risk factor in adults. EAT is a highly active metabolic tissue that secretes pro-
inflammatory factors and therefore is reasonable to expect EAT to have deleterious consequences in cardiac
health. However, the relationship between EAT and CVD in adolescents is less studied. Further, measurement
of EAT has been commonly performed using echocardiogram, which can result in poor image quality when
compared to gold standard MRI, or computed tomography which includes radiation risk. Thus, it is critical to
address early indicators of CVD such as EAT in adolescents with obesity and T2D. We propose to use novel
cardiac MRI methods to assess cardiac structure and function, including EAT. Further, it is important to study
the impact of diabetes treatments on cardiometabolic risk factors. Specifically, metabolic and bariatric surgery
(MBS) is now under investigation in youth with severe comorbidities of obesity and appears to elicit significant
weight loss, however there is less data on its impact on overall cardiovascular health in adolescents. MBS is
also being studied for its weight loss independent effect on metabolism and health, including on the incretin
hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) which has recently been shown to improve glycemic control and
even facilitate weight loss. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential independent
relationship between EAT and cardiometabolic health in Y-T2D and explore changes in EAT as a potential
mediator of changes in cardiometabolic health in response to MBS. To address this goal, the first aim of this
proposal will be to determine if baseline MRI-assessed EAT in Y-T2D correlates with cardiometabolic health,
independent of BMI. Adolescents undergoing MRI of the heart and aorta will have EAT volume measured and
related to cardiometabolic health. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the impact of MBS on EAT
volume in adolescents with T2D and if improvements are independent of weight loss, with the potential
improvements mediated through GLP-1 secretion. To summarize, this dedicated study in adolescents with
severe obesity and Y-T2D will add to the current gap in knowledge as there are no publications to-date
examining the effect of MBS on EAT, nor on cardiac or vascular structure or function, nor on the relationship
between EAT and cardiometabolic health in Y-T2D."

Disease-associated variation in the ABCA4 gene has emerged as the most prevalent cause of Mendelian
retinal disease affecting an estimated 50,000 people in the United States. The extensive clinical heterogeneity
of ABCA4-associated retinopathy, in short ABCA4-RD, which includes >40 clinical phenotypes entities (most
often called Stargardt disease (STGD1), cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP)-like, etc.),
reflects its equally large genotypic profile with >2300 known disease-associated variants. While the clinical and
genetic spectrum of patients of European descent has been advanced significantly since the discovery of the
ABCA4 gene in 1997, the same is practically unknown for underserved minorities, especially for patients of
African American (AA) descent. Only two studies have been performed in small cohorts of AA patients;
therefore, the absolute majority remain uncharacterized. Therefore, it is clearly necessary to fill this serious
void by comprehensive, integrated clinical and genetic analysis of ABCA4-RD in AA patients. We will test the
central hypothesis that, as in our previous studies in European patients, a combination of advanced genetic
screening coupled with quantitative clinical data and functional analyses of ABCA4 alleles from both coding
and non-coding sequences from the entire ABCA4 locus is necessary to unequivocally determine the ABCA4-
RD structure in AA patients. This program represents a collaborative effort between five centers, with
demonstrated expertise in recruiting and comprehensive clinical characterization of patients, including cases of
AA descent, deciphering genetic causes of ABCA4-RD, and ABCA4 functional studies. The program is
organized into three Specific Aims. The first Aim is dedicated to patient recruitment and clinical analyses,
research in the second Aim identifies and analyzes all variants in the entire ABCA4 locus and exome, and
defines genotype-phenotype correlations, genetically defined disease subgroups and the entire structure of
ABCA4 variation in AA patients. The third Aim is dedicated to functional analyses of most frequent ABCA4
alleles in AA cases by testing for their effect in structural modeling, protein function in in vitro assays, mouse
models and iPS-derived retinal organoids. The proposed research will uncover and functionally verify the most
frequent ABCA4 disease-associated variants in AA patients, thereby substantially advancing precise disease
diagnosis, will refine clinical prognosis for ABCA4-RD caused by specific ABCA4 alleles, resulting in variable
age of disease onset, expression, and progression. Integrating clinical, genetic, and functional data in the
analyses and, eventually into a prediction matrix will improve diagnostic accuracy, prognostic counseling and
will provide a platform for designing precise phenotype-specific treatment in clinical trials for ABCA4-RD in
African Americans."
10856480,"Reelin signaling enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity and increasing evidence
suggests Reelin serves a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reelin delays AD hallmarks
including amyloid plaque formation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive deficits, contributing to remarkable
resilience against AD. Reelin’s ability to enhance synaptic plasticity is dependent on its obligate
APOER2/VLDLR receptors that are prone to high degree of alternative splicing. We uncovered a diverse range
of human full-length APOER2 splice transcripts in postmortem AD brains and age-matched controls. Most of
the splicing events occur in functionally important domains such as the ligand-binding domains where Reelin
binds suggesting variation in ligand-receptor interactions and functional consequences related to Reelin
signaling; however, this has not been explored. The project includes three aims. Aim 1 seeks to determine if
alternative splicing of APOER2 and VLDLR, the obligate receptors of Reelin, impacts AD risk. Aim 2 will assess
the functional consequences of receptor splice variants on Reelin binding and signaling, proposing that specific
interactions may either protect against or increase AD risk. Finally, Aim 3 will explore the mechanism of Reelin's
resilience in AD-associated tau pathology, utilizing a CRISPR activation strategy to increase endogenous Reelin
expression with the goal of reversing tau pathology-related deficits. This project, poised to deliver high-impact

Traditional rehabilitation approaches following stroke involve 1:1 motor learning-based training to facilitate
recovery of upper extremity (UE) and lower extremity (LE) function. These time- and personnel-intensive
approaches are costly, yet leave ~75% of stroke survivors with residual disability. More effective alternative
approaches to facilitate motor recovery following stroke have not been adopted clinically due to excessive time
and cost. To advance clinical care, both effectiveness and cost of a candidate intervention must be considered
simultaneously. Aerobic exercise (AE) is known to improve cardiovascular function following stroke and central
nervous system (CNS) function in older adults and neurological populations. Strong theoretical arguments
suggest that AE may facilitate motor recovery following stroke. A protocol that rigorously tests this theory in the
subacute stroke population is warranted. Animal studies, coupled with our preliminary data, indicate a specific
type of exercise – forced aerobic exercise (FE), where volitional movements are mechanically supplemented –
improves motor recovery following stroke. The mechanical assistance provided by FE enables patients to
achieve a more rapid and consistent exercise pattern beyond their volitional capabilities while maintaining their
aerobic effort within a beneficial range. In our initial studies, persons completing FE cycling followed by a
reduced dose of UE motor task practice exhibited greater recovery of UE motor function compared to those
completing unassisted AE and motor task practice or extended sessions of motor task practice alone. Animal
studies have shown that FE triggers the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF-1), thought to be critical building blocks for neuroplasticity. Project Hypothesis: FE
facilitates high-intensity AE, which triggers growth factors essential for neuroplasticity, thereby `priming' the
CNS to facilitate motor recovery associated with motor retraining therapies. We propose a prospective,
pragmatic clinical trial to determine effects of FE in facilitating UE and LE motor recovery post-stroke in an
outpatient rehabilitation setting, to elucidate neural and biochemical substrates of FE-induced motor recovery,
and to evaluate cost effectiveness of a FE-centered intervention compared to traditional stroke rehabilitation.
Aim 1: Determine effects of FE+rehab vs. time-matched rehab on the recovery of UE motor function.
Aim 2: Determine effects of FE+rehab vs. time-matched rehab on recovery of lower extremity motor function.
Aim 3: Determine effects of FE+rehab vs. rehab on electrophysiological and biochemical markers of
neuroplasticity.
Aim 4: Evaluate cost-effectiveness of FE+rehab vs. rehab. The global effect of FE has the potential to enhance
recovery in a growing population of stroke survivors in a cost-effective manner, thus accelerating its clinical
acceptance. Our mechanistic aim will elucidate the effects of each approach on substrates underlying
neuroplasticity."

PAR-22-172 Mental Health Research Dissertation Grant to Enhance Workforce Diversity (R36): Transgender
and/or nonbinary (TNB) college students (those whose gender is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth)
are at substantially higher risk for mental health concerns (e.g. suicidality, depression) than their cisgender
peers (whose gender aligns with sex assigned at birth). Students of color and students of lower socioeconomic
status (SES) similarly experience disparities in mental health outcomes. However, no quantitative studies of
TNB college students have examined mental health outcomes across intersecting social positions of gender
identity, race/ethnicity, and SES, a notable gap in mental health equity research. Additionally, while a growing
body of literature connects state-level protective policies with improved TNB mental health, little research has
examined the role of TNB-supportive campus policies (e.g. insurance coverage for gender affirming
healthcare, TNB-competent counseling training) in TNB student mental health. Further, no studies have
investigated the impact of these policies collectively. In light of an increasingly anti-TNB sociopolitical climate in
the US and the aforementioned scientific gaps, further research on protective policy environments for TNB
students across intersecting social positions is urgently needed. To address these gaps, this project will draw
on Intersectionality, Minority Stress, and Ecosocial frameworks. Leveraging data from the largest national
study of US college mental health, the Healthy Minds Study, including new data on TNB-supportive campus
policies from 323 campuses, this project's objective is to use rigorous social epidemiologic methods to
examine the role of TNB-supportive campus policy environments in intersectional TNB mental health
disparities. The project's aims are to: 1) estimate mental health outcomes (depression and suicidality) across
intersectional groups defined by gender, race/ethnicity, and SES; 2) empirically categorize campuses into
distinct classes of TNB-supportive policy environments; 3) characterize the degree to which policy
environments impact TNB mental health outcomes across intersectional groups of race/ethnicity and SES.
These aims are consistent with priorities stated in the NIMH Strategic Plan (Goal 4 Objective 4.3) and the NIH
FY 2021–25 Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the Health & Well-Being of Sexual & Gender Minorities.
The project is innovative in its novel application of quantitative intersectional methods to advance health equity
in TNB mental health research. The proposed project is significant in that it will generate a nuanced
understanding of the role of TNB-supportive campus policy environments in college student mental health
across intersecting social positions, with the goal of informing campus policy interventions to improve TNB
mental health. Support for this project would lay the groundwork for future studies in the investigator's career
as a scientist researching equitable policy solutions for TNB mental health."

 The long-term goal of this project is to assess the utility of trans-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRSs)
in real-world, ancestrally diverse cohorts to predict health outcomes in clinical settings. PRSs represent a
numerical summary of an individuals’ genetic risk for a trait or disease based on combined effects of genetic
variants across the human genome. A PRS has many potential benefits such as efficient disease
screening/prediction and therapeutic prevention/intervention and may be useful in saving many lives and
resources. However, the application of PRS for risk prediction in clinical settings alongside non-genetic risk
factors such as lifestyle and environmental risk factors remains largely unknown, especially in
underrepresented populations, yet may be of added benefit. A better understanding of PRS utility for clinical
risk prediction, and limitations of PRS in diverse, real-world populations is needed to realize the potential
benefits of the applications of PRS across all populations.
 This proposal encompasses a training and research plan to develop the candidate’s expertise in
genetic epidemiology research. The specific aims are to 1a) Investigate the association of trans-ancestry blood
pressure (BP) PRS with hypertension incidence and progression in individuals across their life course, 1b)
Investigate the association of trans-ancestry BP PRS with incidence of BP-related health outcomes including
stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), dementia, kidney disease, heart failure and all-cause mortality in
ancestrally diverse individuals (F99 dissertation research); and 2) Assess clinical utility of trans-ancestry
prostate cancer PRS for predicting prostate cancer incidence and aggressiveness, incorporating prostate
serum antigen (PSA) level trajectories and other clinical risk factors (K00 postdoctoral direction).
 This proposed project will generate new knowledge and provide training for the candidate’s
advancement to become an independent investigator focused on genetic epidemiology of complex polygenic
diseases and traits in ancestrally diverse populations. The research is relevant to NHGRI’s bold predictions by
2030, number 6 “The regular use of genomic information will have transitioned from boutique to mainstream in
all clinical settings, making genomic testing as routine as complete blood counts” and number 9: “Individuals
from ancestrally diverse backgrounds will benefit equitably from advances in human genomics.”"

 The long-term objectives of this proposal include the following: 1) to generate cell-type-
specific chromatin profiles of the four cell types of the intestine, 2) to identify the effect crippled
silencing in intestinal stem cells has on progenitor cells, and 3) to characterize the
transcriptional changes associated with an age-related increase in the Polycomb Repressive
Complex-2 mark, H3K27me2, in the intestine. Cell-type-specific chromatin profiles aid the
specific gene expression patterns necessary for the function and identity of the cell. Complex
tissues are comprised of both stem and differentiated cells with different phenotypes,
transcriptional profiles, and roles within the tissue. The intestine contains a population of stem
cells responsible for replenishing damaged cells from the multiple stimuli exerted on the
intestine throughout the organism’s life span. However, the determining factors, especially at the
chromatin level, that make each cell type unique are unknown. Investigation into the chromatin
modifications of each cell type will provide insight into the unique roles each cell plays in the
function of the tissue. To generate gut cell-specific chromatin profiles, I will use CUT&Tag, a
robust and sensitive chromatin profiling technique that can be used with low cell numbers. I will
generate landscapes for chromatin modifications for all cell types of the gut to comprehensively
profile the epigenetic state of this tissue. Because of the importance of silencing modifications
for cellular identity and previous observations of loss of chromatin silencing affecting the gut
cells, I will investigate the effect of the loss of different chromatin silencing pathways in intestinal
stem cells on progenitor cells. Since the intestinal stem cells are the only mitotically active cells
in the intestine and the source of all other cells in the gut, their chromatin profiles likely affect the
progenitor cells. Additionally, observations of age-related increases in H3K27me2 in the
Drosophila melanogaster gut may indicate the protective role H3K27me2 has in preventing
pervasive transcription as tissue ages. The insights gained from this project will help us
understand the cell-type-specific chromatin profiles of cells of complex tissue and how
chromatin modification changes in stem cells affect their progenitors. My proposed project fits
the mission of NIGMS to fund research in fundamental biology that increases understanding of
the principles that underlie biological processes."

The most common cause of fluoroquinolone and multi-drug resistant UTIs are two E. coli strains that comprise clonal groups ST131-H30 and ST1193. Those pandemic multi-drug resistant strains (PMDR) have emerged 1-2 decades ago, are globally spread and, combined, are responsible for 60- 80% of the antibiotic-resistant UTIs. At the same time, PMDR appears to be able persisting for many months, possibly years in the gut and urinary bladder of healthy women, without them having symptoms of UTI or taking antibiotics. The objective of the proposed work is to investigate in detail the frequency, patterns and clinical risks of asymptomatic gut and bladder carriage of PMDR, identify possible means of the carriers de-colonization and compare on a genome-wide scale the PMDR isolates from women without and with UTI. Our preliminary data support that we can investigate sizeable samples of fecal and urine samples, establish the clonal identity of fresh isolates, and determine genome-wide the pathogenicity-adaptive genetic changes. We will determine how mutational changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions/deletions, etc.) and horizontal gene transfer contribute to the urovirulence of PMDR. For this, we will employ a population genomics- based analysis to trace the mutations and gene transfer, followed by assessment of the functional significance of the representative positively selected loci in PMDR. practical terms, accomplishment of the proposed studies will advance at the molecular level our understanding of the ecology, pathogenicity, and epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant uropathogenic E. coli and will provide information on possible targets for vaccines, antibiotics, or other therapeutics."
10828406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved outcomes for patients with various malignancies by
disinhibiting anti-tumor T cells; however, most cancer patients do not yet benefit from it. In situ vaccination
(ISV), which converts tumors into therapeutic vaccines via direct intratumoral treatment, is under investigation
as a means of potentiating ICB. ISV often consists of injecting tumors with agents that activate stimulatory
receptors on antigen presenting cells (APCs). However, this method of ISV has not yet been translated into
standard-of-care treatments for most cancer patients. This may be, in part, because of the secretion of
inhibitory cytokines such as IL10 that confer negative feedback in response to ISV, and thus represent a critical
barrier to progress in this field. Preliminary data in this proposal suggest that by incorporating an IL10 receptor-
blocking antibody (αIL10R) into ISV, tumor control is significantly improved. These data further suggest that
αIL10R enhances tumor control by two distinct mechanisms, and support the central hypothesis that αIL10R
enhances innate immune cells' ability to control tumors, in various in situ vaccines, by both a direct and an
indirect mechanism. The objective of this proposal is to interrogate this central hypothesis through the
proposed Specific Aims.
This work will provide ideal training for the candidate as he prepares for his long-term career goal of
investigating the mechanisms by which innate immune cells can enhance the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapy. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has a renowned immunology program. Dr. Jedd
Wolchok, the candidate's mentor, is a leader in the development of new immunotherapies, and the candidate's
co-mentors are experts on distinct aspects of innate immune cell biology. All have strong track records of
mentoring independent scientists. Together with the candidate and an interdisciplinary advisory committee,
they have formulated a rigorous training plan designed to increase the candidate's knowledge base in (i) innate
immunity, (ii) bioinformatics, especially regarding single-cell data, (iii) statistics, and (iv) practical skills related
to professional development. Training in these areas will occur through formal coursework, workshops, and
meetings with mentors and the advisory committee, who will evaluate the candidate's progress. This research
project and training plan will provide the foundation for the candidate to transition to a tenure-track position
leading an academic laboratory that is well positioned to compete for R01 funding. The candidate's ultimate
aim is to define new ways to enhance immunotherapy through the innate immune system, and thereby extend
life for patients with a range of solid cancers."
10828407,"ABSTRACT
Melanomas metastasizing to different organs often display heterogenous responses to therapies such as BRAF
inhibitor or anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) immunotherapy. This heterogeneity of responses may be due to strictly tumor
cell-intrinsic biological differences or more likely co-adaptation of the tumors with organ site-specific
microenvironments. However, most patient-centric studies of metastatic melanoma biology and/or therapeutic
responses are limited to one tumor per patient, with a predominance of tumors from more accessible sites such
as the skin. Thus, there is a dearth of clinically relevant knowledge of organ site-specific adaptations of
melanoma metastases and their possible influence on therapeutic responses. This project will derive this
knowledge through comprehensive analysis on not only melanoma lesions at distinct organ sites but also their
adjacent and non-adjacent normal organ tissues from warm autopsies.
Through integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of triplets of tumor, adjacent normal and non-adjacent
normal specimens, this study sets out to dissect the co-evolution of the tumor and its host organs. The
preliminary analyses have already revealed several pathway activations that may be related to MAPK inhibitor
(MAPKi) or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance in the brain, liver and spleen metastases. Aiming for
a larger set of specimens, the researchers will assess the tumor heterogeneity (at the genomic, transcriptomic
and pathway activation levels), their association with metastatic growth and MAPKi/ICB response patterns in
each metastatic organ. In parallel, the research team will examine the tumor-adjacent normal tissues' cellular
composition and pathway activations. These will also be correlated with organ-specific tumor growth and
treatment resistance. The PI's experiences in large omic integration analyses of MAPKi and ICB resistant
tumors will be a tremendous asset for the success of the proposed work. This study is expected to discover and
validate heretofore unknown determinants of organ-specific metastasis in melanoma and novel mechanism(s)
of resistance to MAPKi and ICB."

Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug available as an oral and topical formulation to treat pain,
migraines, and arthritis accounting for more than 13 million prescriptions in the US annually. The oral formulation,
which represents nearly half of the prescriptions for diclofenac in the US, is associated with severe adverse
events, including gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, and cardiotoxicity. Rofecoxib was a blockbuster drug with a
similar mechanism of action and side effect profile as diclofenac that was withdrawn from the market in 2005.
However, oral diclofenac remained available over-the-counter (OTC) until 2013, when reports indicated that
diclofenac was associated with a rofecoxib-like cardiotoxicity. This life-threatening risk led to regulations to move
oral diclofenac to prescription status in the US and Europe. However, the underlying reasons for the idiosyncratic
nature of diclofenac cardiotoxicity is unknown, and the drug remains OTC in many countries, including Australia,
China, India, Italy, Russia, and various African countries, posing a global public health concern. Compelling
preliminary data generated by the sponsor’s laboratory demonstrated that the intestinal drug metabolizing
enzyme, uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B17, is the major enzyme that catalyzes
diclofenac glucuronidation, which is a major route of diclofenac elimination. UGT2B17 demonstrates large
interindividual variability in expression and function, which is associated with toxicity, lack of efficacy, and drug
interaction liability of other clinically used drugs such as vorinostat and exemestane. Results generated from a
series of experimental and in silico studies further revealed that deletion of the UGT2B17 gene can lead up to
an eight-fold increase in systemic plasma exposure to diclofenac when administered orally. The applicant
recently showed that curcumin, the major curcuminoid contained in the popular spice and botanical dietary
supplement turmeric, is a potent inhibitor of the UGT2B17-mediated glucuronidation of diclofenac (IC50 of 14.5
µM, <1.0 µM when considering the unbound fraction). Considering that both diclofenac and curcumin are widely
used for chronic diseases such as arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, there is a high likelihood for
pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic curcumin-diclofenac interactions. This translational research project
will investigate the effects of UGT2B17 variability on the inhibition of diclofenac metabolism by curcumin in vitro
(Aim 1) and in human adult participants via a clinical PK study (Aim 2). Data from these studies will be used to
develop a physiologically based PK model (Aim 3) to predict the effect of UGT2B17 gene variability and varying
doses of curcumin on the PK of diclofenac in various patient populations (e.g., patients with gastrointestinal and
liver diseases, elderly, and pediatrics) that otherwise may not be feasible to study in the clinical setting. Results
will provide critical insights into the effects of UGT2B17 variability and curcumin on the disposition of diclofenac
to help improve the safety of this widely used drug. This novel project will elucidate the drug-gene-natural product
interaction potential of diclofenac, which can be extended to other UGT2B17 substrate drugs."

 Despite over a century of research on the causative agent of syphilis Treponema pallidum, many
questions associated with T. pallidum biology, and by extension syphilis pathology, remain unanswered due to
the previous lack of an in vitro culture system. Syphilis, a quickly growing global public health concern, is a
sexually transmitted, multiphasic disease with varied and devasting symptoms that can be fatal. As T. pallidum
lacks many classical virulence factors (i.e., lipopolysaccharide, toxins, secretion systems) and has a paucity of
outer membrane proteins, making it a stealth pathogen, it is unclear how T. pallidum causes syphilis. A growing
body of work has established released peptidoglycan (PG) monomers (i.e., muropeptides) act as toxins and
immune modulators. Many diderm bacteria have a highly conserved PG recycling pathway to transport
muropeptides released during normal growth into the cytoplasm for reuse. When this pathway is disrupted, highly
immunogenic muropeptides are released into the environment. Through bioinformatic analysis I discovered T.
pallidum lacks this recycling pathway. Modifications to PG composition and architecture affect immune
recognition and response, and our lab has identified unusual PG modifications in related pathogenic spirochetes,
Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Treponema denticola (periodontal disease). Additionally, the release of
unique muropeptides from B. burgdorferi during infection plays a causal role in the development of Lyme arthritis.
Thus, this proposal aims to test the hypothesis that T. pallidum naturally secretes unusual muropeptides that
drive syphilis pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, I will first determine the biochemical features of T. pallidum
PG as well as the fate and identity of released muropeptides via liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LCMS) and hNOD2 reporter assays. Second, I will elucidate the role of released PG in T. pallidum
pathogenesis by creating a novel CRISPR platform to target T. pallidum lytic transglycosylases and testing the
ability of CRISPR mutants to induce inflammation, induce chancre formation, and establish infection in vivo with
a rabbit model. Collectively this proposal will increase our understanding of T. pallidum biology and syphilis
pathology as well as create a new tool for the syphilis research field."

10861717,"This proposal seeks to understand mechanisms of auditory training (AT) and potential of AT to mitigate hearing issues that promote risk of development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Reports from the Lancet Commission (Livingstone and colleagues, 2020), and others, show midlife hearing loss is one of the greatest predictors of late-life dementia, and hearing aids protect against development of ADRD. While this has promoted a push for greater distribution of hearing aids, research from Gates and colleagues (2011) suggests that central hearing processes may be greater predictors of onset of ADRD than peripheral hearing (as addressed through hearing aids). Central auditory processing abilities are fundamental to understand speech, appreciate music, and separate competing environmental sound sources. Hearing challenges experienced with increasing age, especially understanding speech in noisy ambient environments, cause frustration with interpersonal verbal communication and detrimental long-term effects on functional independence, cognitive abilities, and overall quality of life, including increased risk for ADRD. Nevertheless, despite extensive research conducted across multiple fields, clinicians and researchers still disagree about the best ways to address the diversity of hearing difficulties individuals face throughout their lives. The guiding premise of the current proposal is the need for robust and reliable data sets to clarify the underlying mechanisms of AT and to identify the mediators and moderators that impact training outcomes. The overarching goal of this proposal is that better understanding of mechanisms of AT, with focus on speech in competition, can address the most prevalent hearing complaints reported by people as they age, and in turn mitigate transition to ADRD. To address this, we will recruit a large and diverse sample of older adults, including those with prodromal ADRD, and a comparison group of younger adults (1260 participants across training conditions, including separate samples of young and older adults). We will research how baseline cognitive and hearing measures predict training outcomes (moderators) and how these interact with training methods (mediators). To enhance rigor and reproducibility, we will release data sets and training/assessment tools to enable other researchers to conduct analyses, replicate our studies, and test their own training methods using common outcome measures. The proposed research will address four Specific Aims. Aim 1 – Determine the relationship of stimulus complexity and AT outcomes. Aim 2 – Determine the relationship of AT training structures and AT outcomes. Aim 3 – Determine relationships between participant characteristics (moderators) and AT approaches (mediators) on training outcomes. Aim 4 – Create an AT platform that facilitates faithful replication and modelling. Through the collection and dissemination of a large, unique, and comprehensive dataset, this proposal has potential for transformative impact by clarifying moderators and mediators of AT, and will afford translational opportunities to contribute to the mitigation of hearing and cognitive decline in individuals who may be at risk for the development of ADRD."
10861787,"This R35 MIRA grant application addresses a fundamental gap in understanding of the mechanisms that underlie
trauma-induced microvascular leakage, a hallmark of the systemic inflammatory response. The long-term goal
is to identify novel targets that can be used to ameliorate microvascular leakage in the context of traumatic injury,
in order to improve outcomes for trauma patients. To achieve this goal, the current knowledge of the cellular and
molecular signals that control microvascular permeability must be significantly expanded, including signals that
promote hyperpermeability and those that promote resolution toward normal barrier function. Also, very little is
known about how alcohol intoxication, which often accompanies traumatic injury, worsens microvascular leakage
leading to poorer outcomes for trauma patients. Until these gaps in knowledge are filled, physicians will not be
able to shift beyond current therapeutic paradigms to the next level of care required to save many patients that
worsen over time after trauma, developing sepsis and multiple organ failure. To significantly expand the current
knowledge base of how microvascular hyperpermeability develops and is resolved, the proposed research
capitalizes on emerging approaches that have become more widely available. These include RNA-Seq,
proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, which provide unbiased analysis of changes in expression of genes
and the molecular landscape. Applying these methods to experimental models of trauma or cells/tissues from
trauma patients will identify novel molecules associated with trauma-induced microvascular hyperpermeability
that will reveal answers to three key questions that must be addressed in order to advance new therapies: 1)
Which endothelial signals activated by alcohol intoxication and hemorrhagic shock sustain increased
microvascular leakage, and which terminate microvascular hyperpermeability? 2) Can sustained microvascular
hyperpermeability be accurately predicted and monitored using plasma biomarkers of endothelial injury or
leukocyte activation, to help guide therapeutic interventions? 3) How can fluid resuscitation be optimized to
reduce microvascular hyperpermeability, improve blood-tissue exchange, and better prevent organ dysfunction?
A multilevel approach will be used to answer these questions featuring an established, clinically relevant rodent
model of combined alcohol intoxication and hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, supported by cultured endothelial
cell models that will increase the depth of understanding about how the microvascular endothelium responds to
trauma/shock. This proposal also leverages the PI’s unique expertise with isolating intact venules for study, and
to maximize translational impact will utilize a novel human isolated venule permeability model. Finding answers
to these key questions is important, because having comprehensive knowledge of the signals that activate and
terminate microvascular hyperpermeability, the biomarkers involved, or what key factors in plasma are
endothelial barrier-protective, will permit logical development of new, personalized therapeutic strategies to
extend and improve life."

The public health success of FDA’s proposed ban on menthol cigarettes hinges upon whether menthol
smokers who are unable to quit smoking switch to non-menthol cigarettes (no public health gain) or to
potentially lower harm alternatives like heated tobacco products (HTP). In 2019, FDA authorized an HTP called
“IQOS” and its tobacco- and menthol-flavored “HeatSticks” (HS) as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP).
One issue relevant to FDA’s future action regarding IQOS will be “whether and how certain flavors may help
adult cigarette smokers reduce cigarette use and switch to potentially less harmful products” (FDA, 2018).
Understanding the potential for HTPs like IQOS to reduce the health burden of cigarettes requires targeted
research investigating the extent to which flavor availability is important for menthol smokers to switch to HTPs.
For one tobacco product to substitute for another, their abuse liabilities should be congruent. Validated clinical
lab methods exist for comparing tobacco product abuse liability by characterizing their nicotine delivery profiles
(via plasma nicotine and puff topography) and reinforcing efficacy (via subjective and behavioral measures).
Naturalistic assessment can validate clinical lab results regarding use patterns and product substitution.
The current study involves a two-arm, two-week, parallel group trial. The first week is an own brand (OB)
menthol cigarette baseline, during which tobacco use will be assessed daily using ecological momentary
assessment (EMA). On Monday and Friday, participants will complete clinical lab sessions that involve using
OB cigarettes and responding to subjective measures and an Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) task
that assesses willingness to substitute menthol cigarettes with an array of tobacco products including IQOS.
During the next week, participants will be randomized to receive IQOS-menthol (n=25) or IQOS-tobacco
(n=25); EMA and clinical lab visits will be repeated. Aim 1 assesses IQOS’ abuse liability in a clinical lab
setting. Outcomes include plasma nicotine levels, puffing behavior, responses about subjective effects, and
product substitution from the ETM task. Aim 2 measures tobacco use patterns in naturalistic settings where
participants will report daily OB and IQOS use outcomes via EMA. The overarching hypothesis is that, relative
to OB, IQOS-menthol’s abuse liability profile will differ less than IQOS-tobacco’s, suggesting that menthol
smokers will be more likely to substitute an HTP for combustible menthol cigarettes when a menthol-flavored
HTP is available. Results will deepen our understanding of the public health impact of HTPs and policies that
might restrict access to menthol-flavored MRTPs. Moreover, this application describes an excellent research
environment for the proposed work, supported by a collaborative mentorship team with relevant expertise.
Resultantly, the applicant will learn new skills in clinical lab assessments of tobacco products, behavioral
pharmacology, clinical trials and translational research, addiction medicine, and professional development.
This training will be invaluable towards the applicant’s goal of becoming an independent physician/scientist."

The objective of the proposed research is to improve the response to incident HIV infection by engaging the
networks of Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and transgender women (TGW) through a
combination of Partner Services, social network recruitment, and HIV genetic cluster detection. Despite
marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, HIV incidence has not substantially declined among
BMSM/TGW in the Southern United States (US), highlighting the need for innovative methods to detect and
respond to ongoing HIV transmission. While Partner Services can be highly effective, case finding remains
limited even for persons diagnosed soon after HIV acquisition (acute or recent infections). Partner Services
can also be limited in investigations across jurisdictional boundaries and in rural areas. We hypothesize that
leveraging the social networks (social contacts rather than only drug sharing or sexual partners) of networks
with recent HIV transmission will lead to improved engagement in HIV services (prevention or care). However,
such strategies must be responsive to the barriers and facilitators to engagement in these services including a
better understanding of social support networks. This project involves a multidisciplinary team including robust
public health partnerships and active community engagement to address HIV prevention needs and build on
existing resources. We will develop and implement an enhanced social network strategy (eSNS) for networks
of BMSM/TGW with new HIV diagnoses, including acute incident infection, in the high-burden Charlotte region
(Mecklenburg County, North Carolina), situated on the border of South Carolina. Both areas are priority regions
in the Ending the Epidemic (EHE) initiative. In the eSNS intervention, new diagnoses will receive rapid
response Partner Services for elicitation of social and sexual contacts; selected contacts will be recruited and
coached to recruit their peers to engage in HIV services. Aim 1 will employ regional genetic and contact
network analysis of incident and prevalent HIV in North and South Carolina, to evaluate important connections
(bridging) between states and between urban and rural areas. This granular data (contact, spatial, genetic) will
expand epidemiological understanding of the epidemic to inform development of the eSNS and enhance local
EHE strategies. To further inform eSNS development, Aim 2 will use a mixed methods approach to examine
the barriers and facilitators of engaging BMSM/TGW members of networks with recent HIV transmission. Aim
3 will then evaluate the eSNS with effectiveness and implementation outcomes. Effectiveness outcomes
(increase in testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis referral, and HIV care engagement) will be evaluated with
regression point displacement design comparing outcomes pre/post intervention in Charlotte and in
comparison, with the Raleigh region receiving standard of care partner services. Overall, the results of this
project will lead to critical information to guide new strategies in Partner Services and in EHE responses to
increase HIV care and prevention engagement among BMSM/TGW in the Southern US."

 Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a pressing public health problem nationwide but is increasing rapidly in
underserved communities where there is currently a shortage of services, particularly evidence-based
transitional opioid programs (TOPs) which link patients in hospitals to harm reduction and treatment resources.
Hospitals are ideal sites to address OUD and engage patients given the relationship between opioid use and
misuse and a number of acute health conditions, including overdose and infectious disease. Evidence
suggests that hospitals are highly motivated to participate in offering new interventions due to the economic
and social toll of untreated OUD. Safety net hospitals, however, face considerable barriers to adopting TOPs
and have been significantly less likely to offer OUD services in their communities. To engage safety-net
hospitals effectively and help them implement opioid programs such as TOPs, more information is needed on
implementation barriers to tailor implementation strategies that will be most effective given the local constraints
faced by safety-net providers.
 Using a combination of the latest publicly available community benefits reports and Internal Revenue
Service Schedule H data, we will catalog hospitals’ OUD services, including TOPs, and assess the relationship
between the adoption of TOP and various community and hospital characteristics, including safety-net status,
and examine trends in the availability of OUD services across time (Aim 1). We will then interview hospital
decision makers and community partners at five diverse safety net hospitals to better understand barriers and
facilitators to adopting and implementing TOPs. (Aim 2). Finally, we will convene an expert panel to identify
high-yield and tailored implementation strategies to increase the availability of transitional opioid programs and
other evidence-based opioid services in underserved communities (Aim 3). As an interdisciplinary team of
health services researchers, we have a strong record of collaborative publication and extramural funding
related to hospital-community partnerships and opioid services. The implementation strategies developed in
this study will lead to a future cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of tailoring
implementation strategies to safety net settings. The long term outcome is to increase the availability of TOPs
in communities where significant disparities currently exist."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a costly clinical problem that affects millions of patients
worldwide. CAUTI are characterized by infection of the bladder and pathogen colonization of the catheter
surface, making them especially difficult to treat. Catheter modifications have been employed to reduce pathogen
colonization, including infusion of antibiotics. However, with a rise in antibiotic resistance among uropathogen
strains, there is a great need to develop alternative strategies for effective CAUTI treatment and prevention.
Lactobacillus probiotics offer promise for a “bacterial interference” approach to prevent CAUTI because they not
only could compete for adhesion to the catheter surface but they also produce and secrete antimicrobial
compounds that are effective against uropathogens. Three-dimensional (3D)-bioprinting has enabled fabrication
of well-defined, cell-laden architectures with tailored release of active agents. We hypothesized that 3D-
bioprinting could offer a novel means for sustained probiotic delivery. We have capitalized on this technology to
design and fabricate a prototype 3D-bioprinted catheter tubing containing the widely used probiotic strain
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Our preliminary data already demonstrate that our initial bioprint prototype 1)
maintains probiotic viability upon extended storage, 2) displays sustained release of live L. rhamnosus, lactic
acid and hydrogen peroxide in vitro, 3) develops surface-associated L. rhamnosus biofilms, 4) inhibits
uropathogenic E. coli in vitro and 4) maintains L. rhamnosus viability and release in vivo in a mouse model. Here,
we will test the overarching hypothesis that the combination of probiotic bacterial interference and 3D-
bioprinting technologies provides an optimal framework for effective CAUTI prevention The objective of
this proposal is to optimize the design and fabrication of Lactobacillus 3D bioprints and to confirm their safety
and efficacy in vitro and in a preclinical mouse model, while advancing our understanding of probiotic interactions
with the host and uropathogenic bacteria.
Successful completion of the aims will deliver validated 3D-bioprinted prototypes that accomplish long-acting
delivery of probiotic species that ultimately improve outcomes in preclinical models of CAUTI. These studies will
provide the foundation for translation to reduce risks associated with urinary catheterization, while providing new
insights into the effects of lactic acid-based and probiotic therapeutics on host inflammatory response and CAUTI
disease markers and progression. Moreover, outcomes of this research will have a significant impact on the
development of future probiotic approaches in the context of other medical device-associated infections. The
successful completion of this project will deliver validated 3D-printed prototypes that enable long-acting delivery
of probiotic bacteria for the prevention and treatment of CAUTI."
10856703,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital vascular anomalies of the lymphatic system that cause life-
threatening complications. LMs most commonly arise in the neck, and affected children are often born with large,
disfiguring neck masses that obstruct the airway and cause severe functional deficits. LMs frequently become
inflamed and infected, and spread locally by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) of surrounding tissue.
This causes recurring episodes of pain and a poor quality of life. These episodes require recurrent antibiotics
and steroids and make surgery more difficult. There is no cure for LMs, but patients endure multiple resections,
injections, and laser treatments in attempts to control the disease, often for their entire lives. When it was
determined that LMs were caused by single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in in the oncogene PIK3CA, we began
prescribing two chemotherapeutic medications that target the PI3K/mTOR pathway, which is activated by these
genetic changes. While some patients experience reductions in LM size, many receive no benefit and none are
ultimately cured despite being subjected to severe side effects. In efforts to develop individualized treatments
that are more effective and safer, our laboratory performed the first ever multi-omic analysis of LM endothelial
cells (LM-ECs) which are responsible for LM growth. This integration of RNA sequencing, microRNA sequencing,
and proteomic mass spectrometry uncovered dysregulation of several pathways that control cell proliferation,
inflammation and infection, and ECM remodeling. These pathways are controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs),
which fine tune gene expression by silencing protein translation. By delivering miRNA mimics and inhibitors to
cells, it is possible to reverse the dysregulation of these pathways, which we have demonstrated by inhibiting
miR-21 and reducing LM-EC proliferation in a recent publication. We propose to deliver a topically administered,
nanocarrier-conjugated miRNA-21 inhibitor to LMs in an in vivo murine xenograft model (Aim 1). Based on
preliminary data, we expect this to reduce the growth of LMs and demonstrate a novel approach to treatment.
We will also characterize the mechanisms of the dysregulated miRNA-mRNA-protein pathways we discovered
that drive recurrent infection, and will reverse this dysregulation using miRNA mimics and inhibitors in vitro (Aim
2). These include cell surface receptors that bind immune cells (ICAM-1, CD44), and endothelial junction proteins
that maintain lymphatic vessel integrity (ANGPT2, JUP, DSP, GJA1). Finally, we discovered that LM-ECs
dysregulate two secreted ECM-remodeling enzymes (PLAT/RELN), along with their upstream miRNAs, and that
LM-ECs are activating ECM-remodeling in distant cells. By targeting these miRNAs, we will demonstrate
restoration of normal RELN/PLAT expression and reduction of paracrine ECM remodeling (Aim 3). The
completion of these aims will facilitate the development of a combinational miRNA-based therapy that
simultaneously targets the most pathologic mechanisms in LM-ECs. This would change the paradigm in the
treatment of all vascular anomalies and other diseases of the lymphatic system."

Anorexia nervosa (AN) has one of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric conditions due to long-term
physical complications and a suicide rate over 50 times higher than the general population. The mortality rate
encompasses a combination of the medical sequelae of underweight and death by suicide – and increases by
around 5% with each decade of illness. Around one-third of people with AN develop a chronic disorder. If AN is
not treated, serious complications such as heart conditions and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to
death. Despite the severity of AN, the neurobiological mechanisms that influence risk and treatment outcomes
in AN are poorly understood; AN is severely understudied compared to other psychiatric conditions. Little is
known about the alterations in brain circuitry and function in AN, and which brain changes predict future remission
or relapse. Findings to date often raise questions related to the acute state: What are the acute and lasting
effects of starvation? Which brain differences are related to the illness rather than undernutrition, and which are
reversible with treatment? Which clinical measures, risk factors, and brain abnormalities are most important in
understanding risk for AN and longer-term illness courses? To address these knowledge gaps, we launch the
ENIGMA Eating Disorders Initiative – a global alliance to bring together clinical and neuroimaging experts in
eating disorders worldwide to address pressing questions in AN research. This new international initiative is
a coordinated data analysis platform to determine multimodal neuroimaging signatures of AN from 31
diverse datasets worldwide. We build on our promising pilot data that shows 1) one of the largest effects on
brain structure ever observed among psychiatric conditions, and 2) some of the brain anomalies in AN are
reversible after weight restoration treatment in a subset of patients. Identifying circuits and functions that can be
restored, and in which patient subgroups, is critical. In the largest and most diverse worldwide dataset ever
analyzed (n~1,600 cases and ~1,700 HCs), we will identify multimodal brain biomarkers of AN, its driving
mechanisms, which brain abnormalities can be reversed, and in which patients. To boost statistical rigor,
reproducibility and power, our coordinated international alliance will pool diverse brain and clinical data
internationally using harmonized analytic workflows. We build on the successful launch of our ENIGMA Eating
Disorders working group, which published the most highly powered neuroimaging study of AN. Our Specific Aims
are to: (1) identify multimodal brain signatures of AN, with the power and diversity of data to understand which
brain signatures are reproducible in patients across the world; (2) disentangle undernutrition effects on the brain
from the aberrant brain circuitry that drives the condition and increases risk of relapse; and (3) longitudinally
assess relapse and recovery, to better predict remission and risk for AN. Our Precision Medicine approach
responds to NIMH’s mission to seek more reproducible, objective biomarkers of disease for individual monitoring
and management, to assist prognosis, and discover factors that influence relapse, suicidality, or recovery."

Mitochondria serve as a central signaling hub for innate immune responses. Disruption of mitochondrial function
is a hallmark for various infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. The overall objective of this proposal is
to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial membrane homeostasis and determine how
membrane disruption promotes inflammatory cell death. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are
associated with disrupted mitochondrial integrity and increased reactive oxygen species. They are also
associated with increased susceptibility to hormonal breast cancer, Crohn's disease, and mycobacterial
infection, strongly suggesting a role in innate immune function. Recently, the Watson lab set out to investigate
LRRK2's role in peripheral innate immunity, focusing on a gain of function mutation, Lrrk2G2019S. Mitochondrial
stress conferred by the Lrrk2G2019S mutation increases demand on the electron transport chain, which leads to
excessive ROS production. This increased ROS triggers a new type of cell death where a protein canonically
associated with pyroptosis, gasdermin D (GSDMD), can associate with mitochondrial membranes and cause
necroptotic cell death. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify the minimal domain within GSDMD that targets
mitochondrial membranes, enabling a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GSDMD's
newly described role in necroptosis. Aim 2 will investigate the contribution of various aspects of mitochondrial
dysfunction to GSDMD mitochondrial targeting and necroptosis, providing new insights into connections between
the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis and GSDM relocalization. With the goal of understanding how
mitochondria are impacted by genetic mutations and/or stress, Aim 3 will measure relocalization of the
mitochondrial inner membrane phospholipid cardiolipin in WT and Lrrk2G2019S macrophages and catalog
mitochondrial lipids in WT vs. Lrrk2G2019S macrophages. Defining the molecular mechanisms that drive
inflammation in the face of specific mitochondrial mutations will help enable therapeutic interventions designed
to correct specific aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious,
cardiac, and neurological disorders."

Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and many others, affect the quality of life of millions of people
worldwide. High-molecular-weight neurochemicals, such as neuropeptides and other polypeptide
neurochemicals, play critical roles in various aspects of these mental disorders. However, despite intensive work,
current measurement technologies, such as microdialysis or cyclic voltammetry, lack the spatial and temporal
precision and the molecular specificity to detect these larger molecules. Our long-term goal is to develop
advanced tools and approaches to understand where, when, and how neuropeptide corelease modulates diverse
behavioral outputs of the brain. Our immediate goal is to develop, optimize, benchmark, and fully validate a
wireless, multimodal neural probe for simultaneous membrane-free neurochemical sampling and
neuropharmacology in freely moving mice and rats. We will achieve this goal by pursuing the following three
specific aims: (1) to develop and characterize a push-pull microsystem for membrane-free neurochemical
sampling; (2) to develop a wireless, multimodal neural probe for simultaneous membrane-free neurochemical
sampling and neuropharmacology; and (3) to evaluate and characterize the efficiency and functionality of the
wireless, multimodal neural probe in vivo in freely moving mice and rats. The proposed research is innovative
for four key reasons: First, the wireless neural probe combines the membrane-free, push-pull microsystem with
a time-sequential fluid sampling device, thereby enabling the sampling of multiple neuropeptides and proteins
with spatiotemporal precision. Second, the probe provides simultaneous neuropharmacology and membrane-
free neurochemical sampling in awake, freely moving mice and rats, thereby making it possible to sample
multiple high-molecular-weight neurochemicals and in turn guide localized pharmacological stimulation through
a single platform. Third, the fully wireless, battery-free operation prevents the limitations that conventional wires
and tubing connected to external hardware impose on the natural behavior of animals, thereby offering a
tremendous opportunity to link neuromodulation and/or neurochemical release with natural animal behaviors
related to mental disorders. Finally, the probe has lightweight construction, thereby enabling the application in
small animals, such as mice, without inducing physical stress or disrupting their natural behaviors, a condition
important for behavior studies related to mental disorders. The successful completion of the proposed research
will yield wireless, multimodal neural probes with several innovative features for simultaneous membrane-
free neurochemical sampling and neuropharmacology during freely moving behaviors. We believe that these
neural probe systems will be of great interest to the neuroscience community as a way of elucidating the
molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant behavior, circuit dysfunction and altered neurochemistry associated
with mental disorders."
10829920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital ataxias generally result from dysfunctions and malformations of the cerebellum, particularly the
medial vermis. These disorders may result from the lack of proper developmental signaling cascades which
dictate the proliferation and formation of neurons. Primary cilia provide a hub for various developmental signaling
proteins such as SHH or WNT. Dysfunction in ciliary proteins leads to rare genetic disorders affecting human
development in the nervous system, optical system, and liver, kidney, and skeletal systems. Patients with
ciliopathies like Joubert Syndrome and related disorders display cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, thickened superior
cerebellar peduncles, and a deepened interpeduncular fossa. Components of the cytoskeleton, such as actin
and microtubules, play a vital role in ciliogenesis and the maintenance of existing ciliary components and
supporting scaffold. Although many cilia-related genes have been found to be causal for these disorders,
cytoskeletal regulators of the formin family and their relationship with cilia has not yet been fully defined, nor
have these molecules been previously associated with abnormal brain development.
Our lab uses a forward genetic approach to identify pathways critical to cerebellar development and degeneration
of neurons in this brain region. Through a chemical mutagenesis screening, we discovered an ataxic mouse
mutant with phenotypes similar to those observed in some ciliopathies: cerebellar hippocampal hypoplasia,
abnormal foliation, cerebellar elongation along the anterior-posterior axis, as well as the failure of the superior
cerebellar peduncle to decussate. By positional cloning, we identified a mutation at a splice acceptor in Fmnl2,
leading to exon skipping in Fmnl2 transcripts. Interestingly, levels of Fmnl2 transcripts in the brain of mutant mice
are unchanged compared to WT, but protein levels are reduced, suggesting that the in-frame deletion encoded
by this exon are necessary for stability of this protein.
FMNL2 is an autoinhibited cytoskeletal effector that has been previously shown to drive actin polymerization at
filopodia and lamellipodia tips of cultured cells. Although other proteins in this family have shown to bind and
regulate microtubules, actin, and influence cilia formation, whether this protein functions in microtubules and
actin during brain development is unknown. Using this novel mouse model, I will investigate the role of FMNL2
in actin and microtubule stabilization and determine how the hypomorphic loss of this protein may impact
ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance. These studies will enlighten our understanding of cerebellar malformations
and impact our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of microtubules and actin in human
ciliopathies."
10931613,"Project Summary/Abstract
While advances in resuscitation science have improved cardiac arrest survival, we lack therapies to improve
cognitive-affective outcomes in this patient population. Our lab has previously identified cognitive dysfunction in
a mouse model of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) which has been attributed to hippocampal neurodegeneration
and impaired hippocampal plasticity. However, no study has attempted to identify amygdala dysfunction after
GCI, despite clinical evidence of emotional dysfunction, such as anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). Therefore, it is important to identify the effect that GCI has on the amygdala, the emotional center of the
brain. Our lab has a well-developed, translatable mouse model of GCI, the cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary
resuscitation model (CA/CPR), that has been instrumental in assessing amygdala function after GCI. I have
utilized the amygdala-dependent delay-fear conditioning (DFC) paradigm to assess associative learning and
memory and have performed field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings in two circuits within the
amygdala, as measures of amygdala function. I have found a sexually dimorphic and circuit specific deficit in
amygdala function after GCI and am working toward identifying the mechanism of this dysfunction. I have found
that there is a male specific impairment in amygdala-dependent associative learning and a concomitant deficit
of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the cortical input to the basolateral amygdala. I have also found no evidence
that these deficits of amygdala function can be attributed to neurodegeneration within the amygdala. I have
verified that there are differential mechanisms of LTP induction between the two circuits and this difference has
led to the development of my hypothesis put forth in this proposal. The difference being, LTP of the cortical input
to the BLA requires functional NMDA receptors and L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), whereas the intra
amygdala circuit only requires functional NMDA receptors. Thus, I hypothesize that GCI induces dysfunction of
LTCC's within the BLA of male mice, thereby contributing to the deficits in amygdala-dependent behavior and
LTP. To assess this hypothesis, I have isolated and recorded LTCC mediated currents from BLA pyramidal
neurons. This method, while powerful, has yielded no significant difference between CA/CPR and sham animals.
However, a caveat of the method is that only somatic and peri somatic LTCCs can be measured. Therefore, to
fully evaluate my hypothesis, I have proposed more site-specific experiments that will evaluate the contribution
of LTCC's to synaptic transmission at individual distal dendritic spines. I will use two-photon calcium imaging of
individual spines in the BLA while electrically inducing LTP of the cortical input to the BLA. I will then use
pharmacology to identify the LTCC component of the calcium response and compare between sham and
CA/CPR animals."
10829828,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immune modulatory receptor expressed in
microglial cells in the brain. Coding variants in TREM2 have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Previous studies have extensively demonstrated that TREM2 plays a central role in microglia
activation/survival and amyloid pathology in various cell-based and animal models of AD. Despite evidence
demonstrating the functional importance of TREM2 in microglial biology relevant to AD, we currently do not have
a complete mechanistic understanding of microglial TREM2 signaling, due in part to the lack of a comprehensive
knowledge of TREM2-bearing molecular complex(es) in microglial cells. Most of the focus has been on the
interaction of TREM2 with DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12), which appears to serve as a communal platform
for downstream signaling. Given the complexity and high disease relevance of TREM2-associated biological
processes, it is conceivable that additional molecular components may interact with TREM2 and contribute
substantially to the regulation of relevant microglial functions. Therefore, we are proposing an unbiased
proteomic approach to identify novel components of TREM2-harboring protein complex(es), not yet implicated in
TREM2 signaling. Moreover, certain protein-protein-interactions involving TREM2 may be regulated in response
to TREM2 receptor stimulation and/or affected by AD-associated TREM2 risk variants. Since conventional
protein complex isolation methods are disruptive and often severely affect the stability of the complex, our
experimental approach will use an enzyme-catalyzed ""proximity labeling"" technique to investigate the protein
interactions in living cells. Specifically, the ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2)-based proximity-tagging method
combined with mass spectrometry will identify proximal endogenously interacting proteins of TREM2 in the intact
microglial cell. Successful completion of the proposed research will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the
complex biological regulation of TREM2. Our proposal will establish a protein-protein interaction map of TREM2
in microglial cells and may discover novel TREM2-interacting proteins that are critical for TREM2-mediated
microglial functions relevant to AD."

The obesity pandemic brings with it multiple attendant metabolic comorbidities, including Non-Alcoholic Fatty
Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is now the leading cause for chronic liver disease, with prevalence approaching
30% in certain populations, but may in fact be considered a “pre-disease” state for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
(NASH) and associated liver fibrosis. NASH has no approved pharmacotherapy, and is thus the fastest-growing
reason for liver transplantation. As the prevalence of obesity-related NASH continues to rise, and available livers
for transplantation remain limiting, this unmet need grows more urgent.
Intercellular crosstalk between lipid-laden hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs), including hepatic
stellate cells (HSC), determine obesity-induced liver pathology. To determine signals that mediate hepatocyte-
NPC crosstalk, we performed transcriptomic analysis in hepatocytes isolated from mice fed a NASH-provoking
diet. When compared to normal chow-fed mice, we found significantly increased expression of Cfd (Complement
factor d), which encodes Adipsin, a secreted protein thought uniquely produced in adipocytes that mediates
complement factor C3 cleavage. We first confirmed these data in three other dietary NASH mouse models, as
well as in liver biopsies from patients with NASH, all of which revealed increased liver (but not adipose) Adipsin
in NASH. These robust correlations prompted us to test potential of Adipsin to mediate NASH phenotypes. First,
as Adipsin cleaves complement factor C3 to two bioactive species – C3a, which binds C3aR1 on target cells,
and C3b that drives alternative complement pathway activation – we analyzed C3 knockout mice fed NASH diet,
which showed lower fibrosis than controls. Next, we transduced NASH diet-fed wildtype mice with a viral vector
encoding shRNA to Cfd, which phenocopied lower fibrosis seen in C3 knockout animals, in both prevention and
treatment strategies. Consistently, application of recombinant C3a increased HSC activity in vitro. These results
suggest that aberrant liver Adipsin plays a pathogenic role in NASH, which we will test in Aim 1 of this application,
including studies to test whether Adipsin-derived C3a acts directly on HSC C3aR1 to drive liver fibrosis. In Aim
2, we study mechanistic determinants of aberrant liver Adipsin in NASH. Preliminary data revealed a striking
induction of the master adipogenic factor PPARγ2 in mouse and human NASH. These data prompt the
hypothesis that a PPARγ2-mediated adipogenic reprogramming of hepatocytes in NASH is necessary and
sufficient to drive Cfd expression in the obese liver. Achieving the goals of this application will identify mechanistic
determinants of aberrant Adipsin expression and resultant liver pathology, and potentially lead to development
of Adipsin or C3aR1 inhibitors for NASH-induced fibrosis."

and cellular mechanisms. Besides the two to three years of support offered to full-time trainees, short-term,
summer training experiences are offered to medical and health professions (Doctorate in Physical Therapy)
students. The summer training program is designed to expose clinical students to the complex interdisciplinary
approaches needed to maximize neurorehabilitation approaches. The summer research experience has made
the short-term trainees more competitive for top flight residencies, and inspired health professionals to alter
their career path to develop into clinician-scientists. The predoctoral preceptors area composed of 15 basic
science and clinical mentors, along with 28 short-term mentors and administrative faculty. The mentors are
located within 13 academic departments in the School of Medicine and the School of Health Professions at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, and the College of Engineering at the University of Kansas-Lawrence.
The strength of this group is evidenced by the expertise and caliber of the research faculty, the outstanding
research infrastructure, the focus on translating basic neuroscience discoveries into treatments for neurological
disorders, and the collaborative interactions between the basic and clinical faculty that are needed for an
effective interdisciplinary training program. Laboratory research and apprenticeships, courses, seminars, guest
lectures, journal clubs, data sessions, and poster presentations are included in the program to ensure frequent
interactions between the trainees and faculty. A new feature of the program in this cycle is a more formal
relationship with the Bioengineering Graduate Program, allowing us to provide bioengineering mentors and
engineering content to our required course in Neurorehabilitation. The recruitment and selection of trainees is
overseen by an Internal Advisory Committee, with input from the participating faculty. In addition, the program
is monitored by an External Advisory Committee composed of national leaders in graduate training in
neuroscience, rehabilitation science and bioengineering."
10829876,"This proposal aims to develop advanced and scalable statistical methods for integrative analysis of large-scale
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks of common diseases, such as heart and lung
diseases. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic variants associated
with many common diseases, but are limited to common variants from a majority of individuals of only
European ancestry. Large-scale multi-ethnic WGS studies and biobanks have been rapidly arising to overcome
these limitations, and to study the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases and traits in both coding and
non-coding rare variants across populations. Examples include the NHLBI Trans-Omics Precision Medicine
Program (TOPMed) and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP), UK biobank, and All of Us. Various
omics data are also available in TOPMed. Full usage of these datasets can fuel genetic discoveries applicable
to genetically understudied populations. These studies consist of hundreds of millions of rare variants (RVs),
and their analysis faces several challenges. First, although several methods have been developed for RV
analysis, they have limited power for analysis of non-coding RVs, as their functions are unknown or cell-type
specific. There is a pressing need to empower RV Association Tests (RVATs) for non-coding variants by
developing more powerful statistical learning methods using integrative analysis and incorporating cell-type
specific variant functional annotations. Second, large sample sizes of WGS studies and data privacy
consideration of many national and institutional biobanks with unbalanced case and control ratios call for
distributed WGS analyses. Third, it is of substantial interest to develop polygenic risk scores using both
common and rare variants in WGS studies, and to investigate causal effects of biomarkers and omics’ markers
on diseases using Mendelian Randomization (MR) using both common and rare variants as instrumental
variables. This proposal aims at addressing these needs with four aims. First, we will develop statistical
learning based ensemble RVATs to boost power. This ensemble RVAT framework will be extended to use
cell-type-specific functional annotations calculated from single-cell assays, and to perform meta-analysis.
Second, we will develop distributed methods for important tasks in the analysis of large WGS and federated
biobank data: estimating population structure via distributed fast principal component analysis, distributed
methods for fitting generalized linear mixed models, and distributed RVATs. Third, we will develop methods for
polygenic risk score (PRS) using both common and rare variants in WGS studies, and develop Mendelian
Randomization methods for studying the causal effects of biomarkers and omics markers on diseases by using
WGS-based PRs as instrumental variables. Fourth, we will develop open-access statistical software capable of
implementing our proposed methods in both offline and cloud computing environments. We will apply the
proposed methods to the analysis of the TOPMed and GSP data and the biobanks."
10840348,"Injection drug use increases the probability of contracting HIV, and opioid use disorder (OUD) accelerates HIV-
1 infection through immune suppression and direct CNS actions. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is a major factor
in HIV-dependent CNS injury, but emerging evidence also suggests a loss of inhibitory GABAergic function in
neuroHIV. The parallel loss of Cl− homeostasis and GABAergic tone will worsen excitatory outcomes since
‘disinhibition’ results in net excitation. If this is true, then interventions that protect inhibitory systems are
predicted to at least partially negate ‘excitotoxic’ effects of HIV. KCC2 is the main transporter responsible for
maintaining [Cl−]i homeostasis and GABAergic function in the adult CNS and is the focus of proposed studies.
Although the idea of disinhibition as a driving force is embraced for other neurological disorders (e.g., autism,
certain epilepsies, opioid dependence, traumatic brain/spinal cord injury), it represents a conceptual shift about
mechanisms underlying synaptodendritic dysfunction in neuroHIV. The Cl− concentration inside neurons ([Cl−]i)
is small and the Cl− reversal potential (ECl) is close to the resting membrane potential. Thus, minor changes in
[Cl−]i can greatly affect the strength and polarity of inhibitory (e.g., GABAA) transmission. NKCC1 (Cl− uptake)
and KCC2 (Cl− efflux) co-transporters are key regulators of [Cl−]i, and KCC2 expression/function is essential for
adult neuron survival. Their balance can be regulated by cytokines/trophic factors (e.g., BDNF) from glia,
therapeutically (CLP290), genetically, and by opioids. Importantly, we find that increasing KCC2 levels/function
strongly protects against exposure to Tat, gp120, infectious HIV, and opioids in human and mouse neurons. In
vivo, maintaining KCC2 phosphorylation can normalize KCC2 localization in Drd2-expressing striatal medium
spiny neuron (MSN) cell membranes and reverse motor deficits due to HIV-1 Tat. Aim 1 uses in vitro models
including iPSC MSNs, infective HIV, and optical electrophysiology to identify mechanisms by which HIV and/or
opioids alter [Cl−]i homeostasis, dysregulate D1/D2 MSN excitability, how this triggers synaptodendritic injury,
and protective strategies. Despite its fundamental importance, the role of KCC2 in excitatory/inhibitory (E-I)
imbalances and altered ECl and EGABA have never been explored in the context of HIV/OUD. Aim 2 extends the
studies in vivo/ex vivo. 2 transgenic models (Tat+/-, HIVTg26) that both mimic clinical pathology with considerable
fidelity are crossed with transgenic mice expressing Drd1a-tdTomato (D1) and Drd2-eGFP (D2) to identify both
striatal MSN populations. Acute (2 wk) and chronic (8 wk) HIV/Tat exposure times are examined; separate
cohorts of mice (both sexes) receive concurrent, ramping exposure to morphine (s.c.). Comprehensive studies
of [Cl−]i regulation in MSNs (gramicidin-perforated patch physiology), synaptodendritic injury, and behavior
related to striatal function are performed ± the KCC2 enhancer prodrug CLP290 as an intervention strategy.
Alternative [Cl−]i regulation through NKCC1, TMEM16A, and CLC-1 are also tested. GCaMP8f expression in
D1/D2 MSNs in awake, behaving mice links striatal output activity to behavioral change (Inscopix miniscopes)."
10840349,"The premise of this project is that studying immune aging in laboratory mice that are
experiencing a natural burden of major infectious, psychological and physical stressors will
better mirror and inform immune aging in humans. Old age is accompanied by increased
vulnerability to infectious diseases, due to the aging of the immune system. Immune aging is, in turn,
substantially influenced by the presence of a lifelong, persistent infection with the cytomegalovirus
(CMV). In the past period of this award, we studied mouse CMV (mCMV) in isolation (as a latent
persistent mono-insult). We concluded that mCMV substantially degraded the healthspan of mice, but
only in the presence of major stressors, such as ionizing radiation or another infection.
 We propose to advance studies of mCMV and immune aging in mice experiencing a natural
burden of major infectious, psychological and physical stressors that are likely to be encountered by
humans repeatedly during the lifespan. We hypothesize that life-long latent mCMV infection
contributes to the demise of T-cell and global immune function, directly proportional to the
stress-induced viral reactivation and loss of immune control over mCMV. To test this, animals will
be exposed to (i) low dose ionizing radiation; or (ii) low dose stress hormone corticosterone; (iii) non-
specific pathogen free (non-SPF) microbiota, which has been shown to induce the immune system in
SPF mice to become similar to that of humans. We will test how this impacts mCMV reactivation and
immune responses to vaccination and lethal infection. We will ask:
 SA1. Do repeated individual stressors, commonly experienced by humans, worsen the
impact of mCMV on immune function with age?
 SA2. Is the impact of life stressors on immune aging and overall health in mCMV-positive
mice caused by CMV DNA replication/reactivation?
 These experiments will, for the first time, introduce key physiological variables of importance to
human immune aging into a well-controlled murine model of mCMV, aging and infection. We anticipate
that this poly-insult model will substantially mirror immune aging in humans, and provide ground for new
discoveries that will pave the way for combined antiviral and stress-control therapies to improve T cell
and overall immunity and healthspan outcomes in aging."
10840351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the U.S. and ranges
from simple fatty liver (or non-alcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) to the progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). About 20-30% of subjects with NAFL develop NASH, which is caused by hepatocyte injury, hepatic
inflammation, and resultant hepatic fibrosis. NASH can lead to life-threatening conditions, but is difficult to
diagnose at early stages. Liver biopsy is the current standard to diagnose NAFL/NASH, but biopsy is invasive,
has associated morbidity, and is limited by sampling errors and inter-observer variability. Many patients
present with later stage NASH, adversely impacting outcomes and healthcare costs, which are estimated at
$32 billion annually in the U.S. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including elastography (MRE), is a
technology that can non-invasively quantify hepatic fat (MRI proton-density fat fraction), iron overload (MRI
R2*), and fibrosis (MRE stiffness). However, current liver MRI is challenged by motion artifacts and incomplete
signal models, which can compromise the accuracy and reproducibility of the quantitative parameters derived
from them. In addition, early tissue changes associated with NASH are not adequately characterized using
conventional MRI. The common requirements of breath-holding and long protocols also severely limit the
adoption of liver MRI in the clinic. Furthermore, the present clinical interpretation of MRI has limited ability to
distinguish NASH from NAFL. The research teams at the University of California Los Angeles, University of
Arizona, and Siemens have been leading the development of motion-robust radial MRI to quantify hepatic
PDFF and R2*, T2 and T1, perfusion, and stiffness. The Siemens team has also developed deep learning
methods for medical image processing and disease detection and classification. In this bioengineering
research partnership project, the multi-disciplinary research team will investigate four aims: (1) Develop a
robust motion compensation framework for free-breathing multi-parametric quantitative radial liver MRI; (2)
Accelerate quantitative liver MRI scans through combined acquisition and joint modeling of multiple
parameters, data undersampling, and deep learning-based reconstruction and quantification; (3) Develop deep
learning models to accurately classify NAFL versus NASH and measure the degree of fibrosis based on
quantitative MRI; (4) Prospectively assess the new quantitative MRI and deep learning technologies for
classifying NAFL versus NASH and measuring fibrosis in patients, with respect to liver biopsy. The new free-
breathing quantitative MRI and deep learning technologies developed in this project will accurately classify
NAFL versus NASH and measure fibrosis using data from the entire liver and thus help to avoid liver biopsy,
allow monitoring of treatment responses, and accelerate the development and implementation of new
therapies."
10840365,"More than a third of all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in the brain, where they modulate
synaptic plasticity, memory and behavior, and also contribute to the pathophysiology of
neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, improved understanding of how GPCRs
several neurological and
operate in neurons is
fundamentally important to neuroscience, and will enable mechanism-based discovery of more selective and
efficient therapies for memory disorders and mental illness. In this proposal, we build on our transformative
finding that receptor activation on endosomal compartments underlies unique cellular responses. We propose
to explore the molecular consequences of endosomal receptor signaling in neurons, and to investigate how
neurons discriminate between distinct sites of local activation. We focus on the prototypical β2-adrenoceptor
(β2-AR), a recognized mediator of neuronal function, to test the hypothesis that the molecular composition of
signaling complexes present at endosomes is distinct from the plasma membrane resulting in unique neuronal
outcomes upon β2-AR activation. We will employ an interdisciplinary approach in human iPSC-derived neurons
to 1) delineate the consequences of compartmentalized β2-AR signaling on transcriptional reprogramming, 2)
elucidate the role of plasma membrane- and endosomal β2-ARs in translational regulation of gene expression,
and 3) determine how the endosome induces spatially biased GPCR responses. Successful completion of these
studies will illuminate how spatial GPCR regulation is established, and how it shapes critical neuronal outputs of
this pathway."

Project Summary
Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type
2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed
“atypical diabetes”, that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that atypical diabetes comprises a
spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g., MODY/monogenic, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes)
and unknown. During the current U54 funding cycle we established the Rare and Atypical Diabetes
Network (RADIANT), with a well-functioning infrastructure to identify and enroll participants with atypical
diabetes; a pipeline for harmonized screening and adjudication of enrolled participants; full genomic
characterization of participants via whole genome sequencing; transcriptomic characterization via RNA
sequencing; quantitative plasma metabolomics; patient-specific, inducible pluripotent stem cell-based
molecular physiology; enrollment of informative family members; and both standard and specialized
phenotyping for each participant. In the next cycle of RADIANT, we propose to continue to recruit persons
with atypical forms of diabetes to fulfill the original goals, together with discovery and analysis of the
mechanisms and pathways that define these new forms of diabetes, by achieving the following Aims: 1)
Continue the identification, genome sequencing, transcriptomic and metabolomic interrogation, and deep
phenotyping of individuals and families with atypical forms of diabetes; 2) Discover and describe new forms
of monogenic diabetes; 3) Expand and enrich the growing database to characterize atypical diabetes and
recognize different genotypic and phenotypic clusters; and 4) Determine the pathophysiological
mechanisms of atypical diabetes genomic variants. Thus, in the next cycle of RADIANT, our collaborative,
multidisciplinary and diverse group of accomplished diabetes investigators will expand our repository of
atypical diabetes cases, identify new disease mechanisms, target pathogenic pathways, advance our
understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and develop an improved, etiologically based classification of
diabetes."
10856132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mis-segregated chromosomes entrapped in micronuclei are susceptible to catastrophic shattering through a
process termed chromothripsis. The resulting DNA fragments subsequently undergo error-prone re-ligation, in
turn generating complex genomic rearrangements that are detected in approximately one-third of diverse tumor
types. Chromothripsis drives the punctuated evolution of cancer genomes by rapidly rearranging individual
chromosomes within a few cell cycles, which can simultaneously inactivate multiple tumor suppressor genes,
generate oncogenic gene fusions, and/or amplify cancer-associated genes as circular extrachromosomal DNA
elements. Therefore, a complete mechanistic understanding of the etiology of chromothripsis represents a critical
need toward defining how cancer cells acquire complex genomic alterations. Although chromothripsis may be
partially triggered by DNA damage within micronuclei during interphase, recent evidence support a second wave
of extensive DNA damage that is inflicted upon mitotic entry. The mechanisms underlying such mitotic DNA
damage and its contributions to chromothripsis are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we
leveraged a chromosome-specific micronucleus and chromothripsis platform to conduct pooled CRISPR/Cas9
screens targeting the mammalian DNA damage response. We unexpectedly identified multiple components of
the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway as a requirement for chromothripsis. Although the FA pathway is normally a
genome-protective DNA repair mechanism, our preliminary studies indicate that it functions abnormally during
mitotic entry to induce extensive fragmentation of under-replicated chromosomes in micronuclei followed by
mitotic DNA synthesis. We hypothesize that pathological activation of the FA pathway triggers chromothripsis
during mitosis through the cleavage of incomplete DNA replication intermediates that accumulate within
micronuclei. To test this central hypothesis, we propose three complementary aims to define the molecular
mechanisms driving the mitotic shattering of micronucleated chromosomes. First, we will comprehensively
characterize intrinsic defects associated with micronuclear DNA replication and determine the cell cycle stages
during which they arise (Aim 1). Next, we will investigate how the FA pathway functions to shatter micronucleated
chromosomes during mitosis, including identifying the structure-specific nuclease(s) involved in inducing
widespread mitotic chromosome cleavage (Aim 2). Lastly, we will examine the role of the FA pathway in
generating complex genomic rearrangements and extrachromosomal DNAs in experimental models of
chromothripsis and in FA patient cancer genomes (Aim 3). Successful completion of these aims will provide a
detailed mechanistic understanding of how mitotic errors instigate rapid karyotypic changes in cancer genomes.
These studies seek to provide paradigm-shifting insight into how defective DNA replication activates an
uncharacterized function of the FA pathway in triggering chromothripsis and cancer genome instability."
10823867,"Project Summary
Malaria parasites quickly amplify their numbers in both the human host and mosquito vector, with a single
parasite capable of creating dozens, hundreds, or thousands of daughter parasites. The formation of
merozoites (asexual blood stage, liver stage) or sporozoites (mosquito stage) involves the segmentation of
these daughter parasites within the bounds of the initial parasite. This segmentation process has best been
defined during schizogony in the asexual blood stage, during which the basal complex is assembled to direct
the appropriate partitioning of subcellular contents to each daughter cell. Several stable, core members of the
basal complex have been defined in both asexual and sexual stage development through complementary
experiments, but nothing is known about the composition or functions of the basal complex during the even
more complicated segmentation process involved in sporozoite budding.
Therefore, in this proposed work, we will investigate the process of sporozoite segmentation that occurs within
the Plasmodium yoelii oocyst using ultrastructural expansion microscopy, focused ion beam-scanning electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM), and proximity proteomics. This will enable three-dimensional microscopy-based
assessments across the process of sporogony that will focus on the involvement of the basal complex.
Proximity proteomics approaches will allow a cross-stage and cross-species comparison of the composition of
the basal complex, and provide a first view of how it changes over the lengthy process of sporozoite
segmentation, which takes up to 10 days in Anopheles mosquitoes.
In accomplishing this proposed work, we will advance our understanding of the cell biological processes that
underlie sporozoite budding with these complementary microscopy and proteomic approaches. Our focus on
the essential basal complex will provide the molecular landscape that is used for effective sporozoite
segmentation required to promote parasite transmission."
10824742,"ABSTRACT
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a poorly understood cutaneous malignancy with viral etiology. Most MCC tumors
feature monoclonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), which expresses viral T-Antigens (T-Ags).
Small T-antigen (sT-Ag) acts as a transcriptional co-regulator, while Large T (LT-Ag) principally functions to
sequester retinoblastoma protein (RB1) to de-regulate the cell cycle. The T-Ags are responsible for driving
tumorigenesis in T-Ag expressing (T-Ag+) MCC tumors: few mutations are present in T-Ag+ MCC tumors,
including in tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53, whose activities are instead repressed by the functions of the T-
Ags. Latent MCV infection that doesn’t result in T-Ag production is found in a substantial portion of the human
population, however MCC occurs only rarely. Much of what occurs between latent infection and the appearance
of a full-blown T-Ag+ MCC tumor has not been explored due to the lack of in vivo MCC tumorigenesis models.
Among the unanswered questions is how the MCV T-Ags induce a tumor transcriptional program that features
markers of multiple cell lineages, including both epidermal stem cell and neuroendocrine fates.
Previous research in our laboratory determined that SOX9-expressing (SOX9+) hair follicle cells, which give rise
to mechanosensory Merkel cells during fetal development, are also Merkel cell progenitors in adult skin.
Hypothesizing that T-Ags reprogram cells in the Merkel cell lineage to cause MCC, I generated transgenic mice
that express sT-Ag and ablate RB1 to mimic LT-Ag in SOX9+ cells. These mice developed tumors that were not
bona-fide MCC but expressed neuroendocrine markers, making these mice a valuable model in which to study
mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. Analysis of tumors at early time points revealed that re-
programming occurred only in specific sub-populations of SOX9+ cells and that reprogrammed cells were highly
apoptotic. Therefore, I hypothesized that specific landscapes of gene accessibility are required for T-Ags to
induce reprogramming from an origin cell and that suppressing p53 mediated apoptosis is required for MCC.
I propose to leverage the model of SOX9-derived, T-Ag driven neuroendocrine tumors to generate novel insights
into the mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. I will use integrated epigenetic and transcriptomic
sequencing analyses to characterize the gene accessibility and transcriptional landscape required for T-Ag
mediated reprogramming to occur and identify a native cell type that is competent to undergo reprogramming.
Furthermore, I will study how p53 suppression, which is commonly observed in MCC tumors, contributes to
advancing reprogramming. Altogether, the proposed studies will establish a model of T-Ag mediated
reprogramming in vivo and discover factors that enable T-Ags to reprogram cells. This research will not only
make valuable contributions to the field of MCC research but also to my training by exposing me to molecular
techniques and genomic and epigenomic analyses that are foundational to an independent research career."
10824590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
On-target resistance to small-molecule inhibitor therapy is a major challenge in cancer treatment. While the
design of novel compounds remains an important long-term strategy for obtaining selective and potent inhibition
of these mutants, further tumor evolution and resistance may occur. Treatment with multiple inhibitors that co-
inhibit the same therapeutic target has begun to gain traction as a viable clinical strategy to reduce the
emergence of resistance.
Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET/MET), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is an oncogenic driver in many
tumor types, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanomas. MET amplification also serves as an
escape mechanism following treatment with EGFR, ALK, or KRASG12C inhibitors, defining MET as a critical
therapeutic target. Some clinically approved kinase inhibitors (KIs) have activity against MET. However,
clinically-observed MET mutations promote resistance to certain KI subtypes that preferentially bind to active or
inactive kinase conformations. Defining which KIs should be used to treat patients presenting with specific MET
mutations is a pressing clinical need.
Combining as few as two or three KIs with shared activity against a target of interest maximizes on-target
selectivity by diluting each inhibitor’s off-target effects. In addition to maximizing on-target effects for MET alone
or MET and therapeutic co-targets, combinations of inhibitors with different binding modes could decrease the
probability of resistance emerging through further mutations.
The objective of this study is to define selectivity profiles for clinically approved KIs against clinically observed
MET mutants, and calculate KI combinations that would most selectively inhibit those mutants. This study will
investigate the hypothesis that combinations of clinically approved KIs can be calculated that will
maximize selectivity for MET mutants or MET/EGFR and MET/ALK, or with sotorasib for MET/KRASG12C
co-targets, and decrease the probability of resistance emerging. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring
the selectivity profiles of KIs for clinically observed MET mutants, predicting KI combinations, and testing
combinations in cells and in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. The primary rationale
for this work is that it will provide an actionable roadmap for MET mutation-specific targeted KI therapy in clinical
cohorts. Combinations of two or three clinically approved KIs with different binding modes that have been
selected to maximize on-target activity represent an actionable strategy to increase therapeutic potential and
decrease the probability of further KI resistance emerging."
10827958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 6 million people and has a major economic impact
due to early mortality and physical disabilities. It is endemic in Latin America but has become a global public health
concern following the migration of infected people. Disease progression that varies from symptomless to severe, has
been linked to both parasite heterogeneity and host-related immunity. Parasite persistence as well as the intensity of
the inflammatory immune response are determinants of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Understanding
components of host immunity will be crucial to the comprehension of pathogenesis and will allow design of novel
therapeutics.
The acute phase of Chagas disease results in polyclonal B cell activation that may be related to the important early
extrafollicular plasmablast (EF-PB) response that precedes germinal center (GC) reactions. In this direction, the
source of polyreactive antibodies (Abs) was not clearly identified. We initially considered that this polyclonal B cell
response would restrict anti-parasite responses. However, we observed that EF-PB produce parasite-specific Abs of
different isotypes and that signals via BCR, in some way, condition PB generation which requires the participation
of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Also, the EF-PB are the main source of IL-17 in T. cruzi infected mice and a fraction
of them produce IL-6 and other cytokines and express molecules related to antigen presentation. Of note, IL-17
produced by B cells/PB was shown to be key to sustain CD8+T cell activity and survival. Finally, we determined that
PB from T. cruzi infected mice express high levels of the ectoenzyme CD39, higher than T cells, which combined
with CD73 hydrolyze exogenous ATP to adenosine which plays immunomodulatory functions. The absence of PB
in early T. cruzi infection significantly increases the parasitemia, but on the other side, favors the earlier appearance
of GC and increases the frequency of TNF+IFN+ T cells suggesting a controversial role of PB. Our findings are
particularly timely given reports describing poor clinical outcomes in Covid19 associated with high PB responses.
Altogether, the results support our hypothesis that early EF-PB from T. cruzi infected mice have parasite control
capacity and can condition disease outcome. We are focused at further characterizing these EF-PB cell population/s
to determine their heterogeneity as well as its contribution to protection or pathogenicity. Using different strategies
such as single-cell RNAseq, analysis of somatic hypermutation, identification of antigen-specificity and affinity we
will perform detailed characterizations of EF-PB in T. cruzi infected mice. By using genetically modified mice, co-
culture experiments and mixed bone marrow chimeras we will be able to delineate the role of EF-PB and CD39 in
conditioning humoral as well as cellular responses in experimental Chagas disease. The identification of the EF-PB
characteristics and roles will be of great significance for the development of new strategies aiming at the
therapeutic targeting of B cells in the clinic. For instance, this innovative approach could provide information
required to develop an effective vaccine against T. cruzi."

Given the large impact of New Mexico’s food manufacturing industry, providing high quality,
consistent inspections based on the scientific principles of food safety is paramount to protecting
New Mexicans and consumers throughout the nation and world. Furthermore, the ability to
identify and respond quickly to public health events impacting New Mexico through a well-
planned and coordinated Rapid Response Team (RRT) is paramount to preventing the spread
and/or continuation of public health related events.
In addition to Several large food processors have operations in New Mexico (NM) including:
General Mills, Kraft, Coca Cola, Santa Fe Tortilla Company, Bueno Foods, Border Foods, and
Albuquerque Tortilla Company, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED-EHB) has
experienced a substantial surge in the number of small local producers seeking to begin food
manufacturing. In 2015 NMED-EHB identified an inability to keep up with the growing number
of questions and requests to provide assistance and speak to various groups or to develop a
program conforming with the MFRPS. Since obtaining “MFRPS cooperative agreement” in
2015, NMED-EHB has made significant progress in conforming with the MFRPS by achieving
conformance with five standards and through the expansion of staffing, has been able to begin
providing assistance to new and existing food manufacturers throughout the state.
In addition to having adequate resources and time to respond to questions, applications, plan
reviews, operational plans, recalls, training requests, and fulfilling staff training requirements,
NMED-EHB now also able to provide scientifically, risk-based inspections with a small team of
properly trained and audited inspection staff. Raising the level of staffing and education/training
of this team has proven immediately beneficial to NM-produced manufacturing as the team has
discovered significant issues previously undiscovered by other staff conducting manufactured
food inspections. Corrections are being handled in a timely manner in accordance with SOPs.
NMED-EHB anticipates participation in the Flexible Funding Model Cooperative Agreement
will result in further increasing the effectiveness of protecting public health nationwide and will
result in full conformance with the MFRPS by the completion of Y1 of this agreement. After
conformance is achieved in Y1, NMED-EHB anticipates maintaining conformance with the
MFRPS through established monitoring practices and will strive to continually improve through
envisioned continuous improvement initiatives. This will be accomplished by the following:
 • The State will achieve, monitor, and successfully sustain full conformance with
 the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) by completion
 of Y1;
 • The State will actively engage through an annual face-to-face meeting and
 participation in committees supporting MFRPS;
 • The State has and will collaboratively develop strategies and share those
 strategies with other states;
 • The State will provide FDA the foundation for pursuing regulatory action based
 upon the findings of State manufactured food regulatory programs; and
 • The State will seek to further enhance its capability to protect public health
 through development and implementation of Standard Enhancement Projects and
 continuous improvement initiatives.
The goal of this project is to build a manufactured food program to protect consumers throughout

Multiple preclinical and clinical studies show that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, FDA
approved agents used in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction, are a promising novel
treatment strategy for asthma. However, the key cellular targets and mechanisms by which GLP-1R agonists
reduce airway inflammation in asthma remain poorly understood. The rationale for the proposed research is
that a better understanding of the cellular targets and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of GLP-1 signaling is
required in order to maximize the clinical use of GLP-1R agonists for the treatment of both lean and obese
patients with asthma. The overall objective in this proposal is to identify the direct immunologic mechanisms by
which GLP-1 signaling reduces inflammation to inform the clinical repurposing of GLP-1R agonists in asthma.
The central hypothesis, based on preliminary data generated in the investigators’ laboratories, is that GLP-1R
agonists directly attenuate both type (T)2 and non-T2 cells and mediators in asthma. Guided by robust
preliminary data which supports that GLP-1R signaling regulates the function of specific human immune cells,
we will test our central hypothesis in two distinct, but highly integrated specific aims. We will determine the anti-
inflammatory role of GLP-1 signaling in 1) platelet-derived T2 and non-T2 inflammation and 2) CD4+ T cell
function in asthma. In aim 1, we will evaluate platelets from lean and obese asthma patients to determine the
role of GLP-1 signaling on platelet inflammatory mediator release (aim 1a). We will assess platelet aggregation
as a biomarker of the inflammatory and clinical response to GLP-1R agonist therapy (aim 1b), and the effect of
GLP-1R agonist therapy on platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte formation in patients with asthma (aim
1c). In aim 2, we will evaluate CD4+ T cells and platelet-adherent CD4+ T cells from lean and obese asthma
patients to determine the role of GLP-1 signaling on CD4+ T cell subset differentiation (aim 2a). We will assess
the effect of GLP-1R agonist therapy on CD4+ T cell activation in patients with asthma (aim 2b). This proposal
capitalizes on sample collection and mechanistic and clinical data from the investigator’s ongoing randomized
controlled trial of a GLP-1R agonist in asthma with comorbid obesity. This fully human approach is innovative
because it defines how GLP-1R agonists regulate multiple key immune cell populations, independent of GLP-
1R agonist effects on comorbid metabolic disease. This proposal is significant because it defines a precision
medicine approach for repurposing GLP-1R agonists in both lean and obese patients with asthma. This study
will inform the use of GLP-1R agonists in asthma and other inflammatory diseases in the absence of metabolic
comorbidity."

Research of the brain receptor functions holds a promise to provide better diagnostic tools and drugs that
could be tailored for the individual needs, thereby eliminating or reducing side effects and even providing
a way for prevention of diseases. Increasing understanding of receptor functions is revealing complex
and dynamic interactions between neurotransmitter systems. In the basal ganglia, dopamine (DA)
regulation of glutamate (Glu) neurotransmission is complex and the loss of DA-mediated inhibition in the
striatum f. ex. in Parkinson disease (PD) results in an imbalance of other neurotransmitters, mostly
excitatory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR)s are activated when there is excess Glu in the
synaptic cleft and therefore act as sensors and modulators when or where Glu transmission is enhanced.
This functional specificity makes them attractive pharmacological targets. The prevalent localization of
mGluRs in the striatum and limbic system supports their role in modulating DA and Glu-dependent
signaling and synaptic plasticity within the basal ganglia cortico-subcortical loops. A recent failure of the
first clinical trial focusing on agonizing of mGluR4 function inspired this project to investigate the
fundamentals of dopaminergic and glutamatergic interplay in PD-like neurodegeneration. We have
developed high level imaging instrumentation and techniques as well as unique ligands to conduct
quantitative in vivo imaging studies of dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurofunction. We have earlier
developed radioligands for PET imaging of dopamine transporters as well as pharmacological MRI
(phMRI) to investigate dopamine release. Recently, we have developed allosteric modulators as PET
imaging ligands for mGluR4 (presynaptic receptor) and mGluR5 (postsynaptic receptor) and
characterized them in experimental animal models. Now we are proposing to combine the phMR
imaging of amphetamine induced dopamine release or excessive synaptic glutamate concentration
induced by agonizing mGluR4 with mG4P027 (N-(4-chloro-3-((fluoromethyl-d2)thio)phenyl)picolinamide)
or antagonizing mGluR5 function with MTEP ((2-methyl-1,3-thiazo-4-yl)ethynyl pyridine) with
simultaneous PET imaging of mGluR4, mGluR5 and dopamine D2 receptor function to investigate
degeneration induced modulation of dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission using α-
synuclein rat model of PD and its additional 6-OHDA lesioned counterpart (combination model). Real
time imaging of receptor modulation will challenge the present theories of signaling and synaptic
plasticity during degenerative processes. The results of this receptor modulation can be readily utilized in
the drug development for dopamine-glutamate regulation related disorder, like Parkinson’s disease,
schizophrenia or drug addiction."
10861885,"ABSTRACT: Live nasal recombinant B. pertussis vaccine against tuberculosis
An effective TB vaccine that blocks infection and interrupts transmission of TB from infected adolescents
and adults is urgently needed as a complement to the worldwide use of BCG in infants. Although BCG is
moderately effective in preventing disseminated forms of TB, new vaccine strategies are necessary for
improved control and prevention of TB which infects over 10 million people annually. True correlates of
protective immunity have not been identified. However, local, lung-resident memory T cells have been
implicated in protection against pulmonary forms of TB in many prior animal model studies. Furthermore,
recent evidence shows that IL-17 secreting T cells that are enriched in the lung tissue of infected humans
are likely involved with immunological control of pulmonary infections. New vaccine strategies are needed
that can induce mucosal response and better induce protective T cells in the lungs. Our vaccine strategy
will advance a live vaccine platform based on B-Tech, an attenuated strain of Bordetella pertussis, which
has already completed Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated ability to induce durable and specific
mucosal and systemic immune responses. We propose to develop the platform bacterial vector (called
B-Tech-Mtb) for intranasal vaccination. B-Tech strains transiently colonize the nasopharyngeal mucosa in
animal models and humans and induce mucosal (including secretory IgA and resident memory T cells)
and systemic (including serum antibodies and circulating T cells) responses against pertussis antigens.
In addition, B-Tech vaccines are lyophilized, have >2-year stability at 25°C, and can be produced by most
if not all developing countries at low cost. In murine studies, transient colonization induces a resident
memory T cell response that is associated with protection against B. pertussis infection. Indeed, transient
colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa by B. pertussis results in targeting of mucosal dendritic cells,
the induction of Th17 T cell responses, and high expression of IL-17 that is associated with the
development of robust secretory IgA and resident T cell memory in the lungs. We propose to engineer
genetically modified bacterial systems developed in our labs for expression and secretion of several Mtb
hybrid antigens that have been tested clinically as parenteral vaccines. We will construct and test B-Tech-
Mtb vaccine candidates after intranasal administration in mice and non-human primate models, secreting
selected M. tuberculosis antigens continuously in the vicinity of mucosal inductive sites. By developing B.
pertussis strains secreting one or more Mtb antigens, we anticipate that Th1/Th17 skewed T cell
responses will be more robust than observed in prior vaccine studies with other mucosally or parenterally
administered TB vaccine candidates. With success, this program will enable production of enhanced Mtb-
specific mucosal immune responses, including resident memory T cell responses, leading to protection in
TB challenge models."
10861889,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The maintenance of O2 homeostasis is a critical component of human health. Its disruption, for
example, contributes to the pathophysiology of many devastating diseases, including heart,
lung, and cerebrovascular disease. In addition, pervasive reductions in environmental O2
availability at high altitudes pose a serious threat to the growing number of people worldwide
that live above 2500 meters. For example, long-term exposure to high altitude hypoxia can lead
to chronic conditions such as Chronic Mountain Sickness, as well as negative pregnancy
outcomes, heart failure or even death. This is because under conditions of chronic
environmental hypoxia, several physiological responses aimed at maintaining homeostasis
under acute hypoxic conditions can lead to maladaptive remodeling of the pulmonary
vasculature and increases in blood viscosity that can overburden the heart. In the Velotta lab,
we study wild, high-altitude deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model to understand the
integrated evolutionary mechanisms that allow animals to overcome these challenges. Deer
mice are a well-suited model: they are broadly distributed across > 4000 meters of elevation in
North America, are easily captured in the wild and manipulated in the lab, are rich in
physiological and genomic resources, and most importantly, have adapted over evolutionary
time to the extreme conditions of high altitude. Over the next five years, my lab will dissect the
genetic and molecular mechanisms by which natural selection has reshaped deer mouse
physiology at high altitude. We will use quantitative genetics to identify, for the first time, the loci
that underlie adaptive variation in physiological response to hypoxia, coupled with detailed RNA-
sequencing and network-based transcriptomic approaches to identify the regulatory pathways
that underlie such responses. Combining these approaches allows us to pinpoint the genetic
architecture of evolved physiological change at high altitude. Finally, we will use our
understanding of underlying genetic architecture to directly test for the form, direction, and
strength of natural selection on physiological traits during adaptation to these extreme
conditions. The large-scale and ambitious series of experiments outlined in this proposal will
yield new insights into high-altitude biology and medicine and may lead to novel therapeutic
targets for diseases in which the disruption of O2 homeostasis is central to their pathology."

 Synthetic biology offers transformative technologies for constructing or rewiring gene networks to create
novel biological functions. However, the rational engineering of complex biological traits remains very
challenging. To address this, we propose to integrate synthetic biology and computational modeling to engineer
cellular aging, an intricate, multifaceted biological process crucially related to various diseases, including cancers
and neurodegenerative disorders. In this proposal, we choose to focus on replicative aging of budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a genetically tractable model for aging of mitotic cells in mammals, such as stem
cell. We previously found that genetically-identical yeast cells age through two distinct routes with different
molecular and cellular changes. About half of the cells age with chromatin silencing loss, leading to nucleolar
decline, whereas the other half age with heme depletion, resulting in mitochondrial deterioration. We further
revealed that the fate decision and commitment to the two aging paths are governed by a core gene circuit
comprised of the lysine deacetylase Sir2 and heme-activated protein (HAP) transcriptional complex. Sir2 and
HAP inhibit each other, resembling a toggle switch to drive the divergence in aging. Very recently, we used
computational modeling to guide our network engineering and rewired the Sir2-HAP circuit to create a synthetic
oscillator that dramatically slows aging by avoiding the cell’s commitment to either of the two natural aging paths.
Building on these results, we hypothesize that engineered oscillations in pro-longevity factors (e.g. Sir2 and
HAP) can be a general strategy for enabling dynamic homeostasis to slow cell deterioration and promote
longevity. To test this, we will systematically tune the amplitude and period of the Sir2-HAP oscillator to optimize
its effect on longevity (Aim 1). We will then apply the same design principles to engineer oscillations in the
proteasome (Aim 2) and energy sensing systems (Aim 3), both of which are considered as pro-longevity factors,
but their constitutive overexpression/over-activation negatively impact cell physiology and lifespan. We will
systematically evaluate the effects of oscillations on damage accumulation, aging phenotypes/hallmarks, as well
as the lifespan, and will evaluate the mechanisms underlying their effects. We will construct computational
modeling to guide the design of synthetic gene networks and to quantitatively analyze the dynamics and effects
of engineered oscillations to advance our mechanistic understanding of aging processes. If successful, the
proposed research will not only further our basic understanding of aging in natural systems but also establish a
general strategy for promoting longevity applicable to diverse aging processes and organisms."
10856810,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The goal of this proposal titled “Monitoring response of neoadjuvant therapy in primary bladder cancer using
hyperpolarized 13C MRI” is to develop a metabolic imaging biomarker to assess neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NAC) in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), a previously unexplored translational opportunity. This will be
accomplished by using novel quantitative hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
to assess changes in glycolysis in response to anti-cancer therapy using patient derived xenografts derived from
previously untreated tumors. NAC has been associated with a pathologic response in 40% of patients with a
complete response in up to 25%, there is significant overtreatment of non-responders. Identifying patients who
are chemosensitive would not only provide a benefit to them but would spare unnecessary toxicity and a possibly
fatal delay in radical cystectomy for patients who are chemotherapy resistant. Although cross-sectional imaging
is a cornerstone in the management of patients with MIBC at initial staging and during follow-up it has not been
applied successfully for monitoring response to NAC. Lack of specific and sensitive non-invasive means to
monitor response currently limits clinical application and value of NAC for MIBC.
 In Aim 1 we will employ 6 PDX of known response to gemcitabine and cisplatin, the most commonly
prescribed NAC regimen, to evaluate the ability of quantitative imaging marker kPL, the apparent rate of
conversion of pyruvate to lactate, reflecting glycolysis, to monitor the response to said combinatorial
chemotherapy, using HP MRI. Aim 2 will lay the groundwork for providing a biological basis for the value of kPL
as an imaging biomarker of treatment response or resistance and also as a predictive marker. Additionally, we
will explore other basal metabolites and pathways that are informative of treatment effect and to develop
complimentary imaging markers in the future. Given rapidly expanding clinical studies of HP MRI, positive
preclinical results can be swiftly translated to a clinical trial."
10824881,"Investigating the role of PEX11 in peroxisome architecture
Peroxisomes are critical organelles housing numerous metabolic reactions including fatty acid β-oxidation
and reactive oxidative species decomposition. Although peroxisomes are classically thought to be single
membrane-bound organelles enclosing an aqueous lumen, it has been recently established that
peroxisomes can contain pervasive intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). How these suborganellar compartments
form and impact peroxisome function remains unclear. The applicant discovered that mutants lacking two
isoforms of PEX11, a membrane-shaping protein implicated in peroxisomal division, have major defects in
generating ILVs. This new role for PEX11 in ILV formation raises questions about other PEX11 functions.
This project will elucidate the roles of PEX11 isoforms in all aspects of peroxisome membrane shaping
events, including ILV formation, peroxisome division, and de novo peroxisome biogenesis. The experiments
will utilize Arabidopsis because its large peroxisomes allow facile visualization of peroxisome architecture
using confocal microscopy, and its specialized peroxisomal metabolism enables robust whole-organism
readouts of peroxisome function. In the first aim, null mutations in all PEX11 isoforms (PEX11A-E) will be
generated using a CRISPR-based approach in a line that allows visualization of peroxisome membranes
and lumen. Because ILV formation is implicated in peroxisomal fatty acid catabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation
defects will be assessed by monitoring triacylglycerol content and seedling growth. Additionally, a unique tri-
fluorescent reporter system that separately marks the peroxisome membrane, lumen, and individual PEX11
isoforms will be employed to visualize PEX11 dynamics and function within the context of ILVs. The second
aim will revisit the canonical function of PEX11 in peroxisome division and a recent suggested function in de
novo peroxisome biogenesis. Peroxisome division will be examined by quantifying the number and size of
peroxisomes in various pex11 mutants compared to wild type and established peroxisome division mutants.
Peroxisome biogenesis will be observed by visualizing the transition of pre-peroxisomes to mature
peroxisomes and monitoring peroxisome maturation rates. The evolutionary conservation of PEX11 roles in
these processes will be probed using heterologous expression of human and yeast isoforms. Beyond
advancing our understanding of cell biology and organellar evolution, illuminating the cryptic peroxisomal
processes of ILV formation, peroxisome division, and de novo biogenesis could enhance agricultural
sciences and reveal the etiology of human pathologies, such as peroxisome biogenesis disorders. In
addition, the accomplishment of these aims will be a core component of a comprehensive training plan to
enable the applicant to progress towards an independent academic research career."
10825069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incorporation of C–F bonds into small-molecule therapeutics can dramatically improve their pharmacokinetic
properties, including bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic stability. In accordance with the profound positive
impacts of fluorine incorporation, approximately 20% of all pharmaceuticals contain fluorine. Aryl–CF3 linkages
are a particularly common motif, present in approximately 15% of all fluorinated pharmaceuticals. Yet, a major
drawback of current catalytic trifluoromethylation methods is that commonly employed CF3 sources can be very
expensive, limiting the economic viability of trifluoromethylation reactions on large scales. Therefore, the
development of an efficient trifluoromethylation protocol employing an inexpensive CF3 source would significantly
improve the discovery and synthesis of new fluorinated pharmaceuticals.
 Trifluoroacetate (TFA), which is produced annually on multi-ton scale, could serve as the desired inexpensive
CF3 source. However, the decarboxylation of TFA to generate reactive CF3 radicals (●CF3) is notoriously difficult,
due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nature of the CF3 group. Recently, the Nocera group employed a
silver(II) complex to achieve the first example of visible-light-induced TFA decarboxylation using a well-defined
metal complex. However, this method’s use of stoichiometric silver(II), as well as the incompatibility of the
reaction conditions with oxidatively sensitive substrates, limit the practicality of this advance.
 The objective of this proposal is the development of a practical, catalytic trifluoromethylation method. The
stoichiometric, silver(II)-mediated method developed in the Nocera group will be modified to be catalytic in silver,
with the catalyst turned over electrochemically. This method will be applied to the production of other difficult-to-
generate radicals that are relevant to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, a rational ligand design
campaign will be undertaken to develop silver(II) complexes that are compatible with oxidatively sensitive
functional groups. Finally, the catalyst ligand environment will be modified to stabilize ●CF3 in the secondary
coordination sphere, allowing for catalyst control over the precise delivery of ●CF3 to substrates. The proposed
research is expected to constitute a significant synthetic advance in the field of radical trifluoromethylation.
 The Nocera laboratory at Harvard University is the ideal environment to accomplish the proposed research
and training goals in preparation for a career in academia. The Nocera group will provide invaluable training in
many areas of inorganic chemistry, particularly in the development of photo- and electrochemically driven redox
reactions and in the deployment of mechanistic techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and
photocrystallography. Moreover, Harvard will supply numerous opportunities for skill development in scientific
education and mentoring through the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. These factors make Harvard
the optimal institution to pursue ambitious research goals and prepare for a successful future academic career."
10825070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Longitudinal neuroimaging studies have been instrumental in characterizing the developmental trajectories of
brain networks and how specific neural pathways underlie the development of complex cognitive functions.
Learning to read, which incorporates language abilities and the processes required to decode and comprehend
language in written form, is key for academic and vocational advancement. Yet, experience-induced brain
plasticity during development in bilingual children has either not been taken into account or has been explicitly
excluded from existing work. The historical bias toward studying the neural bases of reading development in only
monolingual children leaves uncertainty as to what extent these foundational studies can generalize to the
increasingly diverse population of children in the U.S. In recent years, the number of bilingual children in schools
has grown exponentially, currently comprising over 10% of all school-age children in the U.S. When bilinguals
start English-only education, they are tasked with learning to read in English while simultaneously continuing to
develop language proficiency in English. With language exposure split between two languages, these children
enter formal schooling with an English-language disadvantage. This language disadvantage may contribute to
the consistent reading achievement gap documented between white and Latinx children (who are over 70%
bilingual). Since the neural pathways that underlie language and reading development necessarily overlap, it is
critically important to understand how bilingualism and reading abilities interact to shape these white matter
pathways across development. The field has gained valuable insights into the structural characteristics of the
bilingual brain from studies of bilingual adults; however, few studies provide a critical developmental perspective
on experience-induced brain plasticity. There is a dearth of evidence examining brain structural alterations in
childhood associated with the bilingual experience. White matter pathways provide a vehicle to examine this
experience-induced neuroplasticity. Language processing requires communication between distal brain regions,
both cortical and subcortical. Similarly, lifelong experiences processing more than one language also affect white
matter structural connectivity, but it is unclear how and when these changes happen during the development of
language and reading abilities. To address the insufficient rigor of prior research, characterized by small samples
and cross-sectional designs, the proposed work will leverage the large-scale longitudinal dataset from the NIH-
funded Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD) to examine the development of white matter
pathways over time while controlling for language and reading abilities in bilingual and monolingual children. The
overarching goal of this proposal to disentangle how bilingualism and reading development shape brain structure
during childhood over time and to reveal compensatory neural mechanisms associated with better outcomes in
struggling bilingual readers."
10825498,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A central question in systems neuroscience is how brain states modulate sensory processing. Because
sensory processing is accomplished by a distributed network of areas, a major component of how brain states
modulate sensory processing might involve dynamic and flexible relaying of sensory signals between brain
areas. The visual system’s rich inter-connectivity makes it an excellent model for elucidating flexible inter-areal
communication. Brain state changes with locomotion, in a manner that is intimately and intricately intertwined
with visual processing. Locomotion has been shown to affect visual responses and may also be used to
generate internal predictions of visual input. However, previous research has focused on within-area effects of
locomotion in visual processing. To understand how locomotion influences visual processing, we must
understand how locomotion alters visual inter-areal signaling. Our goal in this project is to understand how
locomotion affects the flow of visual information between areas during contexts of passive viewing and
visuomotor feedback. We hypothesize that locomotion will flexibly alter inter-areal visual processing by
improving communication of visual information and generating feedback predictions of visual input. To this end,
we will utilize high density laminar probes that will record population activity from multiple brain areas
simultaneously during different locomotive contexts. We will evaluate communication between areas using
modern multivariate analytic methods which have revealed the patterns of population activity that are relayed
between brain areas, termed “communication subspaces”. In Aim 1, we will present mice with visual stimuli
during locomotion whilst recording from visual areas dLGN, V1 and LM. We will use the resultant data to
evaluate how locomotion affects the inter-areal signaling of visual information via communication subspaces. In
Aim 2, we will manipulate the relationship between locomotion and concurrent visual input via virtual reality
feedback, whilst recording from dLGN, V1, and frontal areas ACC/M2, to determine how locomotion-generated
expectations of visual input are transmitted between areas and affect sensory representations. We will
momentarily decouple locomotion and visual feedback and evaluate how discrepancies between visuomotor
expectation are relayed between areas and alter sensory representations. We will also provide a causal test of
ACC/M2’s role in affecting visual representations by providing visuomotor predictions. Our project seeks to
uncover the nature of the interaction between locomotion and sensory information flow within the visual
system. In doing so, we aim to elucidate basic principles of how brain states flexibly modulate communication
between brain areas."
10827852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are two B lymphocyte
specific processes that mediate antibody diversification. Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) is
essential for initiating both of these processes by deaminating cytidine residues in immunoglobulin (Ig) loci
DNA. Despite its specific and indispensible function in the Ig loci, AID has been demonstrated to also
deaminate non-Ig locus genes, with the concomitant negative outcome of catalyzing various oncogenic
translocations that manifest in tumorigenesis. Recent work has indicated that AID's DNA deamination activity
requires its association with transcriptionally stalled RNA polymerase II and the RNA exosome complex. RNA
exosome is a cellular non-coding RNA (ncRNA) processing and/or degradation macromolecular complex. How
ncRNA and RNA exosome facilitate AID's DNA deamination activity is a question we plan to address.
Objective/Hypothesis: We will determine how RNA exosome activity on ncRNAs support AID activity at the
IgH locus and stabilizes 3-dimensional organization of the B cell genome. Specific aims: AIM 1: To understand
the chromatin associated function of noncoding RNAs and RNA exosome in controlling AID activity. AIM 2: To
understand the role of CTCF binding element (cbe) ncRNAs in TADIgH organization. AIM 3: To understand the
role of novel RNA exosome cofactors in regulating AID activity.
Study Design: Using mouse models that are deficient in RNA exosome-mediated RNA degradation, we have
identified regions in the B cell genome that express exosome sensitive ncRNAs and also are mutated by AID.
We will evaluate the mechanism of formation of single-strand DNA structures following localized chromatin
remodeling at these identified AID target DNA sequences. We have discovered a new family of exosome
sensitive ncRNAs that are associated with CTCF-binding elements (CBE), defined as cbeRNAs. We will
evaluate how cbeRNA processing regulates the 3 dimensional topologically associating domain structure of IgH
and influences SHM and CSR efficiencies. Finally, using B cells from TAP-tagged Exosome expressing mouse
model, we have purified and identified chromatin associated RNA exosome co-factors. We will evaluate the role
of RNA exosome co-factor(s) in stimulating AID/RNA exosome complex function.
Disease Relevance: The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms initiating
AID dependent oncogenesis in B lymphocytes (particularly in the contexts of DLBCL and multiple myeloma) as
well as have direct implications in understanding B lymphocyte-based immunodeficiency syndromes like
Hyper-IgM syndrome type 2. RNA exosome is implicated in many diseases including numerous
neurodegenerative disorders and multiple myeloma and findings from this grant will lead to a better
understanding of the etiologies of the disorders and development of therapies."
10827965,"Curved bacteria represent one of the most common of bacterial shapes yet the mechanisms by which
bacteria become curved and the functions of curvature are largely unknown. In addition, large-scale polymers
assemble in both the cytoplasm and periplasm yet only the cytoplasmic polymers have been well characterized
to date. This is an important distinction, as periplasmic proteins must contend with different molecular
environments like oxidizing conditions and a lack of ATP/GTP energy sources. My lab recently demonstrated
that two proteins, CrvA and CrvB, assemble into periplasmic structures that are essential for establishing cell
curvature in the pathogen, Vibrio cholerae. Here we propose to leverage this system to address the field’s
gaps in understanding both curved shapes and periplasmic polymer formation.
 In previous work, we identified and characterized the first curvature determinant in V. cholerae, CrvA.
CrvA forms polymers in the periplasm that pattern the insertion of new cell wall to cause these bacteria to
curve. More recently we discovered a second curvature determinant, CrvB. CrvA and CrvB colocalize in the V.
cholerae periplasm, and CrvA and CrvB co-expression are sufficient to induce curvature in straight Vibrio
species, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and even distantly-related C. crescentus and A. tumefaciens.
 Here we seek to better understand bacterial curvature determination and function by answering three
outstanding questions in three aims. 1) How do CrvA/B assemble in the periplasm, whose oxidizing conditions
and lack of ATP/GTP make it a very different environment from the cytoplasm where well-characterized
cytoskeletons assemble? Aim 1 will answer this question by combining electron and fluorescence microscopy
to determine the structure and dynamics of CrvA/CrvB assembly. 2) How do CrvAB actually generate cell
curvature? CrvAB are distinct from previously-characterized shape determinants in both being periplasmic and
functioning autonomously of other shape-patterning elements like MreB. Aim 2 will thus address how CrvA and
CrvB induce curvature by identifying and characterizing their interactions with the cell wall and other partners.
3) How does curvature affect bacterial behaviors? Aim 3 will harness our ability to synthetically curve bacteria
and use single-cell imaging to determine how curvature affects motility in gels, biofilms, and on surfaces.
These experiments will dissect the biophysical basis of important behaviors that result from cell curvature.
 Together these studies will establish V. cholerae CrvAB as a powerful model system for studying cell
shape across multiple scales, answering fundamental questions to advance several fields. First, at the
molecular scale, we will learn how polymers form in the periplasm. Second, at the cellular scale, we will learn
how two proteins can curve an immense range of bacteria. And third, at the behavioral/evolutionary scale, we
will learn the benefits conferred by one of the most common of bacterial shapes."

Although kidney transplantation provides better survival, quality of life, and long-term cost compared to
maintenance dialysis, the majority of patients with end-stage kidney disease in the United States will never
receive a transplant due to a severe shortage of donated kidneys. In response to this shortage, there has been
an increasing emphasis on expanding the use of less-than-ideal deceased donor kidneys, which still provide
survival and quality of life benefits over extended waiting time for a higher quality kidney. Despite efforts to
increase the aggressiveness of organ recovery and utilization, thousands of likely transplantable kidneys are not
recovered or discarded after recovery each year, primarily due to quality concerns. We and others have shown
that clinicians’ subjective assessments of organ quality are often too conservative, and that cognitive heuristics
impact perception or organ quality and likelihood of organ utilization. A key target for improving perceptions of
organ quality is therefore to use decision science to improve the presentation of information during organ offers.
The goal of the proposed project is to understand how surgeons prioritize and consume information during organ
offer decisions, then use a mechanisms-based approach to target cognitive heuristics that favor inappropriate
organ offer refusal. We will begin with improving the presentation of the results of procurement biopsies. Despite
reliance on findings from these biopsies— which are the most common reason for deceased donor kidney
discard— their independent prognostic capability is limited as they are currently performed. We hypothesize that
our approach will enable standardization of procurement biopsy presentation in a manner that reduces
deleterious impacts on organ offer acceptance.
To complete the proposed project and acquire the skills needed for development into an independent investigator
in the field of kidney transplantation, Dr. Husain will work closely with a multidisciplinary team of mentors and
advisors, led by Dr. Sumit Mohan, to develop research expertise in the areas of interventional and prospective
study design, decision making science & human-centered design, kidney transplant epidemiology, and research
dissemination & professional development. Upon completion of this project, he will have the scientific and
research expertise needed to be a grant-supported independent investigator in this field."

terms of both drinking habits and treatment needs, few interventions address the unique circumstances of the

need to improve sleep and reduce the stressors that lead adolescents to over-indulge in the first place. We have
developed a novel protocol to generate a weekday-weekend sleep pattern in adolescent mice, in order to model
circadian sleep disruption and study the ensuing effects on stress and alcohol intake. The proposed studies will
examine how circadian desynchrony and sleep homeostasis impact the self-perpetuating cycle of sleep
disruption, stress, and alcohol drinking in adolescence, the period of greatest vulnerability to the neurobiological
changes underlying addiction, and the long-term effects of this cycle on drinking in adulthood. Next, we will test
whether melatonin, which resets the internal clock and serves as a potent systemic cue for the switch from
daylight to nighttime physiological patterns, can restore sleep and reduce both stress and alcohol intake in our
models. In the first Aim, circadian phenotyping cages will be used to generate circadian desynchrony, then we
will assess alcohol drinking and sleep patterns, stress reactivity, and alcohol seeking after punishment in
adolescent male and female melatonin-proficient C57BL/6 mice, and we will correlate behavioral patterns with
the rhythmic release of corticosterone and melatonin, as well as with the rhythmic expression of circadian genes
and corticotropin releasing factor receptors. In a second group, we will follow the same adolescent protocol,
allow mice to age, then test the same behavioral measures in adulthood. In the second Aim, we will use timed
sleep restriction to awaken adolescent mice earlier than their natural wake-up time and follow the same
assessments as in Aim 1. We propose that circadian sleep disruptions will increase alcohol intake by disrupting
sleep, increasing stress activation, and increasing motivation to work for alcohol despite punishment. In Aim 3,
we will further explore the effects of alcohol and circadian sleep disruption on stress by examining how these
factors impact the activity of the molecular stress axis itself. This will provide an essential foundation of
knowledge about the interactions between the circadian sleep system and the stress axis in adolescent alcohol
abuse, the long-term effects of these interactions, and the potential for melatonin to both reduce alcohol intake
in adolescents and to reduce the risk of developing alcohol use disorders later in adulthood."

Learning to associate environmental cues with rewards, such as food, is critical to survival, but maladaptive cue-
reward learning is thought to underlie cardinal features of substance use disorder by driving craving and relapse
in the presence of drug associated cues. Rewarding environments contain many stimuli that could be potentially
serve as cues. How does the brain learn to selectively discriminate and respond to reward-predictive cues and
ignore irrelevant ones? As a primary target of mesolimbic dopamine signaling, the nucleus accumbens core
(NAc) is a critical brain region involved in both the learning of cue-reward associations and the ability of learned
predictive cues to evoke or invigorate appetitive behavior. Compared to the research on dopamine signaling in
this region, however, the role of NAc neuronal activity is considerably understudied.
During cue driven reward seeking, NAc neurons exhibit heterogeneous firing patterns: many neurons increase
in activity while many other neurons decrease in activity. These activity modulations reflect many different task
variables and differ in duration within a trial. Due to this complexity, understanding the activity profiles contributing
to NAc function and cue-driven reward seeking remains a challenge. Rapid cue excitation responses are
important for cue-induced approach behaviors, but sustained non-selective reduction of NAc activity reduces the
ability to discriminate meaningful versus distractor cues, which suggests an important role for inhibition in
selective behavior responses to reward paired cues. In this proposal, I test the hypothesis that precisely timed
inhibitions of activity in a subset of NAc neurons during cue-driven reward seeking develops over learning to
serve a crucial role in selective conditioned responses to reward paired cues. To answer this, I will use an
auditory Pavlovian discrimination task in head-fixed mice to study the selective learning and response to reward
paired cues. In Aim 1, I will optogenetically inhibit D1 or D2 receptor expressing NAc projection neurons during
either the cue presentation or reward reciept/outcome phase of both reward associated cue and neutral cue
trials. Based on preliminary experiments, I expect D2 neuron inhibition during the reward period to drive rapid,
indiscriminate conditioned responding to both rewarded and unrewarded cues. In Aim 2, I will use two-photon
imaging to track the activity dynamics of the same visually identified D1 and D2 neurons across the entire phase
of learning. I predict that inhibitory responses specifically during rewarded trials will develop in a subset of NAc
neurons immediately preceding or concurrent with the emergence of conditioned responding. These experiments
will greatly enhance our understanding of the NAc dynamics that contribute to cue-driven reward seeking."

Influenza A viruses (IAV) pose a constant threat to human health through both seasonal epidemics and
occasional pandemics, which are often caused by transmission of IAV strains from zoonotic reservoirs. With
the exception of bat IAV, all other IAV strains infect host cells by binding to sialic acid on glycoconjugates
(sialoglycans). Various types of cell surface sialoglycans (N-glycans, O-glycans, glycolipids) display significant
diversity in both structure and carbohydrate composition. In addition, the sialoglycan repertoire can vary
between cell types and across different IAV host species. Thus, defining the structural features in sialoglycans
necessary for IAV infection across different host species is critical for our understanding of zoonotic
transmission into humans. Importantly, there are no reliable strategies that can comprehensively assess and
identify zoonotic IAV strains capable of causing human infections. To define the types of sialoglycans that
facilitate IAV infection, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and truncated different types of sialoglycans in
a human lung epithelial cell line either individually or in combination, by targeting glycosyltransferases essential
to biosynthesis. Our studies show that sialic acid on N-glycans, O-glycans and glycolipids can independently
serve as a receptor for several IAV strains from both human and zoonotic hosts. Interestingly, truncation of all
three types of glycans significantly decreased the replication of human by not avian IAV strains, demonstrating
that IAV strains from avian hosts are more flexible in their requirement of sialoglycan structures. Here we
propose to utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to define the structural features of sailoglycans necessary for
IAV infection and adaptation across various host species using primary differentiated cells. Importantly, we will
develop a single cell multi-omics platform to reliably identify zoonotic IAV strains with the potential to cause
human infections. These studies will provide significant insights into our understanding of how the sialoglycan
repertoire shapes host adaptation and fitness of IAV strains."

Fungal infections have risen in frequency and severity over the last several decades, as the
number of patients with increased susceptibility have also risen. Today, these infections are a
serious clinical problem, and new species emerge to add to these challenges. Candida auris is
one such species, having been first identified in a superficial infection in 2009. Subsequently, C.
auris has been identified in four geographic foci on three continents, and spread throughout the
world. A primary concern with C. auris is its resistance to antifungal drugs, with nearly all
isolate resistance to azoles, and many to the polyenes and echinocandins. The rapidity with
which this has happened is startling and has far outpaced research advances in this species. One
advantage is that C. auris is a haploid species and this opens the door to powerful forward
genetic approaches. To take advantage of this, we propose here to develop an insertional mutant
library with thousands of mutants, which we will validate using two highly relevant genetic
screens. To generate these mutants, we will use the bacterium Agrobacterium tumifaciens,
which transfers an integrating vector (T-DNA) to a promiscuous range of host cells, including C.
auris. We have adapted tools with which we propose to isolate ~5,000 mutants and array them
in 96 well plates, then sequence each to identify the insertion site. Our primary goal is to
develop this resource and make it available to the community. In doing so, we will validate this
library with two screens that are particularly relevant to C. auris. In the first, we have developed
an animal infection assay using the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans that allows us to
identify avirulent mutants. In other Candida species, this assay tracks murine virulence closely,
and we have adapted it for C. auris. Our host strain, chosen for its virulence and transformation
efficiency, is also highly fluconazole resistant and we will screen for insertions that increase
susceptibility. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have (a) built a large mutant library
of random insertional mutants which we will make available to the community, (b) generated
two large datasets on virulence and drug resistance, (c) primed future mechanistic studies that
will make substantial progress in improving the outcomes of patients, and (d) determined the
applicability of the nematode model to a wide array of C. auris isolates.."

 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally and pathologies are exacerbated by
chronic stress. Stress-cardiovascular comorbidities are more prevalent in females, however, the
neurobiological mechanisms linking stress to cardiovascular outcomes are not well understood and could
inform underlying cardiovascular susceptibility and resilience. The prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus are key
regulators of stress and cardiovascular output; therefore, this proposal will test the hypothesis that cortical-
hypothalamic neural circuitry mediates the sexually divergent cardiovascular consequences of chronic stress.
 Chronic psychosocial stress increases the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. The prefrontal cortex
(PFC) is critical for stress appraisal, and both mood disorders and chronic stress are associated with altered
PFC function. Recently, the sponsor’s lab reported that optogenetically activating the predominantly
glutamatergic projection neurons from the rat infralimbic PFC (IL) produces sexually divergent effects on the
stress response. However, the IL does not directly innervate neuroendocrine or preganglionic sympathetic
neurons to mediate these effects; therefore, intermediate neurocircuitry must be involved in translating sex-
specific cortical processing into sex-specific cardiovascular outcomes.
 The posterior hypothalamus (PH) is a major target of IL projection neurons and IL-PH projection
neurons are stress-activated, however, neuroanatomical studies examining IL-PH circuitry have been
performed exclusively in males. Pharmacological inactivation of the PH in vivo restrains acute stress
responses while pharmacologically activating the PH exacerbates acute stress responses. PH activity also
regulates cardiovascular function: pharmacologically activating the PH increases blood pressure and heart rate
and pharmacological inactivation of the PH robustly blocks stress-induced increases in heart rate. The
proposed experiments hypothesize that the PH is an intermediate synapse for sexually divergent outcomes
and that stress-induced plasticity in this region mediates cardiovascular consequences of chronic stress.
 To test this hypothesis, I will learn viral-mediated circuit- and cell-type-specific slice
electrophysiology to investigate synaptic plasticity within the IL-PH circuit after chronic variable stress in
males and females. Additionally, I will learn pulse wave velocity and pressure myography to investigate
vascular stiffness and reactivity in vivo and ex vivo, respectively, to determine the necessity of the IL-PH circuit
for the detrimental consequences of chronic stress on vascular function.
 I have assembled a mentorship team with accomplished neurophysiologists and cardiovascular
biologists to ensure the technical and career development training necessary for this project and, ultimately,
starting my independent laboratory. These mentors will be critical for navigating my postdoctoral fellowship and
preparing to run an independent research program studying unique dimensions of cardiovascular resilience."
10827184,"Abstract. Oxidative imbalance mediates pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is shown to induce mitochondrial and
synaptic dysfunction in neurons. The brains of patients with MCI and AD also have increased oxidative alterations,
such as protein nitration and nucleic acid modifications. Combined factors provide compelling evidence for role of
oxidative imbalance in conjunction with misfolded proteins (Aβ and p-Tau) and inflammation at the front and center
of AD pathogenesis resulting in functional impairment of neurons. However, noninvasive imaging tools to investigate
role of oxidative imbalance in vivo have been lacking and continues to be an unmet need. Compared with other
standard of care techniques, molecular imaging with radiotracers offers advantage of enabling non-invasive,
quantitative, and longitudinal analysis of the biochemical status of tissues and organs. To address this need,
standard clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT lacks sensitivity and diagnostic robustness. Furthermore, the mechanism of its
retention and trapping poorly correlates with oxidative imbalance. To address this critical gap in armamentarium of
PET tracers, we have discovered a 2ndgeneration redox-sensitive molecular PET imaging probe (identified as 18F-
SLN-128) through a rational design, wherein the probe penetrates neuronal cells, gets oxidized upon encountering
oxidants, and trapped within cells to report on mitochondrial function. Using live-cell fluorescence imaging analysis,
we demonstrate ability of molecular imaging probe (noncarrier added SLN 128) to detect LPS- and 3-nitropropionic
acid (3-NP)-induced oxidative imbalance within mitochondria of the human glioblastoma U87 cells. Moreover, in a
model of LPS induced systemic inflammation of mouse brain, dynamic PET/CT scans revealed a 2-fold higher 18F-
SLN128 uptake and retention in LPS-treated brains relative to uninjured saline-treated cohorts. Furthermore,
studies using a stereotaxic injection of 3-NP, a mitochondrial toxin into striatum demonstrates 2-fold higher retention
of the radiotracer in brains of 3-NP treated mice compared with their saline treated counterparts. These data
correlate with post-imaging quantitative biodistribution studies and immunohistochemical correlations thus providing
evidence for microglial cell activation and neurodegeneration. Finally, dynamic PET/MR scan indicate ability of 18F-
SLN-128 to penetrate brain (SUV= 3.5) in a nontargeted rhesus monkey following intravenous injection of the
radiotracer. Armed with this provocative supporting data, aims of this preclinical imaging and translational MPI RO1
project are: Aim 1. Evaluate potential of 18F-SLN-128 to serve as a noninvasive imaging agent of 3-Nitropropionic
acid (3 NP) induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in presence or absence of N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) in mice; Aim 1 Sub Aims. Evaluate potential of 18F-SLN-128 to serve as a noninvasive imaging agent of
ROS-mediated inflammation: 1.1. APP/PS1 (Aβ); mice and their age-matched control counterparts as a function of
aging (pre-plaques (3 months), mild-moderate plaques, and severe plaques (12 months) through PET/CT imaging
using 3-tracer paradigm imaging (11C-PiB for Aβ; 18F-SLN-128 for ROS; and 18F-FDG for glucose metabolism); Aim
2. Evaluate pharmacokinetics of 18F-SLN128, perform metabolite analysis from both venous and arterial outputs,
and kinetic modeling in non-human primates; Aim 3. Perform radiation dosimetry to determine human effective
dose equivalent (HED) and toxicology studies for 18F-SLN128 to prepare for GMP production of the PET tracer; and
Aim 4. Perform three qualifying runs under GMP conditions to ascertain chemistry manufacturing controls (CMCs)
to produce clinical doses of the PET radiopharmaceutical for compiling data for eIND filing; Aim 5: Perform first-
in-human studies using 18F-SLN128: evaluate dosimetry, biodistribution, safety, and imaging characteristics of
inflammation in AD participants compared to healthy controls. Successful accomplishment of proposed aims could
deliver redox-sensitive PET molecular imaging agent for management of ROS-mediated pathogenesis in
Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain
injury, and chronic inflammation, thus extending benefits for functional imaging of mitochondrial function in vivo
well-beyond its immediate utility in Alzheimer’s disease and ADRDs."

Late-stage modification of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biomolecules, including alcohols,
peptides, and carbohydrates, is crucial in drug discovery and chemical biology research. However, achieving
selectivity and specificity among the diverse functional groups present within such molecules is a primary
challenge in late-stage functionalization. This proposal aims to address this challenge by leveraging the non-
polar nature of radical intermediates, which exhibit orthogonal reactivity compared to the prevalent polar
functional groups found in biomolecules. Specifically, a phosphoramidite reagent will selectively functionalize
hydroxyl groups by enabling deoxygenative radical formation and incorporate it into various transformations,
including the Giese reaction, cross-coupling, and trifluoromethylation reactions. The mild conditions and
moderate electrophilicity of the phosphoramidite will offer compatibility with biomolecules rich in various
reactive groups. Mechanistic studies of radical capture by nickel intermediates will inform catalyst design for
stereoconvergent deoxygenative coupling of alcohols. Furthermore, understanding this fundamental step will
provide insight for the design of a broader range of cross-coupling reactions involving radical intermediates
generated from various means, including chemical, photoredox, and electrocatalytic activation. Finally, the
proposed research aims to develop novel photoredox electron donor-acceptor coupling reactions that
facilitate the synthesis of cyclic peptides, a promising strategy for drug development. These reactions will
expand the chemical space accessible to drug discovery and facilitate the development of new therapeutic
agents."
10827024,"After stroke, upper extremity (UE) motor impairment is especially disabling and has few effective therapies.
Vagus nerve stimulation paired with rehabilitation training (paired VNS) has recently emerged as a promising
therapeutic approach. Paired VNS delivers a burst of electrical stimulation to the cervical vagus nerve during a
purposeful training movement. In rodent stroke models, paired VNS drives the release of pro-plasticity
neurotransmitters that enhance cortical reorganization and boost motor gains. A recent Phase III clinical trial in
chronic stroke patients also found that paired VNS improves UE motor impairment compared to rehabilitation
without stimulation, but gains were generally modest and clinical benefit varied. It is likely that additional motor
gains are possible if paired VNS therapy can be optimized. Understanding how paired VNS works in humans
and in whom paired VNS works best will be a critical step in unlocking its clinical potential, allowing us to
improve treatment regimens, individualize delivery, and select suitable therapeutic candidates. Preclinical and
clinical evidence illuminates several candidate neural substrates for the actions of VNS, but these are yet
untested in humans with stroke. Our central hypothesis is that VNS-induced changes in motor, cognitive, and
affective systems underlie motor gains, and that sufficient neural integrity is required to achieve a clinically
meaningful response. To test this hypothesis, we will study chronic stroke patients implanted with our next-
generation VNS device. We will deliver blocks of active or sham VNS paired with UE rehabilitation in a
randomized, blinded, crossover design. Before and after treatment blocks, we will characterize neural networks
and their associated behaviors using transcranial magnetic stimulation, diffusion and functional MRI, and
quantitative behavioral testing. In Aim 1, we will identify VNS-induced neural changes in motor, cognitive, and
affective systems that mediate motor gains. In Aim 2, we will identify baseline structural, functional, and injury
markers that predict clinical benefit from paired VNS. This project capitalizes on the combined strengths of its
multi-PI leadership and investigative team, who bring complementary expertise in motor recovery mechanisms,
VNS device development, clinical trial design and execution, and advanced neuroimaging and biostatistical
analyses. At the completion of the study, we expect to have generated key mechanistic insights regarding
paired VNS in human chronic stroke, providing a solid basis to optimize the efficacy of this therapy. More
broadly, this study could reveal targetable pathways for other neuromodulation strategies and could launch
new treatments for cognitive and mood disorders after stroke. The proposed research is thus an exciting next
step in neurostimulation after stroke. These advances will enhance the clinical potential of paired VNS and will
ultimately optimize neurorehabilitation for millions of patients with chronic stroke deficits."
10827147,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our Overall Objective is to unravel the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and identify new
therapeutic targets. ALD is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide among chronic liver
diseases, but there are no FDA-approved treatments for ALD. Our recent studies have identified lipogenesis
as an important factor promoting ALD. However, the molecular mechanisms for lipogenesis are still poorly
understood. Alternative splicing is a critical mechanism that increases transcriptome complexity and expands
proteome diversity and function. To date, little is known about the role of serine-arginine rich protein kinase
2 (SRPK2), a critical splicing regulator, in chronic liver disease. Intriguingly, our preliminary results have
shown that SRPK2 abundance is upregulated in rodents and humans with ALD, which is associated with the
induction of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1. These data have prompted us to determine the potential
role of SRPK2 in the pathogenesis of ALD. Overexpression of SRPK2 is sufficient to increase lipogenic gene
expression in hepatocytes. Conversely, adenoviral knockdown of SRPK2 alters pre-mRNA splicing of lipin 1, a
lipogenic regulator, and attenuates alcoholic steatosis in mice. While fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is
emerging as a potential therapeutic candidate for diabetes in clinical trials, knowledge regarding the role of
the hepatokine FGF21 in alternative splicing dysregulation during ALD is lacking. A pilot study shows that
FGF21 overexpression in transgenic mice ameliorates alcoholic steatosis and lipotoxicity; this beneficial effect
is associated with SRPK2 inhibition. Thus, our Central Hypothesis is that SRPK2-mediated regulation of
alternative splicing triggers lipid accumulation and promotes alcoholic liver injury, and inhibition of SRPK2 has
therapeutic implications for ALD. To expand on these exciting observations, we propose three Specific Aims:
1) To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which SRPK2-mediated regulation of alternative pre-mRNA is
coupled to the control of lipid metabolism and promotes the progression of ALD; 2) To determine whether the
hepatokine FGF21 functions as a novel regulator of SRPK2 in the control of triglyceride and cholesterol
metabolism in ALD; and 3) To assess whether targeting SRPK2 has therapeutic implications for ALD. We will
comprehensively test our hypothesis with cutting-edge cellular, molecular, and biochemical methods for pre-
mRNA splicing, hepatocyte-specific FGF21 knockout mice, and in vivo pharmacological and molecular
manipulation approaches. Complementary state-of-the-art techniques, including alternative splicing profiling and
lipidomics analyses, will allow us to characterize aberrant changes in pre-mRNA splicing machinery and lipid
metabolites in the livers of alcohol-fed mice. Overall, accomplishing this project will identify pre-mRNA splicing
mechanisms that contribute to ALD pathologies and will provide a rationale for targeting elements of the SRPK2-
regulated splicing process as a novel therapeutic strategy for ALD, such as FGF21."
10980502,"Photoreceptor dysfunction is one of the hallmark pathologies associated with retinal degenerative (RD)
diseases that manifests in patients as a progressive loss of vision. This encompasses heterogenous diseases
such as retinitis pigmentosa, which affects 1 in 3500 people worldwide and age-related macular degeneration,
which affects over 196 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 288 million people by 2040.
Specifically, in our Veteran population, roughly 7,000 Veterans become visually impaired each year due to RD.
Clinical trials and retrospective studies suggest that RD patients may respond to exercise as a neuroprotective
treatment to preserve vision. Recently, our labs filled a significant knowledge gap by demonstrating that
modest exercise protects retinal function and structure in models of RD and were accompanied by increased
levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact BDNF-TrkB signal transduction. To date,
the cell-types and molecular processes mediating the neuroprotective benefits of exercise are unknown.
Others have shown that astrocytes and endothelial cells in the brain express BDNF and its high-affinity
receptor, TrkB, and that altered BDNF-TrkB signaling in these cell-types contributes to neurodegenerative
disease progression and severity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes modify their morphology
in response to BDNF in the brain during neurodegeneration. Likewise, vascular endothelial cells express BDNF
under exercise-induced physiological stress. These data suggest that astrocytes and endothelial cells may
mediate the neuroprotective effects of exercise in the retina. Our approach is to understand the morphological,
gene expression and functional alterations in retinal astrocytes and vasculature induced from exercise and how
these alterations contribute to neuroprotection. For this proposal, we will use the BALB/c light induced retinal
degeneration model, which exhibits phenotypes found in patients with RD. We hypothesize that exercise
induces retinal astrocyte plasticity and improved vascular function through increased BDNF signaling
mechanisms, promoting neural repair and protection. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate if exercise
influences retinal astrocyte biology, by assessing retinal astrocyte morphology, cellular gene expression
profiles, and retinal astrocyte-mediated phagocytosis. Immunohistochemical labeling, AnalyzeSkeleton and
Sholl analysis will be used to quantify astrocyte cell morphology and density. Retinal astrocytes will be isolated
using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to examine astrocyte gene expression profiles. To monitor retinal
astrocyte function, a novel in vitro live-imaging of astrocyte-mediated phagocytosis will be used. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the effects of exercise on retinal vascular morphology, gene expression and function.
Angiotool will be used for retinal vascular morphology quantification analysis. Retinal vascular cell gene
expression profiles will be assessed by MACS and vascular function will be assessed using retinal functional
hyperemia. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine if exercise-induced BDNF signaling mechanisms influence
retinal astrocyte and vascular morphology, gene expression and function, by blocking BDNF signaling using a
highly specific TrkB receptor antagonist, ANA-12. Retinal astrocyte and vascular assessments performed in
Specific Aims 1 and 2 found to be most informative will be used to compare experimental groups. The
expected outcome of this study is that exercise-induced BDNF signaling alters retinal astrocyte and vascular
morphology, gene expression and improves function in order to promote retinal neuroprotection. Results from
this study will illuminate the morphological, gene expression and functional alterations that ultimately result in
gain of function(s) and or loss/upregulation of homeostatic function(s) in retinal astrocytes and vasculature.
This proposal holds profound potential for the long-term goals of optimizing exercise-based therapeutics and
creating new pharmacological strategies targeting the underlying mechanisms of exercise-induced protection
in patients with RD that can be extended to other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases."

Climate change is a threat to human health which impacts each step of the cancer control continuum. Frequent
extreme weather events in the US Caribbean (Puerto Rico [PR] and US Virgin Islands) have highlighted the
interdependencies of their critical infrastructure systems, and how their disruption leads to catastrophic failures
in social and economic ecosystems, with fatal and long-lasting consequences. These US Territories where
cancer is among the leading causes of death, have suffered major disruptions in cancer prevention and screening
programs, and delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment as a result of extreme weather events. Preventing
cancer risk and sustaining infrastructure for cancer control after these events are priorities. The Caribbean

10980705,"RESEARCH PROJECT SUMMARY
Climate change poses risks to human health through direct and indirect stressors. On tropical islands, some of
the risks are accentuated. The population of the US Caribbean Territories, including Puerto Rico (PR) and the
US Virgin Islands (USVI), is especially vulnerable to multiple concurrent hazards heightened by global climate
change and the public health infrastructure that is weak, vulnerable, or absent due to historical and current
problematic policies and practices. PR and USVI are experiencing acute socioeconomic and health
consequences from extreme events including hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017) and the COVID-19 pandemic
(2020-2022). The proposed Caribbean Climate Change Adaptation, Cancer, and Health Disparities Research
Center (CCCARIB-CARES) will employ a multimethod approach to identify helpful strategies for addressing
these problems. CCCARIB-CARES will employ an epidemiological study to assess the risk of cancer in PR and
USVI in relation to climate vulnerabilities and socioenvironmental factors. It will include a cross-sectional study
to assess understanding of climate change and its effects on mobilizing pollution and affecting the quality of life
among cancer survivors. Furthermore, a qualitative study component will use key informants and focus groups
to determine the needs, priorities and capabilities of stakeholder groups, cancer patients, and residents living
in sites with low/high environmental disparities in relation to adaptation to climate-induced vulnerabilities. The
primary aims of the proposed project are to 1) Describe the risk of cancer in PR and USVI in relation to climate
stressors and socioenvironmental factors and 2) Conduct a community assessment of socioenvironmental
climate stressors and adaptation capacity among cancer survivors and residents experiencing environmental
disparities in PR and USVI. Information from the PR and USVI cancer registries will be used to assess cancer
incidence and mortality risk in the context of historical and current environmental data, in a framework that
evaluates social disparities. The study of the needs, priorities, and capabilities of stakeholder groups will
uncover weaknesses in the cancer control and healthcare continuum. This information will guide the
development of interventions and inform planning to respond and adapt to climate vulnerabilities in the
Caribbean region. The findings will be of relevance for government-based planning and intervention efforts,
including developing plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change locally, plans for disaster preparedness,
and improving the resilience of cancer control plans and infrastructure for these US territories. Lessons learned
will be of value to other US Territories Island states, and communities experiencing similar socio-environmental
climate vulnerability nationally."

 An animal’s survival depends on their accurate perception of biologically relevant sounds in a complex
hearing environment that is awash with background noise. Top-down contextual information modulates the
processing of bottom-up sensory signals at multiple levels of the auditory pathway to improve hearing
accuracy, but the neural mechanisms underlying this essential function remain unclear, especially at the
earliest processing level in central auditory system. Here we examine the role of the massive top-down
projection from the inferior colliculus (IC) to the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Our overarching hypothesis is
that top-down signals that encode contextual information are conveyed to DCN by descending IC projections to
guide context-dependent filtering. The proposed project will reveal the circuit mechanisms of top-down
modulation at the first level of auditory processing in the central nervous system. This work could provide
insight into ways to improve auditory perception when bottom-up signals are degraded due to hearing loss, as
well auditory processing disorders for which top-down modulation has been implicated.
 Early filtering that is guided by top-down modulation is a general principle in sensory systems.
Establishing how neural circuits implement context-dependent filtering has been difficult, due in part to a lack of
in vivo phenomenological studies being combined with circuit-level analysis. We will examine the neural
mechanisms underlying top-down modulation of the DCN by utilizing a powerful combination of (1) neural
circuit analysis using projection-specific retrograde tracing, (2) in vitro acute brain slice electrophysiology in
transgenic mice, and (3) cutting-edge in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in awake mice.
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that DCN-projecting IC neurons are a subtype of small cells in the central nucleus,
by retrogradely labeling them and targeting them for direct electrophysiological and anatomical analyses.
Aim 2 tests how descending IC projections are processed by specific cells and microcircuits in DCN. We
recently discovered a pathway, through excitatory interneurons called unipolar brush cells, that could preserve
the descending tonotopic signals and extend their neural representation. This aim will test the hypothesis that
unipolar brush cells amplify signals to principal cells in DCN.
Aim 3 tests how descending IC projections shape auditory responses of DCN principal neurons in awake mice.
We will use optogenetic inhibition of DCN-projecting IC neurons to test their role in spontaneous firing rates,
frequency response properties, temporal response properties, and tone-in-noise detection thresholds.
 Successful completion of this project will establish how top-down projections from IC modulate
auditory responses in the first level of auditory processing in the brain and will reveal the circuit mechanisms
that contribute to accurate auditory processing in complex sound environments."

By 2050, roughly 83.7 million individuals in the U.S. alone will be over the age of 65. Within this population,
memory declines are at the forefront of age-related cognitive complaints. Associative memory, or the ability to
link together multiple pieces of information, is especially vulnerable to aging. Associative memory is central to
everyday memory function, supporting everything from our ability to remember face-name associations to links
between medicines and their daily dosages. As such, there is an urgent need to identify methods that can
improve associative memory in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify effective, theory-driven, evidence-
based approaches for enhancing associative memory in older adults. The objective of this application is to
elucidate the mechanism underlying the cognitive and neural benefits of environmental support, in the form of
schematic and perceptual grouping. Such support promotes unitization of information without requiring older
adults to self-initiate cognitively demanding encoding strategies. This project integrates theories of perceptual
and semantic processing with theories of unitization to advance our understanding of associative memory.
Specifically, we will examine how schematic and perceptual processing induces unitization and how unitization
can be strengthened with exposure-based repetition. Our overarching hypothesis is that grouping principles
enhance associative memory by creating representations of item pairs that parallel how single items are
processed in memory. This will be tested using high-resolution neuroimaging alongside univariate, multivariate
and network connectivity analyses characterizing unitized, non-unitized, and item memory at encoding and
retrieval in long-term memory. The approach is innovative because it directly applies well-established theories
of information processing and perception to ameliorate the burden of binding in associative memory processing,
with the goal of enhancing associative memory in aging. It is also amongst the first set of studies to apply high
resolution fMRI and cutting-edge multivariate and network connectivity analyses to test the neurocognitive
mechanism underlying memory processing in aging. The proposed research is significant because it tests
multiple methods for enhancing associative memory in aging that can be employed across a range of applications
absent of subject-generated strategy deployment. In doing so, the work is a critical step in elucidating the
flexibility of neural processing across the lifespan to the betterment of memory function. By identifying ways to
improve memory function in young and older adults, this work has the potential to 1) enhance other cognitive
processes, 2) improve the quality of life in aging, and 3) help dissociate normal aging from early signs of
dementia."

Obesity continues to be a major health crisis, afflicting populations worldwide with comorbidities that include
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This has stimulated research of neural circuits regulating energy
balance, and technological advances have allowed for the dissection of genetically-defined brain circuits
controlling feeding behavior and physiology. Studies have revealed complex central circuits, which ultimately
exist for integrating endocrine and peripheral sensory signals. The vagus nerve is a critical sensory pathway
for the control of meal termination and is the only direct neural link between the gut and brain. Vagal sensory
afferents innervate the gastrointestinal tract and inform the brain of the quantity and quality of food being
consumed. Similar to other neural systems, the vagus nerve contains heterogeneous neuronal populations that
have discrete connections and perform specialized functions. However, most of what is known about the vagus
and behavior comes from non-specific surgical and chemical ablation studies that do not provide mechanistic
insight about distinct neuronal populations. Hence, little is known regarding primary sensory signals directly
related to satiation, and research in this area is imperative for understanding the central organization and
regulation of energy homeostasis. Studies in this proposal will utilize state-of-the-art wireless technology and
viral/transgenic techniques to manipulate genetically defined vagal afferent neurons innervating the stomach.
We will examine the relative roles of distinct gastric vagal afferent neurons in the control of food intake, which
could potentially lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the safe and effective treatment of
obesity.

 In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis
patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across
the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment.
However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients
without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are
on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight
loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss
observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or
access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between
healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management
paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as
chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of
different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define
healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide
clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will
accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively
determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder
perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second
study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and
low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight-
loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight
loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we
will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United
States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and
measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia,
body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this
research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens
of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to
incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and
mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Fungal Pathogens: Emerging Threats and
Future Challenges, organized by Drs. Michail Lionakis, Sarah Gaffen and Mari Shinohara. The conference will
be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada from February 18-21, 2024.
Human pathogenic fungi have emerged as significant causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with acquired
immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV/AIDS, as well as in receipt of myeloablative chemotherapy and
targeted immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune disorders, neoplastic diseases, and in hematopoietic
stem cell and solid organ transplantation. Moreover, in recent years, emerging multidrug resistant Candida auris
has been responsible for life-threatening outbreaks in healthcare facilities and raises serious concerns to global
public health. Furthermore, a recent surge in the discovery and characterization of novel monogenic inborn errors
of immunity that have been predisposed to mucocutaneous and/or invasive tissue-specific fungal disease, along
with the development of clinically relevant animal models of mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections, have
collectively enhanced our understanding of cell type-, tissue-, and fungus-specific recognition, effector pathways,
and adaptive immune responses. These advances, along with our improved molecular understanding of fungal
virulence traits, highlight the promise for rapid development of targeted treatment strategies against fungal
pathogens. Therefore, this Keystone Symposia conference will bring together, for the first time, scientists who
study fungal virulence and fungal immunology, thus helping to synthesize current understanding of the cellular
and molecular determinants of fungal pathogenesis and mammalian antifungal immunity. By encouraging cross-
disciplinary exchange, this conference will advance key priorities of informing precision risk stratification, and
defining prophylactic, therapeutic and vaccination strategies to combat life-threatening fungal infections in
vulnerable patient populations."

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is the most aggressive and fatal cancer on a case-by-case basis with rapidly
rising incidence. Approximately 80% of MCC cases are caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus, which expresses
two viral oncogenes known as large T antigen and small T antigen that are required for clonal carcinogenesis.
Notably, although MCC is highly aggressive, approximately 50% of patients treated with immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) respond to treatment. With approximately equal numbers of responsive patients to resistant
patients and small, shared neoantigen repertoire, virus positive (VP) MCC serves as a model of T cell
response in cancer. It is unknown why some patients respond to ICB while others resist treatment. A critical
unmet need is to develop treatments for patients with primary or acquired resistant to ICB. To elucidate this
mechanism and identify biomarkers of ICB response, we have collected the largest clinically annotated
database of primary MCC samples treated with ICB. We have identified a subset of T cells that drive ICB
response. In this project, we will elucidate the mechanism by which these cells mediate response to ICB.
We will spatially and functionally identify which receptor-ligand interactions are most critical in triggering a
response by these T cells. Next, we will identify specific T cell receptors that recognize tumor antigens. Finally,
we will characterize anti-MCC T cells in the tumor microenvironment that are causing this response. These
results will validate the prognostic potential of these cells and identify the mechanism by which it drives ICB
response in VP MCC. My overall career goal is to become a successful, independent physician-scientist. The
rigorous training plan proposed in this fellowship will allow me to achieve that goal by gaining research skills
and knowledge in cellular immunology and bioinformatics. I will be mentored by Dr. Jaehyuk Choi, an expert
physician-scientist in MCC, who has devised a training plan to develop all necessary research skills,
communication skills and promote my professional development. This fellowship will broaden our
understanding of MCC immunology and identify potential novel therapeutic strategies, as well as provide the
necessary foundation for my future career as a physician-scientist."
10826215,"The inferior colliculus is a major integration site in the central auditory system. Rate tuning for certain
behaviorally-important sound features, such as amplitude modulation, is first elaborated upon in the
inferior colliculus, suggesting that it plays an essential role in complex sound processing. Dysfunctional
inferior colliculus organization has been seen in a number of disorders of auditory processing, including
tinnitus, dyslexia and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, our understanding of IC circuitry, particularly amongst
its subdivisions, remains limited. We recently found an unexpected degree of functional heterogeneity in
a substructure within the inferior colliculus known as the dorsal cortex (DC). Previous work has suggested
that the DC does not have subdivisions or a tonotopic arrangement. However, using two-photon imaging
of the DC which allows dense sampling of its surface, our group and others have found two mirror-image
tonotopic maps on the DC surface. These maps divide the DC into a lateral portion (DCL) and a medial
portion (DCM). We have further found that the DCL shows strong preferences for amplitude-modulated
white noise, whereas the DCM shows preferences for pure tone unmodulated sounds. These data suggest
that there may be at least two functionally distinct nuclei within the DC. Here, we will further characterize
these functional differences between DCM and DCL and will determine if there are differences in response
properties to complex sounds, and will determine if DCM and DCL show differential plastic responses to
noise exposure. Successful completion of this work has the potential to add clarity to our currently murky
understanding of the role of the DC in auditory processing and potentially to define new brain subregions
in this structure. More broadly, given the importance of the inferior colliculus in auditory processing, this
work will provide additional insights into the general organization architecture of the inferior colliculus
which will facilitate a greater understanding and targeted therapies for its disorders."

The development of specific therapeutics infectious coronaviruses remains a significant challenge and requires
a detailed mechanistic understanding of virus–host cell interactions and viral pathogenesis. A potential target
for therapeutic intervention is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor produced by alpha-
and beta-coronavirus (α-, β-CoV) that regulates host gene expression. Nsp1 is a key player in a strategy
deemed “host shutoff,” in which expression pathways are shifted from host to viral genes, allowing for virus
proliferation and immune evasion. Biochemical and structural studies have shown that Nsp1 exerts direct
translational control, in certain cases binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit with nanomolar affinity. The
structurally conserved N-terminal core of the protein is thought to be critical for its function, yet its contribution
to Nsp1’s mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, α-CoV Nsp1s only contain and function solely through
this core. Structural studies with Nsp1 and the ribosome together have yet to resolve the Nsp1 N-terminus,
generating a gap in knowledge regarding this domain and the protein’s overall function, and impeding the
development of effective drug candidates targeting Nsp1. The goal of this proposal is to uncover structural
insights into the Nsp1 N-terminal core and establish Nsp1’s specificity in enacting host shut-off, focusing on
Nsp1 proteins in human alpha-coronaviruses. The study will contribute to the long-term goal of understanding
coronavirus pathogenesis and evolution and developing effective therapies against the many prevalent
diseases caused by coronaviruses."

in Ventura (California, US). A diverse group of 150-200 participants representing varied areas of expertise,
academic ranks and locales will come together to discuss and debate new findings related to thalamus and its
interactions with cortical and subcortical networks. The meeting will be preceded by a 2-day Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS) organized by and for trainees to promote science communication and mentorship, and to build
community. The Aims are: 1) To highlight recent developments and new areas of thalamic research, from the
molecular level to whole brain function in health and disease; 2) To foster collaborations among investigators at
all career stages who have diverse areas of expertise and are otherwise unlikely to have the opportunity meet,
discuss, and generate new ideas; and 3) To provide scientific and career development for trainees that promotes
gender balance and diversity. Questions to be addressed at this meeting include the role of thalamus in sleep
and arousal, sensory perception, decision-making, changes in behavioral state (e.g. from sleep to arousal to
engagement), global brain dynamics and how recent insights from the laboratory translate to therapeutic
practice. The speakers are at the forefront of their fields and are instructed to present unpublished work, thus
ensuring that the research discussed is cutting-edge and timely. The roster of speakers is fully balanced by
gender, including the keynote session, ~30% of speakers are junior faculty and include Black, Native American,
and LGBTQ+ individuals. Additional events include a “Power Hour”, an interactive exercise designed to help
members of the community identify and dismantle career barriers that women and underrepresented groups still
face, and a Blue Sky discussion, where a panel of the most forward thinking researchers and the audience will
debate future opportunities for the field. Throughout the GRC, trainees will have the opportunity to engage in
pre-arranged one-on-one mentoring sessions with the speakers to get feedback on their scientific projects and
career goals. Each day will also offer opportunities for informal interactions at poster sessions, meals, and other
events. The overall structure of the GRC creates a collegial atmosphere that is intellectually open and energizing,
thus facilitating the exchange of knowledge and ideas. To promote an inclusive environment, the GRC
administrators have identified options for childcare, and the site is ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
compliant. Thus, the conference is fine-tuned to foster new insights and collaborations and provide a wide variety
of mentorship opportunities. Our expected outcomes are that participants will leave the conference with fresh
ideas and new collaborations that will advance the field, and that junior colleagues will have established
relationships with other investigators to promote their scientific and career development. Moreover, this
conference will provide an indelible example of how diversity and excellence in science go hand-in-hand."

The thematic focus of this Center is to understand how a signaling hub of molecules that regulate small GTPases
contribute to the precise developmental formation and maturation of inter-connectivity between neuronal
components of cortical microcircuits. The Center will address this goal with interrelated projects that will provide
an in-depth examination of the function of Trio and SynGAP; two potent regulators of GTPase signaling in the
developing brain. Multiple signaling molecules are involved in the organization and refinement of cortical
microcircuits that are required for correct information processing in the cortex. Trio and Syngap1 are known to
regulate synaptic connections but how they contribute to precise arrangements of cortical microcircuits through
neuronal migration, synaptic morphogenesis and refinement of connections during development is not known.
Pathogenic variants in these genes are causally linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that, while characterized
by heterogeneous genetic etiology, have shared symptoms. Convergence in symptoms suggests that disorders
with diverse molecular causes can be understood by defining the pathophysiological consequences on the
synapses and circuits that underlie the disrupted behaviors. In Project 3, we will address the broader goals of
The Center by analyzing the roles of these complex signaling molecules in the formation and refinement of
cortical microcircuits. Using ex vivo functional electrophysiological and optogenetic mapping approaches we will
dissect the effect of disrupted Trio and SynGAP signaling on cortical architecture. The project will assess (1) the
spatial cell-type and temporal functions of Trio and SynGAP, (2) the importance of enzymatic and non-enzymatic
functional domains to their roles in cortical connectivity, and (3) the action of novel small molecule inhibitors of
these GTPase regulators in synaptic function and connectivity at acute and chronic timescales. These studies
will transform our understanding of how Trio and SynGAP function in developing cortical circuits and along with
collaborative and integrated efforts in the Center will create a foundational understanding of their roles in
neurodevelopment."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. HMG-CoA
reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, statins, show high potential in the prevention and treatment of cancer including
HCC. We will investigate the mechanism by which statins fight against HCC and discovering the biomarkers to
predict the therapeutic effects. Through our previously published work, we have used our conditional transgenic
mouse models of HCC to identify a novel pathway that statins suppress MYC signaling to execute the anti-cancer
properties. Also, we identified that MYC rewires metabolic pathways to promote fatty acid synthesis in addition
to glucose and glutamine pathways. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by TOFA elicits dramatic regression of MYC
driven tumors and the efficacy correlates to MYC level. Statin (e.g., Atorvastatin) blocks MYC phosphorylation in
our MYC-driven HCC model and inhibit tumor initiation and progression (see our Preliminary Results). We
hypothesize that the MYC pathway is suppressed by statins and this is a mechanism by which statins can prevent
and treat HCC, both through direct anti-oncogene effects as well as by restoring immune surveillance. We will
determine the mechanisms by which statins protect against HCC, we propose to 1) evaluate the anti-cancer
efficacy of statins at different progression stages of MYC driven HCC (before MYC induction, early stage of
tumorigenesis, late stage of HCC) and the condition of association with NASH; 2) identify specific metabolism
pathways regulated by statin in MYC-HCC; 3) define the changes of immune system and specific
effectors/cytokines influenced by statin; 4) discover the biomarkers that can predict the therapeutic effect of statin
in prevention of HCC. Our team includes expertise in Medical Oncology, the MYC oncogene and Tumor
Immunology (Felsher), Gastroenterology and HCC (Dhanasekaran) and Hepatology and liver disease (Verna
and Brown). Dr. Verna and Dr. Brown are members of the Liver Cirrhosis Network (LCN) clinical program (RAF-
CA-23-023) and are currently investigating the effect of lipid lowing medications (Statins) in patients with
compensated NASH, ALD, cholestatic and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The LCN study provides us with a unique
opportunity to identify mechanisms through use of our preclinical transgenic mouse model of HCC that can be
evaluated using human clinical samples to available to us through the LCN. Our work will help identify lead to
the identification of the mechanisms by which statins can block HCC as well as identify biomarkers that can
predict when these agents are most likely to be useful in preventing HCC."

This application is a competitive renewal of the training grant “Research Training in Diabetes and
Endocrinology,” which would represent years 47-51 of the first, and longest-running, T32 grant at the University
of Pittsburgh. The longevity is a testament to the success of the program in providing postdoctoral trainees with
the research/career skills necessary for developing independent academic careers. Over that time period, the
research landscape has changed dramatically, and this training program has adapted to complement the
changes. One notable and relatively recent change is the increased complexity of medical research, requiring
cross-discipline integration of research programs. This change necessitates that researchers operate in an
environment that provides a thorough grounding in the translational focus of medical research. Added to this is
the need for ever greater competency in the ancillary skills that are required to complement the core research
skills – including project, group, and multi-team collaboration management, grant writing, public presentations,
transitioning to independence, and others. Historically, these skills were often learned ‘on the fly’, but now
require a more structured approach. During the current cycle of the program we have worked assiduously to
implement such a program, which we believe has resulted in great success and outcomes. Thus, our trainees
are continuously immersed through hands-on-mentoring, peer-to-peer interactions, research experiences,
didactic classes, education workshops, and presentation opportunities in a truly integrated translational
research training program. At a practical level, this is reflected in (i) outstanding research opportunities that are
centered on three research hubs (basic, clinical, and public health/epidemiology); (ii) exceptional training
faculty with expertise in basic, clinical, and public health/epidemiology research; (iii) access to a range of
didactic courses, workshops, and educational experiences, including masters and certificate programs, that
buttress and complement research opportunities and, in many cases, emphasize translational themes; (iv)
structured career development courses that impart skills ranging from managing group projects to presentation
skills, through the T32-to-K-to-R grant transition; (v) a continuous assessment program for trainees, reinforced
by an Individual Career Development Plan, a 3-person mentoring team, and yearly progress evaluations by a
Training Committee that focuses on the individualized professional development of trainees; and (vi) program
management that oversees the ever-increasing complexity of research training in medical research, including
internal and external advisory boards. Our expectation over the next cycle of the training program is that we will
continue to train 4 postdoctoral fellows per year, with a mix of MDs and PhDs, and will offer two to three years
of support to each trainee. At the time of writing, 11 trainees have been supported by the training program in
the 2016-2021 cycle, and 8 have graduated (3 are still in training). Seven graduates applied for, or received,
competitive grant funding, 7 graduates remain active in research careers, and 3 obtained faculty positions.
Nineteen first author peer-reviewed publications were produced (43 total peer-reviewed publications), and 27
first author abstracts were presented at national scientific meetings. All 8 graduates published at least one first
author original research manuscript. Eighteen grants were submitted and 11 were funded. These metrics
represent concrete and categorical evidence of the continued success of our training program."

Monitoring gene delivery in deep tissues is critical for in vivo studies and translation of gene therapies, but
available methods for achieving such measurements have limited capabilities. Ideally, levels of gene expression
could be noninvasively measured anywhere in the body of both small and large animals. Ideally, multiple genes
could be measured at once, without the need for expensive equipment that would put such a method out of
financial reach for academic research groups. However, no such method exists as of now. In this proposal, we
will develop technologies for monitoring gene expression that, when fully developed, will be: 1) noninvasive, 2)
site-specific, 3) could view multiple types of molecules at once (high-multiplexity of imaging), 4) are not impacted
by the depth of penetration, skull thickness, or organ size; 5) will use inexpensive equipment allowing
democratized access. To achieve this, we will attempt a drastically different approach – instead of imaging
reporters within the deep tissue, we will design reporters that can be easily transported from a known region of
the brain into the blood, where they can be easily measured. We will develop two independent methods for
achieving this goal. First, will express gene expression reporters that exit the cells into brain interstitial space.
Then we will temporarily enhance vascular permeability in selected ~millimeter-sized brain regions to allow for
free diffusion of these reporters from the brain into the blood. In the second method, we will develop a new class
of gene expression reporters that can cross through an intact brain vasculature to continuously report on gene
expression within the transduced brain cells. Spatial precision could be provided for this method using
noninvasive gene delivery that genetically labels cells with site-specificity. With each of these methods, we will
be able to measure gene expression in a specific brain region with a simple blood draw. Our technologies will
be particularly beneficial in the studies of large animal species, where monitoring gene expression in the brain,
in most cases, is not feasible without euthanasia. While initially focused on the brain as a test-case with a high
need for such methods, the same concepts can be applied to other tissues."
10861826,"Repeated alcohol experiences can produce long-lasting memories for sensory cues associated with intoxication.
These memories can problematically trigger relapse in individuals recovering from alcohol use disorder (AUD).
The molecular mechanisms by which ethanol changes memories to become long-lasting and inflexible remain
unclear. We recently demonstrated that formation of these memories results in expression of alternative
transcript isoforms in memory-encoding neurons in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila rely on mushroom body
(MB) neurons to make associative memories, including memories of ethanol-associated sensory cues.
Decreasing expression of genes that play a role in splicing in adult MB neurons reduces formation of these
memories, demonstrating the necessity of RNA processing in ethanol memory formation. Moreover, decreasing
expression of genes that are alternatively spliced like the Dopamine-2-like Receptor (Dop2R) in adult MB
neurons reduces ethanol memory formation. This suggests that the splicing changes in these genes has
functional implications for future memory formation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the dynamic
alternative splicing of Dop2R in response to alcohol exposure directs reward behavior by changing the activity
of neural circuits.
We generated mutant Drosophila that have forced expression of the naïve or trained Dop2R isoform, which
allows us to interrogate how these splice variants affect neural dynamics and behavior at a highly mechanistic
level. The applicant will reveal intracellular localization of DOP2R protein (Aim 1, how alternative splicing of
Dop2R affects reward memory (Aim 2), and plasticity within memory circuits (Aim 3). By completing these aims,
the applicant will gain scientific and technical expertise in cellular neurobiology and neurogenetics, behavioral
assessment of Drosophila, super-resolution imaging, and 2-photon calcium imaging. Through a comprehensive
training plan, this fellowship will facilitate the professional development of the applicant in robust experimental
design and data analysis; written and oral scientific communication; and effective and inclusive mentoring.

10861827,"The use of nano-enabled chemotherapy to trigger an immune response to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) introduces a novel approach for overcoming robust barriers to immunotherapy, including poor
immunogenicity, low neoantigen burden, stromal interference (“T-cell exclusion”), overexpression of
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), and the immune privileged environment of the liver favoring metastatic
spread. Our preliminary data show that lipid-bilayer coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (silicasomes)
provide an effective platform for inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by delivering prescreened
chemotherapeutic agents to the PDAC site. ICD promotes the presentation of endogenous tumor antigens
cells, raising the hypothesis that ICD offers a promising endogenous vaccination approach to generate a “hot”
tumor microenvironment (TME) that can be propagated by co-delivery of drugs interfering in regionally
overexpressed immunosuppressive pathways. These pathways can be targeted by inhibitors of IDO-1, CXCR4
(T-cell exclusion) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (which controls PD-1 expression). We also propose that
metastatic spread can be reduced by ICD-induced memory T-cells and delivery of “stimulator of interferon
genes” (STING) agonists to tolerogenic antigen presenting cells in the liver. The long-term goal of our
interdisciplinary efforts is to develop a chemo-immunotherapy platform for delivery of ICD stimuli by the
silicasome contemporaneous with inhibitors of immune checkpoint and T-cell exclusion pathways (CXCR4).
The objectives include the use of innovative drug loading and cholesterol-conjugated prodrugs to synthesize
silicasomes that can be used to obtain the best synergy between ICD stimuli and inhibitors of
immunosuppressive pathways in orthotopic and genetic engineered PDAC models. This requires research
discovery into the mechanistic basis of synergy between ICD and regional immune escape pathways. We will
use an integrin-targeting, tumor-penetrating iRGD peptide to enhance drug delivery by a transcytosis pathway.
We will also construct polymeric nanocarriers to deliver STING agonists for preventing metastatic spread to the
liver. The rationale is that the use of an ICD approach to generate a “hot” tumor environment will facilitate
combination immunotherapy with improvement of PDAC mortality. We plan to test our hypothesis by pursuing
the following specific aims: Aim 1: To develop a nano-enabled chemo-immunotherapy platform for PDAC that
utilizes an endogenous (ICD-mediated) treatment approach plus interference in regionally overexpressed
immune checkpoint pathways to generate a “hot” tumor environment. Aim 2: To enhance the immunotherapy
impact of the ICD platform by using integrin-targeting, tumor-penetrating iRGD peptides and developing a
silicasome that interferes in T-cell exclusion in the stroma through the delivery of CXCR4 inhibitors. Aim #3: To
reprogram the immune suppressive effects of liver APC by STING nanoparticles that promote eradication of
PDAC metastases by the memory T-cells generated by ICD-inducing silicasomes."

most frequently performed surgeries in the US. In male mice that express the human aromatase enzyme
(Aromhum), we previously found that increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol (E2) via aromatase and
increased E2 action via high expression of estrogen receptor- (ESR1) in lower abdominal muscle (LAM)
fibroblasts drive LAM fibrosis and myocyte atrophy, leading to LAM wall weakness and hernia formation. These
histologic and molecular changes are analogous to those found in inguinal hernias in elderly men. Aromatase
inhibitors and anti-estrogens can reverse this process in male Aromhum mice but have serious side effects such
as sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis in humans. We discovered that progesterone (P4) receptor (PGR), the
key mediator of E2/ESR1 action, is exclusively expressed in LAM fibroblasts that express high levels of ESR1
in Aromhum mice. The long-term objective of the proposed study is to determine the role of P4/PGR action in LAM
fibrosis and myocyte atrophy associated with a subset of inguinal hernias. Preliminary data showed that: PGR-
expressing LAM fibroblasts were highly enriched in Aromhum but absent in WT control mice; PGR expression in
Aromhum LAM fibroblasts was induced by E2 and blocked by ESR1 antagonists or ESR1 deletion; Aromhum LAM
fibroblast proliferation was induced by P4+E2 treatment, but not by P4 or E2 alone; P4+E2 induced large hernias
within one week in all WT mice, whereas it took 6 weeks of E2 treatment to detect small hernias in fewer mice;
the P4/PGR antagonists mifepristone and ulipristal acetate prevented hernia development and maintained
normal LAM anatomy in Aromhum mice. We hypothesize that enhanced P4/PGR signaling caused by E2/ESR1
action in highly P4-sensitive LAM tissues drives LAM fibroblast proliferation, fibrosis, and myocyte atrophy,
leading to hernia formation. Our hypothesis is consistent with the remarkable and parallel increases in skeletal
muscle fibrosis and atrophy, inguinal hernia incidence, and PGR expression in fibroblasts of LAM tissues in most
aging men. We propose the following aims: 1. Determine the mechanisms whereby treatment with P4/PGR
antagonists prevents or reverses LAM fibrosis, muscle atrophy, and hernia formation in Aromhum mice. We will
examine P4/PGR-mediated genomic mechanisms responsible for LAM fibroblast proliferation and extracellular
matrix formation using integrative in vivo multiomic analyses and PGR-ChIP-seq on LAM fibroblasts of Aromhum
mice treated with P4 or a P4/PGR antagonist. 2. Determine whether the genetic disruption of PGR selectively in
skeletal muscle fibroblasts affects LAM tissue fibrosis and hernia formation in Aromhum mice. We will also assess
P4/E2 levels and expression of PGR and PGR-responsive and profibrotic genes in LAM biopsies from men with
or without hernia and determine the correlation between PGR, ESR1, and fibrosis. Our study will identify new
drug targets and likely lead to the discovery of preventive and therapeutic approaches for hernia in high-risk
populations since long-term treatment of men with P4/PGR antagonists such as mifepristone is well tolerated."

Fatigue interference with activities, mood, and cognition is one of the most prevalent and distressing concerns
of advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients. As fatigue interferes with patient functioning, family caregivers
often report feeling burdened by increasing responsibilities. Evidence-based interventions addressing cancer
patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden are lacking. In pilot studies, acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT) has shown potential for reducing symptom-related suffering in cancer patients. We recently
conducted a pilot study testing a novel, dyadic ACT intervention for patients and family caregivers coping with
advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The intervention combines acceptance and mindfulness exercises (e.g.,
meditations, performing activities with greater awareness) with identification of personal values and
engagement in activities consistent with these values. This telephone-based intervention showed strong
evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and promise for reducing patient fatigue interference with functioning and
caregiver burden. The proposed phase II trial seeks to more definitively examine the efficacy of our telephone-
based ACT intervention for advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients with moderate to severe fatigue
interference and their family caregivers with significant caregiving burden. In this trial, 244 patient-caregiver
dyads will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to either the ACT intervention or an education/support
control condition. Dyads in both conditions will attend six weekly 50-minute telephone sessions. The primary
aim of this study is to test the effect of telephone-delivered ACT on patient fatigue interference and caregiver
burden. Secondary outcomes include patient sleep interference and patient and caregiver engagement in daily
activities and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post-intervention, and 3 months
post-intervention. This trial will also examine whether increases in psychological flexibility, defined as full
awareness of the present moment while persisting in action aligned with personal values, account for the
beneficial effect of ACT on primary outcomes. Demonstrating ACT’s efficacy will support its adoption in cancer
care. This trial will also lay the groundwork for further application and testing of ACT with a wide range of
patients and caregivers coping with serious illnesses and functional outcomes."

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of systemic organ
damage, often the liver and kidneys. It poses significant clinical challenges in terms of accurate early prediction
and effective prevention and treatment, with grievous maternal and neonatal consequences. One promising yet
relatively unexplored avenue is the vaginal ecosystem: its microbiome, metabolome, and host immune
components. The vaginal microbiome is capable of influencing systemic and local inflammation, producing a
wide range of metabolites, and is the likely source for ascending infections with the ability to translocate to
other reproductive organs. It may therefore provide insights that will advance our understanding and
management of preeclampsia. This project therefore proposes an in-depth study of the vaginal ecosystem in
severe preeclampsia, aiming to uncover the microbial and molecular properties of the vaginal ecosystem that
indicate, predispose to, or contribute to preeclampsia. We hypothesize that the early pregnancy vaginal
microbiome is strongly associated with subsequent development of preeclampsia, facilitated by specific
microbes, host immune states, or microbial metabolites. We will capitalize on one of the largest and most well-
phenotyped pregnancy cohorts collected to date, the nuMoM2b study. This was a diverse, national, multi-
center cohort that collected detailed clinical data in addition to vaginal swabs at three time points along
pregnancy. We will conduct longitudinal metagenomic and metabolomic profiling of ~4,200 vaginal samples
from 389 nulliparous pregnancies with severe preeclampsia and 389 matched controls, in addition to profiling
host immune factors using immunoassays. This dataset would contribute significantly to the microbiome
community, drive discovery in the field, and enable us and other researchers to study host-microbiome
interactions, in general and specifically in the context of preeclampsia, with an unprecedented depth. Using this
data, we will identify microbial associations with severe preeclampsia, longitudinally and cross-sectionally, and
their interactions with host immune factors. We will further use a metabolomics approach focused on broad
structural annotation and identifying metabolite sources to detect vaginal metabolites associated with
preeclampsia, aiming to elucidate their roles as mediators of host-microbiome interactions. We will combine all
collected molecular data along with clinical covariates to devise supervised machine learning models that
predict the risk for preeclampsia early in pregnancy. Findings from this project would illuminate the potential
processes by which the vaginal microbiome influences preeclampsia, providing specific mechanistic
hypotheses for future validation and possibly leading to new therapeutic targets and diagnostics."

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses must hijack cellular machinery to facilitate productive infection. For
DNA viruses that depend on host RNA processing machinery to produce viral transcripts, common targets of
manipulation include both cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the enzymes mediating the post-
translational modifications (PTMs) that govern their functions. Arginine methylation is a PTM deposited by a
family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) and involved in multiple aspects of RNA processing. While
the roles of arginine methylation and PRMTs constitute an emerging field in multiple areas of biology, relatively
little is known about their functions during viral infection. The objective of this project is to utilize human
Adenovirus (AdV) as a model system to address the roles of arginine methylation during infection. AdV is an
important human pathogen and also well recognized as a tool for investigating fundamental cellular processes.
Preliminary data from the Weitzman lab demonstrate an intriguing global decrease of arginine methylation on
cellular RBPs throughout AdV infection. Concurrently, arginine methylation of late region 4 (L4) 100 kDa
nonstructural protein (100K) dramatically increases as infection progresses. Furthermore, 100K expression is
sufficient to cause relocalization of PRMT1 from its normally nuclear subcellular compartment to the cytoplasm,
an event which correlates with a 100K-dependent loss of arginine methylation on cellular RBPs. Additionally,
methylation of the host RBP hnRNPA1 decreases in response to 100K expression alone. Arginine methylation
of hnRNPA1 is known to regulate its splicing capacity, and AdV is well known to manipulate host splicing
machinery, but knowledge of the role of hnRNPA1 during AdV infection is limited. These collective findings inform
my hypothesis that 100K acts as a molecular sponge of PRMT1 activity, leading to the loss of arginine
methylation of RBPs such as hnRNPA1, and thus regulating this splicing factor’s RNA-binding capacity and
function to promote efficient AdV splicing. In Aim 1 I will determine the requirement of 100K for PRMT
relocalization (confocal microscopy, IP-WB) and decreased hnRNPA1 methylation (isothermal calorimetry, MS-
based competition experiments). In Aim 2 I will determine if 100K impacts hnRNPA1 RNA-binding (eCLIP, RNA
Binding-Region Identification) and splicing abilities (qPCR-based splicing assays, molecular cloning, WB, plaque
assays) to benefit viral infection. This study will be the first to describe a mechanism of viral manipulation of
arginine methylation to promote infection. Results of this proposal will expand our understanding of how
pathogens interfere with PTM machinery, thus informing future studies to develop appropriate therapeutics
targeting arginine methylation to treat viral infections. This research will take place in the collaborative and
interdisciplinary environment of the Weitzman lab and the integrated communities of both the University of
Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Skills gained from this training fellowship will prepare
me for a career as a principal investigator investigating molecular processes governing virus-host interactions."
10824459,"Project Summary/Abstract
I am an MD/PhD student in the laboratory of Dr. Susanne Wells at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. This proposal outlines a research project designed to
prepare me for a combined dual-degree career path in metabolism and cancer biology. The overall research
goal is to determine how loss of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway leads to metabolic reprogramming
and tumor progression. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the FA pathway promote the development of
uniquely aggressive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) progression and a poor prognosis. While
up to 20% of sporadic HNSCC tumors harbor mutations in FA genes, it is unclear whether sporadic loss of the
FA pathway also promotes aggressive tumor progression. To begin to answer this question, I have generated
an in vivo xenograft model wherein FA-deficient knockdown (vs. –proficient control) sporadic HNSCC cells were
injected into the cheek mucosa of immunodeficient mice. FA-deficient tumors were more proliferative, invasive,
and of higher grade than their FA-proficient counterparts. Previous in vitro studies in the Wells laboratory
identified a potential mechanism for these phenotypes by discovering two drivers of invasion in FA-deficient
HNSCC cells: (1) activation of the non-homologous end joining associated DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-
PK) and dependent downstream stimulation of the GTPase Rac1, and (2) accumulation of the glycosphingolipid
GM3 ganglioside. Rac1 activation can upregulate folate and potentially related metabolic pathways like 1-carbon
(1C) metabolism. In turn, 1C metabolism can contribute to GM3 ganglioside synthesis and other cancer-driving
processes. My experiments have determined that 1C metabolism was indeed upregulated across multiple FA-
deficient HNSCC cell lines, and the incorporation of 1C inhibitors sensitized FA-deficient HNSCC cells and tumor
spheroids to decreased growth compared to FA-proficient counterparts. Thus, FA pathway loss-dependent
activation of DNA-PK and Rac1 may stimulate 1C metabolism, and 1C metabolism in turn may drive aggressive
tumor behavior in FA-deficient systems. Aim 1 will test whether DNA-PK/Rac1 activation are FA-dependent
stimulators of 1C metabolism. I expect to detect activation of DNA-PK/Rac1 and dependent upregulation of 1C
metabolites across multiple 2D and 3D tumor spheroids and organotypic raft models of FA-deficient HNSCC
cells. These experiments will therefore define a novel mechanism by which loss of a DNA repair pathway
promotes aberrant metabolic stimulation. Aim 2 will define the functional roles of 1C metabolism in FA disease
phenotypes by testing enzymes and metabolites as candidate therapeutic targets. I expect that inhibitors of 1C
metabolism will suppress cancer phenotypes such as migration and invasion in vitro, and prevent the growth
and progression of FA-deficient HNSCC tumors in vivo. Taken together, these experiments will define novel links
between FA pathway loss and cancer metabolism, and thus explore possible metabolic or nutritional
interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of lethal cancers in FA and in the general population."
10824534,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is accompanied by reductions in multiple components of the dopamine system and concomitant declines
in cognition. Alterations in dopamine signaling have been posited to be major drivers of age-related changes in
multiple cognitive domains including reward processing, memory encoding and memory consolidation. Salient
events, such as those associated with rewards, are more likely to be remembered later. Evidence from animal
models has demonstrated that reactivation of neural activity contributes to prioritization of rewarding events. In
recent human fMRI studies, activation patterns produced during specific task conditions persisted into periods
of rest following the task, and the strength of this persistence is related to better memory performance.
However, the exact mechanisms driving reinstatement of fMRI patterns remain unknown. The current project
will test, for the first time in humans, whether greater dopamine release is related to reinstatement of fMRI
activation patterns, and whether dopamine function impacts the relationship between reinstatement and reward
memory. Endogenous dopamine release will be quantified in vivo in cognitively normal older adults using the
positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]raclopride and a within-subjects pharmacological protocol
using the dopamine reuptake-inhibitor methylphenidate. fMRI pattern reinstatement will be measured using
multi-voxel pattern analysis and a classifier algorithm to distinguish between fMRI patterns associated with
high and low reward task conditions. Reinstatement of these patterns into periods of rest following the task will
determine persistence of reward-related activation. This project will use a healthy aging sample where there is
substantial inter-individual variability in all measures of interest and where defining the impact of suboptimal
dopamine function is most clinically relevant. Analyses will include Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathology
(tau and β-amyloid) as covariates. Dopamine is rarely studied in the context of AD and accounting for
pathology will allow for assessment of cognitive and neural effects that are specifically related to dopamine.
Aim 1 will establish relationships between dopamine function and reward-related fMRI patterns during
encoding. Aim 2 will link fMRI reinstatement, dopamine, and cognitive performance. We predict that individuals
with the highest dopamine release will demonstrate distinct fMRI patterns for high versus low reward task
conditions, suggesting that dopamine contributes to tuning and sharpening neural activity for reward-related
events. The proposed project will allow the PI to train in (1) advanced neuroimaging, (2) reward processing in
aging, (3) statistics, (4) scientific communication, and (5) mentorship. Dr. Anne Berry (sponsor) and Dr. Jacob
Hooker (co-sponsor) have expertise in PET, fMRI, and aging. Brandeis University and the Massachusetts
General Hospital provide exceptional faculty, neuroimaging facilities, and professional development
opportunities. Completion of the proposed project and training plan will support the PI in successful pursuit of a
career studying aging and neuromodulator systems."
10825135,"Physiological and biochemical processes in nearly every species (including humans) are regulated by the
circadian clock. For example, the reproductive system (of females) requires tight temporal organization of
estrogen-sensitive neural circuits that allows the hypothalamo-pituitry gonadal (HPG) axis to function properly.
In mammals, the body’s master pacemaker—the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—allows for coordination of
such neuroendocrine events to ensure that ovulation occurs at the time in which reproductive success can be
maximized. Evidence supporting the importance of proper clock function on fertility comes from several lines
of work demonstrating that misalignment of biological rhythms or disrupted function of the body’s master clock
(resulting from shift work, jet, lag, etc.) negatively impact reproduction—interfering with both male and female
fertility. Along these lines, knock-down of clock genes leads to impairments in fertility, and disruption of
circadian clock timing resulting from a reduction of sleep duration and/or architecture negatively impacts male
sex hormones and semen quality and leads to ovulatory deficiencies in females. Despite these well-
established observations that proper clock functioning is important to reproductive success, it is still unknown
whether a circadian rhythm exists in the propensity for sexual behavior and to what degree such a behavioral
rhythm may influence reproductive outcomes. Additionally, the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors as
a function of time-of-day have yet to be studied. Of note, it was recently shown that the propensity for
behavioral aggression follows a daily rhythm that is regulated by a circuit spanning the master clock (SCN), its
postsynaptic target the subparaventricular zone (SPZ), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH).
Interestingly, the VMH has been shown to modulate both aggression and mating behaviors. Such results
suggest that this SCN—SPZ—VMH circuit may also mediate time-of-day dependent sexual behaviors. Hence,
this pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of circadian dysfunction in people
experiencing idiopathic infertility. In this proposal, I will study how circadian clock time affects reproductive
behavior. I will first determine whether temporal overlap of male and female peak sexual behavior influences
reproductive success (Aim 1). I will also examine the hypothalamic circuitry that underlies the rhythm in sexual
behavior in mice (Aim 2), testing whether the first node of the pathway that regulates rhythms in aggression
(i.e. SCN—SPZ) also regulates rhythms in sexual behavior. Finally, using a chemogenetic approach, I will test
whether this hypothalamic circuit can be acutely manipulated to change sexual behavior levels across the day
(Aim 3). This work will test the hypothesis that the circadian rhythm in sexual behavior impacts conception and
that this drive is regulated by a similar circuit to that modulating aggression rhythms. Results from this project
will lay groundwork for our understanding of how hypothalamic circuits that modulate reproductive behavior
can be harnessed to treat infertility."

Increasing evidence indicates that air pollution is a relevant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) even
at low exposure levels. American Indian populations experience the highest burden of CVD compared to other
racial/ethnic groups in the US and thus may be particularly vulnerable to air pollution. Further, although air
pollution exposure levels have decreased in recent decades in the general US population, these decreases are
less pronounced in American Indian populations, suggesting environmental disparities in air pollution
mitigation. However, there is currently a lack of relevant data to comprehensively characterize air pollution
levels, components, and sources in American Indian and other rural populations, which are needed to inform
effective mitigation and intervention strategies. We propose to study the associations of air pollution exposure
with CVD as well as with subclinical risk factors for CVD (blood pressure) in American Indian communities in
the Southwest and Great Plains. We will leverage data from the NHLBI-funded Strong Heart Study (SHS)
cohort to study short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of air pollution in American Indian communities.
Aim 1: We will characterize ambient air pollution via measurements and spatio-temporal modeling in the three
SHS study regions (Arizona, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota). For four years, we will use filters and
pumping boxes at a central site in each study region to obtain two-week average concentrations of ambient
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its components including black and organic carbon, metals, and acids. We
will also obtain two-week averages of ozone (O3) levels using passive samples. In a subset of 240 SHS
participants (80 per region) in three different seasons, we will measure ambient real-time PM2.5 levels for one
week. Our measurements and other available PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and O3 data will be used to build
spatio-temporal air pollution models for SHS regions. Source apportionment will be used to identify pollution
sources. Aim 2: We will determine short-term cardiovascular effects of air pollution exposure in these
communities. We will evaluate associations between ambient PM2.5 levels and composition, NO2, and O3 (from
Aim 1) with measures of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in 240 SHS participants in three repeated
measurements over 18 months. Aim 3: We will determine long-term cardiovascular effects of ambient air
pollution exposure. We will evaluate associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3
(estimated with our model in Aim 1) and incident CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure) in the SHS
cohort (N = 2,736) and its family expansion (N = 2,769) using high-quality data for 2000–2024. This study will
comprehensively characterize air pollution exposures and associations with clinical CVD outcomes in
American Indian and rural populations. Our data will provide critical data needed to inform National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, ultimately contributing to strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of low-level air
pollution exposures especially in already vulnerable populations including American Indians."

Community engaged research (CER) is a historically underutilized approach in behavioral and social science
research (BSSR). Further, when utilized by BSSR researchers, CER has traditionally been conducted in a top-
down approach, with researchers designing studies and collecting data without input or consent from the
communities involved in their studies. This top-down approach has been criticized for being paternalistic, and
for not meaningfully including the perspectives, lived experience, and expertise of community members.
Moreover, BSSR has often been used to justify policies and programs that have had negative consequences
for communities, especially for those who are marginalized. This has led to a mistrust of behavioral and social
science research within marginalized communities. However, there is a growing movement in BSSR to adopt
CER approaches. These approaches involve working directly with communities to identify research questions,
collect data, and interpret results. It also involves sharing research findings with communities and using them
to develop programs and policies that benefit communities. By engaging with communities, researchers can
improve the quality of their research, increase the impact of their research, and build trusting relationships
between researchers and communities. While institutions may now be adapting their curricula to include topics
such as community engagement, health equity, and related methodologies, this subject area is not universal
across BSSR education. Thus, there is ample opportunity for research education programs, such as short
courses, to create shared community learning spaces for reflection, mentorship, and practice between BSSR
scholars, students and health practitioners. In response to “Short Courses on Innovative Methodologies and
Approaches in the Behavioral and Social Sciences” (RFA-OD-23-003), we propose “Community Engagement:
A Short Course to Optimize Research Endeavors” (CE-SCORE). This short course will utilize the principles of
critical adult education (CEA), a form of adult education that aims to empower learners to critically analyze the
world around them and take action to transform it. CEA asks learners to consider power relations and
ideologies, such as those between scientist and citizen, in order to allow the learner to reflect on their current
and future research practices. In this way, CEA and CER are aligned in their concern with community
empowerment, social justice, and social change to create a more just and equitable world. CE-SCORE
promises to empower students to critically engage with CER principles, and learn to apply them in real-world
settings that are relevant to students’ community contexts. The teaching methodologies and course curriculum
will empower emerging and current public health scholars, students, and practitioners to reflect on their current
practice, and learn to enact CER values, in order to transform the world around them through research."

Although lifestyle factors have been investigated for their potential to modify risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes, initiating interventions during pregnancy may not have the greatest impact. Therefore, it is crucial to
focus on preconception interventions to support healthy placental development and reduce the risk of
metabolic conditions. However, there is a lack of data regarding the optimal timing and strategies for
preconception health to improve pregnancy outcomes. Physical activity, diet, and sleep play pivotal roles in
preconception care as they influence metabolic health and body weight regulation, which can impact the
subsequent risk of pregnancy complications. Existing preconception care often emphasizes weight loss, but
there is limited evidence on the most effective amounts and strategies for improving later pregnancy health.
Moreover, using body mass index as the primary measure for obesity classification may misidentify individuals
who would benefit the most from weight loss, as it fails to distinguish between lean mass, fat mass, and fat
distribution. Methodological challenges in studying preconception exposures have hindered the establishment
of a robust evidence base for optimizing pregnancy health. To address these gaps, we propose an innovative
approach utilizing the linkage between the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) and Medicaid data.
With this data examine pregnancy outcomes among low-income reproductive-aged women who become
pregnant and utilize Medicaid services following their NHANES assessment. Medicaid covers a substantial
portion of U.S. births, making studies of Medicaid-covered pregnancies highly generalizable. Leveraging the
NHANES-Medicaid data as a ""preconception cohort,"" we will investigate the impact of preconception
exposures on pregnancy outcomes. Employing advanced epidemiological methods to minimize selection bias
and improve generalizability, we will apply a target trial framework to assess preconception strategies for
optimizing pregnancy outcomes. The comprehensive phenotyping data available in NHANES will enable robust
assessment of confounding variables, reducing the impact of unmeasured confounders and mimicking
randomized trials of lifestyle factors. Using NHANES-assessed exposures, we will evaluate the influence of
preconception dietary patterns, physical activity, sleep, body composition, and weight loss attempts and
strategies on adverse pregnancy outcomes. This analysis will provide the most extensive and generalizable
evidence to date on preconception health and its impact on adverse pregnancy outcomes, ultimately informing
the development of evidence-based preconception care guidelines."
10861890,"Persons with similar amount of Alzheimer's or vascular brain pathology on imaging or autopsy may have had
very different clinical and functional experiences during life. One possible reason could be varying amounts of
cognitive reserve, or brain health which protects them from clinical manifestations. Thus, just as a healthy bone
mass through life protects from osteoporosis and fractures, having a healthy brain at age 65-85, a consequence
of genetic propensity and lifelong environmental, behavioral and disease-related factors, will protect from
development of AD, dementia and stroke. How do we define a healthy brain phenotype? Brain health is typically
characterized using quantitative measurements MRI and PET brain imaging, cognitive testing and at autopsy.
Other dimensions of brain health, often altered in aging, prior to cognition, include retinal structure and
vasculature, olfactory, visual, auditory, tactile and sensory perception and motor abilities. Sensory-motor
measures are promising early biomarkers of AD and may play a causal role in the development or progression
of dementia. An NIA workshop titled “Sensory and Motor dysfunctions in Aging and AD” concluded that
comprehensive sensory motor testing would provide key mechanistic insights into AD pathogenesis. We
propose to incorporate multiple such sensory-motor measures in the recently funded 10th exam for 1874
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring and Omni 1 cohort participants and develop a multi-dimensional
sensory-motor Brain Health Index (smBHI), as well as a composite BHI (cBHI) that additionally includes brain
MRI and cognitive measures. Predictors and outcomes related to the BHI will be identified using the extensive

Cerebral malaria is a serious complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection where infected red blood cells
(iRBC) adhere to brain endothelial cells, eventually leading to disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Our
previous work has identified that P. falciparum-iRBC do not cause the death of brain-microvascular endothelial
cells (HBMEC) in vitro, but induce specific signaling causing the disruption of inter-endothelial junctions and
resulting in the loss of barrier function.
We have also observed that hemozoin, a crystallized byproduct of the digestion of hemoglobin by the parasite,
induces the disruption of inter-cellular HBMEC junctions when it was isolated from P. falciparum-iRBC, but not
when it was synthetized in vitro. These findings suggest that natural hemozoin may serve as a carrier for P.
falciparum active biomolecules that are the ultimate cause the disruption of the brain endothelium. To define the
role of natural hemozoin in the disruption of brain endothelial barrier during cerebral malaria we will characterize
this effect in vitro and determine whether hemozoin acts as a carrier for other bioactive parasite-derived
molecules. The identification of specific bioactive molecules will be attempted. The activity of natural hemozoin
will be validated in an in vitro model of the human BBB neuro-endothelial environment, which represents the
complexity of the neurovascular unit, as a physiological model to mimic the microenvironment of cerebral
malaria. The transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells in the neurovascular unit model of cerebral malaria will
allow the identification of candidate genes and pathways involved in brain endothelial barrier disruption.
We have also observed that P. falciparum iRBC modulate the cholesterol synthesis pathway in HBMEC and that
inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl transferase in this pathway prevents endothelial barrier disruption by P.
falciparum-iRBC in vitro and reduces neurological signs and mortality induced by cerebral malaria in mice. We
will validate these results in the neurovascular unit model and define the role of farnesyl transferase mediated
brain endothelial barrier disruption by downregulating expression of farnesyl transferase in vitro and by studying
the development of cerebral malaria in mice conditionally deficient for this enzyme in endothelial cells. To
investigate the mechanism underlying barrier disruption by farnesyl transferase we will perform an unbiassed
farnesylation screen to identify candidate substrates of this enzyme that will be functionally validated. In parallel,
the role of RhoGTPases, which are typically involved in endothelial barrier integrity, will be defined in the context
of cerebral malaria in vitro and in mice.
Since no specific therapies are available for cerebral malaria, understanding the molecular mechanisms
mediating the loss of brain endothelial barrier integrity in response to P. falciparum is essential for the
development of much needed adjunctive treatments for this syndrome."

Viral respiratory infections are responsible for major morbidity and mortality in early life. Infants account for a
significant proportion of influenza hospitalizations and are considered a top high-risk group. In addition to the
acute morbidity, initial immune responses to influenza shape/imprint the immune system and affect subsequent
responses to influenza infections and vaccinations, which tend to induce humoral responses skewed towards
epitopes present in the first influenza antigen encountered. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants is
generally mild and less severe than in older individuals. This is remarkable and suggests that there are unique
features on how the infant immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2, compared to its responses against other
respiratory viruses, that can be leveraged to improve our understanding of early life immunity.
On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that early life viral respiratory infections elicit virus-specific
immune responses that lead to distinct immune developmental trajectories. To address this hypothesis, we
will compare three longitudinal cohorts: i) infants infected with SARS-CoV-2; ii) infants infected with influenza
virus; and as reference iii) healthy infants with none of those two infections. After the acute infections, children
will be followed longitudinally for three years and immune responses assessed in the context of influenza and
COVID-19 vaccinations.
We designed the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the differences of blood transcriptional immune
signatures in infants with SARS-CoV-2 versus infants with influenza infection. We will assess the differences in
immune signatures between: i) the two acute viral infections SARS-CoV-2 versus influenza in infants; ii) primary
acute infection versus primary vaccination, and iii) between initial (primary responses) and subsequent
vaccinations (recall responses). Will correlate immune signatures with antibody profiles and B cell responses.
Aim 2. Define the magnitude, immunodominance pattern and breath of the antibody responses to influenza virus
and evolution of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. First, we will define the evolution of the antibody responses
to influenza virus in infants upon initial infection and subsequent vaccination(s). Second, we will define the
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infants upon initial infection and subsequent vaccination(s). Additionally,
we will compare primary immune responses to infection versus vaccination with each of the two viruses. Aim
3. High-throughput longitudinal evaluation of B cell responses to influenza and SARS-CoV-2. We will perform
high-throughput single cell assays using the 10xGenomics drop-seq platform to perform multi-variate analyses

Infants and young children are at higher risk for severe manifestations of certain respiratory viruses, such as
influenza and RSV, compared to older children or adults. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown the
opposite trend, with infants being at lower risk of serious outcomes. The molecular and cellular mechanisms
underpinning vulnerability to some infections and protection from others are poorly understood, but intrinsic
properties of the post-natal immune system might be at their core. Systems biology tools can resolve these
knowledge gaps through detailed analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome and function of immune cell
populations across the life span. This project capitalizes on our experience in studying the human immune
system through childhood in health and disease, and the availability of immune monitoring assays for use with
small-volume samples. Recently, we have leveraged innovative technologies, i.e., ATAC-seq for assessing
chromatin accessibility, RNA-seq, high-definition cellular immunophenotyping at the bulk and single cell levels
as well as custom-built integrative analysis pipelines. Our preliminary data confirm that we can maximally
leverage infant samples to capture transcriptional and regulatory genome-wide signatures associated with the
developing immune system in response to viral infections and vaccination with unprecedented granularity.
We propose to assess the immune responses to infection with two viruses, influenza and SARS-CoV-2,
occurring in the first six months of life by leveraging our immune profiling platform. We will track age-related
changes in immune cell composition, transcriptome and epigenome during this first encounter with the virus
and will subsequently monitor these parameters upon vaccination against these viruses yearly for a period of
three years. Aim 1 will define the phenotype/cell composition, transcriptome and epigenome of infant PBMCs
upon their first encounter with either Influenza or SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Aim 2 will Characterize the PBMC
phenotype/cell composition, transcriptome and epigenome in response to vaccination against influenza and
SARS-CoV-2."

The metabolic state of hematopoietic stem cells is an important contributor to self-renewal, however the
metabolic changes controlling the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells to erythrocytes is poorly
understood. Here, I show preliminary data that that the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) impacts early
erythropoiesis. The MAS is a well-studied mechanism in cells that transfers electrons in the form of NADH from
the cytosol into the mitochondria, Specifically, disruption of the shuttle in vivo through conditional deletion of
one its enzyme in an erythroid progenitor leads to significant anemia. Accordingly, I hypothesize that the MAS
is required for redox homeostasis during early erythroid development and that failure of the MAS paves way for
ineffective erythropoiesis. AIM I works to determine which erythroid differentiation stages requires the MAS.
AIM II defines the molecular mechanism by which the MAS impacts erythropoiesis. For these, I am using both
in vivo mouse models and in vitro CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Together, these aims
investigate whether reductive stress through the MAS during early erythropoiesis is an important contributor to
ineffective erythropoiesis."

Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in
cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic
strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed
research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to
identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma,
bladder, kidney, and lung cancer.
Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision
immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His
previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the
proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer
immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain
research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading
experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has
developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal.
Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC);
computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy
patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations.
Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to
arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor
to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep
learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the
immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3
prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models.
Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine
cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy.
The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research
at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI."

Acute β-adrenergic activation of protein kinase A (PKA) during the “fight or flight” response increases Ca2+
influx through CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels in cardiomyocytes to augment contractility. Yet in heart failure, triggering
the same signaling systems to compensate for decreased cardiac output—but chronically rather than acutely—
is cardiotoxic, exacerbating the failing heart and promoting life-threatening arrhythmias. By elucidating the
mechanisms by which β-adrenergic signaling modulates heart function we seek to ultimately develop targeted
and specific therapies for arrhythmias, heart failure, and other cardiovascular disorders. In studies completed
in years 1-4 of this application, we identified the mechanism of adrenergic regulation of cardiac Ca2+ channels.
We showed that the small RGK G-protein, Rad, a known inhibitor of high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels is
the key PKA target in the CaV1.2 complex. Rad simultaneously interacts with the inner leaflet of the
sarcolemma and CaVβ, thus holding CaV1.2 in a low open probability gating mode. PKA phosphorylation of two
Rad C-terminal Ser residues releases Rad from the membrane, reduces affinity for CaVβ, and relieves CaV1.2
inhibition. Using phosphosite knock-in mice with Ala-substitutions of the four PKA-phosphorylated residues in
Rad (4SA-Rad mice), we showed that phosphorylation of Rad is essential for β-adrenergic augmentation of
Ca2+ influx. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating Ca2+ handling, preventing adrenergic
activation of Ca2+ channels in 4SA-Rad mice has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with
increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of β-adrenergic contractile response,
and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression in mice of mutant Ca2+ channel β-subunits that
cannot bind Rad (2DA-β2B knock-in mice, 3DA-β2B transgenic mice) is sufficient to enhance basal Ca2+ influx
and contractility to the augmented levels seen in WT mice with adrenergic activation. With these new
fundamental insights, we reason that we can utilize Rad-mediated modulation of Ca2+ influx as innovative
therapies for heart failure and arrhythmias, and for age-related loss of adrenergic reserve, while avoiding the
side-effects inherent to other CaV1.2 agonist/antagonist strategies. We propose three Specific Aims to
elucidate the effects of attenuating or enhancing Ca2+ influx in the heart via Rad-dependent mechanisms:
Aim 1: To determine whether blocking the augmentation of Ca2+ influx by catecholamines attenuates
arrhythmogenesis. Aim 2: To determine whether preventing the catecholamine augmentation of Ca2+ influx
attenuates stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Aim 3: To determine how aging alters adrenergic regulation of Ca2+
handling and cardiac contractility. Feasibility is supported by all mice lines being readily available and expertise
in all methods being established by the long-standing collaborations of the investigative team. The three Aims
will provide key mechanistic insight of causes underlying arrhythmogenesis and cardiomyopathy, which will
pave the way towards novel therapies."
10826697,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Many patients with advanced-stage cancer will develop metastatic disease in the brain. Most patients
who develop brain metastasis (BM) will succumb to the disease. Despite such poor outcomes, BM-specific
therapies are currently lacking. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that BM may respond to immune
checkpoint inhibitors. However, responses in BM tend to be less durable than those seen in extracranial
metastases, warranting further investigation into how immunotherapies can be better leveraged against BM.
Recent findings from our group have suggested that amyloid beta (Aβ), a protein well-established for its role in
Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, facilitates immunosuppression within the BM microenvironment and inhibits
cancer cell phagocytosis by macrophages, permitting for tumor outgrowth. Likewise, one study in glioblastoma
found that the use of BACE inhibitors (BACEi), which stall the β-secretase enzymes involved in Aβ production,
decreases tumor burden by increasing cancer cell phagocytosis and inflammatory signaling by macrophages.
We hypothesize that Aβ drives immunosuppression in BM in a macrophage-dependent manner, and that
targeting Aβ will lead to the reprogramming of macrophages, promoting anti-tumor immunity in the BM
microenvironment. In Aim 1, we will perform a novel characterization of Aβ in the BM microenvironment using
immunocompetent mouse models. Following this characterization, we will determine if treatment with BACEi,
alone or in combination with anti-PD1, inhibits the outgrowth or even induces the regression of BM. Aim 2 will
unpack the mechanisms by which Aβ interacts with macrophages to inhibit cancer cell phagocytosis and facilitate
their immunosuppressive characteristics. We will also study how this Aβ-macrophage interaction influences
downstream T cell phenotypes. Collectively, this work will establish Aβ as a potential therapeutic target in BM
and uncover novel myeloid-based molecular candidates for next-generation immunotherapies.
 The training plan for this fellowship will span 2.5 years, during which 1.5 years will be dedicated to
research and 1 year will be dedicated to clinical training. The research detailed above will allow me to establish
mastery in the fields of cancer biology and immunology, positioning me well to achieve my goals of becoming a
professor and establishing my own tumor immunology laboratory. In addition to investigating the immunologic
functions of Aβ in BM, I will attend and present at a multitude of internal seminars and international meetings.
To develop my mentorship skills, I will engage in several opportunities to mentor high school and undergraduate
students. Additionally, I will continue my involvement with NYU’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute to
foster my development as a translational scientist. Lastly, I will support my clinical training by attending Oncology
Tumor Boards and Hematology/Oncology grand rounds, shadowing a heavily research-focused oncologist, and
completing my medical school core clerkship curriculum."

The overarching goal for this project is to understand the events governing the earliest stages of mammalian
embryo development. Specifically, we will investigate how the pluripotent epiblast which generates the embryo-
proper, and its sister lineage the extra-embryonic (or primitive) endoderm, arise from a common progenitor
population, the inner cell mass. Furthermore, we will determine how the cells of these two nascent lineages
differentiate and organize themselves, as they sort into two adjacent tissue layers.
We will use the mouse as an experimentally tractable animal model system to investigate a universal and critical
stage of mammalian development. We will take an integrative approach across scales (from gleaning molecular
details to tissue-level organization) by applying cutting-edge methods, including in toto light microscopic imaging,
the analysis of gene expression and protein localization at the level of single cells across a population of cells,
as well as performing perturbations, pharmacologic and optogenetic manipulations, within the spatiotemporal
context of developing embryos. Our experiments will be coupled to computational analyses of data, and
mathematical modeling. These contextual time and space resolved studies will shed insight into how a population
of progenitors gives rise to two lineages each possessing a distinct identity and stereotypical tissue organization,
and the mechanisms that ensure the robustness reproducibility and scalability of this process.
An in-depth mechanistic understanding of critical events taking place in vivo in the mouse model provides the
foundational knowledge for: extending our understanding to other mammalian species, the stem cell populations
than can be derived from early mammalian embryos which are increasingly being used to generate embryoid
(also referred to as synthetic embryo) models, and the differentiation of cells with distinct identities having
therapeutic potential. Moreover, using a simple and robust in vivo paradigm of self-organization for decoding the
dynamics of cell-cell communication and growth factor signaling will provide insights into how developmental
mechanisms are hijacked during disease progression, and can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
10826599,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Impulsivity is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders1 and food-directed impulsivity is
associated with both obesity and binge-eating disorder2–4. Impulsive behaviors can be roughly divided into two
distinct subtypes: behaviors resulting from a failure to suppress an inappropriate action (impulsive action) and
behaviors wherein a choice between two or more responses is made without proper consideration of the
consequences (impulsive choice). While the neural processes regulating impulsive responding are poorly
understood, evidence exists that impulsive actions and impulsive choices may be modulated by both
overlapping and distinct neural substrates5. The hippocampus (HPC), a brain region crucial for mnemonic
function, has recently been identified as a critical region mediating the higher-order control of appetite and
food intake6,7 . Our recent findings have further shown that the ventral subregion of the HPC (vHPC) plays a
critical role in mediating impulsivity directed towards palatable food8,9. However, the neural processes and
circuitry through which the vHPC modulates impulsive responding for palatable foods remain unknown.
 In addition to the vHPC, The nucleus accumbens (ACB) is also known to regulate impulsivity10–13, and
ACB-projecting hippocampal neurons have been shown to enhance food palatability14. Deep brain stimulation
(DBS) of the ACB shell subregion (ACBsh) increases impulsive responding in rats15, and a pilot study of
responsive DBS in the ACB for patients with BED improved lose-of-control eating frequency and was
associated with weight-loss16. Previous research on HPC-to-ACB circuitry has focused its role in
neuropsychiatric disorders17 and on non-food related reward processing, such as drugs of abuse18,19. Despite
both the HPC and ACB being implicated in food-motivated behavior and impulsivity, it is unknown whether
HPC-to-ACB communication modulates behavioral inhibition for food-motivated responding.
 We hypothesize that the vHPC regulates impulsivity for palatable foods via downstream connections to
ACBsh. Preliminary data presented herein reveal increased calcium-dependent activity in both the vHPC and
ACBsh in rats immediately prior to a non-impulsive relative to an impulsive lever press. Aim 1 experiments
build off these findings by using pathway-specific in vivo fiber photometry to record calcium-dependent
activity in the ACBsh-projecting vHPC neurons during impulsive responding. Our preliminary findings further
show that chemogenetic vHPC-to-ACBsh inhibition increases impulsive action for palatable foods in males.
Aim 2 will build on these findings by exploring the effects of pathway-specific inhibition on impulsive action in
females, as well as impulsive choice in both males and females. Finally, Aim 3 uses multi-synaptic neural
pathway tracing and in situ hybridization to identify the neurochemical phenotype and downstream targets of
the vHPC-to-ACBsh pathway. Overall, improved understanding of the neurobiology underlying food-directed
impulsivity can shed greater light on the role of food motivation and behavioral inhibition in obesity."

 The brain is an immune-privileged organ; thus, the composition and the nature of the immune response
is fundamentally different in the brain than in the periphery, where avoiding immunopathology is prioritized. Prior
studies found that human and rodent T cells isolated from brain or CSF have unique transcriptional profiles and
increased functional capability to produce cytokines such as IFN-g29. This was also confirmed in my preliminary
studies, as I found that steady-state mouse brain is enriched with CD4 T cells that highly express multiple co-
inhibitory receptors (PD-1+ LAG3+ TIGIT+) and secrete cytokines robustly upon activation (IFN-g, IL-17A).
Interestingly, this steady-state brain T cell population can be modulated by altering in the microbiota composition.
Our preliminary results reveal that gnotobiotic mice have ~2-fold fewer brain-resident T cells and significantly
fewer IFN-g and IL-17A secreting cells, and mono-colonizing gnotobiotic mice with a single species of bacteria
can partially restore this brain T cell population. The microbiome and the gut-brain axis has been demonstrated
to mediate the symptoms and progression of a wide variety of neurological disease2-7. While the role of the gut-
microbiota-T-cell-brain axis in the context of specific neurological diseases has been studied, its role at steady-
state and the mechanism of gut-educated-T cell trafficking in the steady-state brain is not known. It is essential
to understand the steady-state gut-brain T cell axis in order to fully understand the molecular mechanisms behind
neurological disease and develop better targeted therapeutics. Interestingly in our preliminary studies, we found
that the expansion of the brain-resident T cell population correlates with the massive microbiota changes
accompanying the developmentally programmed weaning reaction30 and this phenotype is absent in gnotobiotic
mice. This weaning period also happens concurrently with large neurodevelopmental changes, including peak
myelination of axons, changes in neurotransmitter and receptors, specialization of the prefrontal cortex neural
network, and thickening of cortical grey matter31. We thus hypothesize that the gut-microbiota introduced during
weaning centrally instruct microglia secrete CXCL10 to recruit CXCR3+ microbiota-educated CD4 T cells from
the periphery and establish residence in the brain to “match” brain development with the external environment.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 will focus on investigating how the gut commensal
microbiota composition affects brain-resident CD4 T cell plasticity in the steady-state brain. Aim 2 will focus on
studying neuroimmune interactions between CXCR3+ microbiota-educated CD4 T cells and microglia at steady-
state. Ultimately, results from this study will inform how the microbiota may play a role in optimizing the unique
steady-state T cell compartment to regulate homeostatic functions in the brain, using behavioral assays as a
readout. The applicant’s multidisciplinary mentoring team will prepare her for research independence and a
successful career as a principal investigator in neuroimmunology."

Widespread implementation, scale-up, and sustainability of culturally-appropriate, evidence-based programs is
critical to reducing the significant and disproportionate burden of cancer among Black women. Community-
engaged Lay Health Advisor (LHA) programs are highly successful in reducing health inequities for cancer.
One of the most robust evidence-based and nationally disseminated LHA cancer prevention/screening
programs is The National Witness Project (NWP). NWP is one of the few equity-focused LHA programs with
both longevity and evidence of impact in Black communities nationally. Despite its impact, NWP continues to
face challenges to sustainability and the long-term delivery of the program. Advancing the science of
sustainability is urgent, as inequities in cancer and challenges to the sustainability of evidence-based programs
were exacerbated during the COVID pandemic. Research is critically needed on sustainability, particularly
among low-resource settings and communities that face historical and ongoing structural and systemic barriers
to health, to make progress towards racial equity for cancer screening and outcomes. Our team is uniquely
poised to lead and advance research in this area. Building off of our work on sustainability and a long-term
partnership with NWP, we propose a national mixed-methods prospective study with the following aims. First,
in aim 1 we will refine, with a sub-sample of NWP sites nationally (n=6), a package of sustainability strategies
to support the ongoing delivery of NWP at scale, with the long-term goal of addressing cancer screening
inequities among Black women. We will focus on strategies for building capacity and partnerships to enhance
sustained impact and delivery of NWP and support retention of LHAs (e.g. novel curricula/training; tailored
technical assistance; Community of Practice model to share lessons across sites), with the goal of enhancing
capacity for: 1) building partnerships/identifying champions at academic/healthcare centers to leverage
organizational resources; 2) building business case for program’s value; 3) adapting to local community needs
and context. In Aim 2, we propose to deliver and examine the impact of this refined package of sustainability
strategies on multiple sustainability outcomes annually over four years across 16 NWP sites nationally using a
pre-post cluster prospective design. Finally, in aim 3, we plan to apply a concurrent mixed-methods approach
(n=200 surveys and 50-65 in-depth interviews) to examine the uptake, acceptability, appropriateness,
feasibility and impact of sustainability strategies among 16 NWP sites to explore the processes through which
strategies build capacity for and influence sustainability of equity-focused EBIs in community settings over the
4 years. This research is timely, providing a key opportunity to advance scientific understanding of strategies to
promote sustainability among a generalizable, nationally disseminated program. Findings lay the groundwork
for enhancing sustainability of trusted community-led programs and making progress towards racial equity in
cancer and cancer screening."
10928161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress-related systems undergo a change during the transition to ethanol dependence, such that activation,
which in a non-dependent state may leave unaffected or suppress intake, instead increases consumption. This
effect reversal often coincides with an upregulation in receptor gene expression for stress-related neuropeptides;
however, for the stress-related neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), the
changes instead appear to occur via a specific increase in receptor variant expression. Our study focuses
attention on the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), which has notably and selectively dense
expression of the less ubiquitous PACAP peptide isoform, PACAP-27, where it is expressed in a subpopulation
of glutamatergic neurons. In preliminary studies, we have found with a 20% ethanol intermittent access (IA)
model of binge drinking, that effects of PACAP+ cell manipulation in the PVT can change based on drinking
history. In PACAP-Cre mice drinking under the IA model for 6 weeks, Cre-dependent chemogenetic inhibition of
PACAP+ cells stimulated ethanol drinking in low drinkers but instead inhibited intake in high drinkers. With
preliminary evidence that these PACAP-27+ PVT neurons send dense projections to the nucleus accumbens
(NAc), we have also found in rats, which drink lower levels of ethanol than mice, that those drinking under the
IA model for 6 weeks respond to PACAP-27 injection into the NAc with a suppression of ethanol intake. Further,
rats with a longer IA drinking history (10 weeks) show a specific increase in gene expression in the NAc of the
HOP variant of the PACAP receptor (PAC1). We have confirmed with quantitative real-time (qRT-)PCR that the
HOP and SHORT variants are present in the NAc of mice. Building on our preliminary and published data, we
hypothesize that activation of PACAP-27+ cells that send afferents from the PVT to the NAc suppresses non-
dependent, binge-like ethanol intake, but increases intake in a dependent state (Aim 1); and this shift in
behavioral output occurs as the PACAP system becomes dysregulated resulting in a specific increase in PAC1
HOP receptor variant expression (Aim 2). To test this, Aim 1 investigates the effect of activation and inhibition
of the PVT→NAc PACAP pathway on ethanol intake before and after dependence, by using PACAP-Cre mice
and Cre-dependent excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs injected into the PVT paired with cannula guided
microinjections of CNO into the NAc shell. To determine the involvement of PAC1 receptor variants in the NAc
on ethanol intake, Aim 2 will measure PAC1 variant mRNA expression in the NAc of non-dependent and ethanol
dependent mice and also use specific interfering (si)RNA to knock down the PAC1 receptor variants in the NAc
of non-dependent and dependent mice. Together, these Aims will determine how the PACAP+ PVT→NAc
pathway affects ethanol drinking across states and how PAC1 variant populations in the NAc are changed with
the transition to dependence and, in turn, affect ethanol intake."

 The blood vascular circulatory system is composed of arterial, venous, and capillary vessels, which work
together to facilitate the efficient exchange of gasses, nutrients, and waste from all tissues, while regulating blood
pressure and distribution of immune cells. The endothelial cells that line these vessels must acquire specialized
characteristics to enable specialized arterial, venous and capillary functions, a process known as endothelial cell
specification. Disruption of this process during development can lead to embryonic lethality, while postnatally it
causes arterial-venous malformations and contributes to pathological conditions, including dysfunctional tumor
vasculature. Understanding the mechanisms that control arterial-venous endothelial cell specification and
network formation is essential for advancing our ability to improve therapies for vascular pathologies,
revascularize injured tissues, and optimize the differentiation of pluripotent human stem cells for vascular tissue
engineering and regenerative medicine therapies.
 Our previous studies, in the postnatal murine retinal vascularization model of sprouting angiogenesis,
revealed a critical role for blood flow-regulated endothelial cell cycle state in their fate specification. We found
that arterial/arteriolar shear stress levels promote Notch signaling, and downstream p27-induced late G1 state,
which enables TGF-β1-induced arterial gene expression (Fang 2017; Chavkin 2022). Conversely, flow
magnitudes typical of veins/venules induce early G1, which enables BMP4-induced upregulation of venous
genes (Chavkin 2022). However, blood flow is not required for the initiation of arterial-venous specification during
embryonic vascular development (Chong 2011), and whether endothelial cell cycle control is required for this
process is unknown. I hypothesize that endothelial cell cycle control is required for embryonic arterial and
venous specification and its dysregulation causes arterial-venous malformations. In support of this, my
preliminary data show that, during embryonic vascular development, even before flow, arterial endothelial cells
are enriched in late G1, while venous endothelial cells are enriched in early G1. Additionally, we identified target
genes that may regulate endothelial cell cycle state and/or specification. Using the Fucci2 cell cycle reporter
mice, we will rigorously define the cell cycle state of arterial and venous endothelial cells in the developing
embryo and determine the role of endothelial cell cycle control in fate specification. We will also identify novel
key regulators of endothelial cell cycle state and arterial-venous fate that can provide new targets for the
treatment of diseases associated with endothelial cell hyperproliferation and loss of identity, including vascular
malformations and tumor angiogenesis."

In humans, postpartum stress exposure is associated with increased risk for mood disorders and compromised
quality of mother-infant interactions (i.e. maternal care). For example, mothers that undergo postpartum adversity
may lose interest in their babies and have difficult caring for their infant’s needs. However, the neural
mechanisms by which adverse maternal environments contribute to aberrant maternal behavior remain poorly
understood. One potential pathway is the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, which originates in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and is critically involved in reward-related processes, including maternal behavior, and the
pathophysiology of depression. Importantly, DA dysregulation has been observed in women with PPD and
studies in rodent models relevant for the study of depression have shown a causal link between DA system
dysregulation (i.e. decreased VTA DA neuron activity) and negative affect-related behaviors (i.e. anhedonia,
passive coping). Thus, compromised activity of VTA DA neurons induced by postpartum adversity may interfere
with reward-related processes necessary for maternal motivation and responsiveness. Yet, little is known about
the regulation of DA system function in postpartum rodents at baseline and under conditions of adversity. The
overall goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of an adverse postpartum environment, as modeled by
providing the dam with limited bedding and nesting (LBN) materials from postpartum days 2-9, on maternal
behaviors and mesolimbic DA function while testing a mechanistic role for the stress hormone corticosterone
(CORT) (Aim 1). This work will lay the necessary groundwork for future experiments aimed at conducting cell-
type specific in vivo optical recordings of genetically identified VTA DA neurons during the expression of maternal
behavior in adaptive (control) and maladaptive states (LBN) over time, while also enabling assessment of time-
locked behavior/DA responses (Aim 2), and causally manipulating potential neural circuits driving LBN-induced
alterations in VTA DA function (Aim 3). Importantly, these aims are based on my preliminary data showing
disrupted mother-infant interactions and attenuated VTA DA activity in LBN dams. During the award period, I will
use an integrated systems-oriented approach including behavioral assays, hormonal measurements, in vivo
electrophysiology and fiber photometry, and chemogenetic approaches that enable causal manipulations of
specific cells and circuits involved in the regulation of VTA DA activity. This proposal addresses an important
gap in knowledge, is consistent with the NIMH’s mission to increase research in females to improve women’s
mental health, while enabling me to acquire new conceptual, technical, experimental and analytical skills
(through the help of my Advisory Team/Co-Mentors) that will help me launch an independent research career."

The Keystone Symposium on Precision Genome Engineering has become one of the leading conferences in
the genome editing field. This regularly occurring conference is established as a premiere forum for featuring
gene engineering technology development and the preclinical application of these tools. As a result, the
conference has a primary aim of bringing together a diverse group of scientists with expertise that will facilitate
the application of genome editing approaches in human patients. Because delivery of gene-targeting reagents
presents a salient challenge for implementation of genome editing in the treatment of human disease, this

pairing is ideal as it will stimulate discussion and collaborative innovation between two fields which have
traditionally been distinct but are becoming increasingly connected as gene editing moves into the clinic.
Through these joint conferences, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current state of research in
these related fields, have the opportunity to strategize about the major challenges in the area and forge cross-

 The stereochemistry of a pharmaceutical drug is of paramount importance as alternative stereoisomers
can lead to vastly completely different outcomes in its efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and side-effects.
Therefore, site-selective control to access the desired stereochemistry of a molecule (stereochemical editing),
especially at a late-stage, has a direct impact on drug discovery and is at the forefront of innovation in synthetic
organic chemistry. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a mild and efficient stereochemical
editing strategy for quaternary stereocenters guided by enantioselective recombination of C–C bonds.
Traditionally, stereochemical editing relies on the homolytic cleavage of a C–H bond via photoredox catalysis in
the presence of a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond abstractor. Nevertheless, this system is simply
unapplicable to quaternary stereocenters because they lack the required hydrogen bond. To overcome this
challenge, the proposed research engages an innovative application of photoredox catalysis and asymmetric
recombination of a C–C bond. The first approach will establish a dual asymmetric photoredox/nickel catalysis
strategy. This system will be applied to effect a mesolytic cleavage of a target C–C bond, followed by asymmetric
induction of a chiral nickel catalyst to promote an recombination of the C–C bond via intramolecular sp3–sp3
cross-coupling. If successful, this dual catalytic system will provide a fully stereocontrolled means to access to
the quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions. The second approach will deploy a chiral counteranion of
the photocatalyst to induce asymmetric ion-pairing with carbocationic intermediates. This method will utilize
exceptionally simple, yet underexplored conditions to recombine C–C bonds to manipulate the quaternary
stereocenters orthogonally to the previous approach. These studies are expected to enable a novel mode of
action toward stereochemical editing of quaternary stereocenters and have applications, such as epimerization,
racemization, and deracemization, in the discovery of pharmaceuticals, natural product synthesis, as well as
derivatization of the existing drugs.
 The proposed research aligns well with my future development plan to broaden my expertise in modern
methodology by ensuring exposure to the development of new techniques in photoredox and transition metal
catalysis with mechanistic and kinetic studies. The Wendlandt lab’s extensive experience and expertise in
photoredox catalysis, coupled with the state-of-the-art resources and facilities at MIT, provides the optimal
environment to pursue and successfully execute the proposed research."

United States currently identify as transgender, and demand for GAS has increased over the past two decades.
As more of these procedures are performed, a handful of reports have recently started trickling in claiming that
there are worse healing outcomes among transgender male patients, but the breakdown of transgender males
who were on T versus not on T at the time of surgery was not elucidated by these reports.
 Co-Sponsor Dr. Devin O’Brien-Coon is a plastic surgeon who performs GAS and observed this same
phenomenon and hypothesized that presence of T perioperatively may be playing a role in mediating wound
healing in this patient population. To validate these observations, the Coon lab conducted an assessment on
148 transgender male patients (XX-chromosome individuals, some on T and some not on T) showing statistically
significant differences in grading of wounds and scars between both groups. Meanwhile, no disparity is observed
between transgender females (who take estrogen and suppress T) and cisgender females.
 We hypothesize that T may modulate wound healing in a more complex manner than the scientific
community had understood up until this point by shifting cell phenotypes and operating under novel pathways,
with sex chromosome- and sex hormone receptor-dependent effects, and by preferentially affecting immune
cells. We will test these hypotheses using various assays including planimetry, histology, immunofluorescence,
flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing, transgenic mouse models, and chemical and genetic depletion. By
performing these experiments, we will obtain wound healing metrics such as comparing collagen deposition,
granulation tissue, wound area remaining, localization of cell phenotype markers, identifying causal pathways,
gene expression, involvement of the Y chromosome and Sry testes-determining gene, and immune cell
quantification and visualization.
 Successful completion of these aims will give us a new understanding of the biological mechanisms
responsible for this observed impaired wound healing in transgender men, who undergo lifelong T therapy, and
has the potential to significantly rewrite perioperative guidelines for gender affirming surgery. By filling this
knowledge gap, this research may ultimately offer improved wound healing and personalized medicine therapies
to not only transgender patients but all patients."

Reversible chemical modifications of mRNAs have recently been recognized as a major regulatory
mechanism of gene expression. Among >100 various RAN chemical modifications identified so far, N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most abundant one with ~3-5 m6A sites per mRNA in eukaryotic
transcriptomes. Our recent work (PNAS, 2017, 115:E325) has demonstrated that ALKBH5 acts as a
m6A eraser, and m6A serves as a signal for alternative splicing in the nucleus of spermatocytes and
round spermatids, and for degradation in the cytoplasm of elongating and elongated spermatids. The
scientific premise that proper epitranscriptomic regulation (e.g., m6A) is essential for successful
spermatogenesis and male fertility prompted us to embark on investigations aiming to understand
how m6A levels are controlled in developing male germ cells and what role this specific chemical
modification of mRNA plays in the regulation of spermatogenesis. Based upon our published and
preliminary data, we hypothesize that ALKBH4, a homolog of ALKBH5, regulates mRNA m6A levels in
spermatogenic cells either as a novel eraser or a co-factor of ALKBH5. To test this hypothesis, we will
first determine whether ALKBH4 functions as a novel RNA m6A demethylase or as a co-factor for
ALKBH5 using biochemical analyses in vitro (Aim1). The in vitro findings will then be validated using
knockout mouse models in vivo and the physiological role of ALKBH4 in the regulation of
spermatogenesis will also be determined (Aim2). The proposed project will help us gain insights into the
epitranscriptomic regulation of spermatogenesis and the knowledge gained would help us discover the
underlying causes of poor sperm quality and male infertility."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cardiometabolic Diseases: The Role of Ethnic
Diversity in Precision Medicine, organized by Drs. Paul Franks, Ewan Pearson and Karin Conde-Knape. The
conference will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from February 4–7, 2024.
Cardiometabolic disease constitutes a major threat to global health, with the greatest affliction occurring outside
the western world. Precision medicine has enormous potential to reduce this burden yet the data that will seed
precision medicine algorithms and products often stems from people of European ancestry living in high-income
societies. Addressing this bias is important because a failure to do so may drive significant health inequities,
rather than diminish them, as precision medicine has the potential to do. Best viewed as an evolution rather than
a revolution, precision medicine will not replace, but may substantially enhance, contemporary medicine. Its key
pillars are diagnostics, prediction and prevention of the primary disease, prognosis of secondary disease,
treatment, and monitoring of risk exposure, treatment response and disease progression. For precision medicine
to fulfil its potential, a well-functioning ecosystem will be necessary, comprised of multiple stakeholders,
furnished with powerful computing infrastructures, and fueled by multidimensional data generated in people of
diverse ethnicities living in varied environments. This conference will be paired with another Keystone Symposia
conference entitled Obesity: Causes and Consequences. The joint conferences will share a keynote and joint
sessions. Participants of both conferences will also have an opportunity to network at shared mealtimes and
poster sessions. It is anticipated that this will lead to new scientific collaborations and the implementation of new
precision medicine approaches directed at better understanding and treating cardiometabolic disease."
10829853,"Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor
(TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long-
term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able
diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se-
quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires
are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems-
level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that
can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced
two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity
(top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral
infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We
will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de-
velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will
use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da-
tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing
computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under-
lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr.
AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the
field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling
(MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties
(e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine
what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii)
Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in
whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i)
developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic
patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno-
logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data
medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new
tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in-
cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine."
10829858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vascular barrier dysfunction causes aberrant transport of blood components into the vessel wall or surrounding
tissues, a hallmark of inflammatory injury in response to trauma, sepsis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and stroke.
Currently, there are no effective therapies that directly target the leaky barrier, as drug development has been
hampered by knowledge gaps and difficulties in translating cell/animal data to human pathophysiology. Our
program addresses these challenges via comparative analyses of endothelial barrier structure and function in
human and animal models of inflammatory injury. We conduct three series of studies in the blood, blood-vessel
interface and endothelial barrier structure, aimed at 1) identifying key circulating factors that cause barrier
leakage and their cell-specific mechanisms of production and action; 2) characterizing endothelial surface
receptors and intracellular signals that transduce their effects; and 3) elucidating molecular events in cell-cell
junctions, cytoskeleton, and glycocalyx that ultimately lead to barrier opening. Our work has continuously been
supported by the NHLBI contributing to the development of novel techniques and transformative theories in
vascular permeability. We were among the first to characterize the nmMLCK signaling in endothelial junction
dynamics and paracellular permeability during leukocyte activation. Recently, we reported the discovery of a
new post-translational modification pathway, dhhc21-mediated protein palmitoylation, in microvascular leakage
and leukocyte-endothelium interactions following infection and sterile injury. Built on these exciting findings, our
program continues to advance by exploring novel diagnostic/therapeutic targets with mechanistic insights that
will transform the paradigm of inflammation. Current efforts are directed to the characterization of neutrophil
extracellular traps, histones and microvesicles, focusing on their cell-specific mechanisms of generation and
function in the microcirculation. Studies are on-going to test the roles of palmitoylation in vesicle biogenesis,
cargo composition and interaction with endothelial cells. The barrier-disrupting effects of these factors will be
uncovered with in-depth molecular details on endothelial glycocalyx receptors, intracellular signal transduction,
and post-translational modification (palmitoylation) of junction structures. We use a multifaceted approach that
incorporates innovative molecular biology and imaging techniques (many developed in our lab) into functional
analyses of vascular permeability under clinically relevant conditions. Complementary in vitro, ex vivo, and in
vivo experiments are designed testing pharmacological activators and inhibitors, molecular manipulations, and
genetic/chimeric alterations at cell-tissue-body levels. A unique aspect of our program lies in the translational
impact achieved through the studies with intact functionally viable human organs."
10829861,"Project Summary
Sex and gender are potent influencers of the etiology, presentation, and prognosis of essentially every
neuropsychiatric disorder. However, we have a fundamental gap in knowledge in understanding how sex
interacts with other contributors to neuropsychiatric risk, such as genetic variants. These genetic variants may
not have the same biobehavioral impacts across male and female brains. One such genetic factor, copy
number variation at the 16p11.2 locus, is strongly associated with a broad spectrum of male-biased
neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including autism and psychosis at the level of genome-wide significance. Male
mice with a hemideletion at the syntenic 16p11.2 locus display profound alterations in reward-guided decision
making and striatal biology, but these are substantially mitigated in female mice carrying the same
hemideletion. This animal model is thus ideally positioned to reveal how sex interacts with genetic factors that
alter neurodevelopment to produce male vulnerability. Strong evidence implicates striatal circuits in reward-
guided choice behavior. We will pursue three Aims assessing whether altered functional activation of striatal
circuits in male 16p11.2 hemideletion animals, in comparison with wildtype males and 16p11.2 hemideletion
females, provides explanatory power for behavioral alterations in these males. In each case, we will test
whether sex differences in striatal circuit function interact with or mitigate the impact of 16p11.2 hemideletion
on these circuits. In Aim 1, we will measure dopamine inputs into the dorsomedial striatum and nucleus
accumbens core during decision making to determine if these signals are leading to striatal dysfunction in
males, and if dopamine release in females is normalized. In Aim 2, we will measure medium spiny neuron
outputs from the dorsomedial striatum and nucleus accumbens during the same decision epochs to determine
what aspects of choice and reward are being signaled in 16p11.2 hemideletion males versus females. Finally
in Aim 3, we will expand our scope to measure functional connectivity to the striatum across the brain using
resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, asking in particular if cortical inputs to specific striatal
compartments are impacted by 16p11.2 hemideletion in a sex-dependent manner."

With the great success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), older adults (>50 years of age) now
account for 30–50% of HIV-1 seropositive individuals in high-resource countries; a prevalence that is expected
to reach approximately 73% by 2030. Critically, older HIV-1 seropositive individuals exhibit a higher frequency
of neurocognitive impairments (NCI) relative to their younger counterparts. Neurological complications of HIV
infection are the biggest challenge facing HIV researchers, but currently, there are no efficacious treatments for
HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). An innovative regenerative “dendritic spine-targeted”
therapeutic approach is proposed to address the neuropathologic hallmark of HAND: synaptodendritic
neuronal injury. The hypothesis is that a regenerative “dendritic spine-targeted” approach will alter the longi-
tudinal trajectory of HAND (i.e., delay progression of NCI) by restoring synaptodendritic integrity via the
NogoA-NgR3/PirB-RhoA signaling pathway. The specific aims are: 1) To establish efficacious “dendritic
spine-targeted” therapeutics to address HIV-1-induced synaptodendritic loss and spine dysmorphol-
ogy. Factorial design experiments will establish neurorestoration at the synaptic level following treatment with
the promising isoflavandiol estrogen S-Equol (SE) as well as a specific estrogen β-receptor agonist (SERBA,
i.e., AC-186) in sex-specified brain cell cultures. Given the well-established role of the NogoA-NgR3/PirB-RhoA
signaling pathway in synaptic function and dendritic spine growth/retraction, we will employ pharmacological
and molecular approaches to investigate whether this pathway mechanistically underlies neurorestoration. 2)
To establish the in vivo efficacy of SERBAs to alter the longitudinal trajectory of HAND in the HIV-1 Tg
rat. We will promote restoration of neurocognitive function with SERBA therapy (initially SE, a metabolite
produced via the gut microbiome following ingestion of soy isoflavone daidzein). Having utilized cross-sectional
studies to optimize the treatment conditions of SE to mitigate NCI, we are poised to establish the in vivo
efficacy of SE to alter the progression to NCI using a longitudinal design; the factor of biological sex is integral
to the experimental design. 3) To establish in vivo the neural mechanism by which SERBAs exert their
therapeutic effects. Using a time-sequential longitudinal experimental design, we will examine the regenera-
tion of synaptodendritic integrity in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medium
spiny neurons (MSN) of the nucleus accumbens following SERBA therapy. Using in vivo pharmacological and
molecular approaches, the NogoA-NgR3/PirB-RhoA signaling pathway will be examined to establish the
underlying neural mechanism. With recently established models, methodological advances, proof-of-concept
publications, and new preliminary data, we are in a unique position to critically test: 1) the efficacy of SERBAs
to alter the longitudinal trajectory of NCI, and 2) the neural mechanism by which SE exerts its therapeutic
effects. Notably, SE is a dietary metabolite affording high translational relevance and promising clinical utility."

The overall goal of the proposed research program is to improve our understanding of single cell biology through
information maximization techniques, by applying molecular engineering and computational approaches in
sequencing. Specifically, single cell sequencing is rapidly becoming the predominant method for studying human
biology and disease because it removes the confounding factor of sequencing cell mixtures in bulk. However, it
has major pitfalls: significant material consumption during library preparation, noisy data readouts and signal
dropout, and unclear paths for data integration across datasets.
The overall vision of the proposed research program is to develop a pan-omic analysis strategy that enables
perpetual re-use of any single cell source material. It revolves around a hybrid molecular engineering and
computational framework that is loosely inspired by principles found in computing. The experimental core of the
proposed research program revolved around a new molecular technology referred to as APEX (‘Attachment-
based Primer EXtension’). The major innovation of APEX is the covalent conjugation of genomic material (i.e.
DNA or cDNA) to a solid phase support such as an agarose magnetic bead, followed by utilizing only polymerase-
based assays for non-destructive molecular interrogation.
In this project, we will focus APEX development on single cell transcriptome sequencing applications, with
general applicability to genome biology. As a model system, we will utilize peripheral lymphocytes as they consist
of complex subpopulations with distinct characteristics at multiple levels of omic features. The project will focus
on assay development and optimization, development of bioinformatic algorithms for data integration, and scale
up to large cohorts as a demonstration of the scalability of the technology."

The overall objective of the PNNL Proteome Characterization Center (PCC) is to comprehensively characterize
human tumor samples provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and to integrate the multi-omic
measurements to support improved understanding of the molecular changes that characterize cancer, and do
so in the context of clinical outcome. PNNL has participated in the NCI’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis
Consortium (CPTAC) as a PCC for the past ten years, with responsibility for comprehensive proteogenomic
characterization of high-grade serous ovarian, colon, and endometrial cancers, and glioblastoma. The planned
PNNL PCC will build on those achievements to extend and advance the CPTAC mission of comprehensive
proteogenomic characterization of human cancers to additional cancer types, meeting or exceeding CPTAC
key expectations or requirements for sample throughput, coverage, sample size, and data quality. Utilizing an
advanced analytical platform, PNNL plans to add analysis of both acetylome and ubiquitinome to the
phosphoproteome of prospectively collected human tumors, to betters illuminate key biochemical processes
related to protein-protein interactions, protein degradation, and signal transduction. We will also complement
the core proteome and post-translational modification (PTM)-ome analysis with global metabolome and
lipidome analysis, as well as selected data driven spatial or single-cell proteomics analysis. This will provide
additional critical insights on potential metabolic vulnerabilities and tumor heterogeneity as well as
microenvironment contributions. This multi-omic analysis strategy will also be applied to preclinical samples,
such as cell lines, organoids and patient-derived xenografts. We will also develop targeted mass spectrometric
assays using input from the CPTAC consortium, and particularly the Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers
(PGDACs), to prioritize targets for further exploring important mechanistic proteomic changes in independent
cohort(s). Throughout this work our measurements will benefit from further performance increases (e.g.,
sensitivity and throughput) based on refining, validating and implementing developments from both PNNL and
the other CPTAC Centers.
The PNNL PCC will identify promising cancer signatures and signaling networks through proteomic and
metabolomic analysis of human biospecimens and relevant preclinical samples for 2-3 cancer types selected
by the CPTAC, using state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation, highly
multiplexed isobaric mass-tag labeling (TMT 16-plex), and integrated sample workflows, as well as additional
advanced metabolomic, spatial and single-cell proteomic planforms, at a throughput of 300 samples per year.
We will also explore mechanistically important proteomic changes in human specimens and model systems
using cutting-edge targeted proteomic platforms, analytically validated and highly multiplexed targeted assays,
and workflows meeting the CPTAC Tier 2 assay guidelines. Two hundred highly specific, multiplexed targeted
proteomics assays will be developed and used for measurements in 300 samples each year. The PNNL PCC
will accomplish both unbiased and targeted multi-omic characterization of cancers in conjunction with
improving the depth, throughput and quality of both unbiased and targeted data generated by implementing
and deploying relevant new technologies, such as nanoscale PTM, metabolomic analysis, and single-cell
proteomics analysis.
The PNNL PCC will work closely with the other PCCs, PGDACs and PTRCs in the CPTAC network on data
integration and bioinformatics analysis, as well as translational applications."

The goals of Project 2 are to use iPSC-derived neuron models and cerebral organoids to investigate the
contributions of gene expression and function to human neuron axon/dendrite growth, migration, morphology,
synaptic structure and function, and brain development. We will perform studies in iPSC models that parallel the
common themes explored in the other four projects. These common Center themes include: 1) how Trio and
SynGAP function within specific cell types regulate circuit substrates (migration/morphogenesis, synapse
connectivity, neural function); 2) how specific protein domains in Trio and SynGAP regulate circuit substrates;
and 3) how small molecule targeting of GEF/GAP domains regulate circuit substrates. We will test the
hypotheses that gene dosage, functional domains, catalytic activity, and genetic variants in Trio and SynGAP
affect the ability of human neurons to undergo normal morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, and connectivity. In Aim
1, we will determine the expression and function of Trio and SynGAP in diverse neural subtypes within
developing human neurons and organoids. In Aim 2, we will determine the physiological importance of functional
domains in Trio and SynGAP in human neurons and organoids. Finally in Aim 3, we will determine the effects of
pharmacological inhibition of Trio and SynGAP in human neurons and organoids. These proposed studies will
have a broad, long-lasting impact on the field by determining the physiological importance of individual isoforms
and domains, as well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of Trio and SynGAP in human neurons.
Demonstrating effects of pharmacological modulators of Trio and SynGAP will further yield a valuable toolbox
with which to study other GEF and GAP superfamily members. Findings from Project 2 will provide fundamental
information about the neurobiology of these important regulators of GTPase signaling in the brain."

10861742,"Mechanism of Action of a Novel Golgi-Targeted Anti-Cancer Agent
PROJECT SUMMARY
To cure cancer we need new, actionable targets for therapeutics that are orthogonal to current treatment
strategies to enable new, combinatorial treatment regimens. The Golgi GOLPH3 pathway has emerged as an
attractive target. Genes encoding GOLPH3 pathway proteins (GOLPH3, MYO18A, PITPNC1, and PI4KB)
have all been identified as frequently amplified and over-expressed in common human cancers, acting to
drive cancer (including lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers). Furthermore, the function of the
GOLPH3 pathway is unique among known cancer promoting genes in that the GOLPH3 pathway functions in
vesicle exit from the Golgi for trafficking to the plasma membrane. Genetic interference with the GOLPH3
pathway (including depletion of PI4P, GOLPH3, MYO18A, or PI4KIII?) kills cancerous cells in culture and in
vivo, while relatively sparing normal cells. Therefore, the GOLPH3 pathway is an attractive target for novel
therapeutics. We have identified a small molecule inhibitor of the GOLPH3 pathway using a high-content,
image-based, phenotypic, high-throughput screen. This compound acts on MYO18A to impair Golgi GOLPH3
pathway function and to preferentially kill cancerous cells. Here, we propose experiments to determine the
mechanism of action of this small molecule by identifying the direct, mechanistic target. Thus, we will provide
new insight into mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by the GOLPH3 pathway, regulation of the
GOLPH3 pathway, and enable further medicinal chemistry for hit-to-lead optimization with the goal of
developing a first in class therapeutic agent."

Aging is a known risk factor for the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), although the underlying
mechanisms are only recently being understood. OSA is associated with Alzheimer’s disease in
epidemiological studies as well as having common genetic links. A number of mechanisms have been
proposed including oxidative stress and amyloid and tau deposition which may contribute to the observed link.
Recent prominent publications have hi-lighted the potential impact of sleep disruption on Alzheimer’s risk. We
have clearly observed impairment in sleep-dependent memory consolidation even with mild OSA and have
developed robust methods to assess these outcomes in a rigorous manner. Recent evidence suggests that
OSA in older individuals may be a somewhat different disease than OSA in younger individuals, based on
relatively unique underlying mechanisms. We have recently published and validated techniques allowing the
assessment of the pathophysiology underlying OSA using minimally invasive methods making disease
endotyping clinically accessible. We have also recently found subgroups of OSA patients who respond well to
oxygen and can be predicted based on the underlying pathophysiology of OSA. We plan to study and further
validate our model by assessing the impact of oxygen therapy in OSA patients who are at risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease. We have a robust panel of neurocognitive outcomes and have exciting preliminary data
showing reversibility of some of the observed impairment in hippocampal memory. Moreover we are now
working with expert imaging and neuropsychology collaborators who will help us define robust outcome metrics
using MRI and PET scanning (e.g. volumetric analyses, amyloid, tau). Ultimately we hope that this application
will lay the groundwork for a mechanistic comparative effectiveness trial whereby we can compare oxygen with
standard therapy for select OSA patients in an effort to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease.
Regardless of the results of the proposed work however we will gain major insights into the mechanisms and
optimal care of elderly people with OSA."

 Plants synthesize complex molecules for defense and signaling using specialized metabolic pathways.
These plant natural products enhance their own evolutionary fitness and many of these molecules have been
used with great success as pharmaceuticals to treat a wide range of human diseases as exemplified by Paclitaxel
and Vinorelbine. However, our access to plant specialized metabolites can be limited, as these molecules are
often produced in small amounts as part of complex mixtures and restricted to specific cell-types. While metabolic
engineering and synthetic biology has the potential to improve our access to these compounds, these
approaches require in-depth knowledge of the biosynthetic genes, transporters, and/or regulatory elements of
the specific pathway. Next-generation omics technologies have made elucidation of plant natural product
pathways more streamlined over the last decade, yet the discovery of plant natural product genes remains
challenging relative to that in microbial systems. As a consequence, successful examples of metabolic
engineering to improve access to the wealth of pharmacologically active molecules encoded in plant genomes
are still few in number. For example, while the plant anti-cancer agent vinblastine has been reconstituted in
yeast, the titers are not commercially viable.
 We have recently developed a single-cell omics-enabled, genome-to-pathway discovery pipeline that
accelerates the discovery of natural product biosynthetic pathway genes and their associated regulatory
sequences, including transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements. In Aim 1, we will prepare single cell-
omics datasets from plant materials for pathway discovery of eight key plant natural products with anti-pain, anti-
inflammatory, anti-malarial, and anti-cancer activity. In Aim 2, we will select and validate biosynthetic pathway
genes for these compounds in N. benthamiana. New and innovative metabolic engineering strategies for
improving access to plant natural products are still needed. In Aim 3, cell-type specific regulatory sequences for
these eight biosynthetic pathways will be identified. In Aim 4, synthetic biology will bes used to engineer
Catharanthus roseus callus-derived suspension cultures to produce anhydrovinblastine and a subset of the eight
natural products from this study. Single-cell omics will be used to examine the heterogeneity of natural product
production in populations of wild-type and engineered C. roseus suspension culture cells. Even if commercially
appropriate cultures are not developed within the scope of this proposal, this project will provide the first rigorous
omics datasets on a plant cell culture system. In summary, the state-of-the-art omics approach in this project
will lower the barrier for gene discovery of plant-derived natural products. Utilization of synthetic biology
approaches empowered by cell-type-specific knowledge of biosynthetic pathways will enable a renaissance in

Speech is a closed-loop behavior which requires the brain to continuously perceive and produce acoustic signals
in real time. Current neurobiological theories of speech posit that neural population activity across auditory and
motor regions is dynamically coupled during speech production, but that speech perception relies on auditory
processing alone. This sensorimotor integration hypothesis would allow the brain to exploit immediate auditory
feedback to fine-tune the motor actions that elicit speech. Rigorous neurobiological tests of sensorimotor
integration require (1) a model system that enables the control and measurement of sensorimotor behaviors, (2)
the experimental expertise to conduct large-scale neural recordings simultaneously in sensory and motor
regions, and (3) the computational abilities to develop population scale analyses that assess coordination in the
distributed dynamics of individual neurons. This proposal presents a synergistic combination of experiments and
analyses that meet these requirements: Simultaneous recordings and perturbations of both auditory and motor
regions in European starlings during birdsong production and perception are combined with novel topological
data analyses (TDA) to uncover the population mechanisms that instantiate sensorimotor integration. European
starlings are an ideal organism for understanding neurobiological mechanisms that support sensorimotor
integration; they produce and rely on complex vocal communication signals and have a long history of use in
invasive electrophysiology studies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate how distributed
neuronal population activity integrates auditory and motor information during closed-loop behavior—specifically
birdsong. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that auditory and motor population activity is uniquely
coupled when birds sing, in contrast to when birds listen to song. This hypothesis will be tested through the
following specific aims: In Aim 1, simultaneously recording auditory and motor regions while birds sing and
listen to song will enable an understanding of how population activity is coordinated across regions. In Aim 2,
recordings from auditory regions with concurrent optogenetic inhibition of motor regions while birds sing and
listen to song will enable a delineation of causal interactions between regions. Novel TDA will be used to quantify
the coordination of neural activity across regions and through time, enabling mechanistic insight into how
population dynamics structure song behavior. Contrasting population activity across auditory and motor areas
between singing and listening will allow for the identification of dynamics unique to sensorimotor integration. In
the near-term, this proposal provides a mechanistic understanding of how neuronal populations coordinate to
perform sensorimotor integration in the songbird system. In the long-term, this approach will enable future
research into how brain network dynamics support closed-loop behaviors, such as speech. Ultimately, this
proposal will enable the training and development of a unique and synergistic combination of skills that has the
potential to provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of sensorimotor integration."

Post-transcriptional control of mRNAs plays a key role in regulating important developmental events via RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) that modulate key aspects of RNA fate, including splicing, stability, and translation.
Developmental roles of RBPs are particularly evident in the nervous system, where their loss is linked to an array
of diseases. Understanding how individual RBPs contribute to tissue-specific developmental events is
complicated by their generally ubiquitous expression and by the insufficiency of consensus RBP-binding sites to
predict in vivo occupancy or regulation. These observations imply as yet undefined mechanisms that elevate
requirements for RBPs in specific cell types. We co-discovered an inherited neurodevelopmental disease caused
by loss of the ubiquitously expressed, zinc finger RBP ZC3H14 and have probed function of this protein in
multiple model organisms. The ZC3H14 ortholog in D. melanogaster, Nab2 (nuclear polyadenylated RNA binding
protein 2), provides a tractable genetic model to probe molecular and neurodevelopmental roles. Importantly,
ZC3H14/Nab2 is expressed in all cells but required specifically in neurons of the developing nervous system to
support viability, brain axon guidance, locomotion, and olfactory memory. Critically, human ZC3H14 can
substitute for Nab2 in fly neurons, indicating that the two orthologs share molecular roles and target RNAs.
However, the identity of ZC3H14/Nab2-regulated RNAs, and mechanisms that elevate the ZC3H14/Nab2 role in
neurons, are gaps that limit understanding of how such RBPs play key roles in neurons. Our recent work
exploiting Drosophila provides a foundation to fill these gaps by identifying Nab2 as a novel inhibitor of N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) on a subset of mRNAs in the developing nervous system. m6A is deposited at specific
sites within mRNAs by the m6A ‘writer’ Mettl3. m6A is enriched in the developing brain, where it plays key roles
in neurodevelopment. Our analysis of one newly identified Nab2 neuronal target, the pre-mRNA encoding the
Sex Lethal (Sxl) sex determination factor, suggests that Nab2 promotes a key developmentally regulated exon-
skipping event in Sxl pre-mRNA by binding an A-rich intronic element and inhibiting m6A deposition by Mettl3.
Critically, Nab2-regulation of this splicing event is neuron-specific and rescue of multiple Nab2 phenotypes by
concurrent Mettl3 loss implies that the Nab2-m6A hypermethylation model extends to additional RNA targets.
 We hypothesize that the neurodevelopmental requirement for Nab2/ZC3H14 is based on regulating on a set
of mRNAs encoding key neuronal proteins, at least in part, via this novel m6A inhibitory role. We pursue this
mechanistic hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) Exploit the Sxl pre-mRNA as a model to dissect Nab2 inhibition of
m6A deposition; Aim 2) Use a Sxl splicing reporter to parse direct and direct effects of Nab2 and m6A-regulation
of splicing and identify additional factors in the Nab2-m6A pathway; and Aim 3) Identify key neurodevelopmental
targets of Nab2/ZC3H14 in both flies and in vertebrates. Taken together, these approaches will provide insight
into why loss of a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein causes morphogenesis defects in the brain."

 There is an urgent need to understand the factors determining female reproductive longevity.
Female reproductive aging is characterized by a significant decline in reproductive function due to the
sequential decrease in the number and quality of ovarian follicles that constitute the finite ovarian reserve. The
rete ovarii (RO) is a conserved epithelial structure divided into 3 regions, the intraovarian rete (IOR), located
within the ovary, the extraovarian rete (EOR), located in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete (CR),
which links the EOR and IOR. The RO has been depicted for decades in anatomical context, and is a possible
contributor to gynecological disease, yet its function has never been thoroughly investigated. The reproductive
longevity of females is determined by three main factors: 1) the size of the initial primordial follicle pool, 2) the
rate of ovulation and atresia during the fertile window, and 3) perturbations, such as changes in metabolic
status or hormone levels, which affect ovarian function and follicle growth. The objective of this application is
to elucidate the contribution of the RO to each of these determining factors. To allow visualization and
functional investigation of the ovary in situ, I developed tissue clearing and 3D imaging methods that suggest
a role for the rete in the assembly of ovarian cells into ovigorous cords and subsequent specification of
medullary and cortical domains. I found that the RO remains closely associated with the ovary throughout
adulthood, and preliminary ovary transplantation experiments suggest that the host EOR/CR reestablishes a
connection to the IOR of the grafted ovary. Our transcriptomic data of the RO shows enrichment of secretory
and metabolic pathways consistent with the finding that Dextran injected into the EOR is transported to the
ovary. These data have led to the central hypothesis that the RO plays critical roles in the establishment
of the ovarian reserve and in the regulation of ovarian follicle growth in response to physiological cues.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) (K99) Characterize the contribution of the
RO to the development of the ovary and the establishment of the ovarian reserve; (2) (K99/R00) Define the
functional differences between EOR and IOR in adult homeostasis and (3) (R00) Investigate the changes of
the RO in response to physiological cues. Discovering a role for the rete ovarii in the establishment of the
ovarian reserve and in the regulation of adult follicle growth under homeostatic or perturbed conditions
will situate the RO as a new candidate in the search for determinants of female fertility and reproductive
longevity. In addition, the approaches I develop will be useful in future investigations of interactions
between the ovary and other extrinsic tissues. Pursuit of these aims requires training in single-cell RNA
sequencing, mouse surgery and virally-mediated approaches for manipulating gene expression. I have
assembled an advisory committee chaired by Dr. Capel, and we designed a training plan that will provide me
with the skills required to run a productive, independent developmental and reproductive biology laboratory."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an autoimmune response that targets and destroys insulin-producing
beta cells in the pancreas. Despite advancements in managing T1D, identifying specific antigens critical for T1D
onset has been challenging. Recent research has uncovered hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs), which induce an
autoimmune CD4 T cell response and may serve as specific autoantigens in T1D. HIPs are generated when a
peptide fragment of proinsulin binds to a peptide fragment from other beta cell proteins. Presence of various
HIPs has been validated through mass spectrometric analyses of human and murine islet samples. Several of
those identified HIPs have a known CD4 T cell that specifically targets them in human and murine disease. We
consider these HIPs as disease-relevant because we not only have mass spectrometric evidence for their
existence, but also immunological evidence verifying their role in disease. In this proposal, we plan to study the
role of disease-relevant HIPs formed by the enzyme Cathepsin D (CatD) in the progression of diabetes in non-
obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a amahor animal model used for the study of T1D. We hypothesize that a mutation
of an insulin leucine residue (targeted by CatD) can effectively prevent CatD-mediated HIP formation, resulting
in a reduction of disease incidence in genetically modified mice compared to wildtype mice. We will assess HIP
formation by analyzing mouse islet samples using mass spectrometry, confirm HIP content through T cell assays
with HIP-reactive T cell clones, and monitor mice for disease incidence and immune cell infiltration of the
pancreatic islets. The researchers will also investigate the origin of another subgroup of HIPs (identified in human
islets) that do not form through a CatD-mediated process. For this we apply a proteomic strategy to probe human
islet samples by mass spectrometry with the objective to identify the enzyme responsible for their formation. The
results of these experiments will provide a better understanding of the role of HIPs in disease onset. Furthermore,
the identification of additional HIP-forming processes in human islets may lead to the discovery of a new
therapeutic target, that may allow us to selectively block formation of HIPs in beta-cells. The proposed studies
also offer me the opportunity to expand my understanding of several fields including immunology, proteomics,
and mass spectrometry. These combined skillsets will provide me with expertise needed to study numerous
diseases and pathogenic process throughout my anticipated career as independent investigator."

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause significant lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis,
and pneumonia, that lead to illness or death in millions of infants and young children worldwide. Viral infection is
initiated when the viral fusion complex, comprised of the surface glycoproteins HN (receptor-binding protein;
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and F (fusion protein), mediates fusion upon HN engaging sialic acid receptor.
Bound-HN triggers F to undergo conformational rearrangements that promote viral entry when F is sufficiently
close to insert into the host membrane. To mediate fusion, the fusion protein precursor (F0) must first be cleaved
by host proteases into its active form. F0 cleavage has been thought to be executed intracellularly by the
ubiquitously expressed furin, because F0 contains a dibasic cleavage site. However, the sponsor’s laboratory
found that the dibasic cleavage site underlying the assumption is an artifact of laboratory adaptation, whereas
circulating strains of HPIV3 have a monobasic cleavage site that is cut by an unidentified extracellular protease
in the lung. F0 cleavage by extracellular proteases opens the possibility that catalytic activation of F may be
delayed until a target cell is reached, thereby enabling the fusion protein to remain in a more stable uncleaved
state until reaching specific protease expressing target cells. The goal of this proposal is to identify the
proteases required for HPIV3 spread in the human lung and novel mechanisms by which the virus exploits these
proteases to selectively target cells, proliferate in the respiratory system, and survive host-to-host transmission.
Aim 1 will identify host proteases that are necessary for circulating HPIV3 F0 cleavage and assess the impact
of their expression on viral tropism in authentic lung models.
Aim 2 will determine how the timing of F cleavage affects fusion efficiency, and how a delay in F cleavage until
the time of infection may enable virions to evade inactivation of the viral fusion machinery by host factors during
traversal of the human respiratory tract.
The proposed project employs an array of cell biological, biochemical, and imaging techniques to apply
complementary, yet independent approaches for understanding critical host protease determinants of HPIV3
infectivity and novel viral mechanisms for maintaining fusion protein functionality. The breadth of approaches will
contribute to the project’s scientific rigor, since each question will be answered in several different ways, and
provide technical and theoretical learning opportunities. By the time of completion, this project will have identified
F cleaving proteases, characterized the role of cleavage in regulating F activity, and explored the broader
implications of F0 for viral evasion of virucidal host factors, like mucins. Data gleaned from these studies will
clarify an essential step of HPIV life cycles and our overall understanding of the HN-F viral fusion machinery. For
these reasons, the project serves as an ideal training vehicle, providing an interdisciplinary path to greater
independence."
10825632,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents a worldwide health burden as the most common type of congenital
abnormality, affecting ~1% of live births. While it remains the leading contributor to birth defect mortality, the
causes of CHD remain to be uncovered. Development of the heart is itself a complex process that is controlled
and regulated by multiple cell types, largely arising from the pharyngeal apparatus, a transient structure in
embryogenesis. The conotruncal region of the heart, composed of the outflow tract and great vessels, is
particularly susceptible to congenital anomalies since its formation and remodeling involve extensive
developmental processes. Conotruncal defects (CTDs) represent about 30% of all CHDs and occur in 40% of
patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). TBX1, encoding a T-box transcription factor, is the main
causative gene for CTDs in 22q11.2DS, yet haploinsufficiency is not sufficient to explain the variable expressivity
of these defects. Therefore, 22q11.2DS represents a unique population in which to uncover genetic modifiers of
CTDs. To identify potentially damaging rare coding variants as modifiers, our lab performed whole genome
sequence analysis on 1,182 subjects with 22q11.2DS, with and without CHD. We found that chromatin regulatory
genes occurred in 8.5% of the 22q11.2DS subjects with CTDs. Some of these genes are also associated with
sporadic CHD in the general population, which is strongly suggestive that precise regulation of chromatin, and
consequently transcription, is essential for proper cardiac development. Our study aims to investigate the
interaction of chromatin regulatory genes, specifically Kmt2c and Kmt2d, with Tbx1 in mouse models. KMT2C
and KMT2D encode histone methyltransferases of the COMPASS family and they have also been implicated as
causative for sporadic CHD. I therefore hypothesize that Tbx1 and Kmt2c/d genetically interact in the
developmental processes critical for proper formation of the conotruncal region of the heart. To test this
interaction, I have generated mouse crosses for the conditional knockout of Kmt2c, Kmt2d, and Kmt2c/d in the
Tbx1 lineage. I will characterize cardiac defects through molecular and cellular approaches, as well as through
functional genomics studies that will delineate the shared and unique developmental roles of Kmt2c/d and Tbx1.
This will further the understanding of the genetic architecture of heart development and, consequently, the
etiology of CHD, knowledge of which will improve diagnosis and treatment."

mRNA holds great therapeutic potential as an agent to induce expression of proteins in cells. Precise delivery of
mRNA to diseased cell types could have numerous applications, from correcting pathogenic mutations by gene
editing to inducing killing in diseased cell types to cell state reprogramming. Despite this potential, it remains
challenging to deliver mRNA to specific subsets of cells. A general method to safely deliver mRNA cargo to
target cell types within a patient’s body would unlock the full therapeutic potential of mRNA. Living cells are ideal
delivery vehicles because they can be programmed to use sensing and logic to specifically deliver mRNA to
target cell populations.
Towards this goal, our lab has recently developed delivery cells capable of exporting mRNA in synthetic export
vehicles (synEVs). These particles can transfer mRNA cargo to receiver cells, where it is expressed. In this
proposal, we aim to create, optimize, and integrate elements to generate an ideal cell-based mRNA delivery
platform. In Aim 1, we will engineer primary human T cells, a clinically relevant cell type, as delivery cells. In Aim
2, we will develop strategies to control targeting specificity by engineering conditional sending and pseudotyping.
In Aim 3, we will demonstrate cell-cell delivery and functionality of mRNA in vivo by delivering a circuit that
induces cell death to tumor cells, which should bypass the immunosuppression that limits traditional immune
cell-based therapies.
Together, this work will expand our capabilities in cell-cell mRNA delivery and enable a novel, cell-based tumor
killing strategy that circumvents immunosuppression. Further, while we focus on applications related to cancer
in this proposal, this work will establish a platform with broad utility across biomedicine, including for in vivo cell
reprogramming and genome editing."

The formation of comedones, referred to as comedogenesis, describes the production of keratinized plug that
occludes the opening of the hair follicle. Comedones are often observed in common cutaneous diseases like
acne vulgaris, with up to 85% of individuals experiencing comedonal lesions in their lifetime. Comedones are
also seen in rare, severe diseases such as nevus comedonicus (NC), a disease involving comedones that
progress into painful, inflammatory cysts. We have shown that NC is caused by somatic mutations in the NEK9
gene. Remarkably, whole exome sequencing (WES) of a common comedonal disorder, the epidermal inclusion
cyst, revealed identical mutations in NEK9, suggesting NEK9 mutations may drive comedogenesis across
different manifestations. While NEK9 has been well studied in the context of mitosis and cell cycle progression,
sporadic associations of NEK9 with primary cilia are also seen in the literature. The primary cilium, an immotile
finger-like projection from the cell with critical functions in signal transduction, houses many of the signaling
pathways related to proper development and maintenance of hair follicles. Because comedones arise from
follicular structures, these mutations in NEK9 provide an unmatched opportunity to elucidate the genetic and
biologic mechanisms underlying comedogenesis. To accomplish this, we have generated in vitro and in vivo
models of NEK9 mutations identified in NC and EIC. Our preliminary data show NEK9 mutations result in shorter
cilia and less ciliation in vitro. Hedgehog signaling, a key follicular signaling pathway that acts through the primary
cilium, is diminished in NEK9 mutant cells. Our immunofluorescence studies show the activated form of the
NEK9 protein localizes to the base of the cilium, a new discovery in NEK9 biology. We have previously shown
this activation signal to be increased across the NEK9 mutations. Together, these preliminary data support ciliary
dysfunction to be a result of NEK9 mutations. To study the involvement of NEK9 and cilia in comedogenesis in
vivo, we have generated a transgenic mouse using a tamoxifen-dependent, basal keratinocyte specific promoter
(K14-CreERT) to drive transcription of the NEK9 mutation most commonly reported in NC. We will time transgene
induction with follicular morphogenesis onset and perform immunofluorescence and advanced microscopy
methods to interrogate defects in canonical follicular development. We will continue to obtain NC and EIC tissue
from our institution and perform WES to identify new candidate variants that may contribute to comedogenesis.
We will generate stratified skin equivalent models to continually test the newly identified mutations for ciliary
phenotypes. Lastly, we will use the known biology of NEK9 to systematically test downstream effectors for
possible mechanisms of ciliary dysfunction. This training proposal represents an integrated scientific approach
and new learning experiences that harness techniques in cell biology, computational genetics, and pathology to
yield novel insights into the mechanisms of comedogenesis."

 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of late-onset dementia, known for the presence of
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. There is a portion of patients with AD
who develop symptoms before the age of 65, known as early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), caused by
mutations in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. A specific kindred of these patients was identified for having PSEN1
E280A mutations in Colombia, leading to mild cognitive impairment in their early 40s and dementia by late 40s.
One patient from this kindred interestingly did not develop any memory deficits until she was in her 70s.
Postmortem analyses showed that in addition to her PSEN1 E280A mutation, she also was homozygous for a
mutation in her APOE3 gene, known as the Christchurch mutation (APOE3cc). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a
lipid transporter that is expressed by astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system and is the most
common risk factor for AD. Ultimately, a better understanding of how this mutation yields resilience against ADAD
could be a promising therapeutic target for AD.
First, we created a mouse model of human APOE3cc to replicate the patient’s rare homozygous mutation
in mice. We leveraged single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to elucidate which cell types could be
responsible for APOE3cc’s resilience. The snRNAseq data implicated both microglia and astrocytes as
regulators of APOE3cc’s neuroprotection. In microglia, our data showed that ApoEcc/cc+P301S mice significantly
downregulated several interferon genes. High levels of type-I interferons in the CNS, present in both aging and
neurodegeneration, have been associated with detrimental effects on cognition. In astrocytes, ApoEcc/cc+P301S
mice showed reprogramming of mitochondrial and antioxidant genes. Oxidative stress and neurodegeneration
are inextricably linked, and having increased antioxidant genes could explain downstream resiliency in the
patient. Additionally, previous studies have linked oxidative stress to activation of the interferon pathway. I
hypothesize that the combination of microglial interferon suppression and astrocytic antioxidant
reprogramming protect against tau-mediated dysfunction in the ApoE3cc/cc mice. To test this hypothesis,
we aim to determine the following: 1) determine the relationship of the interferon response in ApoE3cc/cc microglia
to neuronal health and neurite outgrowth. 2) analyze the ApoE3cc/cc astrocytic mitochondrial, antioxidant, and
metabolic response to tauopathy. Both aims will utilize a combined in vivo and in vitro approach."

 After spinal cord injury (SCI), spasticity occurs in approximately 80% of patients. Spasticity involves
involuntary muscle movements, co-contraction of muscles, and hyperreflexia. These severe symptoms of
spasticity can make daily activities, such as sitting or sleeping, nearly impossible. Current pharmacological
treatments for spasticity, such as GABA agonists, have severe side effects such as seizures and dizziness, and
depress spinal reflex excitability and muscle activity, which further impedes motor recovery. Therefore, there is
a pressing need for new treatment options that will reduce spasticity in SCI patients without decreasing motor
output.
 Epidural stimulation (ES) studies have mainly focused on locomotor recovery, however a decrease in
spasticity has been reported, but not heavily explored. The efficacy of ES on functional improvements can vary
based on the optimization of the electrode configuration used, necessitating the need to elucidate specific
configurations tailored to the treatment of spasticity. Our preliminary results have shown improvement in the
frequency dependent depression of the H-reflex in SCI rats following a single session of ES, suggesting a
decrease in spasticity. However, this effect is based on how the electrode configuration is optimized. Moreover,
the differences in ES-induced evoked potentials between configurations within the same animal can elicit
depression or facilitation, providing insight into what configurations might be ideal for the treatment of spasticity.
Aim 1 will determine an optimal electrode configuration for epidural stimulation to decrease spasticity and
hyperreflexia after SCI. We hypothesize that ES will be optimal for treating spasticity with the usage of
configurations that favor depression and that motor output will not be reduced.
 Spasticity and hyperreflexia mostly manifest from a downregulation of KCC2, a chloride transporter,
which largely determines the intracellular chloride concentration of neurons. Therefore, KCC2 is essential in the
maintenance of normal inhibition within the adult spinal cord. Activity based therapies, such as locomotor training,
decrease spasticity by increasing motoneuronal KCC2 expression. Aim 2 will determine if the restoration of
chloride homeostasis contributes to ES effects on spasticity. We hypothesize that ES reduces spasticity through
KCC2-mediated mechanisms and that blocking KCC2 activity during treatment will diminish ES-induced changes
in spasticity.
 The proposed project will further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for reducing spasticity with ES
and aid in optimizing treatments for spasticity. This ES protocol will provide a valuable resource to pursue
translational ES treatments with and without the use of pharmacological intervention."

Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains a leading cause of death primarily in children under the age
of five in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being treatable with chemotherapy, the global spread of drug resistance,
along with the lack of natural sterilizing immunity and a vaccine with only modest efficacy has made the goal of
malaria elimination an ever more distant goal. Identification of highly conserved antigen targets that prove to be
true correlates of immune protection would create transformational tools in malaria research. To do this, there
is need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of immunity to malaria. This
proposal will focus on understanding the kinetics and dynamics of functional immune responses to merozoite
antigens longitudinally and with consideration to natural genetic diversity of currently circulating parasite
genotypes. With defined immune correlates of protection not yet broadly established in malaria, it is essential to
move beyond antibody-antigen recognition and towards a better understanding of antibody-mediated
mechanisms of functional immune responses. The blood-stage of malaria represents an attractive target as it is
responsible for both clinical disease severity and onward transmission and previous studies have demonstrated
that antibodies against P. falciparum antigens play a critical role in controlling blood-stage infection. The first
objective is to quantify anti-merozoite functional activity by assessing mechanisms that are associated with
protective blood-stage immune responses including neutralization and opsonic phagocytosis. Extensive
consideration for the development of the next malaria vaccine needs to understand the extent of genetic diversity
on protective functional immune responses. A second objective is to understand how merozoite antigenic
diversity affects functional immune responses by quantifying the degree to which functional opsonizing and
neutralizing immune responses are strain-specific or strain-transcendent when challenged with strains of varying
degrees of genomic relatedness. To evaluate these objectives, we will use serum samples collected
longitudinally following a genomically well-characterized malaria infection and P. falciparum parasite isolates
from these day 0 infections from a Senegalese cohort. The central hypothesis is that functional immune
responses against P. falciparum are developed through changes in antibody composition over the course of
infection, with broadly functionally protective responses dependent on the degree of parasite genomic and
genetic relatedness. Senegal is an ideal setting for understanding the determinants of highly functional immune
responses to key merozoite antigens, as transmission is low, and multiple individuals in the population are
exposed to genomically identical strains and have monogenomic infections. Understanding determinants of
highly functional immune responses and the ability to generate strain-transcending immune responses will
ultimately help to define immune correlates of protection in malaria and aid in vaccine development."

This project will elucidate the psychological processes that give rise to gender disparities in mental health
across development. Despite efforts toward mitigating such disparities, gender-linked outcomes remain stark:
relative to men, women consistently report higher rates of internalizing problems and lower levels of self-
esteem. The relation between gender and mental health is evident by adolescence: thus, efforts to identify how
such disparities emerge—and, critically, how they may be mitigated—require a broad-based investigation into
the psychological processes that create and sustain them across development. To date, research into the
emergence and manifestation of gender differences in mental health has focused largely on the role of
biological factors linked to sex (e.g., differences in genetics, brain circuitry, or hormones). However, gender
identity—the extent to which one identifies as a boy/man, a girl/woman, nonbinary, or another gender—is
complex and multi-faceted. Not only is its relation to biology inconsistent, as in the case of gender-diverse
populations, but it is linked to a host of psychological variables (e.g., attributes, behaviors, and experiences)
that may themselves contribute to psychological distress. The proposed research will seek to achieve a more
holistic understanding of how gender disparities in mental health emerge by involving a diverse sample of
adolescents, including cisgender girls (gender identity: girl, assigned sex: female), transgender girls (gender
identity: girl, assigned sex: male), cisgender boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: male), and transgender
boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: female). This sample will be drawn from a large-scale longitudinal
study of socially-transitioned transgender and gender-diverse youth in North America (including 40+ U.S.
states), of which the project Sponsor is the Principal Investigator. Our research will seek to address several
important objectives across two waves of online data collection, spaced one year apart.
In Aim 1, we will distill the unique role of gender identity, relative to assigned sex, in predicting gender
disparities in mental health across adolescence. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the influence of relevant
psychological variables linked to gender (i.e., possession of feminine vs. masculine characteristics, reports of
self-objectification, and experiences of sexism) in accounting for gender disparities in mental health across
adolescence. By investigating gender disparities in mental health in a sample comprised of both cisgender and
gender-diverse adolescents, this research is well-positioned to clarify the role of gender-linked psychological
variables—relative to biological ones—in predicting gender disparities in mental health, thus opening up novel
pathways for achieving gender equity in this domain. Additionally, the proposed project enables us to expand
the inclusivity of research on mental health by affording us the opportunity to examine gender-based disparities
in mental health in the context of existing disparities between cisgender and gender-diverse adolescents."
10825817,"Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of deaths globally, representing approximately 31% of deaths
per year, 85% of which are due to myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. This does not account for the millions of
patients suffering daily with current therapies that are not efficacious in treating a major cause of cardiovascular
disease: atherosclerosis. Current therapeutics for atherosclerosis fail to consider the role of dampening
inflammation and improving lymphatic function, both of which have the potential to promote plaque regression.
Lymphangiogenesis is the process where the lymphatic network is extended, but its role in atherogenesis is
currently under-characterized and controversial. Inflammatory diseases are found to have lymphangiogenesis
with associated malfunction, but controversy exists as to whether this is a cause of disease pathogenesis or a
compensatory attempt at disease resolution. Recent data suggests a role for lymphatic vessels in reverse
cholesterol transport (RCT), which relies on the junctional morphology between lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs) to regulate the egression of HDL and/or inflammatory cells. During inflammation, junctions between LECs
transform from discontinuous buttons to impermeable zippers, which may impede RCT and prevent resolution
of inflammation. Our lab has previously reported that Interleukin-19 (IL-19), an immuno-modulatory cytokine,
uniquely attenuates atherosclerotic plaque progression while also being pro-angiogenic. This drives our central
hypothesis that one mechanism whereby IL-19 prevents atherosclerotic disease progression is by driving
functional lymphangiogenesis, especially through the maintenance of permeable lymphatic vessels to promote
RCT. Our in vitro data indicates IL-19 can significantly induce primary LEC proliferation, migration, and tube
formation, all lymphangiogenic assays. RNA sequencing also identified upregulation of Prox1, the master
transcription factor of lymphangiogenesis, 6.2-fold. IL-19 also increases expression of several genes implicated
in endothelial cell permeability, including Angpt2. Functional in vitro permeability assays showed that oxLDL
decreases LEC permeability which IL-19 treatment prevents. This suggested that IL-19 can promote transport
of lipid through lymphatic vessels and was confirmed with HDL transit. Junctional morphology was also validated
via immunocytochemistry for VE-cadherin on hdLECs. Western blot confirmed phosphorylation of STAT3, a
factor in canonical IL-19 signaling, and VE-cadherin, an indication of LEC permeability. Subsequent Prox1 siRNA
knockdown mitigated both IL-19 stimulated lymphangiogenesis and Angpt2 upregulation. Preliminary in vivo data
with VEcadCreERT2 Prox1 F/+ mice, which experience compromised lymphatic function, indicates that IL-19
improves lymphatic function through removal of Evans blue dye. These data suggest that IL-19 increases
lymphatic vessel formation and function, with a potential mechanism of enhancing RCT to decrease plaque
burden in atherosclerosis. This grant will continue to characterize IL-19’s mechanistic pathway in LECs and
determine lymphatic functionality in vivo through HDL and foam cell trafficking by aortic microlymphangiography."

(UPR) activation are required steps in β-cell dysfunction. Activating Transcription Factor 6 alpha (ATF6α) is
a UPR-effector protein that helps increase cellular tolerance to stress by inducing expression of genes
involved in ER function. Based on extensive literature documenting the beneficial role of ATF6α, we
hypothesized in vivo β-cell ATF6α activation would protect mice against diabetes. Using destabilized domain
technology provided by Luke Wiseman’s lab at the Scripps Institute, the Alonso lab generated knock-in mice
(C57BL/6) expressing the N-terminal fragment of human ATF6α fused to a destabilized variant of E. coli
Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR-ATF6α). Upon constitutive expression, the destabilized DHFR domain
directs DHFR-ATF6α towards proteasomal degradation until exposure to the pharmacologic chaperone,
Trimethoprim (TMP), which stabilizes DHFR and turns on DHFR-ATF6α transcriptional activity. These mice
allow cell-type-specific (via Cre recombinase) and temporal (via TMP) activation of ATF6α in β-cells.
Surprisingly, contrary to our hypothesis in vivo β-cell DHFR-ATF6α activation caused marked glucose
intolerance during an intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose challenge. There was no loss of insulin responsiveness
and β-cell mass remained intact, suggesting β-cell DHFR-ATF6α activation causes insulin insufficiency.
Indeed, our preliminary data indicate loss of glucose stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and a reduced islet
insulin content. Intriguingly, loss of insulin secretion preceded reduced islet insulin content, suggesting β-cell
DHFR-ATF6α activation impacts these processes by distinct molecular mechanisms. In Aim1, I propose to
examine the impact of in vivo β-cell DHFR-ATF6α activation on insulin production; specifically, proinsulin
production, proinsulin processing, and insulin granule maturation using transmission electron microscopy. In
Aim 2, I propose to examine the impact of in vivo β-cell DHFR-ATF6α activation on the insulin secretion
pathway; specifically, glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, ATP production, cAMP signaling, ATP-sensitive
potassium channel closure, calcium induced insulin release, and cortical actin remodeling, using the gold-
standard islet perifusion assay. These aims will contribute valuable knowledge for developing therapies that
help preserve and/or rescue β-cell function in T2D. ATF6α is a key component of the chronic stress response
that is thought to contribute to β-cell dysfunction. Understanding the impact of continuous, inappropriate β-
cell ATF6α signaling may be useful for uncovering novel molecular mechanisms that explain one part of the
damaging effect of chronic stress that precedes diminished β-cell insulin production and secretion in T2D."

 In the developing nervous system, neurons are overproduced and subsequently pared down through cell
death to ensure the proper connections are supported and stabilized. Neurons that do not receive sufficient
support will die and be removed from the system. In the developing peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
circuits are refined by limiting amounts of nerve growth factor (NGF) that is secreted by target organs (e.g. eye
or salivary gland). NGF binds its receptor, TrkA, at the distal axon of innervating sympathetic neurons and
internalizes onto signaling endosomes (SEs). Since the cell bodies reside in sympathetic chain ganglia, SEs
need to be retrogradely trafficked to the soma for survival signaling. Insufficient NGF/TrkA uptake and trafficking
leads to cell death. Sympathetic neurons are innervated by autonomic preganglionic ChAT-positive neurons in
the spinal cord. Their survival is also NGF-dependent, despite lacking TrkA or access to soluble NGF. How these
preganglionic neurons survive without access to NGF is unknown. We hypothesize that TrkA-containing (TrkA+)
extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from sympathetic neurons provide this neurotrophic support.
 Our recent publication is one of the first to show that sympathetic neurons secrete EVs with characteristic
sizes and protein marker composition. We identify TrkA as a novel EV cargo, which can be present in its active,
phosphorylated state. Using a compartmentalized culture system, we show that TrkA originating from distal
axons can be packaged in EVs and secreted from the somatodendritic domain. In addition, our preliminary data
show that sympathetic EVs reduce death of preganglionic ChAT-positive neurons, suggesting they can indeed
provide survival signaling. Interestingly, pilot experiments suggest that the TrkA+ EVs mediate this survival
response. Together, our foundational data led to the hypothesis that sympathetic EVs provide neurotrophic
support to preganglionic neurons, potentially via the TrkA+ subpopulation.
 In this application, I aim to discover the pathways by which these signaling-competent EVs contribute to
preganglionic neuron survival. Aim 1: I will investigate the pathways by which EVs initiate signaling in recipient
cells using mass cytometry, a powerful technique that will enable the assessment of 20 signaling states with
single-cell resolution. I will test the hypothesis that a subpopulation selectively initiates survival signaling
pathways when exposed to EVs. Aim 2: Using live imaging in a compartmentalized culture system, I will
determine the contribution of long-distance communication within the preganglionic neuron to the neurotrophic
effects of sympathetic EVs. I will test the hypothesis that local accessibility of sympathetic EVs confers specificity
in recipient response and whether these EVs and their components undergo retrograde transport. The impact of
this work would be the discovery of a novel component of long-distance trophic signaling, i.e. signaling-
competent sympathetic EVs. Understanding mechanisms of sympathetic EV responses will greatly improve our
understanding of how a neuronal target dictates the entirety of a circuit to its needs."

Mammals possess a limited compacity to regenerate appendages following traumatic injury and amputation,
including regenerating digit tips and healing of bone fractures. In contrast, zebrafish can regenerate entire
appendages following amputation. As in development, regenerated appendages are scaled appropriately to
body size. Extensive genetic and pharmacological experiments have established that canonical signaling
pathways, such as Fgf and Wnt, are reactivated following injury to promote the cell proliferation, migration, and
differentiation that drives regeneration of appendages. However, how these pathways encode size and shape
is unclear. This is due, in part, to the limited number of quantitative and dynamic descriptions of these signaling
pathways and their downstream cellular events during regeneration. To address these gaps in the
understanding of appendage scaling during regeneration, this proposal aims to develop a quantitative, live
imaging platform for zebrafish caudal fin regeneration. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the role of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in encoding cell proliferation and bone size during fin ray regeneration. Aim 2
will define the role of negative feedback during fin regeneration and investigate whether this negative feedback
contributes to the robustness of this regeneration event. Collectively, this work will establish a quantitative
model for interrogating the cellular basis of size and shape control during regeneration. This work will be
conducted at Duke University under the mentorship of Dr. Di Talia and Dr. Poss. This is a highly collaborative
training environment that affords expertise in quantitative and regenerative biology. This proposed research
will be carried out alongside focused training in quantitative approaches, scientific writing, and mentorship."

Depression is the leading mental health related contributor to the Global Burden of Disease. We have shown in
previous studies that generic antidepressant medications (ADMs) and brief psychological interventions such as
our culturally adapted version of behavioral activation, the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), are effective in
achieving remission in primary care patients. However, not everyone responds to either intervention and
similar aggregate outcomes can mask considerable individual variability in response. The goal of our proposed
research is to see if we can enhance treatment outcomes for patients with moderate to severe depression by
personalizing allocation to one of the two treatments; additionally, we aim to identify those patients who are
unlikely to respond to either treatment and should be referred to specialist care. To achieve this, we will use
machine learning to develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) based on a wide range of baseline moderators
which are feasible to assess in routine care settings. Our primary hypothesis is that those patients randomized
by chance to their optimal intervention as indicated by the PTR will be more likely to remit and recover than
those who are not. Moreover, we hypothesize that using our PTR to select the optimal treatment for each
individual patient will prove to be more cost-effective than leaving things to chance. We also plan to explore
secondary questions, such as whether we can enhance our mediation tests by including the PTR in
interactions with our purported mediators (moderated mediation). Further, we plan to explore whether we can
enhance the prescriptive utility of our PTR via genotyping our sample and calculating polygenic risk scores
based on very large sample Genome-Wide Association studies. We will test these hypotheses in a controlled
trial in primary care settings in India where we have a record of conducting depression treatment trials for two
decades. We plan to randomize 1500 individuals to either HAP or ADM and generate our PTR on the first 1000
patients randomized and then test it on the remaining 500 patients. This will be the first test of whether
precision medicine can be used to enhance depression treatment outcomes through prediction of differential
response to the two treatments recommended by the WHO for depression in primary care. Concurrently, we
also should be able to identify baseline predictors of nonresponse to either of these two treatments, so as to
identify patients who should be referred to specialist care at the outset. Our findings have the potential to make
significant contributions to the prospect of optimizing the treatment of depression in primary care not just in
India but also in primary care settings worldwide, and thus support the practice-related goals of NIMH RFA-
MH-18-701."
10827931,"This proposed K23 career development award will provide Nancy Kerner, MD, Assistant professor of Psychiatry
at Columbia University, with mentored career development to establish an independent research career in the
study of the association of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia. Poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms are common in older adults with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), whereas more than half of
adults aged 65 years or older have sleep disorders, less than half are diagnosed. Also, there is strong evidence
that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in older adults, and some individuals with untreated OSA
have rapid cognitive transitions from normal cognition to MCI and from MCI to dementia. However, the
associations between poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with clinical cognitive diagnoses have not
been studied. The goal of this K23 award is to advance Dr. Kerner’s research career by (a) providing mentored
career development and training in patient-oriented research (POR) in sleep and circadian disturbances across
all stages and (b) conducting a study to assess sleep and circadian rhythms with the PROMIS sleep
questionnaires and actigraphy among the elderly evaluated for ADRD in primary care practices. The proposed
project is an ancillary study to an ongoing project of dementia detection among persons 65 years or older with
cognitive concerns in primary care, in which the primary mentor Luchsinger and co-mentor Devanand are the
principal investigators. The primary aim is to examine cross-sectionally and longitudinally the association of poor
sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with cognitive diagnostic categories based on the NIA-AA criteria,
including dementia, amnestic MCI single domain, amnestic MCI multiple domain, and cognitive impairment no
MCI. The relation of OSA with diagnostic categories will also be explored. The secondary aim is to examine the
relationship of cognitive transitions with new onset of abnormal sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms. The
exploratory aim is to explore the interactions of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with AD risk factors
(e.g. APOE genotype) in relation to transitions from normal cognition to MCI and from MCI to dementia. These
research aims will be complemented by training in (1) cognitive testing and diagnosis, (2) sleep and circadian
rhythm scoring, (3) circadian metrics analyses, (4) statistical analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal data,
(4) methods to assess temporality of associations, such as path analysis, and (5) mediation and moderation
analyses. Collectively, the career development plan, research project, and training activities will build a sound
platform for Dr. Kerner to become an independent investigator in sleep/circadian rhythms and ADRD research."
10827932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small-animal models are powerful discovery tools in medical research, but sacrificing prevents long-term, in vivo
observation of natural or pathological processes. As such, there is a need for a morphologic, functional,
cellular/molecular, and quantitative imaging technique capable of longitudinal visualization of biochemical and
pharmacological processes in small-animal disease models. Unfortunately, current molecular optical imaging
approaches tend to present an undesirable trade-off between imaging depth and resolution. Non-invasive
photoacoustic imaging (PAI), which is capable of simultaneous anatomical, functional, and molecular
visualization of pathology with high contrast/resolution at depth, has thus generated significant excitement
among preclinical imaging researchers. However, these end-users currently lack a reliable, reproducible, and
validated molecular PAI platform to complement their translational research. To address this need, we propose
enabling the molecular sensitivity of PAI through the development and validation of targeted contrast agents and
signal/image processing algorithms to allow simultaneous, reproducible, quantitative, longitudinal, and
tomographic imaging of molecular and physiological signatures of disease and therapy response in preclinical
studies. Many available molecular contrast agents lack adequate PAI contrast for deep imaging and/or overlap
with spectral features of hemoglobin absorption, making it difficult to differentiate a targeted probe from
surrounding blood. To address these limitations, we seek to continue development of a unique contrast agent
based on antibody-targeted liposomes loaded with J-aggregates of indocyanine green (ICG) dye. Encapsulation
of ICG J-aggregates in a liposomal compartment results in a stable contrast agent (Lipo-JICG), which provides
highly advantageous properties for in vivo PAI: (i) a strong, narrow absorbance at ~890 nm, where it can be
readily unmixed from hemoglobin spectra; (ii) enhancement of PAI signal due to dye-aggregation-mediated
increases in thermal gradients and absorbance; (iii) the ability to implement robust, semi-quantitative PAI
analysis that does not interfere with imaging of important physiological parameters such as blood oxygen
saturation. Our compelling preliminary data show that targeted Lipo-JICG provides impressive stability, linearity,
PAI-signal intensity and molecular specificity. During this research proposal, we will validate the molecular-
imaging capabilities of this promising technology in tissue-mimicking phantoms, well-characterized cell cultures,
and orthotopic models of ovarian cancer. At the conclusion of these studies, we will be in position to start mass-
production and end-user dissemination of Lipo-JICG and image processing algorithms as a fully validated,
molecularly specific PAI platform for reliable, reproducible, and affordable preclinical imaging. Although not the
principle objective of this proposal, these studies also provide a foundation for clinical translation of our agent as
the liposomes, ICG, and humanized-targeted antibodies of which it is composed have all been FDA cleared for
i.v. use, therefore reducing safety concerns and improving the chances for future clinical utilization."

The goal of this application is to support the candidate in developing advanced and specialized skills necessary
to build an independent program of research, with a focus on improving the implementation of culturally relevant
pain assessment and management for language-diverse patients and families who use interpretation services
in pediatric medical settings. The F32 candidate will be a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of
California-Irvine Center on Stress and Health (UCI-CSH) which is currently funded by 5-NIH awards (including
a K-23) and has an excellent history with mentorship of early career faculty.
This application proposes a mixed methods design study to identify sociocultural factors that influence pain
communication and evaluate the concordance of pain understanding among multiple stakeholders (caregivers,
children, interpreters, and clinicians) in a linguistically and ethnically diverse sample of children 1-6 years old
who present to the emergency department (ED) with pain-related complaints. Indeed, millions of children present
to the ED setting each year in pain and although current guidelines emphasize the need to address such pain,
inadequate pain assessment and management remains prevalent. Latinx children are at a particularly high risk
for experiencing pain disparities and Spanish-speaking families are at particularly high risk because of additional
linguistic barriers. The first aim of the application calls for a quantitative approach to identify the congruence of
pain reporting across all stakeholders (child-parent-interpreter-clinician). The second aim is focused on a
qualitative approach to understand the perspective of the stakeholders regarding communication of pain using
interpreters. With enthusiastic and material support from UCI-CSH and Children’s Hospital of Orange County
(CHOD) ED senior leadership, the project will be conducted in a high-volume pediatric department where a large
proportion of patients are Spanish-speaking Latinx and are part of an innovative population health program.
The candidate’s training plan capitalizes on the expertise of a highly experienced multidisciplinary mentorship
team, integrating key training in pain in the ED, NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research
Frameworks, sociocultural factors in pediatric pain and healthcare disparities, mixed methods research, and
professional development. The training plan will incorporate didactic coursework, one-on-one mentoring, and
seminars focused on career development, training evaluation and research ethics. UCI-CSH is a highly
productive, well-established research environment that incorporates a unique multidisciplinary approach to
training and clinical research. UCI-CSH is embedded within CHOC, where the study will be implemented.
Collectively, this will provide an exceptional training and research environment to characterize sociocultural
contributors to pain in a population at-risk for experiencing care disparities and provide a strong foundation for a
Career Development Award focused on developing and piloting an intervention to train diverse stakeholders to
improve cross-cultural and cross-linguistic pain communication during interpreted medical encounters."
10827049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is on the rise, and we are in dire need of effective
treatments. In AD, the spatiotemporal progression of tau pathology within the CNS remains the strongest
neuropathological correlate of cognitive impairment, thus constituting a likely effective treatment target (long-
term goal). Compelling evidence supports a trans-synaptic framework for pathological tau spreading, driven
primarily by the propagation of toxic soluble tau oligomer (tauO) conformers between functionally connected
brain regions. Numerous investigations further postulate the influence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) on trans-
neuronal pathological tau spreading, while emerging evaluations of primary tauopathies (e.g. Primary Age
Related Tauopathy—PART), which lack Aβ, observe limited regional tau spreading alongside little-to-no
amnestic changes. Within the trans-synaptic spreading framework, however, the precise mechanisms by
which tauO engage human synapses, and the role of Aβ in this process, remain unknown. We thus
hypothesize that Aβ modulates pathological tau spreading by increasing oligomeric tau binding to vulnerable
synapses. To support this hypothesis, we provide novel preliminary evidence for two (i.e. bivalent) tauO
binding sites in human synapses and further show that synaptic tauO binding is significantly increased in
the presence of soluble Aβ oligomers. In Aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying
bivalent tauO binding, as a function of AβO, in healthy human synapses. In In Aim 2, we will evaluate how
AβO, or lack thereof, influences synaptic tauO binding as a function of regional (i.e. hippocampus vs.
neocortex) and clinical (PART vs. AD) resilience status. To execute these aims, we have developed an
innovative and translationally relevant approach to interrogate mechanisms of tau binding directly in human
synapses isolated from post-mortem autopsy specimen using an array of biochemical techniques. At the
completion of this project, we expect to document previously unappreciated mechanisms that modulate
synaptic tauO binding—a key component of pathological tau spreading. In addition to advancing our
understanding of human tauopathies, I also look forward to sharpening my understanding of human synapse
biology, learning to integrate molecular biology research techniques with clinical neuropathology, and
planning and executing translationally relevant research objectives. A uniquely qualified team of established
research and clinical mentors at The University of Texas Medical Branch have been assembled to effectively
guide my training through this project, bringing together expertise in AD molecular neurobiology (Dr.
Taglialatela), amyloid biochemistry (Dr. Kayed), human synaptic physiology (Dr. Limon), neurology (Dr.
Fang), and neuropathology (Dr. Felicella). The comprehensive training plan outlined herein will provide
essential technical, intellectual, and professional skills to help me achieve my long-term career goals as an
academician and physician-scientist."
10827050,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and other developed countries
in the pediatric population. A pivotal aspect of early ROP is retinal avascularity, which leads to advanced
stages of ROP and pathologic retinal NV. Deficiency in vascularization of ischemic tissue is a major challenge
in this disease condition. Current treatments for ROP are largely focused on later stages of disease
characterized by pathologic pre-retinal neovascularization. These treatments are associated with significant
side effects and do not address the retinal avascularity, which has an impact on the patient’s ultimate visual
function. There is great need for early treatment, directed toward the promotion of “physiologic” retinal
vascularization (i.e., vascularization of the avascular/ischemic retina), which would relieve retinal hypoxia,
leading to resolution of pathologic neovascularization and optimizing visual function. Although
revascularization of ischemic retina (reparative angiogenesis) is a highly desirable objective in ROP,
accomplishing this objective has posed a significant challenge. In this respect, there is a great need for better
understanding of the cellular mechanisms regulating reparative angiogenesis, as well as for treatment
strategies. It has been especially elusive why endothelial cells fail to vascularize the ischemic retina and
instead grows into the preretinal space. In order to fully realize the goal of promoting reparative angiogenesis,
it is critical to better understand how to promote endothelial cells toward revascularizing the ischemic retina,
especially in identifying important angiogenic regulators. We have identified a novel molecular mechanism
regulating the angiogenic phenotype of retinal endothelial cells. This project will examine the functional role of
this angiogenic regulator in endothelial cell activity and dissect mechanisms of its angiogenic regulation. This
project could thereby lead to insights into a new target for treatment and develop therapeutic strategies for
revascularization that could be beneficial for ROP and other ischemic retinal diseases."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains one of the most infectious and deadly pathogens worldwide. Key to
Mtb virulence are Mtb membrane-bound and secreted effector proteins that interact with host proteins to
influence the host response to infection and promote Mtb survival. Mtb has roughly 100 effector proteins, but few
of these effectors have been characterized or directly implicated in Mtb pathogenesis. There is emerging
evidence that many intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved nuclear effector proteins (dubbed
nucleomodulins) that interfere with nuclear gene expression pathways like chromatin remodeling, histone
modification, transcription, and pre-mRNA splicing. The objectives of this proposal are two-fold: to define how
histone methylation changes at innate immune genes over the course of Mtb infection of macrophages, and to
investigate how a putative Mtb nucleomodulin evolved to manipulate host epigenetic control of gene expression.
Mtb secretes a protein called Rv1075c. Preliminary data demonstrates that Rv107c is upregulated early after
Mtb infection, ectopic expression of Rv1075c promotes hyperinduction of genes likes Ifnb1, and expression of
pro-bacterial inflammatory cytokines in dampened by a Rv1075c Mtb strain. Immunopurification of Rv1075c
enriches for multiple components of the mammalian SET1 histone methyltransferase complex (RBBP5, ASH2L,
WDR5), which deposits H3K4me3, a mark associated with transcriptional activation. This proposal is founded
on the hypothesis that Rv1075c interacts with the SET1 complex to alter histone methylation in Mtb-infected
macrophages to promote a specific pro-bacterial gene expression program. Aim 1 of this proposal will implicate
the SET1 histone methyltransferase complex in controlling innate immune gene expression in response to Mtb.
Aim 2 of this proposal will investigate how Rv1075c is secreted and how it traffics to the nucleus and how it
interacts with SET1 complex members. Aim 3 will investigate how Rv1075c expression controls macrophage
gene expression during Mtb infection. Through completion of these aims, this application will provide novel
insights into the role of Rv1075c in chromatin remodeling and broadly advance our understanding of bacterial
virulence mechanisms. It will also provide multiple training opportunities, including mastery of bacterial and
mammalian genetic approaches and the development of expertise working with an important human BSL3
pathogen."

 Pharmaceutical technologies are inherently limited by the synthetic methods available to medicinal
chemists. Novel transformations in organic chemistry have the potential to enhance human well-being through
the prevention of human suffering through pharmaceutical therapies. Modern innovations in synthesis have
shown the ability to furnish new molecular scaffolds, especially through the employment of catalytic methods.
Past efforts in supramolecular catalysis have offered strategies to more traditional methods by enabling
orthogonal selectivity through non-covalent interactions which are imparted via encapsulation. In this way,
supramolecular hosts behave similarly to enzymes, inspiring further study due to the allure of the rate
enhancements offered by nature’s catalysts. Utilizing supramolecular hosts pioneered by the Raymond,
Bergman, and Toste groups, we plan to enable several transformations relevant to the production of
pharmaceuticals. Previous work with these privileged clusters has shown powerful reactivity through the
coencapsulation of two reagents within the host cavity. Trends in these reactions have shown the ability to
enhance the electrophilicity of electrophiles through protonation and increased reactivity from nucleophiles
through p-p stacking interactions. These motifs will be leveraged for various pharmaceutically relevant
transformations, including N-heterocycle reduction and functionalization, regio- and diasteroselective olefin
epoxidation. Through the combination of supramolecular catalysis and Pt catalysis we also hope to provide
methods for an enantioselective C(sp3)-H oxidation of alkanes. These methods all involve the use of widely
available or readily synthesized reagents that may be rapidly constructed into valuable pharmacores for use in
drug discovery investigations with the ultimate goal of improving human health.
 The specific aims in this proposal provide a detailed plan for the production of these potent
technologies. Under the tutelage of Professors Toste, Bergman, and Raymond I will develop these methods
with expert guidance in asymmetric reactivity, physical organic chemistry, and organometallic cluster synthesis.
Conducting this research at the University of California Berkeley provides an optimal environment for both the
success of this project and for my personal and professional development as a researcher. Providing the
tutelage of brilliant faculty, ambitious colleagues, and stunning state-of-the-art facilities, Berkeley offers no limit
to the resources for the practicing scientist."

The constant arms race between viruses and their hosts lead to the evolution of antiviral defense. Recent studies
have revealed that bacteria developed diverse anti-phage defense systems that can be denoted as the
“prokaryotic immune systems”. The well-characterized prokaryotic immune systems include restriction-
modification (R-M) systems, CRISPR-Cas systems, abortive infection systems, and prokaryotic Argonautes.
Mechanistic characterization of these systems has revolutionized biomedical research. For example, R-M
systems provide restriction enzymes as invaluable tools for molecular cloning and genetic engineering while
CRISPR-Cas has revolutionized the genome-editing field. In this proposal, we will focus on characterizing a
novel bacteria immune system with unknown mechanisms. In this system, we have two components: A and B.
A is predicted to have an ATPase domain, while B is predicted to be a nuclease. Our preliminary study showed
that A and B can form a stable and large complex for anti-phage defense. This finding is reminiscent of
inflammasomes, which are large immune complexes that are assembled via the ATPase domain in response to
pathogen infection in higher organisms. We hypothesized that A and B also form large oligomers to combat
phage infection. We will use cutting-edge cryogenic electron microscopy single-particle analysis techniques to
define the structure and assembly mechanisms of the A/B complex and develop biochemical and cellular assays
to characterize the functions of the A/B complex. Our studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of the
assembly and functions of this novel inflammasome-like system in bacteria, which will shed light on the evolution
of inflammasome signaling as well as provide a basis to develop novel tools for biomedical research and disease
diagnosis and treatment."
10826360,"Project Summary/Abstract: Capillary Malformation (CM) is one of the most common vascular malformations.
CM comprises enlarged vessels lined with sprouting endothelial cells (EC) and disorganized mural cells. In
Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), a neurocutaneous disorder, CM occurs in the skin, brain, and eyes. Patients
may suffer from seizures, strokes, glaucoma, and only symptomatic treatment is available. CM is caused by a
somatic mutation in GNAQ, the gene that encodes the a-subunit of the G-protein – Gaq. The GNAQ mutation
– the arginine (R) at the amino acid position of 183 replaced by the glutamine (Q) – is enriched in ECs isolated
from CM in the skin, brain, and choroidal vessels of the eye. To date, little is known about how the R183Q
point mutation in the Gaq activation domain leads to abnormal capillaries. Moreover, nothing is known about
the interactions between the mutant EC and neighboring mural cells surrounding CM vessels. Our preliminary
data suggest that lentiviral transduced human EC expressing the R183Q allele (EC-R183Q) have high levels of
pro-inflammatory markers, a weaker junctional barrier, and exhibit heightened response to laminar shear
stress. Immunostaining of CM tissue sections also reveal disorganization in mural cell environment labeled
with Desmin, Calponin, NG2 and alpha-SMA. Moreover, our histological analyses of CM tissue sections
revealed MRC1pos, LYVE1pos and CD68pos macrophage-like cells surrounding the CM vessels of the brain and
skin suggesting a pro-inflammatory environment. The goal of this fellowship proposal and training plan is to
examine how the EC-R183Q interact with both the mural cells and macrophages. I hypothesize that EC-
R183Q triggers the disorganized assembly of mural cells and subsequent macrophage attraction to the
abnormal vessels. The proposed study will test this hypothesis through the following aims: (1) to identify
paracrine interactions between EC-R183Q and mural cells (2) to identify and characterize mural cell and
macrophage interactions with EC-R183Q in vivo. Completing these aims will provide new insights into the
relationship between EC and the surrounding mural cells and macrophages in the CM. This fellowship training
will provide me with technical, communication, and mentoring skills to leverage my next step to independence.
Working with Drs. Joyce Bischoff and Arin Greene (co-sponsor) at Boston Children’s Hospital will provide me
with an excellent training environment from both the basic science and clinical aspect of the proposed work."

Over the next three years, the Indiana Rapid Response Team (IN RRT) aims to enhance all aspects of
response related to human and animal food emergencies. The overall RRT concept includes steps prior
incidents, such as relationship building with stakeholders, training, preparedness, and surveillance
sampling. During food incidents environmental assessments are conducted, as well as product and/or
environmental sampling. Follow-up actions, include mitigation/control steps, prevention, after-action
reviews, and improvement plans. By offering more specific and advanced response-related trainings and
exercises, the IN RRT will continue to foster preparedness across a network of agencies that stand ready
to respond to human and animal food emergencies and incidents. Specifically, such exercises will help
advance a more robust, scalable, and flexible Incident Command Structure (ICS) that can be used during
small-scale and large-scale events. Staff will be trained in position-specific roles to solidify the ICS along
with working roles and responsibilities. In addition, the Foodborne Illness Working Group will be utilized
to enhance interagency communication and increase capacity. Core capabilities that are currently in
place will be improved, added upon, and strengthened as will relationships within and between
agencies.

sharing, and mitigation actions will aid in reducing and eliminating repeated outbreaks. In post-
response and prevention phases, the IN RRT will address gaps in procedures identified during after-
action reviews related to outbreak and incident responses. The information gathered from the after-
action reviews will guide the development and implementation of an on-going Improvement Plan as
well as any necessary updates to SOPs to allow for greater preparedness for future food emergencies.
The IN RRT is an integral part of the nation's integrated Food Safety System by contributing data to CDCs
NEARS and NORS platforms as well as presenting ideas and findings at national and regional
conferences. As the ability and preparedness of IN RRT is increased, a more rapid and efficient response
to human and animal food emergencies will result, the significance of which will be the reduction of the
scope and duration of outbreaks, thus reducing the burden placed upon Indiana’s public health system.
Throughout the upcoming project period, the IN RRT will continue regular meetings with laboratory and
epidemiological partners as well as nurture relationships with other state agencies, local/county
partners, academia, industry, law enforcement, other states, and the FDA. This increased collaboration
will aid information and skill sharing with the objective of enhanced readiness."
10916524,"The Virginia Rapid Response Team (VA RRT)
Background:
In 2009, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services was awarded a grant by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop strategies to improve food and feed rapid response capabilities
within the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Virginia Rapid Response Team was formed to include
representation from the major food safety agencies operating within the Commonwealth of Virginia as a
multidiscipline team for response to food and animal feed emergencies.
Federal funding also provided many opportunities for continual training for VA RRT core team members
and state response partners. RRT core team members attend FDA HAF2E district meetings, the national
Rapid Response Team meetings and National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) regional
meetings. The VA RRT was able to provide three training events during the previous funding period, to
introduce and exercise the state Food Emergency Response Plan (VA FERP) to state and local emergency
response agencies.
During the previous five-year funding period, the Virginia Rapid Response Team activated to coordinate
multi-agency responses to thirty-nine foodborne outbreaks and adverse event reports and seven emergency
weather events.
Methods:
The VA RRT was activated for these multi-agency outbreaks to facilitate communication between all
partners VDH, FDA Baltimore District Office, Human and Animal Foods 2 East (FDA HAF2E), VDACS,
DCLS and USDA during the outbreak response using a using a modified Incident Command Structure with
the FDA HAF2E Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC). The responses required coordination and
communication with several agency partners and included joint facility inspections, environmental,
ingredient and product sampling. Tests to detect cases matching into the outbreaks and samples collected
by the VA RRT were completed by the state health laboratory, Division of Consolidated Laboratories
(DCLS).
Results:
The development and implementation of the Virginia Rapid Response Team (VA RRT) has greatly
increased cooperation and coordination between the state central offices and local health departments, the
Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) Food, Dairy and Produce Safety
Programs, the VDACS Agriculture Commodities Program, the state health laboratory (DCLS), USDA, the
Virginia Department of Emergency Management, FDA HAF2E and the FDA CORE TEAM. Funding
provided in the RRT cooperative agreement provides team training and collaboration between these groups
to decrease foodborne outbreak investigation response time, increasing the probably of detecting the root
cause of the outbreak and collecting valuable information for outbreak prevention. The VA RRT
collaborated with Virginia Department of Emergency Management to provide two statewide training
seminars to introduce the VA FERP. An intentional contamination tabletop exercise written by the VA
RRT core team and VDEM to implement and test the VA FERP with new agency partners was completed
during the recent funding period."
10934375,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with a high prevalence of inflammation-
associated co-morbidities in people living with HIV (PLWH), even those receiving effective antiretroviral therapy
(ART). Our preliminary data support a model in which the combined insult of AUD and HIV on the gut, specifically
on the microbiota (depletion of the bacteria that produce the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs))
and intestinal barrier integrity, exacerbates inflammation. Our preliminary data using intestinal organoids also
suggest a potential mechanism for AUD-mediated changes in the gut barrier function during HIV: the intestines
of HIV+ individuals have low resilience to alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption caused by high levels of
oxidative stress. Finally, our preliminary data also suggest a potential approach to enhance the integrity of the
intestinal barrier and reduce gut derived inflammation in PLWH with/without AUD; SCFA-promoting prebiotics.
SCFA-promoting prebiotics prevent alcohol-mediated adverse effects on the intestinal barrier and inflammation
by preventing oxidative stress. These prebiotics are safe and decrease gut inflammation in humans.
Together, our data support our central hypothesis that the intestinal resilience to alcohol-mediated disruption
is reduced during HIV infection leading to exaggerated microbial translocation/inflammation, and that SCFA-
promoting prebiotics can enhance the resilience of the gut from HIV+ individuals to alcohol-mediated disruption.
In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that intestines from HIV+ individuals have lower resilience to alcohol-
mediated gut barrier disruption than intestines from HIV-negative controls. Blood, urine, stool, and intestinal
biopsies will be collected from four groups: (i) HIV- AUD-; (ii) HIV- AUD+, (iii) HIV+ ART+ AUD-; and (iv) HIV+
ART+ AUD+. First, we will compare: (a) intestinal barrier integrity, (b) systemic and gut inflammation, immune
activation, and oxidative stress, (c) microbiome and metabolome, and (d) HIV reservoirs. Second, we will
generate Ileal/colonic organoids from the HIV- and HIV+ ART+ individuals and examine their resilience to
alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that SCFA-promoting prebiotics
induce the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms that can enhance the resilience of the intestines
of HIV+ individuals to alcohol-mediated disruption. We will provide 20 HIV+ ART+ (10 AUD- and 10 AUD+)
individuals with commonly used prebiotics fructooligosaccharides (FOS) for 10 days. Stool/blood will be collected
before/after the treatment. First, we will examine the impact of FOS on the microbiome, gut-related metabolites,
and inflammation. Second, we will examine the impact of pre- and post-FOS microbiome/metabolome (filtered
from stool) on the resilience of organoids to alcohol-mediated barrier disruption.
The results of this study can build a foundation for: 1) identifying the mechanisms; and 2) designing strategies
to prevent the development, of AUD-associated co-morbidities during ART+ HIV infection."
10861936,"ABSTRACT
Despite recent major advances in targeted therapy for melanoma, the nearly universal eventual
acquisition of drug resistance remains a major hurdle that prevents durable gains in patient
survival. To address this critical unmet need, we have recently used patient samples and model
systems to identify S6K1 as a critical counter-resistance therapy target that lies at the
downstream convergence point of the MAPK, CDK4/6, and PI3K pathways. Importantly, these
are the primary drivers of both melanomagenesis and of known BRAF and MEK inhibitor
resistance mechanisms, positing S6K1, an understudied drug target, as a potential broad-use
salvage and/or frontline therapy. Our preliminary data is consistent with this hypothesis, as
pharmacological S6K1 inhibition reversed MAPK inhibitor resistance in several drug and genetic
contexts. Our central hypothesis is that understanding the mechanistic basis and clinical
applicability of S6K1 inhibition in melanoma will allow for improved design of next-generation
S6K1 inhibitors and combination therapies, as well as a deeper functional understanding of drug
resistance mechanisms operating through and downstream of S6K1. Specific Aim 1 will focus
on developing S6K1 as a key drug target in the contexts of both drug resistance and tumor
initiation, and its clinical relevance will be interrogated in a series of clinical biopsies. Specific
Aim 2 will determine the oncogenic mechanisms downstream of S6K1, with distinct focuses on
its impact on cell cycle and metabolism. Overall, successful completion of this study will provide
an evidential basis for S6K1 as a promising broad-use therapeutic target, with a mechanistic
underpinning to further refine future designs and uses of pharmacological S6K inhibitors."
10856074,"Summary/Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially lethal disease that lacks pharmacological treatment. Although
vascular inflammation is the initial event leading to AAA formation, aorta rupture due to artery wall weakening
is responsible for the high mortality rate in this silent killer. Aortic wall weakening in AAA is primarily caused
by aorta media degeneration, elastin breakage and impaired adventitia response. The media degeneration is
driven by programmed cell death (e.g., apoptosis and necroptosis) of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC).
However, there are critical knowledge gaps concerning mechanism(s) or key factor(s) governing SMC survival
in aortic wall. Moreover, adventitia thickening due to fibroblastic response is crucial for strengthening aorta
wall and impeding AAA progression. Compromised adventitial responses along with medial degeneration
make the aorta highly vulnerable to rupture. However, it remains largely unknown how the adventitia
fibroblastic response is regulated. Exciting preliminary data indicate that Smad2 is downregulated in both
mouse and human AAA lesions. Smad2 deficiency with SM22α-Cre mice (S2sm22-/-) exacerbates AAA
formation/dissection in both angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion and elastase models. S2sm22-/- aggravates elastin
fragmentation, causes larger aorta dilation and greater SMC loss with less adventitia thickening than wildtype
(WT) ApoE-/- mice in AAA. Importantly, Smad2 deficiency exacerbates SMC necroptosis both in vivo in aorta
media and in vitro in culture SMCs. Moreover, lineage tracing studies indicate that Smad2 deficiency in SMCs
attenuates SMC trans-differentiation to adventitial Sca1 (advSca1) cells and diminishes adventitial fibroblast
proliferation and collagen deposition. These compelling data strongly support a novel hypothesis that SMC-
driven Smad2 mitigates AAA progression by alleviating SMC necroptosis in aorta media while promoting
protective fibroblast response in adventitia. Using primary mouse and human SMCs, in vivo Smad2 SMC-
specific knockout mouse and two AAA models combining with molecular, cellular, histological, and cutting-
edge CUT&RUN sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing analyses, the hypothesis will be tested by two
specific aims: Aim 1 is to determine the impact of Smad2 deficiency on AAA formation/dissection; and Aim 2
is to establish molecular mechanisms by which Smad2 preserves aortic wall integrity essential for hindering
AAA formation/dissection. Successful completion of the proposed studies will establish novel mechanisms
regulating SMC necroptosis and adventitial protective responses, which are likely to advance our understanding
of the AAA progression and dissection and ultimately lead to novel strategies for developing effective
therapeutics to treat AAA/dissection."
10861828,"Articulatory impairments are common in talkers with dysarthria and have been shown to contribute most to
speech intelligibility loss. However, the treatment of articulatory impairments remains challenging; primarily,
because knowledge about articulatory impairment patterns and how they vary across talkers is limited. The
Mayo Clinic dysarthria classification system links neurological conditions to specific, auditory-perceptually
defined dysarthria types with presumably distinct motor impairment patterns. Based on this framework,
prominent textbooks have recommended to specifically target the motor impairments that presumably underlie
each dysarthria type. Such an intervention approach, however, still lacks empirical support and is difficult to
apply to mixed dysarthria types. Based on the rationale that virtually all talkers with dysarthria exhibit imprecise
articulation, impairment-nonspecific behavioral treatments (e.g., loud, clear, slow speech) have gained
popularity and are commonly used as therapeutic interventions for talkers with mild to moderate dysarthria
regardless of their underlying disease. This rationale, however, ignores the fact that a variety of articulatory
behaviors can yield the same auditory-perceptual consequences. Indeed, highly heterogeneous articulatory
performance patterns have been reported across and within disease types and motivated us to test the
feasibility of a new, taxonomic (data-driven) approach to dysarthria classification based on speech kinematic
measures. Our pilot work on a cohort of 28 talkers with Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) revealed six dysarthria subgroups with unique articulatory impairment
profiles addressing temporal and spatial characteristics of vocal tract adjustments as well as labial coupling.
Three disease-dominant subgroups and well as three mixed-disease subgroups were identified. This proposed
project seeks to expand upon these preliminary findings. In Specific Aim 1, we will classify the articulatory
performance profiles of 160 talkers with varying underlying disease types [PD, ALS, MS, Huntington's disease
(HD)]. To allow for a clinical interpretation of the kinematic findings, articulatory performance of talkers with
dysarthria will be referenced to age- and sex-specific control groups. We will also determine which kinematic
measures differentiate talkers with dysarthria and if disease-type varies systematically across articulation-
based dysarthria subgroups. To ensure a rapid translation of our kinematic-based classification approach into
clinical practice we will determine how perceptual-based clinical ratings of articulatory performance map onto
findings of kinematic measures (Specific Aim 2). Raters will judge the articulatory performance of the same 160
talkers with dysarthria using auditory- and visual-perceptual ratings scales. Study outcomes will advance the
field's understanding of articulatory impairment patterns and how they vary in dysarthria. Findings are critical to
elucidate subgroup-specific articulatory mechanisms of intelligibility loss and recovery. Ultimately, this work will
facilitate personalized dysarthria management and the development of new, impairment-specific interventions."
10861861,"Project Summary
People living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere have weight gain with integrase strand transfer
inhibitor (INSTI)-based treatment regimens. Weight gain with Dolutegravir (DTG), an INSTI, has also been
observed in postpartum women although how DTG-regimens affects postpartum weight is not known.
Understanding the impact of maternal DTG-regimens on the physiology of postpartum body weight regulation
has clinical significance as postpartum weight retention is known to increase future maternal risk of overweight,
obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCD). With the ongoing scale-up of DTG in Sub-Saharan Africa for
HIV management, our understanding of how DTG regimens affect the physiology of postpartum body weight
regulation could help identify potential interventions to reduce future overweight and NCD risk in this population.
To address this research gap, in aim 1 of this study, we propose to initiate a prospective cohort study in Uganda
of postpartum women with HIV on DTG and non-DTG based regimens, as well as a control group without HIV.
In this cohort, we will study how DTG-regimens, as compared to non-DTG regimens or women without HIV,
affects the macro-phenotype (i.e. energy intake and expenditure) and micro-phenotype (i.e. metabolic profile) of
the physiology of body weight regulation in postpartum women. Metabolic profile includes assessment of
orexigenic and anti-orexigenic peptides and hormones, short-chain fatty acids, and unbiased `omics'
approaches. Aim 2 of this study will leverage the postpartum cohort to also follow their breastfeeding infants for
similar investigations of how maternal DTG-regimens affects infant energy intake, expenditure and metabolic
profile. Further, by comparing to infants born to mothers without HIV, our study will help us understand the
physiology of growth deficits observed in infants born to mothers with HIV (and on non-DTG regimens), one of
the most clinically significant outcomes in this population; and to understand whether DTG impacts are similar
to other ARTs. Our overall hypothesis is that maternal DTG-based ART regimens will result in increased maternal
and infant energy intake, with increased appetite and a dysregulated metabolic profile. Through these two aims,
we address an urgent need to understand how maternal HIV and DTG impacts the physiology of body weight
regulation in postpartum women and their HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants. These maternal-infant
populations have a unique physiological profile with increased energy demands on the lactating mother and
breastfeeding infant to sustain growth. In addition to improving our understanding of the physiology, our detailed
metabolic assessments will further help identify potential therapeutics (e.g. related to intake/appetite,
expenditure, or metabolic pathways) for management of postpartum weight and infant growth in maternal-infant
populations with HIV."
10855414,"Summary:
 Many cellular processes are triggered by ligands such as ions, small molecules, peptides/proteins (e.g.,
hormones, cytokines), and viruses. However, rapid cellular adaptations that follow stimulation often fall in the
blind spot of microscopy: limitations of spatiotemporal resolution prevent detailed exploration of nanoscale
cellular dynamics. Motivated by the need to address this technological barrier, we aim to develop a biophysical
tool that will allow stimulating biological cells with various chemical or biological compounds and then freezing
these cells for subsequent analysis by high-resolution microscopy. We refer to this technique by an acronym:
Vitrification Experiment Resolved In Time After Stimulation (VERITAS).
 Broad utility of this new method in biological research is envisioned, including investigations concerning
the dynamics of cellular membranes and membrane-protein interactions, the dynamics of protein-protein and
protein-nucleic acid interactions, and the dynamics of post-translational modifications. In addition, the need for
the proposed instrument is supported by a user survey that we conducted.
 Our approach is conceptually innovative because it will permit imaging of nanoscale cellular dynamics
with millisecond temporal resolution and because it establishes a connection between time-resolved
cryo-vitrification and super-resolved fluorescence imaging. The approach is methodologically innovative
because it will feature millisecond-level control over the stimulation-to-vitrification time, and reliable chemical
stimulation of cells. Moreover, we will develop new protocols to integrate cryo-vitrification and nanoscale optical
microscopy, and to validate the technique against live optical microscopy measurements.
 In Aim 1, we will develop the time-resolved cryo-vitrification instrument by first achieving
millisecond-level control over the stimulation-to-vitrification time and then developing a method for precise
chemical stimulation of the sample. This work will complete our instrumentation development efforts and allow
proceeding to the validation stage.
 In Aim 2, we will develop post-vitrification imaging and data analysis protocols and use these
procedures to validate VERITAS using two representative biological systems. These studies will test the
boundaries of utility of the method because they use different types of cells and different imaging methods.
 Based on our preliminary data, the project is feasible. Our efforts will establish the groundwork for future
biological studies using the proposed time-resolved cryo-vitrification technique. We suggest that this is
significant because time-resolved cryo-vitrification will provide detailed molecular and structural understanding
of how cells respond to a variety of stimuli of relevance both to normal physiology and disease. Furthermore,
the proposal includes detailed plans for technology dissemination via direct collaboration, open-source sharing,
commercialization, and integration with local instrumentation facilities."

10858929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Exaggerated smooth muscle contraction is one of the hallmarks of asthma. To transmit enough force to
deform the airway lumen, smooth muscle depends on firm tethering to the surrounding tissue. These tethering
pathways play critical roles in connecting intracellular actin filaments to the extracellular matrix and adjacent
cells to efficiently transmit force. We have shown that targeting specific tethering proteins in the integrin and
cadherin families have functional effects on force transmission in smooth muscle without altering actin-myosin
crossbridge cycling. We have further shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines enhance the activity of tethering
proteins to promote adhesion.
 The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms regulating force transmission by
tethering proteins in airway smooth muscle. The overall objectives of this application are to explore how the
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-13 and IL-17A regulate activation of β1 integrins and to apply advanced imaging
methods to analyze cell-matrix and cell-cell tethering in tissue. The central hypothesis is that cytokine-
mediated integrin activation enhances force transmission in the airways, and that cell-matrix and cell-cell
tethering pathways have a significant impact on the exaggerated airway narrowing that characterizes asthma.
These hypotheses are built on data demonstrating that (1) integrin α5β1, integrin α2β1, and cadherin-11 all
regulate force transmission in disease-relevant models of asthma; (2) mitigation of exaggerated force
transmission does not alter classical actin-myosin pathways; (3) integrins are differentially activated in airway
samples from asthmatics; (4) IL-13 and IL-17A activate β1 integrins in a manner dependent on Rho kinase;
and (5) integrin activation has functional effects on force transmission even in the absence of cytokine.
 These hypotheses will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Evaluate the mechanisms by which pro-
inflammatory stimuli regulate β1 integrin activation; and 2) Apply advanced imaging tools to analyze cell-matrix
and cell-cell tethering in tissue. Aim 1 will examine the time course and conformation states of integrins during
cytokine-mediated activation, quantify differences in integrin activation from airway biopsies of asthmatics and
controls, and determine signaling mechanisms by which cytokines regulate Rho kinase, and Rho kinase
regulates physiologic integrin activation. Aim 2 will use two-photon microscopy and confetti mice to quantify
changes intercellular tethering induced by ligation of cadherin-11, explore dynamic interplay between cell-
matrix and cell-cell tethering pathways, as well as investigate the influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines on
cadherin-mediated tethering. The proposed research is innovative because it explores two novel ideas (force
transmission pathways and their activation by inflammatory stimuli) using cutting-edge tools. The prosed
research is significant because it highlights an underappreciated contributor to asthma and lays the
foundational mechanistic studies to one day identify novel therapeutics."
10824085,"The first ever International Indigenous Dementia Research Network Annual Conference series addresses a
critical need to advance knowledge, discovery, and scientific collaboration in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) in Indigenous populations. American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Native Hawaiians and
Pacific Islanders, First Nations in Canada, and Indigenous peoples in Australia all experience a significant
health equity gap reflected in the rates of ADRD. Moreover, these racial disparities are expected to expand in
all Indigenous populations; for example, the prevalence of ADRD in AI/AN populations is projected to increase
almost 6-fold by 2060. Indigenous ADRD research is an emerging field, and the number of studies is
increasing. In the US, Indigenous people have been referred to as an invisible minority in relation to ADRD
research, but there is a core group of researchers working with Indigenous populations on dementia all over
the world. These scientists utilize community-based and Indigenous research methods to address dementia
specific topics such as caregiving, screening and diagnosis, and culturally safe care. Unfortunately, little
attention is given to these studies in mainstream conferences and knowledge exchange has been limited.
There is currently no equitable venue for academics and communities studying dementia in Indigenous
populations to come together and share scientific and Indigenous knowledge in a way that is comparable to
other disciplines or disease focused research areas. The consequence of this structural inequity is slow
progression of the field and researchers working in isolation, which leads to inadequately informed health care
and poor policy preparation for the growing prevalence of dementia in Indigenous communities.
To remedy this situation, we will implement a 5-year conference series focused on ADRD in Indigenous
populations by bringing together current members of the International Indigenous Dementia Research Network
(IIDRN) along with other leading scientists, policy makers, Indigenous Elders, Indigenous communities and
organizations, people living with dementia, and trainees to exchange information on current research and
advancements concerning ADRD in the context of health equity. The IIDRN is a network of over 100 members
from seven countries. Recognizing that ADRD in Indigenous populations is still a developing field of research,
these annual conferences will build and support research capacity, facilitate the development of national and
international research collaborations, and sustain scientific advancement in Indigenous dementia research.
Key components will include featured research sessions, keynote speakers, Elder involvement, mentorship,
and volunteered papers and posters. Our long-term goal is to create an expanded, sustainable, supportive,
worldwide network of scholars committed to knowledge exchange and collaboration to advance research,
knowledge, and mentorship in community-based, culturally appropriate ADRD research with Indigenous
populations."
10827372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Food allergies have been increasing at an exponential rate since 1960 for unknown reasons. We hypothesized
that modern xenobiotics that were widely introduced into the modern environment may be acting as allergic
adjuvants to break oral tolerance and cause allergy. This proposal will explore how certain non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sufficient for oral allergic sensitization. The proposal will test the overarching
hypothesis that adjuvant NSAIDs are activators of the xenobiotic sensor, Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (NRF2), in intestinal epithelial cells, which release IL33 to initiate the allergic response to coincident
food antigen. We will use a combination of genetic, pharmacologic, and mass spectroscopic approaches to
rigorously test this hypothesis. If confirmed, our work has major implications for why allergies are increasing
and could lead to new public health policies and novel therapies for the management of allergic diseases."
10827373,"Extensive drug resistance (XDR) in Gram-negative bacteria is widely recognized as a top priority public health issue. Colistin is often the only viable treatment option for infections caused by such pathogens, but morbidity and mortality are substantial even with colistin treatment. Furthermore, clinical use of colistin has led to the emergence of colistin-resistant strains. We have shown, for Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that colistin resistance arises during therapy primarily due to modifications of lipid A, the membrane anchor component of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide, with amino-containing moieties such as aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine, and alternatively galactosamine, primarily mediated through specific mutations in the PmrAB or PhoPQ two-component regulatory systems. We have also demonstrated that rapid profiling of lipid A can serve as a reliable method to predict colistin susceptibility and resistance, an important advance given challenges associated with conventional susceptibility testing of colistin. Meanwhile, pharmacokinetic-based dosing of colistin has been widely implemented in the hope of improving its efficacy but without tangible clinical benefits so far. Our previous investigations have deepened understanding of colistin resistance mechanisms and their implications in A. baumannii, but also identified new knowledge gaps. These include wide ranges of resistance observed in the presence of lipid A modifications with colistin MICs ranging from 4 mg/L to >256 mg/L, difficulties with defining colistin MICs in some strains, and apparent disconnect between in vitro activity and suboptimal clinical outcome, especially among patients with pneumonia. Importantly, in vitro MICs may not always reflect in vivo efficacy of colistin due to remodeling of lipid A that occurs in the host, with or without selective pressure from colistin, and this may account for clinical failure in patients who are treated with ostensibly appropriate doses of colistin. This project aims to address these issues by quantifying resistance-conferring amino-containing lipid A moieties in clinical strains with a wide range of MICs among XDR Gram-negative pathogens, elucidating lipid A remodeling of XDR Gram-negative bacteria in the BAL fluid and the lung tissue of mice with pneumonia, determining lipid A modification directly in BAL specimens of patients infected with XDR Gram-negative pathogens, and correlating the ability of colistin adjuvants to abrogate colistin resistance to levels of Lipid A modification. The proposal therefore advances our understanding of colistin resistance across various XDR pathogens, fills a critical knowledge gap that lies between in vitro and in vivo resistance to colistin, and explores novel colistin adjuvants in abrogating lipid A modifications and colistin resistance. This comprehensive effort will be realized by close and ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration representing clinical microbiology, glycolipidomics, and synthetic chemistry."

Effective medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is needed to stem the alarming increase in Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
related morbidity and mortality in Benin, a French sub-Saharan African (SSA) country, where diabetes
prevalence has quadrupled from 3% to 12.4% in the last decade, reaching 22% in some areas. The impact of
the disease reaches beyond those living with the condition to their families, society, and the healthcare system,
warranting strategic efforts to reduce its burden. Following a diet consistent with MNT guidelines is well-
documented to help people with T2D achieve better glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular risks and prevent
complications. However, despite these benefits, low adherence to dietary recommendations is consistently
reported. The reasons include lack of nutrition knowledge, difficulty translating recommendations to practice,
cultural acceptability of the diet, and access to healthy foods. Thus, culturally appropriate dietary
recommendations based on locally available and accepted foods through guided counseling are key to
improving dietary adherence rates among T2D patients in the country. The purpose of this International
Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to empower Dr. Halimatou Alaofè to develop a research
program that integrates innovative approaches to nutrition care delivery to optimize diabetes control in low-
income African populations. To achieve this goal, mentorship and training in this award are proposed to
support: 1) additional training in menu planning and recipe development, social and behavioral sciences, and
research methodologies; 2) protected time to conduct the planned patient-oriented research; and 3) the
collection and publication of preliminary data to facilitate the next steps in the research program. Under the
mentorship of Drs. John Ehiri and Waliou Amoussa Hounkpatin, as well as co-mentors and collaborators from
the US and Benin, Dr. Alaofè plans to 1) adapt an existing MNT intervention that combines a 4-week local food
menu plan based on the 4A framework (adequacy, acceptability, accessibility, and availability of foods) with
individual counseling to meet the Benin nutrition therapy guidelines for T2D patients; 2) develop SmartMenu, a
culturally tailored MNT for T2D patients using codesign methods; and 3) assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and preliminary efficacy of SmartMenu for Benin patients with T2D. The anticipated outcome of this study is
high-quality pilot data that will serve as the foundation for an R01 application to conduct a larger pragmatic
randomized controlled trial to assess the intervention’s cost-effectiveness and sustainability. We hypothesize
that a culturally tailored MNT combining individual counseling and menu plans that address dietary adherence
barriers through the 4A framework will facilitate patient acceptance and adherence to MNT guidelines. If
successful, this model could significantly improve nutrition care in resource-limited settings. The training and
research activities delineated complement the candidate’s background in nutrition education and diet
modification and will position her to contribute substantially to nutrition care delivery system change."

Research: The proposed research will investigate the neural representation of abstract sequences. Abstract
sequences are defined by higher-order patterns that generalize across sensory stimuli (e.g., AAAB, &&&*).
Deficits in sequence processing arise in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder (OCD), Parkinson’s disease, and frontal lobe dysfunction. The source of these deficits is difficult to
determine, as the neural mechanisms behind them remain poorly understood. Previous work suggests that
lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) contributes to sequence processing, but the neural representation of abstract
sequences has not been investigated. The proposed studies address this knowledge gap. I focus on two
questions: whether sequence representations are abstract, and whether sequential behavior requires multiple
neural subpopulations to facilitate flexible coding. I approach these questions using two complementary
methods: neural recording in nonhuman primates and modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In Aim
1, I will use fMRI-guided neural recording to test the hypothesis that sequence representation in macaque LPFC
is independent of stimulus identity, leading to generalizability across stimuli and task contexts. In Aim 2, I will
use low-rank RNNs to test whether sequence monitoring requires more neuronal subpopulations than a non-
sequential delayed-match to sample task, a signature of flexible stimulus-response mapping.
These studies will expand our knowledge of abstract sequence representation. Moreover, the results serve as a
case study to understand two key features of generalization: representational stability and implementational
flexibility. In combination with other work from our group, the data from this study will create a bridge between
primate electrophysiology, primate fMRI, and human fMRI, informing the development of cross-species models
of human disease.
Environment & Training: My environment is ideally suited for the proposed training. Drawing on their expertise,
my Sponsor and Co-Sponsor will train me in multi-electrode recording, analysis of large neural datasets, and
computational modeling using RNNs. Furthermore, my Sponsor leads one of the few labs conducting fMRI
experiments in awake monkeys, giving us the unique ability to functionally target regions of interest for neural
recording. The collaborative research community, research facilities, and computational resources at Brown
further support my proposed training. In addition to my research, my training will include workshops in neural
analysis and modeling, participation in scientific meetings, professional development, and training in scientific
communication, mentorship, and responsible conduct in research. The proposed training will provide ideal
preparation for my career goal of combining computational and systems neuroscience to study generalization in
my own lab."
10824796,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) catalyzes the interconversion of glucose-1 phosphate (Glc-1P) and glucose-6
phosphate (Glc-6P) and therefore, it plays a fundamental role in glycolysis, glycogenesis, and glycogenolysis.
Consequently, inherited deficiency of PGM1 in humans has previously been identified as Glycogen Storage Disorder
(GSD) Type 14, but has lately been revealed as a Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) with mixed type I and
type II glycosylation defects. The liver, the skeletomuscular, endocrine and coagulation systems all get involved over
time, but the most life-threatening complication is the early onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, we
discovered that oral D-galactose supplementation improved serum transferrin hypoglycosylation, liver function, endocrine
abnormalities, and reduces frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, but does not alleviate the fatal cardiomyopathy and most
muscle symptoms. To study the pathobiology of cardiac disease in PGM1-CDG patients, we constructed cardiomyocyte-
specific conditional Pgm2 (mouse ortholog of human PGM1) knockout mice (Pgm2 cKO) mice. Using
echocardiography, we corroborated a DCM phenotype with significantly reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular
dilation similar to those seen in PGM1-CDG patients. Ultrastructural analysis revealed Z-disk disarray,
swollen/fragmented mitochondria and macroscopic thickening in the heart of a PGM1-CDG patient. Preliminary
transcriptomic analysis of hearts from Pgm2 cKO mice demonstrates a gene signature of DCM. Assessing the
glycoproteomic profile of left ventricular tissue of Pgm2 cKO mice, our group showed significant glycosylation defects in
sarcolemmal proteins including Laminin-211 (Merosin), sarcoglycans and biglycan. Collectively, not only does our
mouse model recapitulate the cardiac phenotypes of PGM1-CDG patients, but our characterization to-date also supports
the overarching hypothesis that altered glycosylation alone cannot fully explain the pathobiology of cardiac symptoms in
PGM1-CDG patients as other biochemical and metabolic disturbances may also contribute. To test this hypothesis, we
will (1) examine for altered energy metabolism, and (2) clarify the role played by aberrant glycosylation of sarcolemmal
proteins in the DCM development in the Pgm2 cKO mice. Lastly, we will test the therapeutic potential of PGM1 gene
replacement in the Pgm2 cKO mice by assessing whether PGM1 augmentation will restore the energetic deficit and
reverse Lamnin-211 glycosylation abnormalities resulting in improved cardiac function and survival in Pgm2
cKO mice."

PI: Himabindu Vidula, MD, MS
University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY
A growing number of advanced heart failure patients are supported by a continuous-flow (CF) left ventricular
assist device (LVAD) around the world, but the optimal blood pressure (BP) range for patients on CF-LVAD
support has yet to be fully characterized. Previous studies of patients with older LVAD technology have
suggested that elevated BP is associated with adverse outcomes, including stroke and mortality. However, the
thresholds for maximal and minimal BP for patients supported by contemporary centrifugal flow pumps, such as
the HeartMate 3 (HM3) LVAD, are largely based on expert consensus. In addition, limited data exist regarding
the lower limit for BP control and BP goals for women, Blacks, and patients with right heart failure (RHF). Finally,
the optimal anti-hypertensive medication regimen for LVAD patients is not well defined.
 A recent study from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
(INTERMACS) suggested that both low and very high BP are associated with increased mortality in CF-LVAD
patients, but these retrospective analyses were limited by the availability of BP measurements only at fixed
timepoints unrelated to the time of the adverse event. Our preliminary data from the University of Rochester
Database, employing time-dependent analysis of 66,618 non-invasive BP measurements in 310 CF-LVAD
patients, demonstrate that maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 80 mmHg is associated with
increased risk of stroke or death during the first year after LVAD implantation. Furthermore, our findings
suggest a sex and racial difference in optimal BP thresholds.
 The association of BP and stroke or death has not been previously studied in a prospective study of
HM3 LVAD patients and accordingly BP guidelines in this population are not well defined. We propose a
prospective study of 200 newly implanted HM3 LVAD outpatients at 4 different LVAD implantation centers.
Following index discharge, patients will measure their BP at home 3 days a week for a 6-month period with a
Doppler ultrasound in addition to a standardized protocol of weekly home BP measurements and in-clinic BP
assessment every 3 months throughout follow-up. BP will be assessed as a time-dependent covariate for the
endpoint of stroke or death. We will evaluate the following specific aims: Specific aim #1 is to validate our
findings regarding the association of low BP and the risk of stroke or death and to identify appropriate BP
thresholds in HM3 LVAD patients. Specific aim #2 is to determine the optimal BP range in the following
subgroups: 1) women as compared to men; 2) Black vs. White; and 3) patients with RHF as compared to
patients without RHF. Specific aim #3 is to evaluate the interaction of anti-hypertensive medication use with BP
to identify the optimal medical regimen for LVAD patients. Findings from this study, using novel modalities of
home BP monitoring with a prespecified follow-up protocol, have important implications for the prevention of
death and stroke in LVAD patients and will be used to guide management in this growing population."
10823878,"Abstract
 It is now widely appreciated that uncontrolled inflammation is a unifying component in many widespread
diseases, including chronic lung disease. Inhalational exposure to respirable particulate matter can be an
important precipitant or exacerbant of lung inflammation. From our earlier results, the resolution of
inflammation is known today as an active process. There are several new families of specialized pro-resolving
mediators (SPMs) identified and characterized in acute inflammation. These protective mediators are
enzymatically produced and are agonists at specific receptors transducing cell type specific functional
responses critical in tissue resolution. Resolution programs of the inflammatory response are essentially
uncharted scientific terrain in environmental health and medicine. Fundamental information is critically needed
on the impact of environmental agents within the resolution response and whether they perturb resolution to
trigger chronic inflammatory responses and susceptibility to allergen induced asthma. Here, the laboratories of
Bruce Levy, Charles Serhan, Phil Demokritou, and Adam Haber collaborate and propose an innovative
proposal focusing on elucidating the impact of inhaled potentially hazardous traffic emitted ultrafine particles
(UFPs) on the new resolution programs that govern pro-resolving cellular and molecular mechanisms and
tissue catabasis in its return to homeostasis. Failed resolution or its disruption can lead to sustained lung
inflammation and enhanced susceptibility to allergen induced asthma.
 This proposal will test an innovative hypothesis, namely that exposure to traffic-emitted UFPs disrupts
airway resolution mechanisms associated with allergic airway responses in part via changes in
specialized pro-resolving mediator production and action; and that delivering SPMs using a novel
nanocarrier platform can protect from UFP-initiated disruption of endogenous resolution mechanisms.
 To test this hypothesis, an interdisciplinary team of scientists was assembled with expertise in environmental
health and particle health effect studies (Demokritou), computational biology (Haber), asthma, lung inflammation
and its resolution (Levy) and SPMs, SPM receptors and resolution (Serhan) to pursue the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Collect and physicochemically characterize traffic emitted UFPs in urban Boston,
Aim 2. Determine the impact of traffic emitted UFPs on the resolution of house dust mite (HDM) evoked allergic
airway responses, and
Aim 3. Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms for UFP disrupted resolution of inflammation and
establish an SPM delivery system to activate catabasis.
 These innovative and timely studies will establish the impact of environmental UFPs on endogenous resolution
programs in lung inflammation and lay the groundwork for new therapeutic approaches with resolution agonists
that promote active resolution of inflammation in our fight against environmental insults."

The mammalian gut harbors complex communities of microbes that interact and compete with each other while
also influencing the physiology of the host. Discerning the mechanisms by which major members of these
microbial communities colonize the gut is a fundamentally important research goal. One major member is the
gut bacterium Phocaeicola vulgatus (Pvu), a gram-negative anaerobe and one of the most abundant bacterial
species found in the gut of humans and other mammals. Pvu has been associated with inflammatory bowel
disease and several metabolic disorders, and can also infiltrate and colonize established gut microbial
communities following a single introduction. However, there is a gap in understanding of the molecular tools that
Pvu deploys to colonize and invade established niches in the gut. Our long-term goal is to understand what
makes Pvu such an unusually efficient colonizer of the mammalian gut. Our preliminary studies have identified
an operon specific to the Phocaeicola genus that is required for fitness within the mouse gut in a manner strongly
dependent on microbial competition, but the specific functions of the genes in that operon remain unknown. I will
address this gap by defining the requirement for the genes in this operon on Pvu physiology in vitro and on in
vivo gut colonization amidst competition with other microbes. This will be accomplished through in vitro studies
involving tagging proteins encoded in the operon for immunohistochemistry, lipid binding assays, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing. Additionally, in vivo studies using germ-free and specific-pathogen free mice
will be performed to understand how the specific genes in the operon influence Pvu's colonization efficiency and
biogeography in the gut. The expected outcomes of these studies include identification of new mechanisms used
by Pvu to effectively colonize the mammalian gut as well as fundamental new insights into Pvu physiology. These
results will vertically advance the field by providing new understanding of Pvu's colonization strategies which
could eventually lead to the development of new probiotic platforms and strategies for controlling gut microbiome
composition in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders."
10823958,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Metastasis is the major cause of mortality in cancer patients and accounts for about 90% of cancer
deaths, which has not changed in the past 50 years. This indicates a significant need for further study of
metastasis pathways to find novel druggable targets. Our lab studies Ewing sarcoma (ES), which is an
aggressive childhood cancer that occurs in the bones or soft tissue. The five-year survival rate for Ewing sarcoma
patients diagnosed with metastatic disease is still only 25% making ES a good model to use for metastasis study.
To discover genes whose activation leads to increased metastasis, a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 transcriptional
activation screen was performed in a zebrafish xenograft model. The gene INAFM2 was chosen for further study
and was overexpressed in six different cancer cell lines (four ES, one hepatocellular carcinoma, and one stomach
adenocarcinoma). Overexpression of INAFM2 caused increased cell migration and chemotaxis in vitro, and
increased metastasis in zebrafish xenografts. INAFM2 knockdown in four cancer cell lines (two ES, one clear
cell renal cell carcinoma, and one stomach adenocarcinoma) decreased chemotaxis and rescue of INAFM2
expression restored the cells’ ability to migrate. Analysis of patient tumor RNA sequencing data from many
different types of cancers revealed correlations between INAFM2 expression and both an increased metastatic
phenotype and poor patient survival. This provides strong evidence for a substantial role of INAFM2 in cancer
metastasis. However, there is no information currently available about the human INAFM2 protein. This grant
aims to address the gap in knowledge for this novel protein by pursuing the following two specific aims:
The first major aim of this proposal is to discern the molecular pathways that mediate the role of INAFM2 in
promoting metastasis using in vitro and in vivo models. To determine the mechanism underlying INAFM2’s
metastasis-promoting function, I performed RNA sequencing on ES cells following overexpression or knockdown
of INAFM2, which revealed significant enrichment in the MAPK and Wnt pathways among others. I will study
these pathways in vitro and in vivo by using the INAFM2 overexpression and knockdown cell lines that I already
generated. The second major aim of this proposal is to discover and characterize the functional significance of
the direct protein binding partners and post-translational modifications (PTMs) for INAFM2. I will perform
proximity-dependent biotinylation and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify binding partners and use tandem
MS/MS to identify glycosylation and phosphorylation sites on INAFM2. Overall, these two aims will fully
confirm the novel protein INAFM2’s role in cancer metastasis and determine its mechanism of function,
potentially revealing therapeutic vulnerabilities for design of future drug therapies."

Metabolism and gene expression lie at the heart of most, if not all, biological processes and both
can go awry in a plethora of human diseases. Metabolic changes affect gene expression and vice
versa. While the interplay between metabolism and gene expression has been studied at the level
of individual genes and pathways, many questions remain unexplored, especially at the systems,
or network, level. The central question underlying this proposal is: How, where and why does
transcription control metabolism and vice versa? Several key questions and challenges pertaining
to this overarching question will be addressed using the nematode C. elegans as a whole animal
model system. We will employ genetic screens, gene expression profiling and metabolomics to
answer key questions at different levels of resolution: from the network level, to the pathway level,
the circuitry/molecular level. This enables us gain both broad, systems-level as well as deep
mechanistic insights into the metabolic control of gene expression and the transcriptional control
of metabolism."
10827467,"Dynamics of the cellular interactome: Abstract;
Through natural selection, protein conformations, interactions and their dynamics inside cells have been
shaped through time to give rise to function needed to sustain life. The set of these intra- and inter-molecular
protein interactions constitute the interactome which defines fundamental functional landscapes that exists
inside living cells. Because selection processes operate within the crowded intra-cellular environment, these
highly evolved interactome networks and the ability to map and visualize them do not exist outside cells. To
overcome barriers and gain insight on cellular interactomes, our lab is developing novel in vivo chemical cross-
linking molecules referred to as Protein Interaction Reporter (PIR) technologies and new mass spectrometry
methods. These developments have provided the initial quantitative in vivo insights on interactomes in live
cells. In this project, we propose to further advance and apply Protein Interaction Reporter (PIR) technologies
together with improvements in accurate mass measurement capabilities that are possible with mass
spectrometry array technologies to gain deeper insight on the cellular interactome. The primary goal driving
our technology advancement is to better understand how interactome dynamics shape functional landscapes
inside cells. Questions we will address include: how are interactome changes among multiple related cellular
phenotypes associated; how do cellular treatments with drugs cause interactome dynamics that affect
pharmacological outcome. Finally, based on our discoveries of interactome changes with Hsp90 inhibitors that
induce heat shock response, we will investigate interactome dynamics during heat and other applied stresses
to reveal which if any inhibitor-induced interactome charges are common to cellular heat shock response
signaling. These efforts may reveal interactome changes that are critical to heat shock response that currently
limit utility of many potent Hsp90 inhibitors."

Brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming increasingly
used in clinical practice. In up to 25% of MRI scans, an incidental brain abnormality is identified. The list of
potential etiologies for these findings is vast and can include benign conditions such as inflammatory or
developmental processes or could also include neoplastic entities such as malignant gliomas. Approximately
17,000 individuals each year are diagnosed with a malignant glioma in the United States and the nearly of
these patients will succumb to their disease. Therefore, the need to reliably and quickly distinguish a neoplastic
from a non-neoplastic condition is of significant importance. Unfortunately, currently there are no clinically
available biomarkers for CNS malignancies. Correctly identifying these abnormalities as non-malignant is
important because such patients rarely benefit from surgical biopsy and can almost always be managed non-
operatively. And a diagnosis other than CNS malignancy can alleviate much of the anxiety experienced by
patients without cancer after imaging. In contrast, patients with cancer could benefit from correct diagnosis by
spurring immediate consultation with appropriate neurosurgical and oncology specialists. As a result, there is
an pressing and urgent need for more sensitive and specific tumor biomarkers in neuro-oncology.
We and others have shown that most cancers shed cell free molecules of tumor derived DNA into the
circulation and that these molecules can be quantified as a measure of disease burden. Brain tumors are the
exception to the rule and rarely shed detectable levels DNA into the bloodstream. However, we have
provocative data to suggest that malignant gliomas shed cell free molecules of tumor derived DNA into the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-tDNA). We have developed a robust multi-omic technology, CSF-TumorDx, that can
sensitively and specifically detect trace quantities of CSF-tDNA from 1-2 ml of CSF. In this Fast-Track
application we will i) establish pre-analytic quality control procedures, ii) determine the analytical sensitivity and
specificity of CSF-TumorDx and iii) determine the clinical validity of CSF-TumorDx.
At the completion of this grant, Belay Diagnostics will be poised to commercialize the first multi-omic molecular
diagnostic for primary brain cancers in a CLIA setting. This could have an immediate impact on the thousands
of individuals facing diagnostic uncertainty from a brain lesion identified on imaging."
10823718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The developing embryo has the remarkable ability to buffer insults, ensuring normal development in the face of
genetic and environmental influences. But when these insults exceed a disease threshold - birth defects can
result. Our goal is to elucidate how these buffering systems mediate the interplay between genes and
environment and if disruption of these buffering systems contributes to structural birth defects in genetic
syndromes. Resistance to perturbations is known as developmental robustness, and miRNA-mediated
negative feedback loops potentially play critical roles in buffering genetic and environmental insults. Disruption
of miRNAs results in increased sensitivity to environmental factors in model organisms; yet, whether the
miRNA-mediated buffering mechanisms play a role in birth defects remains unknown.
This proposal will investigate whether defective miRNA-mediated buffering drives the phenotypic variability in
22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). 22q11DS is the most common deletion syndrome in humans, with
variable features independent of the size of the deletion. It is well accepted that variability is due to the
influence of genetic and environmental modifiers, but the identity of these factors still needs to be discovered.
Preliminary data indicate that mouse models of 22q11DS exhibit abnormal vitamin A/Retinoic acid signaling
regulation, and dietary supplementation of the maternal diet with vitamin A (within recommended levels for
pregnancy) is a modifier of outflow tract (OFT) defects in a mouse model of 22q11DS. Furthermore, Dgcr8 is
deleted in 22q11DS. Due to its essential role in synthesizing mature miRNAs, Dgcr8 is an exciting but
unexplored candidate for mediating abnormal buffering of signal transduction pathways in 22q11DS.
This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that maternal dietary intake of vitamin A is an important modifier of
OFT defects in 22q11DS, potentiated by the altered capacity of the 22q11DS embryo to buffer changes in
vitamin A intake. We propose that reduced buffering capacity transforms benign vitamin A exposures into
teratogenic doses by failing to rapidly engage miRNA-mediated negative feedback mechanisms to buffer
retinoic acid signaling. Moreover, Tbx1 is deleted in 22q11DS and implicated in congenital heart defects
(CHDs) in 22q11DS. However, the haploinsufficiency of Tbx1 results in low penetrance of OFT defects. We
propose that altered buffering capacity in 22q11DS amplifies RA signaling and reduces Tbx1 gene dosage
below a threshold needed for proper OFT development. This novel mechanism for aberrant gene-environment
interactions will be tested with two specific aims: To establish (1) how RA buffering is disrupted in 22q11DS;
and (2) if reduced miRNA processing due to Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency mediates altered RA buffering and
contributes to OFT defects in 22q11DS. Together, these experiments will provide a novel understanding of the
mechanisms mediating gene-environment interactions. This new insight can directly translate to preventing
structural birth defects in 22q11DS."

 Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses that enhance or restore hearing to severely
hearing-impaired adults and children. Sound from the environment is converted into electrical pulses and
conveyed to the auditory nerve by an array of electrodes. The cochlear implant provides important spectral and
temporal auditory information to the listener. However, speech perception performance varies considerably
among cochlear implant listeners, particularly in noisy environments and for complex stimuli. A significant
contributing factor to this performance variability is the quality of the electrode-neuron interface, which is defined
by the position of individual electrodes, the relative health and integrity of the neurons and bone and tissue
growth related to trauma from electrode array insertion.
 Currently, there is not a clinical tool to query the electrode-neuron interface in cochlear implant listeners,
nor is there an accurate computational model based on human cochlear histopathology to estimate the electrode-
neuron interface. One step towards improving our understanding is to update the classical approach to
quantification of the density and integrity of the auditory neurons in donated human temporal bones from
recipients with cochlear implants. We will harness the power of machine learning to generate 3-D reconstructions
of the neurons relative to the electrodes in the cochlear implant array. To develop clinical measures to predict
variations in the electrode-neuron interface, we will leverage an interdisciplinary team of experts, machine
learning, computational modeling, an unparalleled collection of temporal bones, and a wealth of clinical data.
The long-term goal of the proposed experiments is to improve cochlear implant programming and speech
perception outcomes by improving our understanding of the electrode-neuron interface.
 Three aims are proposed: 1) To produce quantitative 3-D maps of cochlear histopathology at the
electrode-neuron interface in temporal bones from cochlear implant recipients and relate them to audiometric
measures and outcomes; 2) To develop and validate a computational model of the electrode-neuron interface
using histopathology, research and clinical measures; and 3) To improve speech perception for cochlear implant
listeners by individualizing programming based on electrode-neuron interface estimates.
 The results of the proposed studies are expected to lead to a shift in how we think about cochlear
histopathology and clinical care of individuals with cochlear implants. We will characterize the largest set of
implanted temporal bones with the highest degree of granularity to date. We will provide insight and tools for
assessing the relationship between histopathology, research, and clinical measures. Finally, we will develop
translatable methods for individualized programming for cochlear implant listeners based on a robust
understanding and a validated model of the electrode-neuron interface in humans."

Rieske oxygenases harness the reactivity of transition metals to perform powerful, efficient, and site-specific
transformations of traditionally inert bonds. These enzymes, which couple a [2Fe-2S] cluster with a non-heme
iron site, exploit molecular oxygen (O2) as a co-substrate in biosynthetic and degradative pathways. In these
reactions, the kinetic stability of O2 is overcome by the use of the non-heme iron site, which binds O2 and
promotes its cleavage via the formation of an activated oxygen intermediate. This reactive species is used to
abstract a hydrogen atom from a substrate and initiate an array of challenging transformations. Rieske
oxygenases are known to function as dioxygenases or monooxygenases, and have even been shown to catalyze
sequential monooxygenation reactions. As demonstrated in a number of biosynthetic pathways that produce
natural products with antibiotic, antifungal, anticancer, or anesthetic activities, as well as in pathways that
degrade environmental pollutants, these enzymes demonstrate exquisite control in differentiating between these
reaction types to ensure that only the intended transformation is catalyzed. Thus, these enzymes represent a
valuable source of enzymatic strategies to industrially produce pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals, or
facilitate bioremediation efforts. However, there is a critical lack of information available about how these
enzymes are able to use a common set of metallocenters to catalyze site-specific reactions with diverse
outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we will uncover the architectural strategies that Nature uses to tune the
selectivity and catalytic repertoire of the Rieske oxygenase enzymes. This knowledge will provide predictive
power towards repurposing Rieske oxygenases to catalyze custom reactions, and will support efforts to exploit
their chemistry for a wide variety of biotechnological endeavors."
10828317,"Background: Uterine fibroids (UF) are a common and costly gynecologic condition that disproportionately affect Black
women with regard to incidence, severity, treatment, and outcomes. UF result in debilitating symptoms including pelvic
pressure and pain, problems with reproduction, heavy menstrual bleeding, and severe anemia, and are the leading
cause of hysterectomy among women Veterans in VA. Although VA is a model healthcare system regarding health
equity in many areas, recent data suggest that substantial Black/White disparities in UF treatment and outcomes exist
within VA. As one-third of women Veterans using VA health care are Black and this proportion is increasing,
understanding the underlying drivers of these disparities within VA is of critical importance. Limited research has
examined these mechanisms either outside or within VA. Building a comprehensive understanding of UF disparities
and potential opportunities to address them will require examining the role of race and racism in women Veterans’
pathways to diagnosis and treatment of UF and their UF treatment patterns and experiences.
Objectives: Our objective is to investigate the mechanisms underlying Black/White disparities in UF-related outcomes
among women Veterans receiving VA care. Guided by the Public Health Critical Race Praxis, which asserts that race
is a social construct and that ubiquitous patterns and structures of contemporary racism shape racial disparities in
health, we propose: (1) To examine Black/White differences in treatment patterns for women Veterans with UF and
identify modifiable determinants; (2) To examine Black/White differences in clinical and post-surgical outcomes among
women Veterans receiving treatment for UF in VA and identify modifiable determinants; and (3) To understand and
contextualize differences identified in Aims 1 and 2 using qualitative exploration of Black women Veterans’
experiences with UF symptoms, care seeking behaviors, and treatment and how they differ from those of White
women Veterans.
Methods: We will use a mixed methods approach to address our study objectives. All three aims, will draw from a
single cohort of Black and White women Veteran users of VA healthcare with newly diagnosed symptomatic UF
between Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10) and FY12, identified through the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). Aims 1 and 2
are retrospective cohort analyses. We will examine administrative data and chart-abstracted medical record data
through FY18 to compare Black/White differences in treatment and outcomes. Aim 1 will compare time from diagnosis
to initial treatment and surgical treatments; type of initial treatment (medical, non-definitive procedure, hysterectomy);
and mode of surgery (minimally invasive vs abdominal). Aim 2 will examine Black/White differences in clinical
(emergency room visits, hospitalization for anemia, blood transfusion) and surgical outcomes (surgical complications,
30-day readmission) for UF. Aim 3 is a qualitative study with a purposively selected sample of up to 30 Black and 30
White women Veterans to inform and contextualize our quantitative findings from Aims 1 and 2. Content analysis will
be used to understand and identify how the constructs of race and gender may interact to impact women Veterans’
experiences with UF, pathways to treatment, treatment decision making, and treatment patterns. Our dissemination
plan includes a stakeholder engagement process which will engage Veterans, providers, and operational partners in
translating our findings into actionable practice and policy recommendations to reduce disparities.
Innovation and Next Steps: This proposal addresses key HSR&D priorities of women’s health, health equity, and
healthcare access. The innovative approach ensures substantial impact by moving beyond documenting racial/ethnic
disparities to building understanding of underlying and potentially modifiable causes. Next steps following completion
of the research and stakeholder engagement process will include partnering with VA Women’s Health Services and
VA Office of Health Equity to develop targeted interventions, programs, and policies to address UF disparities.
Ultimately, this research has the potential to accelerate progress towards quality and equity in gynecology and
reproductive healthcare both within and beyond VA."

Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a congenital bone and oral-facial disorder that mainly affects bone with less well
characterized alterations in bone healing and repair. Like other skeletal diseases, at least some of the
progressive bone and craniofacial defects in OI patients have been attributed to changes in the populations and
functions of their stem/progenitor cells. In general, stem cells require a specialized environment for their
maintenance and function. Nevertheless, how normal or defective structural components of collagen regulate
skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) is essentially unknown. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to define
the in vivo characteristics and function of skeletal stem/progenitor cells in OI and to understand how an
abnormal OI extracellular matrix alters these stem/progenitor cells in the context of bone regeneration
and repair. We previously showed that the Mx1Cre and αSMAGFP combination can selectively label skeletal stem
cells in the periosteum and that these Mx1ÈαSMAGFPÈ periosteal cells are long-term repopulating stem cell
subsets responsible for lifelong regeneration of periosteal osteoblasts and bone repair. Moreover, our preliminary
study revealed that these periosteal SSPCs are Prx1GFP positive and selectively express KDR (VEGFR2). Human
primary periosteal cells also express KDR with multi-lineage differentiation potentials. Notably, we found that
these KDRÈ periosteal progenitor cells are significantly decreased in OI bones. Hence, we hypothesize that the
abnormal OI matrix deregulates the number and function of periosteal and bone marrow SSPCs and the OI-
associated molecular changes in stem/progenitor cells are critical for the progressive deformity and delayed or
defective healing of bones. By using a series of OI animal models and SSPC reporter mice, in which we can
differentially label periosteal and bone marrow SSPC subsets, in combination with intravital imaging and the
latest single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, we plan to pursue the following specific aims. In aim 1, we will
define the in vivo characteristics and function of periosteal and bone marrow SSPCs in clinically relevant OI
mouse models. In aim 2, we will define key OI matrix factors that regulate SSPC function and improve both
craniofacial and long bone healing. Upon completion of this work, we will achieve new biological insights into a
better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that differentially regulate SSPCs under OI
pathophysiological conditions."

 We propose a continuation of the annual Strategic Conference of Zebrafish Investigators (SCZI), the main
meeting of principal investigators using the zebrafish model. Previously, this was a biannual conference
held in Asilomar, USA. In 2019, the International Zebrafish Society collaborated with the European Zebrafish
Society to adopt a 3-year rotation schedule for both their larger International Zebrafish Conference (IZFC)
gathering zebrafish researchers at all career stages and the SCZI so that the locations will rotate between
US/Canada, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. This new, focused meeting structure aims to promote greater international
collaboration by reducing the total number of international conferences, supporting the goals of both societies to
increase inclusivity and to reduce the travel-associated carbon footprint. The SCZI is a prime venue for zebrafish
principal investigators to discuss current research and promote coordinated advancement of research using
zebrafish as a model system (as well as connections to related, emerging aquatic models). The meeting will
accommodate up to 200 principal investigators. The proposed 10th SCZI meeting will take place in 2024 in
Asilomar, CA; continuation of the series will follow in Europe 2025, Asia-Pacific in 2026, and so on.
 The zebrafish has become a powerful model organism for the genetic analysis of vertebrate
development. Moreover, the zebrafish has emerged as a versatile vertebrate system to model human diseases
and discover underlying mechanisms, especially when used in conjunction with other vertebrate models, and to
screen for therapeutics and toxins. Advances in forward and in particular, reverse genetics, imaging techniques,
transgenesis, and chemical screening are rapidly and widely disseminated throughout an active, collaborative
community that has grown in coherence and connectivity through international meetings. The proposed SCZI
meeting will continue to foster the critical development of resources, establishment of collaborations,
and expansion of interdisciplinary interactions. Importantly, one third of past participants have been new
investigators: in addition to the open access to new findings in the field and to establish collaborations, new
investigators will have the opportunity to attend discussion sessions on topics such as grant writing and balancing
professional development and personal growth chaired by senior investigators. Past meetings have had a solid
record of inclusion of women and minority participants, and we will continue to provide inclusive
meeting environment.
 This grant will provide financial assistance for up to 30 US-based junior laboratory heads to attend the
conference. Recipients of financial support will be chosen based on the impact and originality of their abstracts
as well as considering gender, race, career stage, and need."

Biochemical properties and implications of NRAS mutant-specific BRAF interactions in melanoma
ABSTRACT
Extracellular growth factors promote cellular proliferation, motility, and survival through a complex network of
signal transduction pathways. Thus, mutations in these pathways can cause inappropriate cellular proliferation
and lead to diseases, such as cancer. RAS, an intracellular hub for multiple signaling pathways, is mutated in
20-30% of all human cancers. While the three RAS isoforms (H-, K-, and N-RAS) share a high degree of
similarity, each RAS-driven cancer type is enriched for mutations in a specific RAS isoform, codon (12, 13, or
61), and amino acid. We do not fully understand the mechanism driving this observed selectivity, although each
RAS mutant has distinct biochemical and functional properties. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying these
mutational preferences could help identify the features of oncogenic RAS required to initiate cancer in different
tissue types.
To address this knowledge gap, we have focused on the selection of specific NRAS mutants in melanoma. Our
work has shown that common melanoma-associated NRAS mutants (Q61R, K) promote MAPK signaling through
increased activation of BRAF homo- and hetero-dimers. New molecular dynamics simulations suggest that
conformational properties, specific to the NRAS mutants that drive melanoma, facilitate BRAF binding. Here, I
will test the hypothesis that structural differences between NRAS mutants determine their ability to
outcompete autoinhibitory BRAF interactions, drive enhanced MAPK>ERK activation, and alter the
potency of RAF inhibitors. To test my hypothesis, I will use a variety of in vitro biosensors, cell-based signaling
assays, and mouse models to define the mutant-specific features of NRAS that facilitate BRAF interactions (Aim
1) and how the structural determinants of different NRAS mutant-BRAF interactions influence BRAF inhibitor
sensitivity (Aim 2). Successful completion of these studies will enhance my knowledge of structural biology,
therapeutic development, and mouse models of cancer. I will also identify mutant-specific NRAS-BRAF
interfaces to guide the design of novel therapeutic approaches for NRAS-mutant cancers and provide information
relevant to the clinical implementation of next-generation RAF inhibitors."

 APOBEC3B (A3B) is an innate immune enzyme capable of introducing mutations in viral genomes and
has been implicated in the restriction of several viruses. In addition, A3B is unique as the only human DNA
deaminase family member that is constitutively nuclear. Recent studies have shown that -herpesviruses, such
as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have evolved potent mechanisms for A3B neutralization and re-localization. The
ribonucleotide reductase of EBV, BORF2, is capable of binding and relocalizing A3B from the nuclear
compartment to cytoplasmic aggregates. Therefore, nuclear localization has been inferred to be essential for
innate antiviral function. Regarding A3B subcellular localization, we have previously shown that A3B nuclear
localization requires the presence of three residues within the N-terminal half of the protein and that nuclear
localization is not a conserved feature of A3B across non-human primates, despite a need for antiviral function
in the nuclear compartment. For instance, although human and several non-human primate A3B enzymes are
predominantly nuclear, rhesus macaque and other Old World monkey A3B enzymes are clearly cytoplasmic. A
series of human/rhesus macaque chimeras and mutants combined to map localization determinants to the N-
terminal half of the protein with residues 15, 19, and 24 proving critical. Despite advances in our knowledge of
A3B, the mechanism of nuclear localization and the broad role of subcellular localization in virus restriction
activities remain uncharacterized. Taken together, we hypothesize that A3B uses a non-canonical mechanism
of nuclear import and that nuclear localization is a key feature of A3B’s role as a restriction factor. This hypothesis
will be tested through two complementary Specific Aims. The first will identify the molecular mechanism of A3B
nuclear import through evolutionary and proteomics approaches, using the human/rhesus macaque chimeras
described above. The second will address whether nuclear localization is required for A3B-mediated antiviral
activities by testing A3B and select mutants against a panel of viruses in cell culture and in vivo. These studies
will elucidate the mechanism of A3B nuclear import and the role of subcellular localization in DNA virus
restriction, thus enhancing our understanding of these important host-pathogen interactions."
10856102,"Problem: COVID-19 is the #8 and influenza and pneumonia the #9 leading causes of death among children.
Both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are on the CDC recommended vaccine schedule for children and
adolescents and both are effective against severe disease. However, coverage rates for both vaccines remain
low or are dropping. Vaccine reminders are widely recommended with text messaging, as a single-method
reminder, having the largest benefit. However, behaviorally-informed COVID-19 vaccine text messages have
not been tested in a pediatric population. Additionally, while COVID-19 and influenza vaccination are going to
be due at the same time it is not known how COVID-19 and influenza vaccination reminders will interact.
We propose a pragmatic Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness/implementation trial with national scope vital to
understanding the effectiveness and implementation of COVID-19 and influenza text message reminders
across parents with varied backgrounds and whose children are cared for in diverse pediatric primary care
practice settings. AIM 1. To compare the effectiveness of behaviorally informed text message reminders
versus usual care on timely receipt of a needed COVID-19 or influenza vaccine dose in a diverse pediatric
primary care population. AIM 2. To compare the effectiveness of two implementation strategies on timely
receipt of each vaccination: combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccine reminders versus COVID-19 or
influenza reminders alone. AIM 3. To assess parental and child characteristics that modify text message
effectiveness. AIM 4. To identify contextual factors, facilitators and barriers to implementation and
sustainability of text messages for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination in a diverse pediatric population.
Methods: This multi-site trial will include 40,000 parents of 6 month-17-year-old children who are due for both
a COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. Practices will be recruited through the American Academy of Pediatrics
national Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) network. In season 1, children will be randomized into 4
arms: combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccine text message reminders, COVID-19 reminders alone,
influenza reminders alone, and no reminders. Messages will be managed by the research team. The primary
outcome for Aim 1 will be timeliness of vaccine receipt (COVID-19 and/or influenza separately) from trial start.
Aim 2 will compare the implementation strategy of single vs combined reminders assessing whether combining
reminders for both vaccines leads to additive (or synergistic) or negative effects. Season 2 will be a replication
study. In season 3, practices will implement messages on their own. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will
use the RE-AIM framework in combination with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) to understand factors shaping implementation success. On a national scale, understanding the
effectiveness and implementation of influenza and COVID-19 vaccine text message reminders among a
diverse pediatric population will provide key information to multiple stakeholders to bolster vaccine receipt."
10856289,"The 548,000 Americans who rely on dialysis to stave off death from kidney failure suffer from
malnutrition, inflammation, immune defects, and vastly increased incidence of coronary
thromboses and pulmonary embolisms. Conventional hemodialysis cartridges are designed to
remove urea, because urea removal is fundamental to dialysis quality metrics. However, urea is
a largely non-toxic stand-in for other waste products, and urea-focused efforts fail to capture the
complexity of dialysis in renal failure.
One class of uremic wastes that are thought to contribute to the illness of dialysis patients is
called ""protein-bound uremic toxins"" (PBUTs), such as indoxyl sulfate, kynurenic acid, and p-
cresyl. Because dialyzers do not allow albumin to pass from blood to dialysate, the toxins
bound to albumin do not pass in appreciable quantities either. Dialyzer design has focused on
urea removal. We hypothesize that increasing the residence time of blood in the dialyzer will
allow for increased PBUT removal and eventually, better health for patients who depend on
dialysis.
Hemodialysis treatment is associated with an increased risk of clotting despite anemia, uremia,
and chronic heparin use. The superphysiological shear stresses that platelets experience in
hemodialysis appear to prime them to form clots inappropriately. We designed a parallel-plate
dialyzer with tightly controlled shear forces. We will test whether platelet activation with this
novel design reduces platelet activation, compared to conventional dialyzers."

Since 2009, the long-term goal of the UW Voice Research Training Program has been to foster the
development of translational research skills in future leaders in the field of voice science. We provide promising
predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows with highly interactive and multi-disciplinary training experiences that are
unfettered by conventional departmental barriers, and actively facilitate their development as independent
scientists. Fellows partake in comprehensive laboratory, translational, and clinical research experiences, as
well as exposure to curricula in clinical trials, hypothesis-based research, management, ethics, and data
analysis. Further, the training program offers medical students a short-term summer research opportunity to
encourage future clinicians to become physician-scientists. The program capitalizes on the abundant university
resources, including the UW CTSA Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, thereby creating an
outstanding voice training program that is not matched elsewhere. Our pool of experienced, extramurally
funded trainers, from a variety of disciplines including otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, medicine, human
oncology, biomedical and chemical engineering, bacteriology, and communication sciences and disorders
incorporates effective assessment processes, a plan to promote diversity by recruiting and retaining both
women and minorities, and a solid plan for training in the responsible and ethical conduct of research. This
renewal application, based on our immense success over the last 14 years, requests an additional five years of
funding for 5 predoctoral, 3 postdoctoral, and 2 short-term fellows each year. An important metric of success of
our past performance to date is that 31 predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows have completed the program (6
fellows are currently appointed) and have progressed onto competitive postdoctoral positions and academic,
industry, or government research careers. We have had 24 short-term medical students with 2 enrolled for
summer 2023. Other indicators of success of the program include 17 NIH F31 and F32 fellowship awards to
our trainees, other NIH funding (Loan Repayment, K23, K99, R21 and R01s) received to past trainees, in
addition to countless other awards, grant funding, and scholarships. For each fellow, the UW Voice Research
Training Program has a proven track record of creating a dynamic research experience with an outstanding
collaborative research team. Renewal of this training program will ensure the continued excellence and
engagement of the next generation of voice scientists."
10855809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hospitalized children who experience cardiopulmonary deterioration are at increased risk for mortality and long-
term morbidity. Because timely intervention increases survival in children, it is critically important to identify
cardiopulmonary deterioration events as early as possible. However, the current paradigm for detecting these
events in advance has several gaps. First, existing risk prediction methods can lead to fragmented care, as each
unit employs different tools for predicting specific outcomes. For example, risk prediction within the emergency
department (ED) is targeted toward triage; ward-based tools predict the risk of being transferred to the intensive
care unit (ICU), while the ICU focuses on determining the likelihood of death or cardiac arrests. Transitioning
from multiple, siloed risk assessment tools to a single, hospital-wide cardiopulmonary deterioration prediction
model could significantly improve outcomes for children. A second critical gap is that current prediction model
outputs are not accompanied by helpful explanations, a need unmet by standard machine learning (ML)
explainers due to inherent limitations. Developing new algorithms that provide real-time interpretations of model
outputs may increase situational awareness, decrease diagnostic delay, and enable better treatment selection.
Third, to ensure high usage and effective decision-making, any new model should be accompanied by a user
interface explicitly designed using human factors engineering principles.
 The long-term goal is to improve outcomes among children experiencing cardiopulmonary deterioration
by enabling better quality of care. The overall objective of this project is to develop a new clinical decision support
(CDS) tool that is accurate, interpretable, and actionable for early detection of cardiopulmonary deterioration
events in children. In Aim 1, we will use electronic health record (EHR) data from pediatric admissions to four
academic hospitals and ML to derive and externally validate a new hospital-wide cardiopulmonary deterioration
prediction model and compare performances to our preliminary model. In Aim 2, we will develop novel algorithms
that provide physiological explanations and clinical context for model predictions for a given patient. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will create a new CDS tool that embeds the best-performing prediction tool and explainer algorithm
outputs within a graphical user interface purposefully designed to facilitate increased user interaction. The
proposed research is innovative because it incorporates deep learning-based pediatric risk prediction, real-time
explainable algorithms with highlighted clinical context, and human factors engineering for developing the CDS
tool. In addition, the proposed work is significant because it will result in a new, accurate, interpretable, efficient,
and user-friendly CDS tool for risk assessment throughout a pediatric hospital. Ultimately, this powerful tool will
enable early recognition of pediatric cardiopulmonary deterioration events, facilitating timely diagnosis and
intervention to improve outcomes among hospitalized children."

 Children from adverse developmental environments demonstrate varied reading achievement. The
overarching hypothesis of the proposed research is that genetic and neural canalization provide a buffer against
the negative impacts of developmental risks to ensure normative reading and language achievement. Specific
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that genetic canalization protects against the well-established negative effects of low
socioeconomic status on written and oral language development. We focus on the polygenic and environmental
interactions to characterize canalization, including the extent to which the prevalence of low written and oral
language achievement decreases with (better) polygenic scores for children from environments with high
developmental risk. Here, we will examine: 1) specific social determinants of health where genetic canalization
may be critically important for ensuring normal development; 2) the specificity of canalization to reading and
language relative to executive functions; 3) and the degree to which there are brain structure endophenotypes
for genetic canalization. Specific Aim 1 examines population-level effects, whereas Specific Aim 2 examines the
instantiation of canalization within individuals and tests the hypothesis that a cortical network shown to optimize
task performance can explain reading performance in children with risks for adverse development. For both
aims, large datasets and novel topological analyses are used to provide optimal rigor for these experiments that
will be pre-registered. Specific Aim 3 is to grow an existing data repository of data from neuroimaging studies on
reading disability and development, as well as enhance the functions and our data delivery and sharing resource.
This resource includes the integration of methods to generate data that can be used to replicate previous reading
disability findings. This will include deep learning approaches for identifying neural predictors of reading disability,
with a focus on features that canalize reading development. Together, the theoretically motivated study of large
datasets will generate results to advance our understanding about the development of reading disability,
particularly for children from adverse developmental environments, and further an open science initiative that is
expected to advance reading disability research through data access, replication, and new discovery."
10827063,"Project Summary
The majority of breast cancer related deaths occur as a result of metastasis. Once the cancer cells
metastasize, the 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer patients drastically drops. During
metastasis, a complex series of events is initiated by changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM)
composition and architecture in distant tissues, where the metastatic cancer cells take root and form
secondary tumors. These distinct changes in the premetastatic niche (PMN) facilitate tumor cell
colonization, phenotypic heterogeneity of the cell population, and contribute to drug resistance frequently
observed in metastatic tumors. Using an engineered model of the PMN, we have demonstrated that
extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate dynamic changes in premetastatic tissues, and that blocking key
events during PMN formation disrupts the metastatic process. Our preliminary studies indicate that ECM
proteins transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and fibronectin (FN) play a significant role in establishing the PMN
through an EV-dependent mechanism. However, fundamental gaps remain in identifying critical events
within the niche that facilitate metastatic colonization of tumor cells, cellular plasticity, and drug
resistance. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify how the dynamic changes within the metastatic
niche make the distant tissues hospitable to metastatic cancer cells. Aim 1 will use our novel model of
the PMN to identify how specific changes in the PMN facilitate colonization by disseminating cells. Aim
2 is focused on isolating specific effects of ECM dynamics and cellular constituents within the PMN that
impact phenotypic heterogeneity and immunogenicity, giving rise to growth permissive and grow
restrictive environments. Aim 3 will identify mechanisms by which key matrix components within the niche
protect metastatic tumor cells from therapeutic agents. Our cross-disciplinary team encompasses
expertise in biomedical engineering, metastasis, imaging, and EV biology. The proposed studies will
establish novel mechanisms by which the PMN facilitates breast cancer metastasis, an essential step
towards successful treatments to disrupt the metastatic process."

Cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections are a frequent and serious complication of the treatment of hydrocephalus,
occurring in 5-30% of patients1, 2. These infections are associated with significant long-term neurologic
sequelae such as lower IQ, poor school performance and increased risk of seizures 9-13. The mechanisms
responsible for the severe neurologic damage associated with shunt infection are unknown.
Studies have demonstrated the role of complement in normal neurologic development through developmentally
appropriate complement mediated synaptic pruning by microglia 19,20,22. Additional studies have revealed the
role of complement in a variety of neurologic disorders and infection supporting a central role for complement
in central nervous system homeostasis and pathology24-33. My preliminary studies in an animal model of shunt
infection have demonstrated elevated levels of the complement components C3 and C5 in brain tissue at day 5
and 10 when bacterial burdens are low, suggesting complement may mediate the neurologic damage
associated with shunt infections. This is further supported by my preliminary data demonstrating that synaptic
pruning is less dramatic in C3 knockout mice. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the role of
complement in a murine model of CNS catheter infection, to facilitate the future identification of novel
therapeutic targets to limit neurologic damage in pediatric patients. Understanding the mechanisms
whereby complement mediates neurologic damage would allow us to take advantage of many
complement inhibitors that are being developed for clinical medicine as potential adjuvants to
antibiotic therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes 35,36.
Our central hypothesis is that complement components induce microglial-mediated synaptic pruning and are
responsible for late-stage cerebral edema. To test this hypothesis, we will perform experiments outlined in two
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the primary mode of complement pathway activation during CNS S.
epidermidis catheter-associated infection and functional importance. In Aim 2, we will define the molecular
mechanisms of complement-mediated damage during CNS catheter infection.
Finally, the candidate is a pediatric infectious disease specialist with a long-standing experience investigating
shunt infections. She is a well-supported candidate with the goal of becoming a physician scientist and would
highly benefit from a Clinical Scientist Development Award."
10828754,"ABSTRACT
Sustained activated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a pivotal role in mediating hepatotoxic cell death due
to its phosphorylation of target proteins. This proposal focuses on two novel JNK targeted proteins, cytoplasmic
- glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) and mitochondrial outer membrane SAB (SH3BP5) and their roles in mediating
sustained JNK activation by promoting reactive oxygen (ROS) species dependent activation of the MAPK kinase
cascade. Based on preliminary data we propose that (a) P-JNK targets GCLC subunit for rapid proteolytic
degradation which enhances ROS exposure and consequent activation of MAPK cascade; (b) specific P-JNK
docking and phosphorylation sites on SAB mediate SAB-dependent mitochondrial ROS production and together
with GCL degradation sustain a P-JNK-mitoSAB-ROS activation loop; (c) a second isoform of SAB2 with a
modified N-terminus is incapable of transducing an effect inside the mitochondria but retains ability of C-terminus
to be a P-JNK substrate and therefore is a potential decoy. Our overarching hypothesis is that P-JNK targeting
and phosphorylation of both novel targets, GCL and SAB, mediates sustained JNK activation leading to
hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (APAP) in a two-pronged mechanism and apoptosis in other models through
SAB-dependent sustained P-JNK which then modulates apoptosis regulators. Thus, the aims of the proposal
are: (1) Determine the role of JNK in the regulation of - glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) subunits and the impact
on GSH recovery in acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity: Preliminary results show that GCLC is rapidly
degraded after APAP treatment in conjunction with sustained JNK activation while expression of JNK resistant
mutated GCLC dampens P-JNK before onset of necrosis in APAP induced liver injury. Both GCLC and GCLM
contain a P-JNK docking site (KIM, kinase interaction motif) and possible phosphorylation sites but only GCLC
contains a PEST cleavage site. (2) Characterize the role of specific JNK binding and phosphorylation sites of
SAB in mediating JNK-dependent toxicity and relation to SAB oligomerization: SAB contains two possible P-JNK
docking (KIM) sites and four serine (SP/L) sites for phosphorylation. We will perform site directed mutagenesis
to elucidate which is/are indispensable in SAB-dependent signal transduction to inside of mitochondria. We
assess the dependence of phosphorylation of SAB on the homo or hetero oligomerization of SAB and its role in
promoting intramitochondrial signal transduction. (3) Define the expression and function of the two isoforms of
mouse and human SAB (SAB1 and -2) in liver: We identified two isoforms of SAB. Mouse SAB2 has a unique
N-terminal amino acid sequence whereas human SAB2 is shorter and truncated at N-terminus compared to
SAB1. Preliminary data indicates that mouse SAB2 is in mitochondria, does not transduce a signal inside
mitochondria, and, when overexpressed in wild type mice, protects against liver injury, suggesting it acts as a
decoy substrate."
10828758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clinically, nearly all breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis and prior to treatment have some degree of
muscle dysfunction resulting in fatigue that ranges from mild to debilitating and may worsen during and after
chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. Adverse systemic effects of tumor growth can often result in treatment
cessation and greater mortality in late stages of disease. The long-term goal of my work is to identify potential
therapeutic targets for fatigue and a mechanism linking BC with systemic muscle fatigue. The specific goal of this
proposal is to utilize our murine model to characterize the molecular adaptations in muscle and identify targets
to attenuate fatigue in patients with breast cancer. The central research hypothesis is that regulation of
mitochondrial bioenergetics via a PPARγ-agonist will attenuate breast tumor-associated muscle fatigue. Three
Specific Aims have been proposed to test this hypothesis, using murine models of breast cancer and novel in vitro
models of PPAR-activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the working hypothesis that breast tumor growth impairs
mitochondrial bioenergetics resulting in ATP deficiency and subsequent muscle fatigue through aberrant function
of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex V. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the working hypothesis
that breast tumor-derived miR-27a-3p interacts with regulatory components of PPARγ within skeletal muscle to
decrease its function as a transcription factor, thereby specifically inducing alterations in mitochondrial function.
In Specific Aim 3, will test the working hypothesis that pioglitazone will attenuate breast tumor-associated fatigue
by upregulating PPARγ transcriptional activity in skeletal muscle, thereby rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics
and ATP production. BC-PDOX mice and controls treated with and without pioglitazone will be evaluated for
muscle fatigue, mitochondrial bioenergetics and ATP content. This project is conceptually innovative in its use
of a preclinical mouse model that phenotypically and transcriptionally mimics BC-associated muscle fatigue in
the absence of cachexia. Our approach is both unique and practical in that it seeks to lay the foundation for
repurposing an existing FDA-approved PPARγ-agonist for treatment of fatigue in patients with BC, directly
addressing a key knowledge gap in this field. The outcomes of this project will impact the treatment of cancer-
related fatigue, with the potential to offer early-stage BC-patients a treatment strategy targeting this debilitating
symptom before the onset of cachexia. The aims and objectives of this project reflect the goals of the NCI, as
described in their mission statement, by specifically conducting research that will advance scientific knowledge
and be applicable to a large population of patients as well as helping improve patients’ quality of life during and
following completion of cancer-associated therapy."
10828924,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A craniotomy allows neurosurgeons to access the brain for procedures that include tumor resection, localization
and resection of epileptogenic foci, and aneurysm clipping via the removal and intraoperative replacement of a
skull fragment (bone flap). Infection following craniotomy occurs at rates of approximately 1-3%, although some
reports indicate rates exceeding 10%. Nearly half of craniotomy infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus) forming a biofilm on the bone flap. As biofilms are inherently difficult to eradicate due to antibiotic
tolerance and virulence factors allowing immune evasion, craniotomy infections carry significant morbidity since
a second surgery is required for treatment. When craniotomies are complicated by infection, resident immune
cells and infiltrating leukocytes throughout the brain, subcutaneous galea, and bone flap tissues are exposed to
both damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs) originating from the surgical
procedure and bacteria, respectively. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is a major
pathology-induced signaling receptor involved in immune remodeling during many neurological conditions. An
important feature of TREM2 is its reported ability to bind an array of anionic ligands including DAMPs (DNA,
lipoproteins, glycolipids, and phospholipids) and PAMPs (lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and
lipopolysaccharide). This proposal will test the hypothesis that TREM2 plays a critical role in promoting
S. aureus craniotomy infection by eliciting an anti-inflammatory response through combined DAMP and
PAMP signaling. In support of this hypothesis, my preliminary studies showed increased TREM2 expression
and shifts toward an anti-inflammatory metabolic state in microglia after exposure to S. aureus. This proposed
work will seek to uncover mechanisms behind TREM2 signaling during craniotomy infection. In Specific Aim 1, I
will utilize a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection with TREM2 KO animals to determine the relative
contribution of DAMP vs. PAMP signaling, temporal aspects of TREM2 activation post-surgery, the comparative
roles of membrane-associated vs. soluble TREM2, and the extent of TREM2 signaling involved in metabolic
reprogramming of microglia and individual leukocyte populations. In Specific Aim 2, a novel bacterial scRNA-
seq approach will used to identify S. aureus TREM2-targeted virulence factors that are leveraged for immune
evasion. I will be the first to use this sequencing technique to study biofilm on a single-cell level and elucidate
how bacterial pathogens, specifically biofilm, can hijack host immunity to persist. Results from this work will
provide insights into previously unstudied topics on TREM2 signaling in the context of dual DAMP and PAMP
exposure during craniotomy infection and elucidate targets for future therapeutic intervention."
10828928,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nearly 30% of patients with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) have a congenital heart defect
(CHD). Outflow tract (OFT) defects are over-represented, though with variable incidence and severity. The
majority of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) research focuses on the hallmarks of FASD, chronic drinking and
neurologic defects. The most common form of PAE in the population, acute exposure during the
periconceptual period, and its effect on cardiac development have not been studied. We will study the effects
of acute, periconceptual drinking both through a multi-institutional clinical study and with our acute PAE murine
model, in which mice receive two intraperitoneal injections of 3g/kg of 30% ethanol at a point critical to cardiac
organogenesis. We hypothesize the variable incidence and severity of PAE-induced OFT defects can be
explained by a combination of PAE and otherwise non-deleterious mutations that result in a genetically
permissive background. We believe mutations in the Notch pathway establish such a genetically permissive
background, and that PAE acts synergistically with these mutations via epigenetic regulation of Notch to result
in OFT malformation. Aim 1 of this study will address the specificity of the deleterious effects of PAE to OFT
alignment and define the molecular pathways disrupted in individuals with PAE-induced OFT defects. We will
achieve this through relative risk analysis of PAE and CHD diagnoses and pathway and subsequent logistical
regression analyses of whole genome sequencing data. Aim 2 will define alcohol driven epigenetic regulation
as the mechanism by which acute PAE and otherwise non-deleterious Notch pathway mutations synergistically
disrupt OFT development. Using a combination of molecular assays and histologic analysis in vitro and in vivo,
we will test the impact of this combined teratogenic insult on second heart field (SHF) viability and ability to
migrate into the OFT. We will establish PAE driven epigenetic regulation, disrupting Notch gene accessibility
and transcription, inhibits Notch signaling and use a pan-histone acetyltransferase inhibitor in vitro to
demonstrate prevention of PAE induced hyperacetylation is sufficient to rescue Notch signaling and SHF
viability. Similarly, rescue of SHF viability by overexpression of notch intracellular domain (NICD) in vitro will
cement the point of acute PAE and Notch mutation synergy as loss of Notch signaling prohibiting SHF viability.
 As one of the first studies to examine the interaction of clinically relevant acute PAE with heart
development, this study addresses the priorities of the NIAAA to define the impact of non-chronic exposure
and alcohol’s effects on understudied organ systems. The genetic pathways identified by this study, including
novel validation of the Notch pathway as significant in PAE-induced CHD, will provide targets for disease
prevention and identification of those most at risk to develop the world’s most common and deadly birth defect.
Completion of this project is ensured by the technical training and mentorship by the sponsorship team, the
training site’s cutting-edge facilities, and education provided by the principal investigator’s M.D.-Ph.D. program."
10829878,"The ambition of this proposal is to identify the cellular underpinnings of the early transition
between casual to sustain drinking using drinking-in-the-dark model. We propose to employ
a variety of complementary approaches, including mouse genetics, optogenetics,
behavior and biophysical approaches to test the overarching hypothesis that computing
of the synaptic strength of cortical and amygdala inputs (a phenomenon also known as
synaptic gating) is a mechanism enabling nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to
integrate cognitive and emotional information, and is modulated by alcohol exposure to
control consumption. We postulate that this cellular mechanism contributes to the
vulnerability of adolescents to binge drinking."
10829880,"In nearly all forms of human cancer, the development of necrosis is tightly linked with
malignant progression. Whether necrosis accelerates progression or is largely passive
remains an open question, yet modeling these events to establish mechanisms and
therapeutic vulnerabilities in animals has been challenging. In glioblastoma (GBM; WHO
grade IV), the most malignant primary brain tumor, the rapid, radial growth phase that
leads quickly to death is consistently preceded by the development of central necrosis.
While genetic alterations of GBM are known in great detail, the biological properties that
result from their acquisition and lead to this accelerated growth phase require deeper
investigation. The tumor microenvironment (TME) changes dramatically following the
onset of necrosis, from a sheet-like growth of infiltrating cells with relatively constant
growth properties to a highly complex and evolving 3-D microsystem composed of
diverse cell types and spatially segregated signaling networks. To better understand the
dynamic temporal and spatial changes that promote progression, we propose to
advance mouse models that closely parallel these events in human gliomas, since many
mouse models of GBM lack necrosis. We developed a novel method to induce focal
necrosis within high grade gliomas in vivo and will study TME restructuring and its
impact on glioma growth in real time using multiphoton microscopy. As translational
applications, we will demonstrate how hypoxia and necrosis promote the enrichment of
glioma stem cells (GSCs) in their peri-necrotic niche and lead to the dramatic influx of
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which increase in number over 10-fold in the
human disease. We propose both genetically characterized patient-derived GBM
xenografts grown in mice with humanized immune cells, as well as an
immunocompetent RCAS/tv-a model, and will determine how antagonizing these
processes impact disease progression and outcomes. Our preliminary data and the
literature indicate substantial differences between pre-necrotic and necrotic gliomas with
regard to GSC and TAM enrichment and their impact on biological properties, but the
mechanisms and evolution have not been studied in depth, in large part due to the
absence of a credible animal model. Our model will capture glioma growth dynamics,
GSC enrichment, and TAM influx, and facilitate the development of therapies that
antagonize these mechanisms to improve outcomes."
10856321,"Cardiac arrest induces a systemic inflammatory response. Several studies have demonstrated that increased
sustained inflammation is associated with poor outcomes, suggesting a possible role for anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory therapies. However, these studies have focused on mechanisms that promote
inflammation without considering protective mechanisms that are also mediated by the immune cells. Our
preliminary data from human patients with cardiac arrest revealed an association between the higher number
of CD73-expressing lymphocytes and favorable outcomes. CD73 is a key enzyme in the generation of
adenosine, a purine nucleoside that is characterized by potent anti-inflammatory properties. Our new
preliminary data generated using a mouse model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation suggest that CD73-
expressing lymphocytes play a role in the control of local inflammation in the heart and brain tissues. In
Specific Aim 1, we will determine the functional significance of adoptive cell therapy using protective CD73-
expressing lymphocytes after an ischemia and reperfusion injury in a mouse model of cardiac arrest and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CD73-expressing
lymphocytes form T cell-monocyte complexes and promote the differentiation of monocytes toward anti-
inflammatory macrophages. In Specific Aim 3, we will define molecular mechanisms involved in the formation
of anti-inflammatory lymphocyte-macrophages complexes. Our new data will determine the contribution of
cardiac arrest-induced inflammatory response in the heart and brain tissue damage and identify
CD73/adenosine/adenosine receptors axis as a potential therapeutic approach to improve outcomes after
global ischemia and reperfusion injury."
10862869,"Project Summary—Administrative Oversight 
The mission of the Center for Smart Use of Technologies to Assess Real-World Outcomes (C-STAR) is to 
serve as a unique resource to the national rehabilitation research community. In order to maximize our ability 
to advance rehabilitation research and improve outcomes for persons with disability, we will create an agile, 
responsive, and efficient administrative structure that optimizes our ability to provide valuable expertise and 
resources to researchers and clinicians, including efficient collaboration with other Centers. Our overall goal is 
to create an organizational structure that allows efficient managerial oversight, clearly defines the 
responsibilities of key personnel, and provides easy access to C-STAR resources and expertise. Specifically, 
we will create a pilot program project that solicits applications from a diverse population of researchers, provide 
collaborative learning opportunities to the research community, develop technologies to advance the ability to 
measure real-world outcomes, market C-STAR nationally through social media and other unique resources, 
and solicit biennial input from an independent advisory board of stakeholders. 
We have assigned experienced leadership to manage each of the Center components: cores, didactic 
interactions, and hands on interactions. An Executive Committee, comprising Core directors, the principal 
investigators, and the pilot project committee chair, will meet monthly to evaluate progress, address problems, 
and document activities and outputs. The Executive Committee will also monitor Center budgets and key 
personnel effort to ensure that Center resources are used efficiently and distributed effectively among various 
Center activities. On an ad hoc basis, C-STAR personnel will also participate in (1) didactic efforts, (2) 
programs such as IdeaLabs in which clinicians and researchers explore new ideas in structured “white board” 
sessions, and pilot project reviews, and (3) evaluation and mentoring of pilot studies. The guiding strategy 
used to create our core leadership was to choose co-directors who are accomplished professionals, 
representing both Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab) and Northwestern University (NU), and encompass a 
diversity of research experience and gender. Our core directors will serve as a point-of-contact for C-STAR 
inquiries, assist in the reviewing of pilot projects, participate in IdeaLabs and draw appropriate colleagues into 
these reviews, and feed new technology development ideas into the technology core. All core directors have 
leadership experience; some are very senior researchers with extensive experience. 
We are also proposing a novel budgeting model, based on our previous experience with infrastructure grants, 
in which cores are often either under- or over-utilized. We propose use of the “value based” accounting (VBA) 
method in which funds are shifted, as needed, to the appropriate core. Finally, C-STAR will have close 
relationships with industry partners, ranging from the more traditional device and technical support provided by 
most companies to the very substantial data housing and computational environment."

Oral diseases pose a major health challenge globally and affect people throughout their lifetime. These diseases
share common risk factors with other major Chronic Non-communicable Diseases and Disorders (NCDs). The
well-established oral-systemic health connections also indicate that prevention and treatment of oral diseases is
a critical component in maintaining good general health and well-being. Yet, due to the lack of personnel, access
to training, knowledge of research methods, and funding, oral health care and research is still limited in Southeast
Asia. The large diversities in the geography, social structure and cultures in Southeast Asian nations emphasize
the need for locally relevant research to identify risk factors and oral health management strategies that would
be effective in each country. The goal of this application is to sustainably strengthen the oral health research
capacity among LMICs in Southeast Asia by establishing a training hub in Thailand and fostering a network of
regional researchers. The plan proposes to build upon and expand two established training programs “Clinical,
Public Health, and Behavioral Oral Health Research Training for Thailand” (D43TW007768 and D43TW009071,
PI: DeRouen), which have been collaborative efforts between the University of Washington School of Dentistry
(UW) and affiliated Faculties of Dentistry at Khon Kaen University (KKU) and Thammasat University (TU) in
Thailand. Dr. Waranuch Pitiphat, Dean of KKU Faculty of Dentistry, the Director of this Program (PD) was a
major collaborator and Associate Director of the previous training programs. The proposed program will also
include 4 major collaborating institutions: University of Indonesia, University of Malaya, University of Philippines
Manila, and Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Vietnam. Five levels of training are being
proposed: (1) Short-term training. A series of 5-day workshops on clinical research methods, conducted in
Thailand or other Southeast Asian countries annually (n=120 total); (2) Intermediate-term training. An 8-week
program at the UW COHO Institute in Clinical Research Methods in Seattle. The trainees will participate in the
program online for 6 weeks and in Seattle for 2 weeks (n=18 total); (3) Medium-term training. A Short Course
Training in Research Methodology & Biostatistics offered annually at KKU in Thailand. This is an intensive
program in which the trainees will take didactic courses and develop an individual research proposal at the end
of the 4-month course (n=20 total). Medium-term trainees can apply for the next level of training; (4) Non-degree
research training. A research fellowship program allows the trainees to do research in home country under
guidance of a local mentor as well as UW and Thai faculty (n=16 total); (5) Long-term training. The program
will support five dentists from Southeast Asia to pursue PhD in Oral Sciences at the two Thai universities. After
completing 1-year coursework in Thailand, PhD students will attend the Summer Institute in Seattle and work
with UW mentors to develop a dissertation research proposal to be carried out in their home country."
10827434,"Antibiotic resistance and tolerance are a major increasing threat to treating infectious
diseases. Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis
worldwide, is a model organism for understanding antibiotic-induced autolysis and failure of
therapy due to antibiotic tolerance: a phenotype when bacteria stop growing but are not killed.
The main pneumococcal autolysin, LytA, drives autolysis but its mode of downregulation during
tolerance is unknown. We have discovered a new LytA activity: capsule shedding and through its
analysis have, for the first time, discovered candidates for regulators of LytA that also could
explain the modulation of penicillin responses that lead to tolerance and treatment failure. Using
the pneumococcus as a model, our lab has revealed that, for capsule shedding, LytA is activated
to cleave cell wall without lysis in response to antimicrobial peptides, typified but not limited to LL-
37. Rather, LytA removes surface attached capsule in a protective response to avoid LL-37. We
have identified 3 loci that regulate these activities of LytA. Mutation of these LytA modulating
(Lym) loci recapitulates the penicillin tolerance phenotype of clinical isolates: production of
bioactive LytA, but a failure to trigger autolysis after penicillin treatment.
 Our discovery provides tools to make important inroads into defining the mechanisms
governing antibiotic lytic responses (the first mechanistic discovery of how LytA is controlled).
From analysis of genomes of streptococcal pathogens in general, it is apparent that lym loci are
widespread and have alleles that cluster with distinct penicillin tolerant phenotypes. New insights
into autolysin and penicillin responses are needed to advance both the fields of bacterial
physiology and infectious diseases.
 We propose in Aim 1 to take a combined biochemical, genetic, and microscopic approach
to analyze the roles of the Lym proteins and lym loci on LytA regulation. In aim 2, we will exploit
our new discovery that 3 Lym proteins are the first bacterial proteins shown to form biomolecular
condensates and initiate phase separation. This property is widely used in eukaryotes to regulate
complex spatiotemporal multi-protein processes and is thus especially well-suited as a highly
novel mechanism to underpin LytA regulation by 3 Lyms. In Aim 3, we will examine lym alleles
in tolerant clinical isolates of pneumococcus. These isolates are derived from patients dying of
meningitis due to treatment failure that is recapitulated in the animal model of meningitis. We will
define Lyms as a cause of failure of potent bactericidal action of antibiotics due to tolerance."
10827436,"Project Summary
This proposal examines the mitofusin proteins, which catalyze both mitochondrial tethering and outer
membrane fusion. Mitochondrial shape is central to mitochondrial function and is closely linked to changes in
cellular physiology during development, stress, and aging. Mitochondrial fusion increases metabolic production,
protects against excessive degradation of mitochondria, reduces sensitivity of the cell to apoptotic stimuli and
allows functional complementation of damaged organelles. Compromised mitochondrial function and
decreased organelle connectivity are associated with neurodegeneration and other age-related diseases.
Furthermore, mutations in the genes encoding components of the mitochondrial fusion machine cause
peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, myopathy and ataxia. Both mitochondrial division and mitochondrial
fusion are mediated by conserved dynamin superfamily proteins. This diverse family of mechanochemical
GTPases couple self-assembly and conformational changes to membrane remodeling events throughout the
cell. Mitofusin is the mitochondrial outer membrane fusion machine and must assemble both in cis within a
single membrane, and in trans across two mitochondria. The molecular details, including of the composition of
these assemblies, the regulation of their formation and how they contribute to membrane tethering and fusion
are not known. We address these gaps in knowledge utilizing biochemical analyses of mitofusin function. In
Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms of allosteric regulation that control assembly of mitofusin into fusion-
competent complexes. Our collection of functional variants and novel approaches will provide a powerful tool
in dissecting the contribution of each mitofusin functional domain to cis oligomerization and trans complex
formation. Our work characterizing CMT2A-associated variants of mitofusin revealed that molecular defects of
mitofusin can be compensated for by cytosolic factors in cells. In Aim 2, we use a reductionist approach that
combines cell biology, biochemistry, and reconstituted assays developed in my lab to determine how the
cytosolic mitofusin effectors Bax and MSTO1 alter mitofusin assembly to regulate mitochondrial fusion. This
research program draws on our strengths in cellular and biochemical analysis of mitochondrial biology and will
yield fundamental insights not only for mitochondrial dynamics but for the mechanisms through which dynamin
superfamily proteins in general operate."

Functional specialization in a multicellular organism arises when cell fate is established by a specific gene
expression pattern. Epigenetic modifications working with transcription factors enable cell identity. During early
development a few cells migrate at the epiblast stage to the gonad to become Primordial germ cells (PGCs),
which are the precursors of gametes. PGCs undergo an ordered series of global epigenetic changes that
decimates the repressive modifications: H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me2) and DNA methylation, which
suppress expression of repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity, and is replaced by other marks such
as H2A/H4 arginine methylation (H2A/H4R3me2). How the precise temporal regulation of these epigenetic
events is coordinated and their interdependence remains poorly understood. Incorrect or partial erasure at
specific locations could lead to imprinting defects as well as inadvertent transgenerational inheritance. We
have discovered that the H3K9me2 demethylase, KDM3B, controls DNA demethylation by the Tet enzymes
and interacts with PRMT5, a H2A/H4R3 methyltransferase. Despite H3K9me2 being a repressive histone
modification, we have found that KDM3B and KDM3A interact with mRNA processing machinery. Taken
together we hypothesize that proteins of the KDM3 family orchestrate post-implantation development to PGCs
by epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms, which will be investigated in this proposal."

While several pharmacotherapies are currently available for nicotine dependence, smoking cessation is only 7.5%
successful. Recent advances in the study of genetic contributions to nicotine dependence represent a promising avenue
for the development of novel smoking cessation therapies. Our lab has shown that variations in the gene for Neuregulin
3 (NRG3) and its cognate receptor ErbB4 are linked to smoking cessation outcomes and may be responsible, in part, for
affective nicotine withdrawal (WD) phenotypes. Therefore, the overarching goal of this fellowship-training proposal is to
systematically investigate the region-specific, functional role of the Neuregulin Signaling Pathway during nicotine use and
WD. To accomplish this, we are evaluating two central aims: 1) Determine the PFC-specific contributions of ErbB4 to
nicotine WD related behavioral phenotypes and the mechanism by which they occur, and 2) Characterize expression
patterns of NRG3-ErbB4 signaling within the prefrontal cortex and identify the molecular alterations induced during
chronic nicotine and WD. Our approach is significant because it utilizes a novel genetic mouse model of nicotine
dependence in a multidimensional approach to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that define the NRG3
signaling pathway and its role in nicotine dependence. Research undertaken in this fellowship will be performed at the
University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy under the purview of the Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, a
multidisciplinary program designed to prepare motivated individuals for academic, industrial, or government careers in

The ability of neural stem cells to give rise to mature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis, is crucial for
the developing and adult mammalian brain. Dysregulation of this process has been associated with several
pathologies including cognitive impairment and depression. Thus, there has been an increased interest to
study neurogenesis as a potential therapeutic target to counteract these pathologies. Nuclear receptor
subfamily 2, group E, member 1 (NR2E1) has been considered a master regulator of neurogenesis. Loss of
Nr2e1 in the mouse model significantly impairs neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis,
ultimately leading to hippocampal hypoplasia and a decline in learning and memory. In contrast,
overexpression of Nr2e1 improves learning and memory and diminishes anxiety behaviors. Despite the
importance of Nr2e1 for neural stem cell biology and neurogenesis, we still do not know whether NR2E1 is
important in humans, whether NR2E1 genetic variants exist, and if so, whether they cause any pathology. To
answer these questions, we performed a thorough screening of multiple undiagnosed patient databases and
identified several patients with different NR2E1 de novo single nucleotide variants leading to missense
mutations in its coding sequence. All patients present with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and various
behavioral issues, from impulsive to aggressive behaviors. To establish causality, in this proposal we focus on
one identified mutation, I385T, located at the C-terminal of the NR2E1 ligand-binding domain. We hypothesize
that NR2E1 I385T mutation dysregulates neurogenesis by impairing NR2E1 function, leading to poor
learning and memory. To understand the molecular consequences of this mutation, we will first assess how
I385T affects NR2E1's ability to interact with its ligand and co-regulators using biophysical and in vitro assays
(Aim 1). Second, we will determine the cellular and behavioral effects of I385T mutation by studying it in two
complementary models: a CRISPR-Cas9 engineered mouse model (Aim 2) and a patient-derived human brain
organoid model (Aim 3). Mouse model studies will inform whether neurogenesis is impaired throughout life
from the embryonic stage to adulthood, resulting in behavioral anomalies. Patient-derived brain organoid
studies will inform how I385T mutation specifically affects early human neurogenesis. This is very important for
future attempts to develop small molecules to rescue NR2E1 activity in patients with this mutation. Overall, the
findings of this proposal will further our understanding of the causative relationship between NR2E1 mutation
and human pathology and pave the way for a personalized therapeutic approach for the affected individuals."

 The scalable and sustainable biosynthesis of terpenoid drugs like cyclopamine and diverse libraries of
terpenoid drug candidates will transform the treatment of disease. There are >30,000 unique plant
terpenoids and a valuable subset of these natural products have been approved by the FDA approved or
are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment, malaria treatment, symptom relief, and immune system
activation. Terpenoids can be biosynthesized in plants through expensive cultivation (i.e., time-, labor-, and
land-intensive), but these approaches can exhibit low and hypervariable yields. Plant terpenoids can also
be produced by chemical total synthesis and semi-synthesis. However, terpenoids can contain many chiral
centers (e.g., 10 in cyclopamine), resulting in complex syntheses with low overall yields. In contrast, the
production of terpenoids in engineered microorganisms is scalable, renewable, and inexpensive, often
producing complex terpenoids from simple sugars and salts. For example, an artemisinic acid-producing
yeast has resulted in 51 million treatments of artemisinin, contributing to the low current cost of artemisinin
anti-malarial combination therapies. This proposal aims to establish methods to accelerate the future
microbial biosynthesis of medicinal terpenoids. The full 30-step biosynthetic pathway for cyclopamine will
be constructed step-by-step in the brewer’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce cyclopamine from
simple sugars and salts and solve the challenge of sourcing this drug for the treatment of cancer. In addition,
S. cerevisiae will be engineered to produce sets of new-to-nature triterpenoids through the combinatorial
screening of enzymes with well-characterized activity. The studies will accelerate the microbial biosynthesis
of medicinal terpenoids and diverse libraries of terpenoid drug candidates."

The heart is an obligate aerobic organ, making it one of the highest oxygen consumers of any organ in the body.
Cardiac dependence on oxidative metabolism makes the heart particularly vulnerable to oxygen insufficiency,
which is observed in many diseases including ischemic heart disease and heart failure, as well as pulmonary
pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These constitute the leading causes of morbidity
and mortality in the world. The heart retains some ability to adapt to mild hypoxia, indicating that protective
pathways exist that could be harnessed to improve cardiac function in patients with chronic hypoxia pathologies.
Cardiomyocytes (CMs)—the parenchymal cell type of the heart—are metabolically flexible and can shift their
fuel source preference in response to hypoxia. This plasticity suggests that interventions that rewire CM
metabolic pathways can reduce tissue damage. However, our ability to design such interventions is currently
limited by our understanding of the molecular mediators of these metabolic changes. This proposal aims to gain
a systems-level understanding of the pathways that facilitate adaptive and maladaptive metabolic changes in
CMs in response to hypoxia, with the long-term goal of targeting these pathways as novel therapeutics. To
accomplish this, I have developed a functional genomics platform in iPSC-CMs. In a preliminary genome-wide
CRISPRi survival screen in iPSC-CMs in chronic hypoxia, my initial findings paradoxically suggest that
suppressing excessive accumulation of intracellular glucose may be protective in hypoxia. Interestingly, a related
clinical phenomenon supports this general concept – hyperglycemia at the time of ICU admission has been
shown to correlate with worse outcomes following MI or cardiac arrest, independent of diabetes status. These
findings suggest that shifting fuel sources is a central component of the (mal)adaptive hypoxic response. I
hypothesize that modulation of hypoxia-responsive fuel rewiring can serve as a therapeutic strategy to restore
CM function during cardiac pathologies caused by oxygen deprivation. I will test this hypothesis through three
separate aims. First, I will systematically identify the regulators of cardiomyocyte survival in pathological hypoxia
using a functional genomics screen. By creating nutrient limiting conditions, I will determine the pathways that
enable substrate switching in hypoxia. Second, I will determine the metabolic fates of glucose during CM hypoxia
using isotope tracer studies. Third, I will target glucose uptake and processing pathways genetically to restore
CM survival and electrophysiology during pathological hypoxia. These experiments will identify novel therapeutic
targets related to fuel rewiring in CMs and will provide mechanistic insights into cardiac glucose toxicity to enable
a further understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac hypoxia."
10850577,"Cancer-chemotherapy associated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has an adverse effect on
treatment outcomes in cancer patients. It leads to treatment interruptions and/or dose intensity reduction with
calamitous effects on tumor regression. Unfortunately, efforts at reducing CDI incidence in cancer patients
have been hampered by limited understanding of CDI pathophysiology and poor performance of established
predictors particularly in cytoreductive cancer chemotherapy (CCC) treated patients. Until more reliable
predictors of CDI in CCC patients are identified and the basic science of CDI development is understood,
efforts to curtail incidence and improve treatment strategies will remain inadequate. The research aims of this
proposal are focused on preventing CDI in CCC-treated patients while providing the training scaffold for Dr.
Apewokin's transition to becoming an independent physician-scientist with a focus on cancer supportive care.
 Protection against gastrointestinal infections in the normal host is mediated by many processes.
Immunoglobulins provide humoral protection while the endogenous gut microbial community structure favors
resistance to pathogenic organism colonization. We have demonstrated in pilot studies that cytoreductive
cancer chemotherapy modifies these factors and leads to reduction of CDI-specific immunoglobulins and gut
microbial diversity. We propose a conceptual model of CCC-associated CDI that captures these processes and
accordingly hypothesize that CCC-induced loss of CD-specific humoral protection and microbial diversity
transforms CD colonization to infection. To test this conceptual model we will establish that AIM #1,
CCC patients who develop CDI (cases) have lower CD-specific humoral protection. In AIM #2, CCC patients
who develop CDI (cases) have lower gut microbial diversity, and AIM#3, CCC patients who develop CDI
undergo clonal expansion of existing CD organisms during CCC. We will conduct a case-control study of 16
CDI-positive cases and 16 CDI-negative controls. We will use metagenomics and induced human intestinal
organoid models (iHIOs) as a model system to interrogate CDI development in CCC patients. iHIOs
recapitulate human physiology and disease pathology, and incorporate components critical to disease and
human host response. We will also employ shotgun sequencing to evaluate microbial factors contributing to
CDI during CCC. Integrating these state-of-the-art methodologies with collaborative synergistic research
approaches will allow us to characterize CDI pathophysiology and elucidate mechanisms that could not be
performed by traditional methods and models.Training in 1) protein toxin biology and quantification techniques,
2) molecular biology and metagenomics, 3) biostatistics and immunogenetics, and 4) clinical trial design will
serve as a vehicle for Dr.Apewokin to transition to become an independent physician-scientist competitive
for external R type awards. A mentoring team consisting of complementary renowned experts -Drs. A.
Weiss, P. Scaglioni, D. Haslam and T. Mersha - has been assembled to achieve this goal."

 The TGFβ pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis and overall health of articular
cartilage. However, the diminished expression of the TGFβ receptor (Tgfbr2) in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage
hampers the utilization of TGF-β1 as a therapeutic treatment for OA. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to
identify the key downstream mediators as well as potential therapeutic targets that are regulated by TGFβ1.
 We performed an unbiased multi-omics screening combining RNA-seq, ATAC-seq as well as
metabolomics, and establish that TGFβ1 maintains articular chondrocyte homeostasis at least partially through
suppression of lipid metabolism. We have shown that Nuclear Factor I A (NFIA) is a crucial transcription
factor in the regulation of lipid metabolism in articular chondrocytes. Specifically, TGFβ1 reduces Nfia
expression in murine articular chondrocyte, while increased Nfia expression is observed in Tgfbr2
loss-of-function (LOF) chondrocytes and human OA articular chondrocytes. Mechanistically, Nfia physically
binds to the promoter regions of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase a (Acaca) and Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2)
genes, which are rate-limiting enzymes for fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, respectively. Consequently, Nfia
overexpression in articular chondrocytes induces the expression of both Acaca and Cpt2. Conversely, Nfia
inhibition results in the suppression of the elevated expression of Acaca and Cpt2 in Tgfbr2 LOF chondrocytes.
More importantly, NFIA LOF restores lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis in human OA articular
chondrocytes, and Nfia gene ablation in articular cartilage attenuates injury-induced OA progression in mice.
Thus, Nfia represents a potential therapeutic target for OA. Based on these novel findings, our central
hypothesis proposes that TGFβ1 maintains articular cartilage homeostasis by suppressing lipid metabolism
through Nfia inhibition, and lipid metabolism is a viable and highly innovative target for OA treatment.
 Two Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will establish Nfia as a downstream mediator of the
TGFβ pathway in regulating articular chondrocyte lipid metabolism and homeostasis in mice. Complementary
in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches along with metabolomics analyses will be employed to establish
TGFβ/Nfia-regulated lipid metabolism as a critical pathway necessary for articular chondrocyte homeostasis.
Specific Aim 2 will define Nfia-mediated lipid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.
We will investigate if cartilage specific Nfia LOF abolishes the increase in lipid metabolism and attenuates OA
progression associated with obesity and aging in mice. Single cell RNA-seq and metabolomics will be used to
establish the mechanism behind the whole joint protection.
 In summary, this proposal will advance our understanding of mechanisms regulating lipid metabolism in
OA disease and define Nfia mediated lipid metabolism as a novel target to treat OA."

Mpox (formerly monkeypox) virus (MPXV) is a serious global health concern that recently caused a significant
outbreak in the United States, resulting in over 30,000 infections. MPXV infections are known to cause high rates
of fetal demise, particularly with clade I MPXV which is endemic in Central Africa. It is unclear whether clade IIb
MPXV, which circulated worldwide and within the United States, also causes adverse pregnancy outcomes
because the outbreak is so recent. Defining the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes and whether vertical
transmission occurs with clade IIb MPXV is a critical public global health challenge. In addition, it is uncertain
whether the antiviral drug tecovirimat, currently used off label to treat mpox disease, can improve pregnancy
outcomes when administered early in the course of infection during pregnancy. Determining whether early
treatment with tecovirimat improves pregnancy outcomes is essential for informing clinical management.
We developed a preclinical rhesus macaque model of prenatal Zika virus infection, defined vertical transmission
pathways, and assessed adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will adapt this expertise to develop a preclinical
rhesus macaque model of mpox disease in pregnancy. We hypothesize that MPXV will be vertically transmitted
with inoculation in early gestation, that there will be an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes with maternal
infection, and that the antiviral drug tecovirimat will decrease maternal disease and improve pregnancy
outcomes. We propose the following aims to test these hypotheses.
Aim 1: To define the rate and pathways of vertical transmission following MPXV infection in early pregnancy.
Aim 2: To define the association between maternal mpox disease severity and pregnancy outcomes following
MPXV infection in early pregnancy.
Aim 3: To determine if early antiviral treatment improves maternal mpox disease and pregnancy outcomes.
Accomplishing these aims will fill a significant knowledge gap in our clinical management of pregnant persons
infected with MPXV: whether infection results in a higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, whether vertical
transmission occurs, and whether early administration of tecovirimat improves maternal mpox disease and
pregnancy outcomes. Given the limited clinical trial data on mpox in pregnant women, the findings from this
study will be pivotal in informing future clinical trials and improving the clinical management of pregnant women
with MPXV infection, leading to better health outcomes for both mothers and infants."

 A subset of patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) develop severe alcoholic hepatitis
(AH), carrying a very poor prognosis. Control of inflammation is a key to the treatment of AH. Hepatic
lymphatics are highly involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response by discharging extravasated
fluids, inflammatory mediators, antigens, and antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes outside the liver.
However, how the hepatic lymphatic system is involved in the development of ALD remains largely unknown.
The goal of this exploratory study is to advance our understanding of hepatic lymphatics in the progression of
AH and explore whether increasing lymphatic vessels (LVs) and lymphatic drainage can be a novel therapeutic
strategy for AH.
 Given that lymphatics generally help to reduce tissue inflammation, we hypothesize that chronic
alcohol consumption may impair hepatic lymphatic endothelial cell (EC) function and lymphatic drainage,
facilitating the progression to AH. Contrarily, enhancing lymphangiogenesis (new LV formation) via
overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, the most potent lymphangiogenic factor, may
ameliorate AH. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following two Aims:
Aim 1. Determine the role of the hepatic lymphatic system in AH.
Aim 2. Explore the potential of the VEGF-C mRNA LNP (lipid nanoparticle) technology for the treatment of
severe AH.
 This study will explore an important, but poorly understood subject, liver lymphatics in ALD, addressing
the effect of alcohol on hepatic lymphatic functions and its implications in the development of AH. Results from
the two Aims above will provide the foundation for many future studies to advance our understanding of the
lymphatic system in liver disease in general and AH in particular, including a study addressing the molecular
mechanism of lymphatic impairment by alcohol as well as a study aiming at clinical use of VEGF-C mRNA-LNP
for the treatment of AH."

 As the population ages, the prevalence and risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia
(ADRD) is expected to increase with even greater risk for Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx groups. Historical
and contemporary structural racism in the form of residential segregation is a fundamental cause of health
disparities that may contribute to ADRD inequities. However, residential segregation in some communities
may inadvertently lead to formation of ethnic enclaves where higher concentration and proportion of some
ethnic groups may be protective against the negative effects of segregation. Some studies found that
higher residential segregation is associated with greater cognitive decline and higher risk for ADRD, but
other found that it may be protective. It is unclear how lifecourse residential segregation is associated with
cognitive decline and risk for ADRD. This project will determine the relationship of lifecourse
residential segregation with ADRD using measures of incident ADRD, cognition and neuroimaging
brain biomarkers. Furthermore, we will explore how education and poverty rates may mediate the
relationship of segregation and ADRD risk.
 We will use data from the KHANDLE and STAR cohort studies, two longitudinal cohort studies of
racial/ethnically diverse participants of older-adults residing in the Northern California area. Measures of
residential segregation indices of evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering will be
derived from decennial census data from 1970s to 2010s and linked with historical addresses of
participants across 7 timepoints (birth, ages 5, 10, 18, 30, 40, 65). Causal inferences models will be used
to (Aim 1) examine the association of lifecourse residential segregation and cognition for approximately
2476 participants and (Aim 3) examine 614 subset of participants with MRI markers of brain health.
Mediation analysis (Aim 2) will be conducted for educational quality and attainment, and poverty rates to
assess the impact of proximal and distal social determinants of health on the relationship between
residential segregation and late-life cognition.
 As of current, this is the first study to our knowledge that will examine the lifecourse timing and
duration of residential segregation with cognitive decline and risk for ADRD in multiple racial groups. This
study present opportunities to comprehensively assess the effects of lifecourse residential segregation,
significantly improving our understanding of structural racism on late-life cognitive outcomes and ADRD.
Findings from this study may inform decision-making policies on equitable home lending, and
neighborhood reform for healthy cognitive aging. With the support of an exemplary team of experts, the
applicant will be trained and enhanced with skills, research proficiency, and rigorous methodology needed
to carry out this project and advanced his career as a researcher on health disparities."

Optimizing treatments in mental health requires an easy to obtain, continuous, and objective measure of internal
mood. Unfortunately, current standard-of-care clinical scales are sparsely sampled, subject to recency bias,
underutilized, and are not validated for acute mood monitoring. The recent shift to remote care also requires
novel methods to measure internal mood. Recent advances in computer vision have allowed the accurate
quantification of observable speech patterns and facial representations. The continuous and objective nature
of these audio-facial behavioral outputs also enable the study of their neural correlates. Here, we hypothesize
that video-derived audio-facial behaviors have discrete neural representations in the limbic network and can
provide a critical set of reliable longitudinal estimates of mood at low cost across home and clinic settings.
To test our hypothesis, we will enroll ten surgical epilepsy patients with comorbid major depression already
undergoing surgical implantation for clinical reasons. We will obtain simultaneous video-derived audio-facial
features, invasive brain recordings, and frequent assessments of mood. In Aim 1, we will combine continuous
video recordings with frequent mood assessments to build a longitudinal mood prediction model using video-
derived audio-facial features. In Aim 2, we will identify neural correlates of audio-facial dynamics using
synchronized intracranial EEG under spontaneous and task settings. In Aim 3, we will use high frequency direct
electrical stimulation to determine the causal influence of limbic activity on audio-facial features and internal
mood.
The result of this study is a mood-decoding model based on audio-facial behavioral features that are causally
linked to limbic activity and mood. This model will allow for objective, passive, longitudinal, remotely-enabled,
and low-resource measurements of internal mood. Multiple use cases exist to significantly advance psychiatric
care, ranging from acute mood tracking to optimize rapidly-acting interventions such as psychedelics and
neurostimulation, to longitudinal telehealth-enabled monitoring for suicide risk monitoring, treatment dose
optimization, and relapse prediction. Across inpatient, outpatient, and at-home settings, this model can deliver
important real-time mood and electrophysiological insights to both patients and providers.

There is growing evidence that neuronal activity contributes to glioma proliferation and progression, but the
molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Moreover, there has been limited study of
how endogenous neuronal activity, including spontaneous epileptic activity and sensory stimulus-evoked activity
affects glioma cells. A clearer mechanistic understanding of glioma responses to neuronal activity is critical to
identify novel therapeutic avenues. A consequence of neuronal hyperactivity and seizures is ATP release. The
purinergic receptor P2RX7 is expressed in human glioma and activated by high concentrations of extracellular
ATP, resulting in calcium influx. Calcium influx has been broadly implicated in glioma progression and shown to
be a functionally relevant consequence of neuron-glioma crosstalk. However, the role of P2RX7 in glioma has
not been well elucidated, and its role in tumor-promoting crosstalk between neurons and glioma cells has not
been studied. This proposal will investigate purinergic signaling as a means by which neuronal activity leads to
glioma progression at the infiltrative cortical margin. Aims 1 and 2 will utilize glioma cells genetically engineered
to express fluorescent reporters of calcium influx (GCaMP6s) and extracellular ATP (GRABATP1.0). In Aim 1, in
vitro imaging of glioma cells and ex vivo imaging and electrophysiology of acute tumor slices will be performed
to determine the function of purinergic receptors in glioma cell calcium responses to neuronal activity. Aim 1 will
also investigate the effects of purinergic signaling on glioma cell proliferation and assess P2RX7 expression in
human glioma at the infiltrative margin. Aim 2 will employ an orthotopic diffusely infiltrating GCaMP6s glioma
model that elicits neuronal pathology, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In vivo two-photon imaging and
two-color wide field optical mapping of neurons and glioma cells will be used to assess the effects of neuronal
activity, including epileptic events and stimulus-evoked activity, on glioma cell calcium activity and progression.
In both aims, purinergic signaling in glioma cells will be perturbed by P2RX7 knockout or the brain-permeable
P2RX7 inhibitor Brilliant Blue G to investigate its function in neuron-glioma crosstalk and glioma cell proliferation
and progression. As part of a comprehensive training plan, this project will be conducted at Columbia University
Irving Medical Center under the mentorship of my sponsor in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of
physician- and basic scientists who will provide all the expertise and resources needed for me to develop a
strong foundation in brain tumor biology, ex vivo electrophysiology, and in vivo brain imaging, and an enhanced
ability to reason through research challenges. Clinical training will occur at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, home
to the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center and Neurological Institute of New York. Integrated research
and clinical training will provide insight into clinical applications of basic brain tumor research and facilitate
mentorship by a dedicated group of clinical and research faculty. This fellowship will support a long-term goal for
a career as an independent physician-scientist working at the intersection of neuroscience and neuro-oncology."

Adoptive cellular therapies (ACTs) have made remarkable advances in the treatment of hematological
malignancies. However, remarkable outcomes are confined to a subset of patients with blood cancers and have
not been achieved in individuals with solid tumors, which account for 90% of adult cancers. Therefore, innovative
approaches to overcome these limitations are essential to address the substantial unmet need for effective
cellular therapies. We hypothesize that the answer may come from an unlikely source, T cell neoplasms. T cells
in T cell neoplasms have developed genetic means to improve T cell fitness and overcome some of the same
obstacles faced by therapeutic T cells. Our group has pioneered a pipeline using lymphoid neoplasm mutations
as a method to address the obstacles faced by therapeutic T cells. We found a novel gene fusion, CARD11-
PIK3R3, that dramatically increases accumulation, effector function, and anti-tumor efficacy of adoptively
transferred cells in an antigen dependent manner in multiple TCR-transgenic T cell models. These results have
been demonstrated in fully immunocompetent murine models without lymphodepletion, with no evidence of
lymphomagenesis or toxic effects. Preliminary data from our group suggests that these fusion expressing cells
have unique cytokine profiles and increased effector function in vitro. However, the mechanisms by which they
enhance anti-tumor immunity in vivo is still unclear. Therefore, in this proposal we aim to mechanistically dissect
the pathways that govern this unique phenotype and strong anti-tumor immunity. Our preliminary in vivo data
suggest that these fusion expressing cells have increased stemness, polyfunctionality, and are able to resist T
cell exhaustion. In Aim 1, we will utilize in vivo models and single cell -omics to determine the transcriptional,
epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms that allow CARD11-PIK3R3 expressing cells to resist exhaustion. In Aim
2, we will Identify how CARD11-PIK3R3 T cells affect the immune populations in the tumor microenvironment to
promote anti-tumor immunity, and determine whether those populations are necessary and sufficient to increase
therapeutic efficacy of the fusion. Preliminary data form our lab has already shown enhanced recruitment of certain
cell populations in CARD11-PIK3R3 treated tumors. Using multiple transgenic mouse models to selectively deplete
certain cell population, we will uncover important interactions in the tumor microenvironment. My overall career goal
is to become a successful, independent physician-scientist. The rigorous training plan proposed in this fellowship
will allow me to achieve that goal by gaining research skills and knowledge in cellular immunology, cancer
signaling pathways, epigenetics, and metabolism. I will be mentored by Dr. Jaehyuk Choi, an expert and role-
model physician-scientist, who has devised a rigorous training plan to develop all necessary research skills,
communication skills, and promote my professional development. This fellowship will broaden our understanding
of T cell phenotypes and signaling, and identify potential novel therapeutic strategies to improve adoptive cellular
therapies, as well as provide the necessary foundation for my future career as a physician-scientist."

 Increasing evidence suggests that maternal inflammation/infection-induced immune activation (MIA)
during pregnancy can lead to sustained, long-lasting changes in immune function of the offspring, which could
alter disease susceptibility later in life. During pregnancy, the developing fetus is continuously exposed to a
variety of factors at the maternal-fetal interface that can have a significant influence on fetal immune
development. The fetal immune system is characterized by the development of innate and innate-like immune
cells possessing highly specialized functions distinct from their adult-derived counterparts. One example, and the
focus of this proposal, are the innate-like γδ T cells. γδ T cells are unusual tissue-resident T cells that play critical
roles in infectious disease, tumor surveillance, and autoimmunity. Unlike their conventional αβ T cell
counterparts, innate-like γδ T cell subsets are programmed to acquire function during thymic development, and
they appear to retain this programming indefinitely. Interestingly, in both humans and mice some γδ T cell subsets
are functionally programmed in the fetal thymus in carefully orchestrated developmental waves, and the best
available data suggests these fetal-derived γδ T cell subsets are maintained as continuously self-renewing
populations in the adult. These data suggest that innate-like fetal γδ T cell development is especially vulnerable to
maternal immune activation during pregnancy. Here, we propose to examine whether maternal
inflammation/infection during pregnancy will impact fetal thymic innate-like γδ T cell development, which
in turn could have long-lasting effects on γδ T cell phenotype and function in neonates and/or adults. Our
preliminary studies support the notion that maternal immune activation can have a significant effect on fetal
thymic γδ T cell development and that this effect can persist to the neonatal stage. To test this hypothesis, we
propose to combine a single cell proteogenomics workflow customized for γδ T cell analysis, and a clinically
relevant model of viral lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. We will use these tools and others to:
i) delineate the effect of maternal immune activation on thymic γδ T cell transcriptional and epigenetic landscape
at different gestational ages, ii) define the mechanisms through which maternal immune activation affects thymic
γδ T cell development, and iii) determine the impact of a placenta-tropic virus infection on fetal γδ T cell
development. The proposed studies represent the first critical and comprehensive assessment of the influence of
maternal immune activation on γδ T development in the fetus and neonate. They will be critical in informing both
our understanding of both γδ T cell biology, and in our understanding of how maternal environment shapes pre-
natal immune development."

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) cause progressive, irreversible vision loss and most are currently untreatable.
Pathogenic variants in over 300 genes are implicated in IRDs, and variants within a single gene can cause
diverse retinal phenotypes, which makes therapeutic development challenging. As an alternative to genetic
strategies which are disease-specific, we propose that gene agnostic approaches using small molecule drugs
have the potential to treat multiple IRDs independent of their genetic etiology. Our studies on mouse models of
IRDs have identified cholesterol and ceramide as common pathogenic drivers of retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) dysfunction that culminates in retinal degeneration. Accumulation of these lipids facilitates complement-
induced mitochondrial injury in the RPE, infiltration of microglia into the sub-retinal space, and eventually
photoreceptor loss. Here, we will evaluate therapeutic efficacy of two small molecule drugs, a clinically approved
bisphosphonate that inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis and ceramide generation (Aim 1) and a pan-adiponectin
receptor agonist that stimulates ceramidase activity and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (Aim 2), in mouse
models of Stargardt disease and Batten disease. We will test the hypothesis that these drugs act as “triple
threats” by lowering cholesterol and ceramide and protecting RPE mitochondria, thereby preventing microglial
activation and retinal degeneration. We will use cutting-edge techniques such as intravital imaging of drug
distribution, super-resolution imaging of mitochondrial dynamics in the living mouse retina, lipidomics,
transcriptomics, and noninvasive evaluation of retinal structure and function to establish the ability of these drugs
to safeguard the RPE and retina in disease models. These drugs have documented safety profiles and reach
the retina in therapeutically effective concentrations after systemic administration, circumventing the need
for invasive delivery. Therefore, they hold immense promise as novel, powerful, gene-independent
therapeutics for IRDs."

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is noninvasive method for brain stimulation and is an FDA-
approved treatment for major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. It also shows promise in treating
numerous other neurological and psychiatric disorders. High frequency (HF) rTMS targeting prefrontal cortex
(PFC), the original and most widely used paradigm, is thought to exert its therapeutic effects by enhancing
cortical excitability. However, clinical outcomes following HF-rTMS treatment are variable, and the detailed
mechanisms of action are not known. Previous mechanistic studies have been limited by a lack of established
animal models of rTMS with strong face validity. Our lab has acquired the first rodent TMS coil capable of
generating focal, suprathreshold stimulation of individual cortical regions in the rodent brain. I will use this coil
to determine how in vivo chronic HF-rTMS modifies prefrontal excitatory neurons and which projection classes
underlie improved behavioral outcomes. By combining rTMS with cutting edge neuroscience tools, I will test
the hypothesis that HF-rTMS specifically induces structural plasticity in intratelencephalic (IT) circuits and that
activation of these circuits underlies HF-rTMS-induced changes in behavior. In Aim 1, I will determine how and
where chronic HF-rTMS induces synaptic changes by using sparse fluorescent labeling of excitatory neurons
in PFC to quantify dendritic spine density. In Aim 2, I will use chemogenetic approaches to determine whether
subclasses of prefrontal neurons underlie behavioral effects of HF-rTMS. This proposal addresses a pressing
need to understand which circuits mediate the effects of HF-rTMS on behavior. This research will inform the
rational design of more effective rTMS treatments that precisely target specific deficits underlying the
pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders."

 The most fundamental event in the initiation of hearing is the conversion of sound into an electrical signal
by the opening of ion channels in hair cells. We know that TMC1 and TMC2 are the pore-forming subunits of
the mechanotransduction complex, we know the general tertiary structure of TMCs, and we know which
transmembrane domains constitute the pore. But we now need to know specifically how the sound-evoked
increase in tip-link tension leads to channel opening: how does PCDH15 in the tip link attach to TMC1, what
moves in TMC1 to open the pore, and how does tension propagate through the TMC channel to cause that
opening?
 In this project we will first identify the parts of PCDH15 that bind to TMC1, using a combination of co-
immunoprecipitation, biolayer interferometry, protein biochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, and single-cell
electrophysiology. Mutagenesis will be guided by cryo-electron microscopy of a related TMC channel and by
new atomic structures generated by structure-prediction software such as AlphaFold2. We will then identify
the parts of TMC1 that bind to PCDH15, using the same methods. In parallel, we will evaluate recent data from
other laboratories on regions of LHFPL5 that bind to TMC1.
 To understand the gating of TMC1, we will use additional protein structure predictions from AlphaFold2
to identify different conformational states of TMC1 that may represent open and closed states of the channel.
Combining knowledge of the binding interface and the predicted gating transitions, we can use molecular
dynamics to determine whether and how the application of force—through either PCDH15 or LHFPL5—tends
to produce channel opening.
 We will then test the models generated by molecular dynamics, by introducing cysteine residues at key
locations in TMC and transiently linking them with heavy metal ions or bivalent MTS reagents. These bridges
will lock TMC in one or another conformation. By expressing different cysteine mutants in hair cells and
applying these reagents while recording transduction currents, we can determine whether open or closed states
are favored, and thereby test the predicted gating movements. We will also test whether predicted movement
of an intracellular loop drives the gating movement, by inserting flexible peptide sequences.
 This will generate an atomic-level understanding of mechanotransduction, unprecedented for hair cells
or for any eukaryotic force-gated ion channel. It will also provide deep insight into the function of TMC1 and
PCDH15, and how mutations in these proteins cause hereditary deafness."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease believed to be driven
by protease-antiprotease imbalance. The mechanisms leading to this imbalance have yet to be fully
understood. Recent work has suggested that exosomes (small nanovesicles released by cells) from
activated neutrophils (PMNs) are coated in neutrophil elastase (NE) from degranulated PMNs and this
exosome associated NE renders it protected from its native antiprotease, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT).
This resistance to α1AT makes exosome associated NE several log-fold more potent in causing a COPD
disease-like phenotype in mouse models than free NE in solution. These PMN exosomes can bind to
type I collagen and degrade structural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Of bigger significance, these
PMN derived NE+ exosomes can cause alveolar destruction in a mouse model and these NE+ exosomes
can be found in the BALF of COPD patients, but not healthy never smoker controls, indicating an
important role for exosome associated NE in COPD disease progression. This grant will identify the
mechanism of NE association to the surface of PMN exosomes as well as focusing on molecules to
disrupt this association, rendering the NE susceptible to α1AT inactivation. Furthermore, this grant will
develop a smoking mouse model of NE+ PMN exosome production and disease transfer to naïve mice,
effectively creating a mouse-mouse transfer model of disease. Additionally, this grant will correlate the
presence of PMN NE+ exosomes in COPD patient BALF with other significant parameters of COPD
severity. Moreover, PMN derived NE+ exosomes from other, less invasive patient fluid samples, serum
and sputum, will be quantified and their ability to transfer disease to mouse model of COPD will be
compared to those from patient BALF. Additionally, substances studied that can dissociate NE from the
exosome surface can be developed into potential therapeutic targets."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, causing a neurodegenerative cascade,
accompanied by two hallmarks of AD pathology: the accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins
into amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Numerous investigational therapies have been
unsuccessful at treating cognitive impairment in AD patients. This may be because therapies were given too
late in the course of the disease, which has sparked recent investigation into alternative mechanisms emerging
prior to Aβ plaque pathology. Recent studies in AD patients and models of disease have shown circuit
hyperexcitability, or an abnormal increase in excitatory neuron firing, occurs prior to Aβ plaque pathology and
cognitive impairment. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical circuit hyperexcitability in early AD is
related to a suppression in fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneuron (PV-INT) firing. The most common
GABAergic interneuron type, PV-INTs typically maintain the excitatory-inhibitory balance by synapsing onto
nearby excitatory principal neurons to inhibit their firing. Our preliminary data from an early-stage AD mouse
model expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) indicates that PV-INTs in the lateral entorhinal
cortex (LEC) are particularly vulnerable, showing reduced firing which results in overall network
hyperexcitability in the LEC. Others have shown that circuit overexcitation may promote pathological tau in
excitatory neurons, however, the impact on activity at the neuronal and circuit level remain unclear.
Conversely, it is unknown whether a causal link exists between PV-INT dysfunction and pathological tau
progression. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine 1. How pathological tau effects the intrinsic
excitability of neurons, and 2. How PV-INT dysregulation alters pathological tau. In Aim 1, I predict that
pathological tau suppresses excitatory neuron firing, and thus will dampen hAPP-related hyperexcitability in the
LEC. I will use adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) in mice to express the human tau gene (hMAPT) and/or
hAPP. Neuron- and circuit-level changes in excitability will be assessed using patch-clamp electrophysiology.
In Aim 2, I predict that PV-INT hypoactivity results in circuit hyperexcitability, and thus a direct suppression of
PV-INT firing will increase pathological tau in excitatory neurons. I will use AAV-delivered chemogenetics
under direction of a PV-INT-selective enhancer to suppress firing in these neurons. Changes in pathological
tau burden will be assessed using immunohistochemistry. Together, the results of this proposal will provide
clarity on the role of pathological tau as an initial compensatory response to normalize the network balance in

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. With increasing public
knowledge of cancer risk factors and screening, the incidence of CRC has steadily decreased in individuals over
the age of 50 over the last several decades. However, the incidence of CRC in younger populations has been
on the rise. Individuals under the age of 50 are increasingly afflicted by light-at-night exposure, night-shift work,
and erratic eating patterns, which are known to disrupt the circadian clock. Importantly, disruption of circadian
rhythms is a known risk factor for CRC. Therefore, it is likely that disruption of the circadian clock is a contributing
factor for the alarming increase in early-onset CRC cases. This emerging link between the circadian clock and
cancer has enormous potential for cancer prevention strategies. While causal links are clear, the underlying
mechanism of how the circadian clock impinges on antitumor immunity to create a permissive environment for
tumorigenesis is unknown. The goal of this project is to understand how both genetic and environmental circadian
clock disruption alter the immune landscape to promote tumorigenesis. Our preliminary findings suggest that
disruption of the circadian clock promotes inflammation and alters host immunity. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that clock disruption promotes inflammation to create an immunosuppressive
microenvironment suitable for cancer initiation and progression. This central hypothesis will be addressed
with the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how clock disruption alters the in vivo immune landscape
through the activation of MDSCs and the suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Aim 2 will define the molecular
mechanism for how clock disruption impacts host immunity to accelerate tumorigenesis through the Wnt
signaling pathway and MYC. The outcome of our findings will define the mechanistic underpinning linking
disruption of the circadian clock to altered host anti-tumor immunity. The long-term goal of this study is to improve
cancer prevention and treatment through lifestyle and pharmacological manipulation of the link between the
circadian clock and the immune system."

The management of metastatic bladder/upper tract (urothelial) cancer has been transformed over the past five
years, with FDA approval of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, an FGFR-selective kinase inhibitor, and most recently
two antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Despite these advances, most patients with metastatic urothelial cancer
still die from their disease. The HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (encoded by the ERBB2 gene) is implicated in
the pathogenesis of several cancer types, and drugs that target HER2 have an established role in the
management of breast, lung, and esophagogastric cancers. While HER2 mutations and/or amplification are
present in approximately 20% of metastatic urothelial cancers, older HER2-targeted antibodies and kinase
inhibitors had only modest clinical activity in urothelial cancer. Unprecedented clinical activity was recently
demonstrated with a new generation of HER2-directed ADCs in breast and lung cancers resistant to older HER2-
targeted therapies, including HER2-low breast cancer and ERBB2-mutated lung cancer. The current proposal is
based on 1) preliminary data indicating frequent mutational discordance of ERBB2 in paired primary and
metastatic tumors collected from individual patients with urothelial cancer; and 2) durable responses to second-
generation HER2-directed ADCs in a subset of patients with HER2-expressingurothelial cancer. We hypothesize
that pre-existing HER2 expression heterogeneity will be a common mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted
ADCs in urothelial cancer and that molecular imaging can identify those patients most likely to achieve durable
responses. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a largest-of-its-kind prospective molecular characterization
effort and a novel molecular imaging platform (89Zr-ss-pertuzumab PET) to define the prevalence of HER2
expression heterogeneity in urothelial cancer, its association with ERBB2 mutational status, and its impact on
HER2-targeted ADC response. We will accomplish these translational objectives through three broad
approaches: 1) We will perform molecular analyses of paired primary and metastatic tumors collected from
patients with urothelial cancer; 2) We will explore the extent of lesion-to-lesion HER2 heterogeneity in metastatic
urothelial cancer using a bespoke HER2 PET imaging platform (89Zr-ss-pertuzumab PET); and 3) We will use
89Zr-ss-pertuzumab PET and tumors collected before treatment and at the time of disease progression on HER2-
targeted ADCs to study the impact of HER2 heterogeneity on the durability of response to this novel drug class.
Mechanisms of HER2 ADC resistance will be functionally explored using patient-derived urothelial cancer
organoid and xenograft models. Given the promising clinical activity of HER2-directed ADCs in patients with
urothelial cancer, we predict that the studies proposed will directly influence the design of future clinical trials of
HER2-targeted therapies for patients and establish the clinical utility of HER2 PET as a predictive biomarker of
response in patients with urothelial cancer being considered for HER2-targeted therapy."
10856394,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Each year in the U.S., over 3 million people survive critical illness only to experience long-term physical,
cognitive, and psychological impairments that contribute to ongoing morbidity, mortality, and high-cost, high-
utilization healthcare needs. Current fragmented, deficit-based health services delivery contributes to poor
outcomes and preventable rehospitalizations. In response to this gap, we used community engagement to
redesign a pragmatic, accessible, scalable, strengths-based care model that integrates 3 essential elements:
(1) transitional care management; (2) problem-solving rehabilitation; and (3) family support. The result is
the PIC-TRFS, which stands for Post-Intensive Care Transitional care, Rehabilitation, and Family Support.
PIC-TRFS is a hybrid in-person and telehealth intervention delivered by an interdisciplinary team to nimbly
support health, rehabilitation, and social care needs in collaboration with existing hospital, home health, and
primary care infrastructure across transitions from hospital to home in the six months following a critical illness
hospitalization. An ongoing pilot is demonstrating feasibility, acceptability, and engagement among survivors,
caregivers, and providers across the post-ICU continuum. This proposal represents the next step: a single-
center randomized controlled trial to establish the efficacy of PIC-TRFS. Compared to Enhanced Usual Care
(n=80), we hypothesize that PIC-TRFS (n=80) will: (1) improve survivor-and caregiver outcomes including
survivor quality of life (primary outcome), days alive at home, function, trauma symptoms, and caregiver quality
of life (secondary outcomes); and (2) reduce healthcare utilization, measured as a composite of days in a
healthcare facility, ED visits, and outpatient visits (secondary outcomes) (Aim 1). Assessing fidelity to
intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment will inform potential tweaks to PIC-TRFS and resource planning
for future implementation research (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the extent to which clinical and social
vulnerability moderate the impact of PIC-TRFS and dyadic activation, participation, and access to community
services mediate it (Aim 3). Successful conduct of this RCT will establish the efficacy of PIC-TRFS, generate
insight into mechanisms of action, identify groups for whom it requires further adaptation to promote equity,
and inform its subsequent implementation. It will be a major step toward the goals of expanded access to high-
quality, affordable care via scalable models of integrated service delivery. It is also a pragmatic step towards
realizing the AHRQ’s broader vision for implementing learning health systems that continually innovate to
optimize the delivery of safe, effective, equitable, accessible, high-quality care."

RASopathies, pleiomorphic genetic disorders altering RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,
are treated symptomatically. Recent data suggest that the MAPK pathway inhibitor trametinib can reverse
severe heart and lymphatic involvement in some patients; not all patients respond to MEKis, and powerful
inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling has toxic side effects. Thus, development of alternative RASopathy drugs
with favorable side effect profiles is an unmet medical need. To achieve that goal, we developed a RASopathy
drug development platform using transgenic Drosophila, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), and
mouse models. We identified the RAS binding domain (RBD) mimetic rigosertib as highly efficacious. From
chemical screening, we identified a novel compound, M1, with modest activity and then improved its efficacy
substantially. The two lead M1-logs are almost certainly not kinase inhibitors. The bona fide targets for
rigosertib and the M1-logs in the RASopathies are unknown. Identifying their targets represents an exciting
opportunity for advancing therapies for RASopathies and may have relevance for other disorders with altered
RAS signaling. In Aim 1, we will take three complementary approaches to identify rigosertib's protein targets in
RASopathies. Using Drosophila genetics, we will determine functional targets of rigosertib and assess if
perturbation of microtubule biology contributes to rigosertib's RASopathy efficacy. Using targets identified that
way, we will look for physical proximity of rigosertib with putative targets in iPSC-derived RASopathy
cardiomyocytes (CMs) using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer with nanoluciferase (NanoBRET).
Finally, we will determine the impact of knock-down of the best target genes on the CM phenotype using
CRISPR interference. In Aim 2, we will assess existing rigosertib analogs (rigo-logs) against our RASopathy fly
models. Analogs with improved efficacy will be tested for rescue of hypertrophy in RAF1-mutant CMs. The best
rigo-log will be tested head-to-head with rigosertib and trametinib in the Raf1 mouse model, looking at
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy regression. In Aim 3, we will take two complementary strategies to identify the
targets of our lead M1-logs. First, we will use a photoaffinity strategy, derivatizing M1-logs with a minimalist tag
and then using those to tag putative targets. Isolated proteins will be identified using mass spectrometry.
Second, we will use un-derivatized M1-logs for a physicochemical approach to target identification called
proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA). For both approaches, we will confirm target validity using
Drosophila genetic approaches and NanoBRET. The proposed research will provide new insights into the
therapeutic mechanisms of rigosertib and M1-logs for the RASopathies. This may include discovery of
rigosertib analogs with efficacy exceeding rigosertib itself. As the M1-logs are novel and not kinase inhibitors,
their targets are expected to provide new approaches for targeting RASopathies and other disorders with RAS-
MAPK gain of function, including many cancers."

Men and women have differing vulnerabilities to alcohol. For example, men develop Alcohol Use Disorder at
higher rates but research shows that women may escalate their drinking faster and be more motivated to
resume use following abstinence. Preclinical research in animals consistently demonstrates higher rates of
consumption in females and that gonadal sex, chromosomal sex, and alcohol exposure interact to influence
levels of alcohol intake. In regards to chromosomal sex and alcohol drinking behaviors, a subset of genes of
interest on the X chromosome are of potential interest because of their ability to escape transcriptional
repression in brain tissues. The central hypothesis driving the proposed studies is that X chromosome dosage
influences alcohol consumption through overexpression of these genes, but that these effects may depend on
gonadal status or alcohol exposure history. Our experiments will test this hypothesis through completion of
three primary aims. We will 1) demonstrate that alcohol consumption is reduced in mice with two (i.e., XX) vs.
one (i.e., XY or XO) copies of the X chromosome, 2) determine whether a history of alcohol exposure alters
expression of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation in the brain and whether these effects depend on
gonadal status, and 3) identify the candidate gene Gprasp1 as a regulator of alcohol drinking behaviors via its
actions on dopamine receptors. These aims will be achieved through the use of two-bottle choice alcohol
drinking tasks, surgical gonadectomy, quantification of gene expression with RT-PCR, site-specific gene
knockdown, and pharmacological antagonism. Collectively, completion of these aims will demonstrate a role
for the X chromosome in alcohol consumption and determine which X chromosome genes that escape
inactivation in the brain are regulated by alcohol exposure. Further, we will identify GPCR regulation through
Gprasp1 as a mediator of sex differences in alcohol drinking behaviors. These studies will be the first
mechanistic demonstration of how sex chromosome complement influences vulnerability to alcohol.
Additionally, the proposed work and future related studies have a high likelihood of revealing multiple targets
with potential therapeutic efficacy for problematic drinking behaviors in people of all sexes and genders."

Tobacco addiction remains a leading cause of death and disease worldwide. Although many individuals express
a desire to quit, available therapeutics have proven to be only moderately efficacious, with cessation success
rates <25% after one year. In this proposal, we will explore the role of G protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) in
modulating nicotine reinforcement and aversion. GPR3 is a constitutively active orphan receptor that activates
Gs leading to increased levels of cAMP within cells. GPR3 is highly expressed in the medial habenula,
suggesting it may be a critical modulator of the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway that regulates nicotine
aversion. Thus, GPR3 is a novel therapeutic target for nicotine cessation that should be investigated both
pharmacologically and mechanistically. However, in vivo studies of GPR3 are restricted due to the limited
availability of small molecule ligands for this receptor. The goal of this project is to discover, validate and develop
GPR3 agonists for in vivo studies related to nicotine abuse. This will be accomplished by conducting high-
throughput virtual screens of millions of compounds from commercial space followed by confirmatory screens in
a functional assay. We will then conduct structure activity relationship campaigns on hit scaffolds to determine
the potency, efficacy, and selectivity of potential GPR3 agonists as well as initial ADME/PK profiles. We
hypothesize that optimized probes of GPR3 will decrease self-administration of nicotine by increasing aversive
effects through stimulation of the MHb-IPN pathway. We will test the in vivo efficacy of lead GPR3 probes in
altering intravenous nicotine self-administration at various nicotine doses. In addition, we will characterize GPR3
expression patterns in a brain region and cell type specific manner. Upon completion of this grant, we expect to
have a potent, selective GPR3 agonist probe validated in both cell-based functional assays, and behavioral
models of nicotine abuse. Novel GPR3 agonists developed under this application will serve as tools to investigate
the signaling mechanisms and in vivo functions of GPR3 within the context of health and disease."
10825124,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic heart disease presents a substantial burden of disease, partially due to cardiomyocytes’ low turnover
rate. Neonatal mice exhibit a transient cardiac regenerative capacity and serve as a valuable model to study
cardiac regeneration. Many in the field theorize that the driver of the regenerative to non-regenerative shift is the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase that occurs after birth as pups shift from a low to a relatively high-
oxygen environment. These ROS are thought to lead to DNA damage, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Although it
is well established that high levels of ROS can drive pathology in a variety of tissue types, ROS serve as critical
signaling molecules in a wide range of biological processes. One critical developmental process that occurs
during the early neonatal period is the metabolic shift to fatty acid oxidation, which is a hallmark of cardiomyocyte
maturation.
The primary goal of this F31 research proposal is to determine the necessity of neonatal ROS increase in
establishing oxidative tolerance in cardiomyocytes prior to ischemic injury (Aim 1) and in driving a metabolic shift
to fatty acid oxidation that is characteristic of mature cardiomyocytes (Aim 2). This study includes an AAV9-
delivered constitutively active Nrf2 as well as a high-dose antioxidant model to suppress ROS during the early
neonatal period. Preliminary RNA sequencing data showed a decrease in genes associated with fatty acid
oxidation in ROS-depleted cardiomyocytes compared to controls, suggesting that ROS are required for
cardiomyocyte metabolic maturation. To further study the impact of abnormal metabolic shifts on cardiomyocyte
regeneration, a Cd36 knockout and AAV9-delivered overexpression model will be utilized in combination with
human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) studies to manipulate cell
metabolism.
The proposed study focuses on mitigation of neonatal development ROS to understand their role in
cardiomyocyte maturation and establishing oxidative tolerance, in contrast to studies that have aimed to lower
injury-related ROS. While cardiac pathology has mainly been attributed to oxidative stress, recent findings
suggest that reductive stress may also have pathological implications. Elucidating the temporal regulation of
ROS signaling and its influence on cardiomyocyte injury response and metabolism will help inform future
therapeutics for the treatment of heart failure."

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is frequently driven by increased activity of the hypoxia-inducible
transcription factor HIF2. Circadian rhythms coordinate behavior and physiology with predictable daily
environmental cycles. Chronic disruption of circadian rhythms, such as that experienced during shift work or
travel across time zones, increases the risk of several types of cancer in people. We have established that
the circadian clock components BMAL1, CRY1, and CRY2 regulate the activity of HIF2.
In Aim 1 of this project, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which BMAL1, BMAL2, CRY1, and
CRY2 influence HIF2-dependent gene expression in ccRCC cells. In Aim 2 of this project, we will
investigate the impact of depletion of CRY1, CRY2, or BMAL1 on the growth of ccRCC cell lines and
xenograft tumors."
10937073,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Most forms of psychopathology have been increasingly recognized as brain disorders that emerge early in
development and persist throughout the lifespan. Given the considerable costs of mental illness, it is imperative
to develop ways of identifying adolescents who are the most vulnerable, which may lead to more precise and
personalized interventions. Here, we propose using a novel predictive framework that may better capture the
neurodevelopmental origins of psychopathology, thereby yielding more accurate predictions of psychopathology.
Specifically, we plan to develop multi-task neural networks that are trained on spatial maps from three
neuroimaging modalities and yield simultaneous predictions of an individual’s age (“brain age”) and
psychopathology (“brain pathology”). By integrating predictions of brain age and brain pathology through this
novel multi-task framework, we may derive models with improved predictive power, which would also be useful
for uncovering the specific biomarkers that underlie each dimension of psychopathology. To investigate these
research questions and replicate our findings, we will use multimodal neurodevelopmental data from two of the
largest neuroimaging datasets that also contain three longitudinal timepoints – namely the Human Connectome
in Development (HCD) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmental (ABCD) samples. In contrast to using
single-task models, we hypothesize that the multi-task predictions of brain age and brain pathology would be
better able at detect individual differences at any given point in time (Aim 1) and such predictions would best
map onto within-subject changes throughout adolescence (Aim 2). Further, we will use multiple feature
importance methods to identify which brain areas and neural properties added the largest predictive power to
our most accurate models (Aim 3). This F31 proposal may prove useful in identifying adolescents who are most
vulnerable to psychopathology (“personalization”) and accessing risk earlier in the course of development
(“precision”). We will also make our deep learning models publicly available so that anyone could use them to
yield out-of-sample predictions, which may have wide-spread applications for neuroimaging researchers and
pediatric clinicians. Through the pursuit of these research objectives, the applicant will receive essential training
in the following areas: 1) deep/machine learning methods, 2) multimodal neuroimaging, 3) advanced
psychopathology, 4) conducting rigorous and reproducible research, 5) professional development as the
applicant progresses toward a career as an independent, NIH-funded academic researcher. The assembled
training team has substantial expertise in each of these subject domains. With their support, the applicant will
develop the theoretical, analytical, and professional aptitude needed to foster his research and career ambitions.
Altogether, this F31 proposal will be catalyst to help the applicant in his goal of becoming an independent
principal investigator that uses multi-model approaches to delineate the most important determents of
psychopathology and predict risk on an individual-basis."
10934371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early life experiences can have long-lasting consequences on risk and resilience for developing substance use
disorder (SUD). While trauma early in life increases risk for SUD, brief early stressor exposure can promote
stress inoculation or later resilience. Much of the preclinical work studying how the early environment affects
addiction-related behaviors has focused on outcomes in adult animals. However, this approach misses how early
experiences alter the trajectory of the development of brain regions implicated in SUD and limits our ability to
know if interventions for SUD would be effective earlier, such as in adolescence, when first exposure to drugs of
abuse often occurs. This proposal addresses this gap and tests how a rat model of brief early resource scarcity
alters adolescent impulsivity, opioid taking, and cell-type specific transcription in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), a key part of the reward circuitry that is developing in adolescence. This proposal builds on our labs
extensive work characterizing the effects of the limited bedding/nesting (LBN) manipulation on adult addiction-
related outcomes. In LBN, dams and pups are in a low resource environment during pups first week of life and
effects are compared to rats raised with adequate resources throughout development. We previously found that
LBN causes sex-specific resilience to addiction-related behaviors, reducing impulsive choice and morphine
taking, in adult male but not in adult female rats. We also found alterations in glutamatergic signaling in reward
circuitry in adult LBN males that can contribute to resilience. This proposal will extend this work to determine, for
the first time, whether LBN causes similar behavioral and molecular changes in adolescent rats. Aim 1 will used
innovative new behavioral procedures that allow for testing impulsive choice with delayed discounting and
morphine self-administration in adolescent rats. We expect that, like in adulthood, LBN will promote male-specific
resilience to adolescent impulsivity and drug taking. Aim 2 will build on new unpublished single nucleus RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) assessing how LBN alters cell-type specific transcription in the adult mPFC. This
approach overcomes limitations of past work using bulk tissue where transcriptomic alterations cannot be
assigned to any particular cell type. In adults, we found that LBN alters genes in one subtype of excitatory
glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC of only adult males and several of these genes are involved in vesicular
transport, which could lead to altered presynaptic glutamate release. Here we will test the prediction that LBN
causes similar male-specific transcriptional alterations in glutamatergic neurons in adolescents, while also
discovering novel gene expression changes within genetically defined subtypes of cells in the mPFC. By
combining this novel adolescent phenotyping with prior adult work, we can determine how LBN affects the
developmental trajectory of addiction-related behaviors and the transcriptional dynamics of the mPFC. The data
generated here will also serve as a valuable resource for the fields of SUD and developmental neuroscience."
10825085,"Abstract: Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by urges to perform tics
which are repetitive, stereotyped, and uncontrollable movements or sounds. The CDC estimates that TS and
related chronic tic disorders affect ~1 in 50 children. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying neuropathology
is poorly understood. A lack of preclinical animal models is a large reason for this current impasse in TS research.
This grant proposes a new way to overcome this barrier using novel mouse models generated in our lab that
express orthologous human mutations identified in a high-confidence TS gene, CELSR3. Preliminary data shows
these mice exhibit tic-like stereotypies in the open field, with sex-dependent variable expressivity, and also
changes to striatal dopamine. Leveraging these novel mice with construct and face validity, I will test the
hypothesis that tics are associated with changes to habit formation and dopamine signaling. Habits and tics are
highly similar: they are both repetitive, stereotyped, and automated actions that once formed are hard to break.
It is proposed in TS that a potentiation of sensorimotor inputs onto striatal circuits regulating habit formation
along with potentially weaker engagement of circuits controlling goal-directed behavior may predispose
individuals to develop ‘tic-habits’. Further, ‘tic-habits’ may be perpetuated by aberrant DA signaling, which
reinforces and motivates these learned behaviors. Human studies have demonstrated that TS probands develop
habits quicker, an effect not seen in medicated probands on DA stabilizers (aripiprazole). Additionally, habit
reversal therapy is proven to help decrease tics in ~40% of TS subjects, further suggesting a link between habits
and tics. However, these findings have yet to be tested and confirmed in animal models, and the
neurodevelopmental circuit changes regulating habit formation in TS remain uninvestigated. Similar to human
findings, my preliminary data suggests Celsr3 TS mice form habits faster and have difficultly breaking them (akin
to difficulty seen in ceasing to tic). Interestingly, some tic-like stereotypies are more pronounced in female mice,
suggesting sex-differences need to be explored. Thus, I hypothesize Celsr3 TS mice will demonstrate enhanced
habitual responding and changes to DA signaling during early stages of habit formation, which may be influenced
by sex. I also hypothesize that these phenotypes will be normalized with aripiprazole, as observed in human
subjects. In Aim 1, I will use instrumental learning paradigms to test if habit formation and goal-directed behaviors
are enhanced and/or weakened, respectively. Deciphering potential circuit imbalances between these two
systems will provide insight into neurodevelopmental circuit changes proposed in TS. In Aim 2, I will use in vivo
imaging and fiber photometry to investigate DA signaling while mice form habits. I will also administer aripiprazole
to test if I can normalize habitual behavior to control levels. These experiments will be the first to investigate
habit formation and DA dysregulation in TS using bona fide TS mouse models with true construct and face
validity. These results will help explain the neurobiological basis of tics, helping to improve treatment strategies."
10827113,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
40% of patients who are diagnosed with cocaine use disorder are considered to have a severe cocaine use
disorder meeting six or more criteria from the DSM-5. The lack of effective medication for cocaine use disorder
demonstrates an urgent need to better understand the effect of cocaine on neurobiology and behaviors. Cocaine-
induced increase in striatal dopamine release is essential for cocaine reinforcement, however, the mechanisms
of striatal circuit adaptations inducing cocaine seeking is not well established. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine the mechanism by which cocaine affects striatopallidal circuit activity to facilitate cocaine
seeking and taking. My central hypothesis is that 1) cocaine-induced increases of the opioid peptide, enkephalin
in the striatum suppresses GABA transmission from striatal neurons via δ/µ opioid receptors and, as a result,
disinhibits VP GABA neurons, and 2) striatal enkephalin plays a key role in cocaine seeking.
Aim 1: Determine the necessity of striatal enkephalin in cocaine-induced adaptations in the
striatopallidal circuit: Based on our preliminary data and previous findings, I hypothesize that increase in
enkephalin in the striatum during withdrawal from a history of cocaine exposure leads to suppression of GABA
transmission from enkephalin-expressing striatal neurons, which increases excitability of the postsynaptic VP
GABA neurons. We will test this by performing whole-cell electrophysiology recordings in D2-MSN-selective
enkephalin knockouts with a history of cocaine exposure, and measure GABA transmission from striatal neurons
onto VP GABA neurons and VP neuron excitability. The use of exogenous enkephalin and opioid receptor
selective antagonists will confirm striatal enkephalin and determine the type of opioid receptor as a mechanism
for depression of GABA transmission and increased excitability. Immunohistochemistry will confirm the type of
recorded VP neurons.
Aim 2: Determine the role of striatal enkephalin in cocaine self-administration: Based on our preliminary
data, I hypothesize that striatal enkephalin facilitates self-administration and cocaine seeking. We will test this
by performing operant self-administration using striatal neuron-selective enkephalin knockouts and examine the
effect of striatal enkephalin deletion on cocaine seeking and taking and the motivation for cocaine.
Through completion of this proposal, and under the guidance of my sponsors, Drs. Lauren Dobbs and Robert
Messing, who are experts in substance use disorder research, I will receive extensive training to develop
professional skills, expand my laboratory skillset, and improve my communication skills for post-doctorate
research career in neuroscience. Combined with the training resources and expansive research expertise
available at University of Texas at Austin, I will be well-supported throughout this fellowship and make a
successful transition to a post-doctoral research position."
10826145,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Telehealth (or telemedicine), defined as the use of technology to deliver health care, health
information, or health education remotely, has become essential to the modern healthcare system. The COVID-
19 pandemic has accelerated the need for the expansion of telehealth services. In response to the pandemic,
federal and state governments implemented temporary modifications and policies to support telehealth adoption.
However, it is unclear how telehealth policy expansions impact overall health service utilization in the United
States health system. In light of the telehealth expansions policy, it is important to evaluate the impact of
telehealth on the quality of care, especially in behavioral health care and chronic disease management for
patients with cardiometabolic risk (CMR), as telehealth may offer a potential life-course intervention for promoting
healthy aging in this area.
Specific Aims: The proposed project will (1) evaluate the impact of state-level telehealth payment parity
requiring equal reimbursement for in-person and telehealth visits on health service utilization for adults aged 45
to 64 with CMR in commercial insurance (2) assess how telehealth affects health behavior (medication
adherence) for middle-aged and older adults aged 45 or above with CMR. (3) assess how telehealth impact on
disease-specific quality of care for middle-aged and older adults aged 45 or above with CMR.
Approach: The proposed analysis will utilize data from the primary sources: (1) IBM MarketScan Commercial
Claims; (2) Medicare fee-for-service Claims. Additional data sources for covariates and instrument variables will
come from (1) the CDC COVID-19 tracker; (2) Internet broadband data from FCC and Microsoft. For Aim 1, I will
leverage a policy shock of private insurance telehealth payment mandate to identify the causal effects of interest
using a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation framework. For Aim 2 and Aim 3, to overcome potential
endogeneity resulting from self-selection and reverse causality in telehealth use and outcomes of interest, I will
use a two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach with internet connectivity at the county level as an instrumental
variable (IV). I will use the causal inference framework to evaluate the impact of telehealth on medication
adherence and disease-specific quality of care for middle-aged and older adults with CMR.
Contribution and Significance: This study is significant because limited rigorous evidence indicates how
telehealth affects healthcare utilization and quality of care for patients with CMR based on large population
studies over an extended period beyond the pandemic. This study will contribute to understanding the impact of
telehealth reimbursement policy reform on health service utilization in the U.S. health system. In addition, this
study will provide evidence of the causal effects of telehealth on chronic disease management and quality of
care for middle-aged and older populations with CMR.

10827131,"ABSTRACT
Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care es-
timated to be up to $7 billion. Medications are one of the most common causes of delirium and potentially one
of the most preventable and most treatable, with medications thought to be the sole precipitant for delirium in
up to 39% of cases. Despite the critical role of medications as a source of delirium, surprisingly few studies have
investigated this topic, often focused on only a few medications and with only modest quality. In this proposal, we
will address these limitations by utilizing data collected through our Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality
improvement project, which instituted delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over
age 65 admitted to University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital for the past decade. This unprecedented
volume of data on more than 81,000 patients will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective ap-
plication of data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather
than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms to identify med-
ications associated with increased odds of delirium. Combining data mining with our Virtual ACE and hospital
electronic health record (EHR) data, we will be able to evaluate more than 1,000 individual medications, as well
as medication combinations and medication classes, for their association with delirium. Such a comprehensive,
data-driven examination of delirium due to medications will be a significant contribution to our understanding of
the risk factors and management of delirium in the older adult population."
10828361,"ABSTRACT:
Aging and age-related diseases like peripheral artery disease (PAD) lead to considerable morbidity and
mortality. Aging is associated with impaired inflammatory arteriogenesis responses to injury. We defined a
macrophage signaling axis that activates the mRNA stabilizing protein, HuR, to promote VEGF-A expression
required for arteriogenesis. We seek to understand the effects of aging on this pathway. Moderately aged (52-
week-old) mice demonstrated reduced blood flow recovery and decreased arteriogenesis relative to young (12-
week-old) mice in a femoral artery ligation model of ischemia. In aged mice, ischemic muscle tissue and
macrophages revealed reduced VEGF-A expression. Aged macrophages demonstrated increased global DNA
methylation, and though macrophage HuR expression was normal, there was reduced HuR binding to VEGF-A
mRNA with consequent shortened VEGF-A mRNA half-life. Somewhat surprisingly, Dicer1, previously
established as destabilizing for VEGF-A mRNA, was downregulated in aged macrophages. The DNMT
inhibitor, RG108, led to increased Dicer1 and VEGF-A expression and increased HuR binding to VEGF-A
mRNA. miR-29, as a 3p miRNA, appears to be particularly sensitive to changes in Dicer1 expression. Aged
macrophages had decreased expression of miR-29, whose seeding site in the 3′-UTR of VEGF-A is adjacent
to the HuR binding site. Transfection of macrophages with miR-29 mimic increased VEGF-A expression.
Myeloid Dicer1-deleted mice were phenotypically similar to aged mice, having decreased blood flow recovery,
decreased VEGF-A expression, and decreased HuR binding to VEGF-A mRNA with consequent shortened
mRNA half-life. Our hypothesis is that aging acquired methylation of Dicer1 with consequent reductions in
Dicer1 dose-sensitive microRNAs (i.e. miR-29-3p) results in reduced binding of HuR to VEGF-A mRNA and
reductions in both VEGF-A expression and consequent VEGF-A dependent angio/ arteriogenesis. Our aims
seek to 1) define Dicer1 promoter methylation in aged mice to be a major mechanism of impaired VEGF-A-
mediated arteriogenesis with aging; and 2) define the molecular mechanisms whereby the Dicer1 dose-
sensitive microRNA, miR-29-3p, promotes HuR-binding to VEGF-A mRNA with consequent message
stabilization. Our studies will lead to a paradigm shift from Dicer1 as a negative regulator of VEGF-A to that of
a positive regulator. The rescue of macrophage VEGF-A expression by demethylation of Dicer1 or noncoding
RNA (i.e. miR-29) mimics, may have profound implications in the development of treatment strategies that can
promote arteriogenesis and associated tissue preservation in the setting of severe age-related vasculopathies."
11047510,"ABSTRACT:
Aging and age-related diseases like peripheral artery disease (PAD) lead to considerable morbidity and
mortality. Aging is associated with impaired inflammatory arteriogenesis responses to injury. We defined a
macrophage signaling axis that activates the mRNA stabilizing protein, HuR, to promote VEGF-A expression
required for arteriogenesis. We seek to understand the effects of aging on this pathway. Moderately aged (52-
week-old) mice demonstrated reduced blood flow recovery and decreased arteriogenesis relative to young (12-
week-old) mice in a femoral artery ligation model of ischemia. In aged mice, ischemic muscle tissue and
macrophages revealed reduced VEGF-A expression. Aged macrophages demonstrated increased global DNA
methylation, and though macrophage HuR expression was normal, there was reduced HuR binding to VEGF-A
mRNA with consequent shortened VEGF-A mRNA half-life. Somewhat surprisingly, Dicer1, previously
established as destabilizing for VEGF-A mRNA, was downregulated in aged macrophages. The DNMT
inhibitor, RG108, led to increased Dicer1 and VEGF-A expression and increased HuR binding to VEGF-A
mRNA. miR-29, as a 3p miRNA, appears to be particularly sensitive to changes in Dicer1 expression. Aged
macrophages had decreased expression of miR-29, whose seeding site in the 3′-UTR of VEGF-A is adjacent

10828363,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a key window for social/emotional development in humans. This period is characterized by
growth of the amygdala, which increases in both size and neuron number. We recently described a unique
form of neurodevelopment in the human amygdala paralaminar nuclei (PL). This region contains a population
of immature neurons that develop on a delayed timeline relative to other neurons. These neurons mature
during adolescence when they will form excitatory neurons. In preliminary studies in the mouse, a tractable
animal model, we found a population of immature neurons that share molecular, anatomical, and
morphological features with late-developing neurons in humans. Additionally, the timeline of their maturation
appears similar in both species. Although they remain immature during postnatal ages, these late-maturing
neurons are born during embryonic neurogenesis. The goal of this proposal is to uncover the development,
synaptic integration and molecular diversity of late-maturing amygdala neurons from genesis to functional
integration using both humans and mice. Using a combination of state of the art approaches, we propose to
accomplish this goal by: 1) Tracking the embryonic and postnatal developmental dynamics of late-maturing PL
neurons in mice (Specific Aim 1), 2) identifying when and how late-maturing amygdala neurons functionally
integrate into existing amygdala circuitry in mice (Specific Aim 2) and 3) uncovering and comparing
late-maturing PL neuron molecular diversity in mice and humans (Specific Aim 3). In this cross-species project
we will address major questions about the development and maturation of an unexplored form of neuron
development that occurs during the critical stage of adolescence. This work is an essential first step for future
studies of the role of these neurons in social/emotional behavior, mechanisms controlling their delayed
development, and their significance to human behavioral pathophysiology."
10828930,"Aging is characterized by an expansion in adipose tissue (i.e. obesity), which plays a key role in the
pathophysiology of many aging-diseases, including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic vascular disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, and some cancers. Adipose tissue is composed of adipocytes, immune cells, endothelial
cells, stem/stromal cells, and previously uncharacterized cellular populations. Adipose tissue also contains
cells that have undergone cellular senescence, a state characterized by the arrest of the cell cycle and a
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which induces inflammation, cytotoxicity, and metabolic
dysfunction in other cells and tissues. Recent research suggests that aging is associated with changes in
adipose cellular populations and subpopulations, and that these variations may be involved in the biology of
aging and etiology of aging-related diseases. Yet, the precise profiling of adipose tissue cellular composition
has been limited due to a lack of robust cell surface markers for the numerous cellular subpopulations.
 Single-cell (sc) RNA seq is a novel high-resolution methodology that enables global identification of cellular
populations and subpopulations (known and newly identified) in tissues. We have developed a single nuclei
(sn)RNA-seq based method (a variation of scRNA-seq) that allows excellent identification, separation and
clustering of adipose cellular populations, including mature adipocytes, immune cells, endothelial cells, and
mesenchymal stem cells. Although snRNA-seq also is a promising tool for identification and characterization of
cells undergoing senescence, it has not been used to more fully elucidate the importance of such cells in the
biology of aging and the etiology of aging-related metabolic diseases.
 In Aim 1 we will conduct adipose tissue molecular profiling via snRNA-seq in three cohorts at baseline:
younger lean, older lean, and older obese individuals. We will develop molecular atlases in these subjects to
test the hypothesis that both aging and aging plus obesity will have distinct adipose tissue molecular profiles.
In a subgroup of older obese subjects we will also test whether a lifestyle intervention changes the global
molecular profile in adipose tissue to a profile closer to that in younger and older lean individuals.
 In Aim 2 we will focus on the identification, quantification, and functional characterization of adipose tissue
senescent cells. Sub Aim 2A will test the hypotheses that the amount and function (i.e. SASP) of adipose
tissue senescent cells will be elevated with aging and further enhanced by obesity, and that the lifestyle
intervention (from Aim 1) will reduce senescent cell burden in older obese subjects. In Sub Aim 2B we will
administer senolytic agents to a subgroup of older obese subjects (from Aim 1) to determine whether clearance
of senescent cells improves metabolic outcomes. This Sub Aim will directly test the cellular senescence theory
and will serve as a positive control for the lifestyle intervention regarding its potential anti-senescence effect."
10829251,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Oxidative stress is a central part of innate immune-induced neurodegeneration in neurological disorders
including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating oxidative stress gene circuits
to promote neurotoxic immune responses remain poorly characterized. Emerging evidence supports a role for
the epigenome in tightly regulating immune cell gene activity in MS. Yet, the epigenomic landscape and function
in prooxidant, neurotoxic central nervous system (CNS) innate immune cells in MS remains unknown. Thus,
discovery of drugs capable of selectively suppressing immune-driven neurodegeneration has been hindered by
lack of molecular understanding of neurotoxic functions of CNS innate immune cells. The ultimate goal of this
project is to define the regulatory landscape of prooxidant immune cells and identify mechanisms that translate
epigenetic aberrations into innate-immune driven neurodegeneration for devising novel therapeutic interventions
for MS. Our preliminary data discovered a molecular convergence of neurotoxic microglia and peripheral
macrophages to a core oxidative stress gene signature in MS model. By applying an innovative experimental
design with cutting-edge methods, this proposal aims to define the epigenetic and transcriptional components of
oxidative stress-producing innate immune cells in a mouse model of neuroinflammation for MS through unbiased
profiling of the open chromatin landscapes (Aim 1) and histone modifications (Aim 2). These molecular
characterizations will identify key MS-related regulatory elements that will be functionally validated in vitro and
in vivo with CRISPR interference assays (Aim 3). This project will provide a foundational epigenomic outlook on
the molecular circuits governing prooxidant, neurotoxic immune responses in neuroinflammatory disease, and
the research outcomes may reveal candidates for the development of new treatments for innate immune-
mediated oxidative injury in MS and related conditions. The comprehensive training plan will enable the PI to
achieve his career goal of launching a successful independent research laboratory dedicated to studying
epigenomic mechanisms contributing to immune dysfunction in MS for targeted treatments. The MOSAIC UE5
mentoring, leadership, and diversity training will facilitate his transition to independence and enable the PI to
enhance diversity in the biomedical workforce in the R00 phase and beyond. As a mentee in Dr. Katerina
Akassoglou’s laboratory, a leader in neurovascular and immune mechanisms of MS pathogenesis, at the
esteemed academic environment of Gladstone Institutes and University of California, San Francisco, the PI will
obtain new training in functional epigenomics and CRISPR genome engineering during the K99 phase. The PI’s
training and career development will be bolstered through an advisory committee of faculty with related expertise;
and the PI’s participation in didactic activities such as coursework in epigenomics and seminars, will collectively
allow the PI to complete this project and integrate these approaches for making meritorious contributions to the
fields of MS and epigenomics in future independent research."

 Liver fibrosis is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. Factors such as chronic liver
injury, infection, metabolic and toxin insults, and genetic factors are associated with the
development of liver fibrosis. Rapidly expanding intrahepatic biliary epithelium or ductular reaction
with a closely associated highly invasive bridging fibrosis are the characteristic features of
advanced liver fibrosis, which has no definite cure. Fibrosis leads to a significant distortion of
hepatic function, progresses to liver failure. Therefore, the prevention of fibrosis progression is of
paramount importance. Even after tremendous scientific advancements in the area of liver
fibrosis, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how fibrosis progresses to an end-stage liver
disease remain a medical enigma. Previously we have shown that Fibroblast growth factor
receptors (FGFRs) were highly induced and co-localized to a heterogeneous population of biliary
precursors and profibrogenic cells co-expressing Prominin1 (PROM1) with an activated TGF beta
signaling in fibrotic livers. Based on the literature and preliminary studies, we hypothesize that
FGFRs via its crosstalk with the TGF beta pathway promotes ductular reaction and fibrosis in
chronically injured livers. The goals of this application are to elucidate the cell-type-specific role
of FGFRs in ductular reaction and fibrosis progression in a setting of chronic liver injury. Specific
aims of this proposal are: (1) Identify the mechanisms of FGFRs activation and its significance in
liver injury and fibrosis. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which FGFR signaling in Prom1
expressing cells promote ductular reaction and fibrosis. (3) Identify the mechanism and the
significance of FGFR-TGF beta crosstalk in liver fibrosis. Successful completion of the proposed
work may identify novel therapeutic targets and FGFR-mediated signaling crosstalk that promotes
liver fibrosis progression during chronic liver injury."

This grant application proposes to understand the role of astrocytes in mediating cocaine-induced circuit
alterations that drive cocaine seeking and relapse. Outcomes of the first funding period for this R01 project
demonstrate that cocaine self-administration (SA) activates an astrocyte-mediated synaptogenic mechanism to
generate AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-silent synapses in principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in nucleus
accumbens shell (NAcSh). During withdrawal from cocaine SA, a subset of these cocaine-generated NAcSh
synapses mature and strengthen by recruiting AMPARs. Experimentally converting and locking cocaine-
generated NAcSh synapses within their silent state during drug withdrawal substantially decreases cue-
induced cocaine seeking. By measuring intracellular Ca2+ activities, preliminary studies reveal that NAcSh
astrocyte activities are upregulated by cocaine administration, and that this upregulation is increased after 5-d
cocaine SA, indicating a ‘sensitization’ process in astrocytes. Furthermore, after cocaine SA, NAcSh astrocytes
acquire the ability to respond to cocaine-associated cues by increasing their activities, and experimentally
increasing astrocyte activities re-silences cocaine-generated NAcSh synapses. These and other preliminary
results lead to the current hypothesis: NAcSh astrocytes gain unique properties through cocaine experience to
regulate cocaine-generated synapses and formulate specific neuronal ensembles that drive cue-induced
cocaine seeking after drug withdrawal. This hypothesis will be tested by three lines of experimentation. First,
using astrocyte-specific molecular tools, proposed experiments will test the specific hypothesis that astrocytic
levels of mGluR5 are upregulated by cocaine SA, which, in turn, mediates sensitized in vivo responses of
NAcSh astrocytes to cocaine and cocaine-associated cues after cocaine withdrawal. In parallel, selective RNA-
seq of NAc astrocytes will reveal novel molecular substrates for cocaine action in this cell type. Second, using
in vivo two-photon microscopy combined with slice electrophysiology, proposed experiments will test the
specific hypothesis that increased activities of NAcSh astrocytes is both sufficient and necessary for cue re-
exposure-induced re-silencing of cocaine-generated NAcSh synapses, and thus can be used to reduce cue-
induced cocaine seeking after drug withdrawal. Third, using GCaMP-mediated in vivo Ca2+ imaging, proposed
experiments will test the specific hypothesis that the neuronal ensembles are formed, in part, by astrocyte-
mediated synaptogenesis in response to cocaine, and then drive cue-induced cocaine seeking after drug
withdrawal. These proposed experiments will characterize several novel astrocyte-associated substrates
through which addiction-related memories can be manipulated for therapeutic benefits."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by progressive aortic dilation and rupture that leads to sudden
death. To date, there are no medicinal therapies to stop AAA from progressing to rupture, largely due to poor
understanding of not only effective molecular targets but also targeted delivery approaches. While studies have
traditionally focused on immune cells and endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can undergo
inflammation and degeneration, and exacerbate AAA via secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and proteolytic
enzymes. Thus, controlling SMC inflammation and degeneration has the potential to mitigate AAA. Previously
our lab identified bromodomain protein-4 (BRD4) as a driver of SMC inflammation. BRD4 is a transcription co-
activator that recognizes histone acetylation sites where it facilitates the clustering of transcription enhancers
into super-enhancers, thereby mediating gene activation. Our team has demonstrated that pan-inhibition of BRD
function ameliorates AAA in mice, however the mechanisms that underlie the specific role of BRD4 in controlling
AAA-associated SMC inflammation and degeneration remain largely unknown. Here we present promising
findings that reveal an important physiological function of BRD4 in modulating AAA progression. Using cultured
SMCs, we find that BRD4 protein is increased upon exposure to pro-inflammation factors; and human lesions of
AAA also show elevated BRD4 expression. Mice with SMC-specific knockout of BRD4 develop resistance to
elastase-induced AAA, suggesting a potential pro-aneurysm role of BRD4. Genome-wide analysis reveal BRD4
enrichment at the gene of CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD), a master transcription factor that
controls SMC inflammation and degeneration. In elastase-induced AAA models, knockdown of CEBPD reduces
AAA size; conversely, overexpression of CEBPD in the SMC-specific BRD4 knockout aorta exacerbates AAA in
mice. Overall, these findings support the premise that BRD4/CEBPD may participate in the epigenetic control of
genes involved in SMC degeneration and inflammation associated with AAA. By resolving the physiologic role,
and the cellular and molecular underpinnings of BRD4-CEBPD-AAA, we can advance the pathophysiology of
AAA, and potentially gain novel therapeutic approaches to treat AAA. Our team has developed a novel
biomimetic AAA-homing nanoplatform. We envision that targeted delivery of BRD4-inactivating agents can
provide a potential effective means to mitigate AAA."
10855693,"Hypoxia is a common feature of gestational complications. Even when the origins of hypoxia vary (i.e.,
environmental hypoxia versus hypoxia limited to the placenta), there are shared, intermediate features in
placental physiology that are also common across mammals. These commonalities suggest that there are some
fundamental effects of hypoxia on placental development that negatively impact gestational outcomes. We
recently demonstrated that evolutionary adaptations to chronic hypoxia in high elevation environments protects
placental and fetal growth in deer mice act on mechanisms shared with humans. These results point to conserved
processes that are involved in both mediating the negative impacts of hypoxia on fetal outcomes and preventing
these effects. In this proposal, we address three key questions, the answers to which will significantly advance
our understanding of how placental responses to hypoxia contribute to adverse gestational outcomes
(particularly fetal growth restriction) and the genetic and cell type-specific mechanisms that underlie variation in
susceptibility to these complications. First, we ask how individual placental cell type responses hypoxia
contribute to tissue-level outcomes, including identifying the cell types that are responsible for tissue-wide
transcriptional signatures associated with fetal growth under hypoxia. To answer this first question, we generate
cell type-specific transcriptomes from placental tissues using single-nuclei RNAseq from highland-adapted and
non-adapted mice experimentally acclimated during gestation to hypoxia or normoxia. Second, we interrogate
the cis-regulatory variation that explains cell type-specific transcriptional variation by linking allele-specific gene
expression to chromatin conformation in placentas from F1 hybrid crosses of the aforementioned populations,
again in an experimental framework. Finally, our third aim asks how these cell type-specific hypoxia responses
contribute to organizational remodeling of the placental exchange structures by combining in vivo histological
approaches and in vitro experimental approaches focused on cell-autonomous function of a single, important
placental cell type. The proposed aims thus combine experimental approaches, cutting-edge sequencing
analyses, and molecular and cellular biology with the broader goal of resolving the genetic and developmental
processes by which natural genetic variation alters placental function and influences fetal outcomes. The results
of this research will advance our understanding of conserved physiology that shapes placental development and
pregnancy in mammals, thereby supporting broader research focused on gestational health and disease in
humans."
10832003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is substantial evidence that obesity is a risk factor for the development of several chronic diseases,
including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These diseases pose an incredible economic and
sociologic burden to society. Although the underlying mechanisms are likely multi-faceted, inflammation
certainly plays an important role in the link between obesity and cancer. Infiltrating inflammatory cells as
well as systemic and local levels of pro-inflammatory mediators provide in ideal micro-milieu for tumor
development and growth. Anti-inflammatory strategies have been shown in many animal models to delay or
prevent the development of cancers and are widely considered intriguing approaches for cancer prevention. In
addition, obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation, in particular visceral adipose tissue inflammation,
correlates strongly to the development of metabolic diseases, e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (gastrointestinal)
cancer. In previous studies an obesogenic diet was found to significantly accelerate the development and
progression of PDAC precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia: PanIN), and to increase the
incidence of invasive and metastatic PDAC in the conditional KrasG12D (KC) mouse model. This was associated
with a substantial inflammation of the pancreas and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The overarching hypothesis
of this Project is that obesity leads to VAT inflammation, which is a critical (promotional) driver of PDAC
development and growth. Targeting obesity-associated VAT inflammation with FDA-approved, repurposed drugs
may represent an intriguing and novel strategy to prevent PDAC development and progression. In Specific Aim
1 the kinetics of obesity-induced AT inflammation and PDAC development will be investigated. The effects of
diet-induced obesity will be compared with genetically-induced obesity. To identify efficacious interventional and
translational strategies the dose- and time-dependent effects of statins on AT inflammation and PDAC
development will be evaluated in Specific Aim 2. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of statins
on AT inflammation and the effects of AT inflammation on PanIN/organoid growth ex vivo will be determined in
Specific Aim 3 with a focus on YAP/TAZ, transcriptional co-activators in the Hippo pathway. The studies will
provide evidence of a critical role of obesity-induced VAT inflammation in PDAC growth and will identify novel
mechanistic pathways and targets. Since statins are widely used and FDA-approved drugs the successful
completion of the studies will have an immediate and translational impact on patients with PDAC. Generally, the
results may also be transferable to other obesity-related cancers and even non-malignant chronic diseases."
10832005,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human diseases. The focus of research,
which had been placed mostly on development of therapeutic agents, has shifted gradually towards its
prevention. In this context, many studies have linked obesity and long-standing type-2 diabetes mellitus with
PDAC development. These metabolic diseases are characterized by peripheral insulin resistance,
hyperinsulinemia, increased IGF-1 and chronic inflammation. Previously, crosstalk mechanisms between
insulin/IGF-1 receptors, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling systems have
been identified that potently stimulate proliferation of PDAC cells harboring a KRAS mutations. Mitogenic
crosstalk depended on the function of mTORC1, ERK and PKD and opposed by AMPK, a target for the
antidiabetic agent metformin. The identification of the key downstream targets of this signaling network is of
fundamental significance and major translational interest. The YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators are
emerging as points of integration in the action of KRAS, GPCRs and AMPK, all signaling pathways highly
relevant in PDAC. New preliminary studies demonstrate that YAP/TAZ activation is a crucial point of
convergence in the crosstalk between GPCR and insulin signaling in PDAC cells. Importantly, lipid-lowering
drugs of the statin family potently blocked YAP/TAZ activity, including YAP/TAZ/TEAD-regulated genes, such
as CTGF, Cyr61 and NUAK2. Lipophilic statins, including cerivastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin, strikingly
inhibited colony formation of human and mouse PDAC cells. Statins inhibited PDAC colony formation acting
synergistically with metformin. Further preliminary results in vivo show that oral administration of simvastatin
attenuated the loss of intact acini and the development of pre-neoplastic lesions in the pancreas promoted by
an obesogenic diet in conditional KrasG12D (KC) mice. Accordingly, the central hypothesis to be explored in
Project 2 of this P01 is that the well tolerated cholesterol-lowering drugs of the statin family inhibit obesity-induced
promotion of PDAC via inhibition of PKD/YAP/TAZ. The Specific Aims of Project 2 have been designed to
investigate important gaps in current knowledge: 1) Characterize the chemopreventive effects of statins on the
progression of PanINs and development of PDAC using the conditional KrasG12D model (KC mice) subjected to
control or diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in KC mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the ob gene. 2) Identify
a novel molecular mechanism by which statins inhibit YAP/TEAD signaling in mouse and human pancreatic cells.
3) Characterize the inhibitory effect of a low-dose combination of statin and metformin on the development of
PDAC: a novel chemopreventive strategy. The studies proposed in Project 2 of this P01 will provide mechanisms
and rationale for novel chemo-preventive strategies in obesity-related PDAC. Since statins and metformin are
widely used Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the mechanistic and preclinical studies
proposed have the potential for rapid translation to PDAC and other obesity-associated cancers."
10832008,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity increases the risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the mechanisms underlying
these effects and the precise role played by the tumor stroma are not well understood. Using mice with pancreas-
specific expression of oncogenic mutant Kras (KC mice), obesogenic diets were found to markedly increase the
number of activated stromal myofibroblasts (aka pancreatic stellate cells, PaSC) and their deposition of
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, especially those promoting matrix stiffening. Obesity-induced changes in the
pancreatic fibrotic stroma are associated with increased numbers of macrophages and levels of various
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors with immunomodulation capacity, acceleration of the progression of
the tumor and increased incidence of invasive PDAC. Although the data strongly suggest a pro-tumor role for
stromal PaSC in obesity-induced PDAC promotion, the precise role(s) of these cells in PDAC and their
phenotypic characteristics appear more complex than initially perceived. Studies provided evidence that the
extracellular signals insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), leptin, LPS and selected interleukins; and
intracellular signals including mTOR/Akt, STAT3, and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) play key roles in regulating
PaSC phenotypes and in promoting the pro-cancer effects of PaSC. These effects are likely mediated by PaSC
fibroinflammatory signals that boost tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis resistance. Moreover, PaSC were
found to regulate tumor macrophage differentiation into immunosuppressive phenotypes conducive of tumor
progression. Of interest are recent findings from retrospective analysis of large databases that patients with
PDAC have significantly improved outcome and longer disease-free survival if they take simvastatin. Also, pilot
studies indicate that metformin can modulate PaSC responses by regulating cellular metabolism, autophagy and
expression of fibro-inflammatory mediators. In this proposal, the hypothesis is that obesity produces unique
signals in the microenvironment of developing PDAC that are responsible for phenotypic alterations in
the PaSC so that they produce factors that promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance in the cancer
cells as well as shift the immune response to a pro-tumor state. It is also anticipated that simvastatin
and metformin attenuate this PaSC promotion and may be useful for prevention of obesity-induced
PDAC development. This hypothesis will be tested by (1) determining the consequences of selective elimination
of PaSC in KC mice on obesity-induced PDAC promotion; (2) establishing the pathways and cellular processes
in the stromal PaSC responsible for the pro-cancer phenotype promoted by obesity; (3) elucidating crosstalk
between PaSC, cancer cells and tumor macrophages; and (4) determining the effects of simvastatin in
combination with metformin on the pro-tumor phenotype of PaSC observed in the obese mice. In sum, this
proposal is designed to show the roles and mechanisms of PaSC-induced tumor promotion occurring
in obesity, and to provide pre-clinical evidence for chemopreventive strategies for pancreatic cancer."
10861863,"Project Summary
Medication adherence is thought by many providers and researchers to be the most important self-care
behavior, yet it is also the most problematic. Poor medication adherence can cause poor quality of life (QoL),
hospitalization, and death. In the United States, approximately 125,000 deaths per year are due to poor
medication adherence and up to 50% of heart failure (HF) patients are re-hospitalized within 6 months of a
previous HF exacerbation and one of the most common causes is poor medication adherence. Lifelong and
usually complex medication regimens are needed for patients with HF, yet 40-60% of HF patients have
suboptimal medication adherence. Health literacy plays a significant role in suboptimal medication adherence.
Support by a care partner (CP; usually a family member) can improve adherence and reduce hospitalizations.
Although some interventions have improved HF patients’ adherence, improvements were small, and effects
were not sustained. To enhance and sustain intervention effects, we will use an approach that is literacy-
sensitive and incorporates social support. Using easy-to-understand language for patients and CPs, we will
test an interactive, behavioral, family-focused and literacy-sensitive (FamLit) intervention delivered by nurses,
incorporating evidence-based, multi-components (e.g., teach-back, coaching, role-playing, goal setting) to
engage both patients and CPs in improving and sustaining medication adherence and health outcomes. We
will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of FamLit intervention on medication
adherence, hospitalization, death, and QoL. We will randomly assign 164 dyads of patients and their primary
CPs (patients-CPs) to either the FamLit intervention or an attention-control group. Both groups will have an in-
person session (delivered on the day of a clinic appointment for regular follow-up) one month after baseline
and phone boosters every other week for up to 3 months. FamLit group sessions will focus on improving
medication adherence, and control group sessions will focus on general health issues. Our aims are to: 1) test
the efficacy of the FamLit intervention compared to an attention control group on outcomes (i.e., primary:
medication adherence, and secondary: a) HF hospitalization or all-cause death, b) QoL, c) social support, and
d) communication) over 12 months; 2) determine if TPB-related intermediate outcomes (attitudes, subjective
norms, perceived behavioral control) mediate the effects of the intervention on medication adherence; 3)
examine whether each dyad member’s a) health literacy, b) social support, and c) communication moderate
the effect of the FamLit intervention on medication adherence; and 4) determine how each dyad member’s
attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, social support, and communication affect their own
and their partner’s QoL over 12 months using the innovative Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. The
FamLit intervention, if efficacious, holds potential to improve/sustain medication adherence and reduce
hospitalizations and death. We will follow up with an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial as our next step."

Emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks that are occurring with increasing frequency in
high-risk areas in South/Central America, West/Central Africa, and Southeast Asia are a threat to the United
States. Documented gaps in research infrastructure limit the capacity to rapidly respond to these outbreaks.
To address this challenge, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is establishing
the Emerging Infectious Disease Research Centers Network (EIDRC-Net) to improve knowledge of EIDs;
leverage existing NIAID international efforts; and develop the capacity to mount effective, flexible, and rapid
outbreak research responses. RTI International and Duke University propose to establish the EIDRC
Coordination Center (EIDRC CC). The RTI-Duke CC will support the EIDRC-Net, which will comprise the
EIDRCs, research sites, the CC, and NIAID by realizing the following aims: (1) enhance EIDRC coordination
and collaboration by providing administrative, communications, logistical, and operational support; (2)
amplify NIAID's capabilities and reach by coordinating and supporting a sustainable, scalable, and adaptable
research infrastructure to optimize resources and knowledge sharing during inter-outbreak periods and to
respond rapidly and effectively during outbreaks; (3) ensure quality and consistency of study data by using
rigorous data and specimen management systems with built-in data quality assurance; (4) ensure quality of
biospecimens, assays, and reagents through harmonization of standard operating procedures across
EIDRC-Net sites and ongoing audit of cross-network procedures; and (5) develop the next generation of
investigators and in-country scientists by establishing a pilot research program that identifies, funds, and
mentors high-quality EIDRC applicants. By successfully accomplishing our five specific aims, the RTI-Duke
team will shift the outbreak research response paradigm by establishing scalable systems, processes, and
resources that not only provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate EIDRC-Net performance and carry
out CC core functions during inter-outbreak periods, but also can be enhanced and expanded to bolster CC
research surge response activities during outbreaks. The EIDRC CC team will be co-led by multiple Principal
Investigators Donald Brambilla, PhD (RTI), a biostatistician with advanced training in biology and an
experienced CC leader, and Michael Anthony (Tony) Moody, MD (Duke), a pediatric infectious disease
specialist and Chief Medical Officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Together they bring extensive
scientific expertise, leadership, administrative experience, and international research expertise, including in
geographic locations most relevant to the study of EIDs. This partnership also leverages the operational

10855481,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Rural Appalachian counties have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States (US).
While most cancer disparities are narrowing between Appalachian and non-Appalachian areas of the US,
disparities in lung and oral cancers are widening. A high prevalence of cigarette smoking (i.e., >30% in many
rural Appalachian counties vs. 11.5% nationally) primarily contributes to these disparities. As cultural factors,
deficiencies in the rural Appalachian healthcare system, and tobacco industry actions have undermined the
success of tobacco control approaches that proved successful elsewhere, we propose a new approach to
reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking in rural Appalachia. Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs, e.g., Zyn, On!),
which contain nicotine but no tobacco, have a similar toxicant profile to medicinal nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT), with most carcinogens and toxicants below the limit of detection. ONPs deliver nicotine similarly to NRT
lozenges but are about half as expensive, are marketed to smokers, and our preliminary data indicate that rural
Appalachian smokers find them more socially acceptable than cigarettes and more palatable than NRT. We
propose a 6-month, two-arm, remote, randomized switching trial of 1,000 adult smokers who live in rural
Appalachia. Participants will be randomized to either an ONP or an NRT (patch and lozenge) arm. During a 2-
week Sampling Phase, participants will sample products in their relevant study arm in a range of flavors and
nicotine concentrations and will select the flavor (ONP arm) and nicotine concentration (ONP and NRT arms)
for use during the Switch Phase. During a 12-week Switch Phase, participants will attempt to stop smoking
cigarettes and completely switch to their study ONP or NRT using study products provided for free. During a
14-week Observation Phase, participants will no longer receive study products but will be followed to evaluate
longer-term switching outcomes. Participants will self-report smoking and study product use on online surveys,
and changes in cigarette smoking will be confirmed using remote carbon monoxide assessment. This
significant and innovative study will be the first to evaluate whether ONPs are suitable substitutes for cigarette
smoking among rural Appalachian adults. If our study finds that ONP participants have greater success in
reducing or quitting smoking than NRT participants, results will provide a foundation for interventions and
regulations that support switching from cigarette smoking to ONP use. If our study finds that ONPs provide the
same (or worse) effects on smoking outcomes as NRT, results will suggest that public health practitioners,
regulators, and clinicians should steer smokers away from ONPs in favor of NRT."

Principal Investigator: Asuncion Mejias, M.D.
Abstract
This Core will serve three main goals. First, by enrolling all patients, obtaining the human samples, and collecting
the clinical data it will simplify sample organization, data management and compliance with all regulatory aspects
of the U19. In addition, the Clinical Core will support Projects 1 and 2, by performing the viral PCR assays,
which will improve analytical performance and efficiency; and the Data Management Core, by coordinating and
sharing de-identified clinical data.
Specifically, the Core will be responsible for: 1) enrolling infants in the first 6 months of life with influenza or
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as healthy non-infected controls, and obtaining sequential blood and respiratory
samples pre and post influenza and COVID-19 vaccination during the first 3 years of life; 2) sample organization
and distribution between Projects (1 and 2); 3) longitudinal clinical data collection, data curation and data
transfer to the Data Management Core for data analyses and integration with all immune assays; 4) measure
influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viral loads by quantitative real-time PCR in clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs)
from infants with influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach will optimize the use of resources and will
facilitate integration and synergy among all projects."

10862613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The US has experienced an unparalleled epidemic of incarceration. More than 9 million Americans are
incarcerated in jail (facilities housing individuals awaiting trial and serving short sentences) each year. Of
these, about 20% are women. However, the rate of growth for imprisonment among women is twice that of
men. Women are entering into institutions designed with little consideration for differences in gender-based
health needs that contributes to poor short- and long-term physical and mental health. Women incarcerated
have a higher burden of chronic conditions, psychiatric disorders, and drug dependence than men, including
conditions found more commonly in men in the general population. Physical activity (PA) can mitigate poor
health outcomes and have immediate effects. A single bout of moderate-to-vigorous PA improves anxiety
symptoms, decreases blood pressure, and improves sleep on the day it is performed. Despite these benefits,
physical inactivity is the single most common cardiovascular risk factor experienced by incarcerated
individuals. Jails may provide leisure-time and work-related opportunities to be physically active, but
opportunities vary by sex. Depending on policies and practices, jails may provide recreation time, an
unstructured time dedicated to leisure-time PA. However, 75% of individuals incarcerated do not attend rec-
time, with more women reporting higher rates of non-attendance. There are also disparities in work-related PA
opportunities while incarcerated, including disparities in work assignment availability for women and men.
However, there is no research about differential access to leisure and work-related PA opportunities in co-ed
jails and how PA impacts health during and after incarceration. The scientific objective of the proposed
research is to determine gender disparities in PA opportunities in 2 co-ed county jails and examine the impact
of these disparities on health while incarcerated and after release. We hypothesize that, compared to men,
women will have lower access to PA opportunities in co-ed jails leading to poorer mental and physical health
during and after incarceration. We will interview jail staff and individuals incarcerated to determine leisure and
work-related PA opportunities and policies in 2 northern Arizona jails. We will construct a 1-year prospective
cohort of 500 men and women incarcerated at 2 northern Arizona jails to understand gender-based differences
in patterns of time spent in PA and sedentary time while incarcerated and how those patterns impact physical
and mental health during and after incarceration. Finally, using data collected from the prospective cohort and
the novel parametric g-formula, we will estimate the probable impact of realistic, simulated PA interventions to
improve health outcomes. Access to opportunities to increase PA in jails is a health equity issue. The collection
of primary, longitudinal data to inform simulated interventions that hold promise to impact PA among women in
jails will provide information to the jails’ administration for recommended programmatic and policy changes."

HIV-1 establishes a chronic infection that the immune system cannot spontaneously clear. The virus has a
remarkable capacity to evade immune responses and generates a high sequence diversity that tolerates
defective genes. We and others have found that viral dissemination takes place both in vitro and in vivo
through cell-cell contacts, called virological synapses (VS), which can help mask immune detection of infected
cells, and promote viral quasispecies diversity that enable escape. Our data indicate that HIV Env, the central
viral protein involved in VS formation and viral entry, is regulated during the process of cell-to-cell transmission
and assumes distinct conformations on the cell surface versus the virus particle. We examine how low
abundance, rapid turnover and heterogeneity of processing of Env at the cell surface contributes to diminished
antigenicity of infected cells as compared to abundant cell-free virus or shed glycoprotein. The studies
proposed here test a model whereby the sequence of Env trafficking--to the cell surface, to the recycling
endosome, and then to the virus particle--supports distinct antigenic states along this pathway. In the prior
study periods we have learned that during VS formation Env works as a cell adhesion receptor between the
infected and uninfected cell, prior to its role as viral membrane fusion protein. HIV exploits cell biology
including the polarized receptor recruitment and viral endocytosis into the target cell, to enhance cell-to-cell
transmission. The T cell VS is critical for viral spread in cell culture and functions in vivo in lymphoid tissues of
humanized mice. Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are less potent at neutralizing cell-to-cell
infection than the same virus in a cell-free form. When tested against transmitted founder clones, bNAbs
frequently fail to inhibit 100% of cell-to-cell infection at maximum concentration, i.e. display reduced efficacy.
In the continuation of these studies, we will define the cellular mechanisms underlying the reduced potency
and efficacy of neutralizing antibodies against the VS. We will also test a model for how the multicopy
transmission of HIV through VS contributes to maintaining a diverse swarm of mutated sequences, or
quasispecies, that promotes immune escape. We hypothesize that cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission is a pivotal
immune evasion and escape strategy that drives viral persistence."
10827387,"Despite a growing understanding of the various pathogenic mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration,
there are currently no disease-modifying treatments available for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or related dementias.
The main contributing factors in AD, including aging, tauopathy, and APP/amyloid-β pathology, are linked to
mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are the main energy producers in the brain, but they can also generate
excessive free radicals, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which underlie diverse pathological cascades in AD
and other aging-related disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that increased mitochondrial ROS acts as a
central, feed-forward driver of diverse pathogenic processes in dementia, including aberrant cell signaling,
protein misfolding, neuroinflammation, and neuronal dysfunction. However, the exact roles of mitochondrial ROS
in neural function and pathology are not clear due to low selectivity and suitability of currently available tools for
mechanistic and therapeutic studies. In particular, current tools for inhibiting ROS are not selective for individual
sites of mitochondrial ROS production and can disrupt redox homeostasis and cell metabolism. Testing of new
mitochondrial ROS inhibitors with superior selectivity could generate novel mechanistic insights and potential
disease-modifying treatment strategies for AD. We recently discovered novel compounds, termed Suppressors
of Electron Leak (SELs), which are unique in their precision: each acts on only a single target in the mitochondria
and only when that target is producing ROS. SELs inhibit mitochondrial ROS production without hindering energy
and metabolism in diverse model systems. Our preliminary results suggest that an SEL targeting ROS production
from mitochondrial respiratory complex III ameliorates AD-associated neuropathology and neuroinflammation in
vivo, and modulates astrocytic reactivity and astrocytic-neuronal interactions in primary cells. However, the exact
mechanisms of these effects are not known and the efficacy of SELs in different proteinopathies requires further
investigation. In the proposed studies, we will determine if and how SELs targeting complex III ROS modulate
glial responses and neuronal deficits in different models of tauopathy and APP/Aβ-associated pathology. Using
pharmacological and genetic manipulations of complex III together with diverse approaches, including
electrophysiology, transcriptomics, and redox imaging, we will test novel hypotheses that complex III ROS
promotes neuroinflammatory cascades and neuronal impairments caused by tau dysfunction and hAPP/Aβ
pathology (Aim 1), and that complex III ROS increases astrocytic reactivity and aberrant astrocytic-neuronal
interactions by enhancing immune-related signaling in astrocytes (Aim 2). Together, the proposed studies will
test if targeting complex III ROS can reduce multiple types of pathogenic processes associated with dementia
and inhibit aberrant astrocytic responses that promote disease. These studies could provide the first evidence
that site-selective blockade of mitochondrial ROS is an effective approach for reducing neurodegeneration, and
reveal novel molecular pathways underlying glial and neuronal impairments in disease."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common aggressive pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. Despite many rigorous
clinical trials, the survival rate for high-risk patients has not increased in three decades. Furthermore, pediatric
RMS patients receive an aggressive combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, leading to life-long
treatment related consequences, underscoring the need to understand the basic biology of RMS to identify
new molecular targets. RMS is commonly viewed through the lens of muscle development where genetically
corrupted skeletal muscle progenitors fail to terminally differentiate. To understand RMS pathology, it is
essential to understand the role of RMS genes in normal myogenesis. To determine genes of interest, our lab
compared RMS core transcription factors (TFs), RMS essential genes, and genes overexpressed in our RMS
genetically-engineered-mouse-models (GEMMs) and identified three TFs were represented: Pax7, MyoD1,
and Sox8. PAX7 and MYOD1 play known roles in myogenesis and RMS, but the role of SOX8 in both
processes remains unclear. My proposed project focuses on determining the role of SOX8 in myogenesis and
rhabdomyosarcomagenesis. To determine the role of SOX8 in myogenesis I will perturb SOX8 in a primary
myoblast culture system as well as in vivo through our novel Sox8Flox mouse. Preliminary data shows that
SOX8 deficient myoblasts readily differentiate when not prompted, suggesting SOX8 is important for
maintaining muscle stem cell fate. I will analyze the ability of SOX8 deficient and over-expressing muscle stem
cells to pass through muscle differentiation to form functional muscle components. The second aspect of my
project is to identify the role of SOX8 in RMS. I will utilize human RMS cells and our RMS GEMMs to dissect
SOX8’s role in RMS tumorigenicity, tumor initiation, and transcriptional program through both loss-of-function
and gain-of-function experiments. Finally, I will determine the SOX8 interactome in human RMS cells to gain
mechanistic insight of SOX8 transcriptional regulation in human RMS. Understanding the role of SOX8 in
myogenesis and RMS will increase our understanding of myogenic cell corruption and reveal the potential for
core TFs to serve as therapeutic targets in RMS. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and the Hatley Lab
fully support my training goals and will support my training plans to learn scientific techniques for my project,
design rigorous and well-rounded experiments, scientific communication of my findings, and mentorship to
those around me. The Hatley Lab expertise in RMS, GEMMs, and molecular biology will aid in my training
goals. Additionally, the support garnered through the Core Facilities and Academic Programs Office at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital will further support my ability to perform the proposed experiments and
communicate the results effectively. The above combined with support from the Ruth L. Kirschtein Predoctoral
Individual National Research Award (F31) will provide an excellent launching pad for my career goal to
become an independent academic investigator."

 This proposal seeks to advance the state of the art in ophthalmic imaging to improve diagnosis and
treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is a leading cause of blindness in adults, and prevention of
irreversible vision loss requires prompt identification and treatment. Prior work has shown that
neurodegenerative findings in the retina, such as a decrease in thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL),
occur alongside and may predate microvascular changes. Measurements of ONL thickness may therefore
provide non-invasive metrics to monitor the progression of DR. Injectable agents like anti-VEGF therapy have
revolutionized DR treatment, but they often require repeat and invasive procedures for patients. There has
been great interest in novel in-office treatments that can be delivered into the suprachoroidal space; however
clinicians performing these injections are limited to 2D surface visualization that offers no depth information.
 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a low-coherence interferometry technique that allows for high-
resolution, volumetric imaging of the anterior and posterior eye. While OCT is currently the only clinical
technology that can visualize individual layers of the retina in vivo, conventional OCT systems are not able to
distinguish Henle’s Fiber Layer (HFL) from the ONL. Previous research has shown that HFL and the ONL can
be correctly visualized in a single cross-sectional scan by offsetting the pupil entry position of the sample beam.
Our research group has pioneered the invention of robotically-aligned OCT (RAOCT) that is capable of
imaging freestanding individuals and has precise, automatic control of beam position at the pupil plane. We
therefore propose to develop this technology for fully automated volumetric imaging of the complete HFL and
the ONL, in order to investigate these measurements as potential clinical biomarkers to monitor DR
progression. OCT similarly provides excellent in vivo visualization of distinct features in the anterior segment.
We also propose to develop a custom anterior segment handheld OCT probe that can be used for in vivo, real-
time visualization and quantification of suprachoroidal injections with novel therapeutics agents for DR.
 The expected outcome of the proposed research is a series of technologies that will provide automated
measurement of a novel retinal biomarker as well as real-time 3D image guidance for a novel, less invasive
clinical procedure. Our adapted RAOCT system will be capable of volumetric imaging and measurement of the
corrected ONL when accounting for HFL, without the need for operator guidance or input; in addition, our
custom handheld anterior segment OCT system will be able to provide real-time, 3D feedback to clinicians for
guidance and evaluation of suprachoroidal injections. We believe our proposed developments have the
potential to advance the state of the art in image guidance for diagnostics and therapeutics in DR."

This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States.
Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause
symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as
overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs.
Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains
stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase
in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small
thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to
understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be
developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering
and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural
history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid
imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the
downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also
accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate
a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of
development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs,
outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with
expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services
research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific
aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2)
Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to
increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders
throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be
applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the
National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative
model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve
the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and
overtreatment."

period. This comprehensive program provides the trainee with the technical and intellectual tools necessary to
pursue an academic career in research areas related to trauma and inflammation."
10827899,"SUMMARY. Numerous studies, including critical work from our lab, has revealed the fundamental mechanisms
by which proteins encoded by two Parkinson’s Disease (PD) genes – the PINK1 protein kinase and PARKIN
ubiquitin (Ub) ligase – promote the ubiquitylation and autophagic capture of damaged mitochondria to promote
their clearance by mitophagy. Recently, we have merged a quantitative proteomics platform with stem cell-
derived, induced neurons (iNeurons) harboring pathway mutations to elucidate PARKIN and PINK1 ubiquitylation
targets under endogenous conditions, and have determined the role of the mitochondrial deubiquitylase USP30
and the p97 segregase in PARKIN and mitophagic flux regulation. Yet, our understanding of the extent to which
other proteins mutated in PD collaborate with the PARKIN-PINK1 system to contribute to disease etiology
remains limited, as is our understanding of how the PINK1 activation threshold on the mitochondrial translocon
is mechanistically controlled. Here, we propose a series of experiments that address both of these knowledge
gaps. First, among the most compelling genes to emerge from our recent mitophagic flux CRISPR screen is
FBXO7, a gene mutated in PD (PARK15) and a member of the F-Box family of proteins that forms an SCF Ub
ligase. FBXO7’s critical functions and targets, as well as how its mutation predisposes to PD, are unknown.
Through interaction proteomics, we find that FBXO7 associates with multiple regulatory components of the
proteasome, and propose that FBXO7 may play a central role by integrating mitophagy and proteasomal control
mechanisms to support organelle homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will use our iNeuron system to examine FBXO7’s
role in mitophagic flux using an array of quantitative assays that examine sequential steps in the pathway, and
we will genetically and functionally dissect ubiquitylation targets and regulatory mechanisms as an initial step
toward understanding how patient mutations in FBXO7 may contribute to PD. Second, our preliminary data, and
work in the field, indicate that both PINK1 and USP30 are physically associated with the mitochondrial translocon,
placing the translocon at the nexus of PARKIN regulation. Our data show that USP30 has a role in controlling
both the threshold for PARKIN activation by removing Ub from the translocon and also may have a previously
unappreciated role in import quality control at the translocon itself. In Aim 2, we will systematically examine
translocon components and ubiquitylation for their roles in setting the threshold for PARKIN activation via Ub
phosphorylation. In parallel, we will elucidate how USP30 functions in this newly recognized Import Quality
Control (IQC) pathway for removal of Ub chains from translocon import substrates. Finally, our work has led to
the first visualization of PINK1 in association with the translocon using single-particle electron microscopy, and
we seek to further develop a biochemical and structural understanding of how this complex is assembled and
regulated. Together, these focused mechanistic studies on how these key molecules intersect with the PARKIN
system will provide a deeper understanding of mitochondrial quality control."

boosting, and molecularly-guided affinity-maturation. This study design derives from a growing consensus that
critical elements to a successful bnAb-based vaccine will be its ability to: i) efficiently activate and expand multiple
rare naïve bnAb-encoding B cell precursors; ii) immunofocus these B cell responses to canonical, conserved
bnAb epitopes on the HIV Env trimer and away from off-target epitopes; and iii) affinity-mature this response by
a process of molecularly-guided Env-Ab co-evolution. The study design proposed in this application addresses
each of these three critical aspects of bnAb elicitation. Importantly, we propose to target the V2 apex bnAb
supersite because of its unique vulnerabilities, which allow it to be targeted by bnAbs with less somatic
hypermutation and affinity maturation, without V-gene insertions or deletions and with less restriction for
particular light chain pairings. Our proposal is thus unique among the constellation of other HIV-1 vaccine
programs that target relatively more challenging bnAb targets such as the CD4bs, V3-glycan patch, fusion
peptide or MPER. The project includes three aims: Aim #1 will isolate HIV envelope V2-apex site bnAbs from
CAP256.SU Env SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus)-infected RMs, identify their unmutated common
ancestors (UCAs) through lineage-tracing by Next-Gen sequencing, and infer through Env-Ab co-evolution
analyses CAP256.SU “Env immunotypes” that select for affinity-maturation and neutralization breadth. Aim #2
will develop CAP256.SU trimer immunogens that exhibit enhanced affinity for V2 apex bnAb UCAs by employing
in-vitro directed reverse vaccine engineering that targets multiple rhesus and human V2 apex bnAb UCAs. We
will validate this optimized CAP256.SU GT-trimer for native configuration and prepare it as a soluble SOSIP
trimer and nanoparticle-displayed trimer for testing as a prime to activate multiple rare V2-apex bnAb B cell
precursors in outbred RMs. Aim #3 will investigate a B cell lineage-based prime-boost immunization strategy in
RMs to induce V2-apex bnAb responses by rationally engineered Env trimer protein immunizations. Novel
aspects of this vaccination regimen will be an HIV-1 Env SOSIP prime that activates multiple germline precursor
B cells; a V2 apex immunofocused boost using MT145KdV5 SOSIP Env (a simian immunodeficiency virus Env
from chimpanzees that retains selective antigenic cross-reactivity with HIV-1 in V2 apex C-strand epitopes), and
“polishing” immunizations with Env SOSIP trimers corresponding to affinity-graded V2 apex antigens from Env-
Ab coevolution analyses from SHIV.CAP256.SU infected RMs. This study will be the first of its kind, and if
successful in inducing bnAbs in RMs, would represent a new paradigm for lineage-based vaccine design."
10934352,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of both inherited intellectual
disability and monogenic cause of autism. It is caused by the loss of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1
(FMR1/FMRP) protein. FMRP, an RNA-binding protein, regulates target mRNAs through a variety of modes,
such as controlling mRNA localization, stabilization, editing, and/or translation. Translational repression by
FMRP is especially important in neuronal processes, where protein synthesis must be controlled in an orderly
fashion. In the absence of FMRP, translational control is disrupted resulting in the over-production of dendritic
proteins contributing to the FXS neuron phenotype of immature spines and hyperexcitability. Proper translation
regulation by FMRP requires microRNAs (miRNAs) and the RNA-induced silencing complex {RISC). The RISC
regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally by utilizing base matching between a miRNA and target mRNA,
which allows for specific recognition of target mRNAs. It has been shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in
several FXS models; however, no study has unbiasedly characterized the complete mi RNA landscape in human
FXS models. Another unaddressed aspect of FMRP-miRNA mediated gene regulation is whether the interactions
are always cooperative. Recent studies have highlighted an underappreciated role for FMRP in enhancing
translation rather than suppressing it. Thus, I hypothesize that FMRP loss alters the miRNA landscape, and that
FMRP not only coordinates miRNA-mediated repression, but in some cases antagonizes the miRNA-RISC
machinery to protect transcripts from improper regulation. To test my hypotheses, I will conduct experiments
aimed at the following goals: 1.) Test whether loss of FMRP alters global neuron miRNA expression patterns,
miRNA incorporation into the RISC, and localization of miRNAs to neuronal processes. 2.) Determine whether
FMRP-microRNA interactions regulate global and/or local translation of FMRP target mRNAs. To accomplish
these aims, I will require new training in induced-pluripotent stem cell cultures, neural organoids, and microscopy.
My sponsor, Dr. Gary Bassell, has expertise in these methods, and the scientific community of Emory University
School of Medicine will offer me an excellent training environment. Successful completion of this fellowship
proposal will not only reveal the extent to which miRNAs are dysregulated in human models of FXS, but also
reveal whether FMRP and miRNAs always act in a unimodal manner. Of equal importance, this project coupled
with Dr. Bassell's mentorship will allow me to transition from a molecular cancer biologist to an independent
molecular and cellular neurobiologist."
10827946,"Recent work has established a clear connection between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the disruption of the
circadian timing system. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship have not been clearly
identified. Interestingly, if we attempt to deconstruct this relationship and place it within the context of the
profound effects that Alzheimer’s disease has on cognition, several ideas begin to come into focus. First, data
to date has revealed that circadian timing within cortico-limbic circuits modulates complex behavioral states,
including cognition. Second, AD has marked effects on functional plasticity of these same circuits. These
observations raise an interesting question: could the cognitive deficits in AD result, in part, from the
dysregulation of circadian timing within cortico-limbic circuits? As an initial examination of this idea, we
propose to test the following hypothesis: The cognitive deficits during early- to mid-stage of AD results in part from
a systems-wide breakdown in the fidelity of the cortico-limbic circadian timing systems. To test this hypothesis, we
have assembled an innovative set of transgenic mouse models and state-of-the-art imaging methods that will
allow us to both profile and manipulate circadian timing over the course of disease progression. In Aim 1, the
effects of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) on the fidelity of cellular-and circuit-based time-keeping capacity will be
examined. In Exp. 1A, we will use a cell-culture based profiling approach to test the effects of Aβ oligomer on
the cell autonomous circadian timekeeping capacity of neurons isolated from the SCN (the locus of the master
circadian clock), the cortex and the hippocampus. In Exp. 1B brain slice explant imaging will be used to test
the effects of Aβ on circuit-based circadian rhythm generation. In Aim 2 we propose to profile clock timing and
clock-gated gene expression in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. In Exp. 2A, cranial window imaging (via
multiphoton microscopy) of clock timing in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus will be used to generate a
cellular- and systems-level profile of clock phasing, rhythm amplitude and oscillator synchrony over the
course of the AD-like pathology. This study will be complemented by immunofluorescence-based clock gene
profiling (Exp. 2B) and by transcriptomic profiling (Exp. 2C). In Aim 3, we will test the effects that disease
progression in the 5XFAD model has on clock-gated (Exp. 3A) and activity-evoked (Exp. 3B) cellular signaling,
as well as on dendritic spine formation. In Aim 4 we will test whether the desynchronization of cortico-limbic
oscillators underlies the cognitive deficits in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Key to this aim will be to test
whether the clock enhancing compound PF-670462 triggers the resynchronization of cortico-limbic oscillator
populations, and if so, whether this effect underlies the capacity of PF-670462 to augment cognition. If our
underlying hypothesis is validated, these data will provide an important starting point for new lines of inquiry
(and potentially new therapeutic interventions) designed to further understand the mechanistic relationships
(at a cellular, systems, and genetics level) between circadian timing and AD pathogenesis."

The University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) have directed an
NHLBI-sponsored T32 training grant supporting pre- and postdoctoral trainees in the interrelated areas of
hemostasis and thrombosis for the past 20 years. The goal of the program is to prepare these trainees for
careers in the blood sciences as successful investigators working in the areas related to hemostasis and
thrombosis that include academia, research institutes, and industry (pharma/biotech). UPENN and CHOP have
one of the largest concentration of investigators in the country interested in basic, translational, and clinical
research focused on uncovering new mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions related to hemostasis
and thrombosis. We draw upon 31 of these talented faculty members, eight of which are young trainers and 10
of which are female, to mentor and train our students/fellows and provide them with an integrated, collaborative
experience to ensure a rich pipeline of scientists interested in hemostasis and thrombosis. In addition to
rigorous scientific training (specific aim 1), our program has an intensive hemostasis and thrombosis didactic
curriculum (seven unique components; specific aim 2) and fosters development of key core competencies
such as responsible conduct of research, communication/writing skills, professionalism, management skills,
and career development tools all supported by the rich infrastructure at UPENN and CHOP (specific aim 3).
Dr. Rodney Camire is the Program Director and Dr. Douglas Cines is the Co-Director and they oversee all
aspects of the training program. Further, the program receives critical feedback from five Internal and three
External Advisory Committee members, along with successful former T32 alumni, who assist the Program
Director to monitor the progress of the trainees (specific aim 4). Since the last funding cycle, we modified the
total number of trainees to 2 predocs and 4 postdocs to better capture the best and brightest available
students/fellows working with our trainers who are drawn from six Departments/Division at UPENN and CHOP
and five different graduate groups at UPENN. Since its inception in 2000, the program trained 32 predoctoral
(40% female) and 36 postdoctoral scientists (48% female) 12% of which are underrepresented minorities. Over
75% of our trainees remain in careers which are primarily research, with ~51% of our pre- and postdoctoral
trainees in academia-primarily research, ~27% in the pharmaceutical/biotech sector-primarily research, with
the remaining (21%) in research-related careers as scientific writers/consultants. We believe this program, with
an extraordinarily rich and interactive group of faculty members, provides exciting research opportunities
combined with strong didactic and mentoring programs focused on todays and emerging new challenges in
hemostasis and thrombosis. We hope to have the opportunity to train individuals who will make important
contributions to these areas of research and will become leaders in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis."
10850551,"ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly but often silent disease, showing no specific signs until it reaches advanced
stages. The 5-year survival rate for advanced OC is only 50%, as most tumors ultimately become resistant to
treatment.1,2 Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival
in patients with epithelial OC, but the rate of cure has not improved over the last two decades. Computer models
suggest that detection of OC in early stages (I-II) could substantially improve cure rates, but the low prevalence
of OC in the general postmenopausal population restricts early detection efforts. Definitive diagnosis requires
operative intervention, but a consensus is that no more than 10 operations should be performed to diagnose a
single OC (>10% positive predictive value, PPV). According to current requirements, a first-line biomarker-based
screening test must achieve a sensitivity (SN) of at least 75% and a specificity (SP) of 98%, which can then be
further increased to 99.6% by adding a second-line screening modality such as transvaginal sonography
(TVS). 1,3-6 Because available screening tests remain inadequate to merit wide implementation, based on our
strong preliminary findings the proposed project aims to develop a novel, widely translatable, and economically
feasible test that can reduce OC mortality rates. Currently, the only promising strategy developed in the United
Kingdom Collaborative Trial for OC screening (UKCTOCS), is sequential analysis of the marker CA125 in serum
over time (Risk of OC Algorithm, ROCA), followed by TVS. UKCTOCS yielded only a modest 20% decrease in
mortality, insufficient to prompt the US Preventive Services Task Force to change its recommendation against
population-based OC screening. 1 The most likely reason for such modest mortality reduction by CA125
measures is their insufficient lead-time (estimated interval for detection prior to symptoms-based diagnosis). Bio-
mathematical modeling suggests that OC progresses to late stages more than 1 year before symptoms onset, a
time range when CA125 levels offer only limited diagnostic power. Therefore, to improve current clinical practice,
novel screening algorithms allowing substantially longer lead-times are needed. Based on our strong preliminary
findings, we aim to develop and validate a 2-pronged approach, whereby a first-line multi-biomarker test
recognizes OC with high SN (>80%) and modest SP (>80%), followed by a second-line biomarker velocity-based
test in women who tested positive in the first test, that then yields a combined SP of 98%. Supporting this
approach, we have generated a preliminary classification algorithm (threshold-based algorithm, TBA) based on
one-time measurement of multiple biomarker concentrations, that identifies with 80%SN-70%SP women who
will develop OC 1-7 years later. We further identified several biomarkers that display robust temporal dynamics
(velocity) associated with OC development in the 1-7 YTD interval. We thus hypothesize that we can generate
a 2-step algorithm that provides >75%SN at >98%SP, by combining our novel TBA with a velocity-based
algorithm (VBA). In this approach, similar to ROCA, the positive results of the TBA would trigger frequent follow-
up screening with VBA. The crucial advantage of our proposed algorithm vs. UKCTOCS' ROCA is that our novel
combined algorithm will recognize OC more than 1 YTD, increasing the probability of detecting OC at early,
treatment-responsive stages. We have discovered, and will prioritize for integration into the tests, several
promising candidate pre-diagnostic OC biomarkers, including autoantibodies (AAbs). Our long-term goal is to
develop a robust, accurate and widely translatable early-stage screening algorithm for risk of OC. Our
immediate objectives are to enhance our biomarker-based classifiers for pre-diagnostic samples, developed in
preliminary studies, by adding new promising candidate biomarkers we have identified, and validate them in
independent pre-diagnostic samples. The Specific Aims are: 1. Generate and validate an optimized first-line
threshold-based classification algorithm with 1.5-7 years lead-time. We will assess whether new candidate
biomarkers can further improve the algorithm we developed in preliminary studies, and then validate the
optimized algorithms in pre-diagnostic PLCO samples. 2. Generate and validate a biomarker temporal
dynamics (velocity)-based algorithm. We will validate the promising candidate velocity-based biomarkers
identified in Aim 1 in pre-diagnostic serial samples from UKCTOCS and NROSS prospective studies and
generate a velocity-based classification algorithm for detecting OC, to complement and enhance the cut-off-
based algorithm(s) developed in Aim 1. 3. Determine the performance of a 2-step (threshold+velocity)–
based OC screening algorithm with 1.5-7 years lead-time in serial samples. We will determine the
cumulative performance of sequential algorithms including the threshold-based algorithm developed in Aim 1,
followed by the velocity-based algorithm developed in Aim 2, for OC screening in the 1.5-7 YTD interval, in serial
UKCTOCS samples. In summary, we anticipate our results will yield development and validation of the first
blood biomarker-based algorithms with the required >75% SN, >98% SP, for reliably classifying OC in preclinical
samples collected 1.5-7 YTD. These algorithms will be ready for validation in prospective screening clinical trials
to evaluate the effect of early detection upon OC survival. The proposal is supported by extensive preliminary
data and will be carried out by a highly qualified, multi-disciplinary research team."
10850565,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shorter sleep duration has been consistently associated with childhood obesity, and the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians promote sleep as part of their obesity prevention efforts. The pediatric
primary care setting has enormous potential to promote sleep, but a lack of time at the point of care is a key
barrier, and insufficient sleep and childhood obesity are not equally distributed across sociodemographic groups.
To overcome these barriers, mobile health platforms need to be developed to deliver behavioral sleep promotion
remotely in the home setting, with tailoring to individual and contextual factors to help ensure equitable
effectiveness across sociodemographic groups. Multi-component sleep promotion interventions have been
developed, and initial findings suggest that behavioral sleep interventions are effective. However, these
interventions have not been designed for remote delivery in the pediatric primary care context. Furthermore, the
individual components have not yet been optimized, meaning some components may be ineffective or counter-
effective. The study team’s objective is to engineer a mobile health platform for the pediatric care setting to
promote longer sleep duration for childhood obesity prevention. Their central hypothesis is that they will identify
an optimal set of intervention components to increase sleep duration and prevent excess weight gain, with
equitable effectiveness across sociodemographic backgrounds. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three
specific aims and will be guided by the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework. Under aim 1, an
optimization trial will be conducted using an innovative experimental design to determine optimal component
settings for sleep promotion. A total of four candidate components will be experimentally tested: 1) a sleep goal
component, 2) a digital messaging component, 3) a parent-directed incentive component, and 4) a personalized
feedback component. An advisory board (family, youth, and clinicians) will provide feedback throughout to
ensure acceptability of the component content. Under aim 2, the investigative team will determine if optimal
settings for sleep promotion lead to lesser gains in fat mass index. They will also measure total energy intake
and the timing and composition of meals to gain mechanistic insights. Under aim 3, the investigators will
determine if optimal settings for sleep promotion are comparable across individual- and neighborhood-level
sociodemographic factors. This innovative research shifts attention from the problem of insufficient sleep to a
solution for insufficient sleep, and represents the first application of the MOST framework to engineer a mobile
health platform to promote sleep for obesity prevention that will be equitable across sociodemographic groups.
The proposed research will greatly advance the field of behavioral sleep medicine and reimagine how insufficient
sleep duration and obesity are prevented in pediatric healthcare."

The San Diego Digestive Diseases Research Center (SDDRC) has the overall mission to foster basic,
translational and clinical research for improving the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and liver
diseases. The Enrichment Program supports this mission by promoting scientific exchange among
investigators with research interests within the field and enhancing their interactions with investigators from other
fields. Over the past four years since its inception, the SDDRC has witnessed substantial enthusiasm for the
events organized by the Enrichment Core, demonstrated by the consistently high turnout of attendees and the
positive feedback received. The Program will continue in its efforts to initiate and coordinate a range of
educational activities, including monthly research seminars and an annual Center symposium to provide state-
of-the-art overviews in key research areas, catalyze interdisciplinary interactions, showcase early-stage
investigators, and inform the Center membership about Core services and opportunities. The Program helps to
integrate trainees into the activities of the Center and promotes the development of the next generation of
digestive diseases researchers through organizing workshops and career development events. Moreover, the
Program aims to engage and educate the public on issues of digestive health and to generate the awareness
and support needed to sustain research funding in digestive diseases. Importantly, most of the educational
events are entirely initiated and coordinated by the Center, so they would not exist without the efforts of the

10861782,"This is the first submission of this application for competitive renewal of the fourth cycle of the Adolescent Health
Promotion Research Training Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The goal of the program is to
provide training in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) research to post-doctoral Adolescent Medicine
physicians. While there has been some major success in utilizing effective interventions to address the high
rates of SRH morbidity among adolescents and young adults (AYA), significant age- and racial-ethnic health
disparities exist for youth in the United States. This is compounded by workforce shortages of individuals who
are trained in Adolescent Health with specialized skills to use scientific evidence to ensure the healthy transition
of youth into adulthood. Adolescent Medicine specialists, physicians who have contact with AYA in clinical
settings, must also serve as leaders in the development and implementation of new prevention strategies to
effectively prevent STIs, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy. This requires physicians to critically understand the
biopsychosocial development of adolescents and to build upon scientific advancements derived through
collaboration with nurses, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral, social, and basic scientists, and
statisticians. We have created an interactive, interdisciplinary, team-science training environment using an adult
learning model that facilitates effective engagement of physicians and research scientists across pertinent
disciplines to foster the development of our trainees. Over the last decade, we have successfully recruited and
retained a diverse pool of fellows, most of whom are women and half are from under-represented minority
groups. Of the fellows appointed to the grant in the last cycle, 100% completed advanced graduate coursework
at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and 80% entered the program with or formally obtained advanced
degrees, all fellow graduates who attempted subspecialty certification boards have been successful, all
graduates were employed in a related field at fellowship completion, and two recently received NIH K23 mentored
awards. Based on these successes, we now request an additional five years of funding to continue to support
three fellows per year. The Adolescent Health Promotion Training program at Johns Hopkins University is
uniquely qualified to develop and maintain such a program given the active research programs in our unit, the
quality of our core faculty, the successful outcomes of our previous trainees, the infrastructure, resources, and
environment available to foster research development, and the continuous influx of bright dedicated physicians
committed to careers in Adolescent Medicine. Our program also emphasizes innovation at the intersection of
SRH and the social ecology of adolescence to reduce health disparities in line with national health objectives."

This proposal aims to develop new synthetic methods that utilize electrical energy for C-H functionalization re-
actions. Electrically driven C-H functionalization is significant since it eliminates superstoichiometric amounts of
strong oxidants that often contribute to high costs and poor site selectivity. The innovation of the proposed work
is the development of CuIII/CuII-Nu redox catalysts, where Nu represents various carbon and heteroatom-based
nucleophiles. These CuIII-Nu complexes feature inverted ligand fields, where LUMO resides on the ligand instead
of the Cu center. Therefore, electrochemically generated CuIII-Nu complexes can serve as tamed sources of Nu
radical to enable hydrogen atom transfer and radical interception. Our method separates two-electron C-H func-
tionalization processes into two parallel, single-electron oxidation events with fast electrode kinetics. As a result,
the CuII/CuIII mediated C-H functionalization occurs at much lower potentials (by 0.5-2 V) than those of traditional
electrochemical C-H functionalization methods, significantly improving energy efficiency and selectivity. Prelim-
inary result shows selective functionalization of C(sp3)-H bonds with a wide range of simple nucleophiles that
are otherwise incompatible with chemical oxidants typically used in conventional C-H functionalization reactions,
For example, fluoride, which is known to cause decomposition of a wide range of oxidants, can be directly used
as F source under our electrochemical condition. The only side products are readily manageable metal salts,
significantly reducing the cost. Moreover, all CuIII-Nu intermediate can be isolated and characterized at low tem-
peratures to reveal fundamental properties and reactivity, e.g., redox potentials, hydrogen atom transfer, radical
capture, alkene addition, and other unproductive reactivity. This information is used to select suitable electro-
chemical/chemical conditions, e.g., voltage, current, temperature, ligand, to rationally improve the reaction effi-
ciency and selectivity."
10861922,"The ability to store and retrieve sequentially related information is arguably the foundation of intelligent
behavior. It allows us to predict the outcomes of sensory situations, to achieve goals by generating
sequences of motor actions, to 'mentally' explore the possible outcomes of different navigational or motor
choices, and ultimately to communicate through complex verbal sequences generated by flexibly chaining
simpler elemental sequences learned in childhood. Sleep extracts invariant features from the learned
information, leading to the generation of explicit knowledge and insight. Despite remarkable progress,
including work by PI and co-PI of this project, many critical questions remain about role of sleep in memory
and learning. Here we propose to address these questions through the development of computational
models that are probed and validated through in vivo experiments in mice. We will explore the hippocampal
(HC) and neocortical (NC) mechanisms underlying how sequences are acquired and subsequently
consolidated through off-line replay during Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) in a manner that minimizes
interference between overlapping and/or reversed sequences and how NC may chain sequence fragments
together. We combine computer modelling (Bazhenov) of spiking neural networks that mimic awake and
SWS brain dynamics, including NC slow oscillations and HC Sharp Wave Ripples (SWR), with high density
neural ensemble recordings (McNaughton) in mice, in a controlled behavioral setting including sequence
learning and subsequent, chemogenetically induced SWS, which makes it possible to observe how learned
sequence representations in NC evolve spontaneously over prolonged periods of SWS. The PIs have been
collaborating on and discussing this topic for the past several years, resulting in specific hypotheses that
can be explored in real brains. The project outcome will provide a better understanding of how knowledge
is extracted from experience, what brain circuits are involved and how brain dynamics are shaped by the
development of a rich internal model of the world, including the ability to predict the outcomes of current
situations and one's own actions in that context.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The ability to store and retrieve sequentially related information is the foundation of intelligent behavior and
brain executive function. Deficits in this ability, resulting from disruption of brain circuits, are seen in
depression, schizophrenia and PTSD. Better understanding of the mechanisms and brain dynamics
underlying the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of sequential information will lead to interventions to
improve cognitive performance, memory and learning in healthy subjects and patients with mental illness."

Gram-negative bacteria have become broadly resistant to known classes of antibiotics. Treatment of infections
by these pathogens has become increasingly challenging and efforts in the past two decades in discoveries of
new classes of antibacterial agents have failed. In this grant application, we have turned our attention to
bulgecins, a group of three natural products (bulgecins A, B and C) discovered in the 1980s, which potentiate
the activities of b-lactam antibiotics to Gram-negative bacteria. The three natural products were prepared by
total synthesis and we documented the potentiation activity in microbiological experiments. Furthermore, we
documented by both fluorescence microscopy and by scanning-electron microscopy that the combination of
bulgecin A and a b-lactam antibiotic (ceftazidime or meropenem) cause bulges in the bacterial envelope, which
are points of structural instability that burst and lead to bactericidal effect. In addition, we documented that
merely two lytic transglycosylases out of 11 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa—Slt and MltD (with ceftazidime) and
Slt and MltG (with meropenem)—are the targets of bulgecin A. We also report the X-ray structure for the
complex of Slt with bulgecin A. We disclose the next phase of this research in two Specific Aims. Specific Aim
1 addresses our planned analysis of the bulgecin-biosynthetic cluster, which we discovered recently. The
eight-gene cluster converts L-serine and L-aspartic acid to bulgecinine, a key structural component of
bulgecins, and then in turn, to bulgecins A, B and C. We propose to study these genes both for their
enzymological reactions and for their structures. A proposal is outlined to prepare the high-value bulgecinine
using a host bacterium as a “one-pot” reaction vessel. We already have reported a chemical synthesis for
bulgecinine and a second (shorter) synthetic approach is also proposed. A detailed plan is outlined in Specific
Aim 2 to optimize the bulgecin template. The process takes advantage of our X-ray structure for the complex of
Slt and bulgecin A in a computational analysis to identify analogs that will bind more potently to lytic
transglycosynases and achieve penetration into Gram-negatives more avidly. The proposed targets will be
synthesized and fully analyzed in a series of both in vitro and in vivo experiments in identification of a suitable
combination of a bulgecin analog with a b-lactam antibiotic in fighting Gram-negative bacterial infections."

Transgender women (TW) are at significantly higher risk of getting HIV, yet research indicates they are less
likely to use pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and continue to have misconceptions about its utility. Trans-
inclusive communication, delivered by trusted peers, is a potentially useful strategy to address this gap, but
reaching a large number of TW can be difficult. The SIS (Sisters Influencing Sisters) study will use
preliminary findings from a NIMH funded R21 that utilized commercial marketing techniques called perceptual
mapping and vector message modeling to develop and concept test TW specific PrEP messages. Using the
Gender Affirmation Framework and the EPIS Implementation Framework as guides, we propose to embed
these tested PrEP messages and materials in the SIS intervention and pilot it using TW social influencers (SIs)
via Instagram. Specific aims of the research are: Aim 1: Design a community-led, social-media based PrEP
messaging training for TW SIs. We will recruit a Community Advisory Board (CAB) who will consult on all
aspects of the study, including the development of an SI training and recruitment of SIs, tools/measures,
dissemination of findings, and input on a future trial. Aim 2: Refine PrEP messaging materials, design the SIS
intervention modules, and identify and train TW SIs. We will finalize PrEP messaging materials, engaging
trans artists to refine images and convert to social media formats. With the help of our CAB, we will identify and
engage SIs on social media from two intervention locations (San Francisco Bay, Philadelphia) and two
comparison locations (New York and Los Angeles). Intervention SIs will be trained on the SIS intervention
content as well as delivery of clinical referrals and resources to their communities. Aim 3: Aim 3: Pilot test the
SIS intervention to collect feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy data to inform a full trial. We
will implement standardized core components of the Instagram-based intervention, evaluate dissemination and
reach of the PrEP messages, and monitor and evaluate engagement with the materials. To assess promise of
efficacy, we will identify a cohort of 120 followers (80 intervention, 40 comparison) to complete baseline, mid and
end of intervention surveys to track changes and compare levels of PrEP knowledge and PrEP perceptions. We
will also pilot remote collection of hair samples to monitor PrEP uptake and use in a subsample of participants
(n=30; 5 each SI) and do in-depth intervention implementation evaluation. We expect that findings will
significantly contribute to our understanding of how to communicate with a diverse group of TW, how to leverage
social media as a powerful communication channel, and how to disseminate information to increase PrEP
awareness and uptake by addressing the unique HIV prevention needs and concerns of TW."
10861930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental patterns,
increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood.
In response to RFA-AA-21-007, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium
on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for the next 5 years a
diverse community sample of mostly no-to-low male and female drinkers at baseline that NCANDA recruited
when age 12-21 years and has tracked over the last 8 years (N=831; 93% retention rate) across 5 sites.
Monitoring has involved annually-acquired multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state fMRI, task fMRI),
cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer and our mobile
app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep and physical
activity tracking. This cohort sequential design uniquely positions NCANDA-A to quantify transient or enduring
alcohol-related disturbances in specific adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories and
functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol's effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g., age
of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking in individuals during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A
will quantify the impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and
their relations with alcohol use patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among
patterns of alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine
the extent to which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in
cognition, affect, sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects
of frequent binge alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history,
impact of alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by
discovering elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."

The functions of human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), including self-renewal and differentiation, are
required for the constant production of male gametes over a long reproductive lifespan; imbalances in this
process directly contribute to infertility or germ cell-derived cancers. Despite this wide range of healthcare
implications, the cellular and molecular regulation of human SSCs is poorly understood, in particular with
respect to the microenvironment in which SSCs reside, termed the niche. Despite research efforts, a major gap
in knowledge remains, i.e., how does the SSC niche influence the functions of human SSCs? Our long-term
goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate human SSCs. Unlike rodents, for which genetic
models are routinely used to evaluate the roles of the niche in regulating SSC functions in vivo, functional
dissection of the human SSC niche has been challenging largely due to a lack of experimental tools. Single cell
omics has enabled a molecular catalogue of human testicular cell types but falls short on providing insights into
the spatial and functional interactions between SSCs and the niche due to tissue disassociation.
We have recently established a spatial transcriptomics (ST) approach that successfully recapitulates many
aspects of the mouse and human spermatogenesis. This approach quantifies genome-wide gene expression
of individual testicular cells within intact tissue sections. Using this ST approach, coupled with a series of
functional, cellular, and molecular analyses, we will test our central hypothesis that human SSCs are
functionally regulated by the niche through a selective set of ligand-receptor (LR) interactions. First, we will
perform a systematic characterization of LR interactions at the human SSC niche. Second, we will
comparatively study the human and mouse SSC niches under the hypothesis that human specific LR pairs
may be crucial to human SSC functions. Finally, we will examine the contribution of germline cells to the
functions of human SSC niche. The successful completion of the proposed work will significantly enhance our
mechanistic understanding of the functional role of the niche in regulating human SSC activities. It will also
provide much needed insights into the etiology of male infertility, fertility preservation for cancer patients, and
the successful establishment of in vitro spermatogenesis."

The guidelines for the cardiovascular care of spinal cord injury (SCI) have remained essentially unchanged since
mean arterial pressure (MAP) management at 85-90 mmHg was recommended 20 years ago. Due to the
heterogeneity in SCI, there is a critical need for a precision medicine treatment. A promising target is impaired
autoregulation, or the ability of blood vessels to regulate organ blood flow across a wide range of MAP. This
results in altered blood flow through the spatial domain, with hypoperfusion at the permanently damaged injury
epicenter (umbra) and gradually increasing blood flow in the surrounding vulnerable tissue (penumbra). To
capitalize, our team is developing an ultrasound implant to monitor spinal cord blood flow in humans without
contrast. Ultrasound is enabled by removal of the posterior aspect of the vertebra via laminectomy, a common
procedure after SCI to relieve pressure. Autoregulation can then be measured through metrics such as transfer
function analysis (TFA), presenting a diagnostic tool for the acute care physician after SCI, with quantification of
injury extent and severity. Therapeutically, the spatial distribution of blood flow can provide feedback for targeted
MAP management. We hypothesize that after SCI, autoregulation as measured by ultrasound will be
impaired around the injury, extending into the penumbra. Concurrently, systemic MAP management will
differentially affect blood flow over distance from injury, with outcomes depending on penumbra flow.
We have made progress towards this goal and will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:
Preliminary Data: We have developed an algorithm, FlowMorph, which can extract single-vessel flow
parameters from ultrasound data and track them over time. We have also implemented a rigorous measure of
autoregulation, TFA, and detected the limits of autoregulation capacity in healthy spinal cord. Finally, we have
characterized the spatial distribution of blood flow in spinal cord without MAP management.
Aim 1: Establish autoregulation as a clinical marker of vascular injury following SCI: We will use the novel
techniques listed above to quantify autoregulation through distance from SCI and link it to functional outcomes.
Autoregulation as a prognostic marker will reveal the penumbra as a clinically important area vulnerable to MAP
changes. Moreover, it will provide mechanistic insight into using MAP management to optimize blood flow.
Aim 2: Use MAP management to protect the penumbra: Following SCI, we will treat rats with MAP
management at various levels, both pharmacologically- and volume-induced. We will measure the spatial
distribution of flow using FlowMorph and relate it to functional outcomes. Different MAP levels will result in
variable levels of flow through the umbra, penumbra, and healthy tissue due to altered autoregulation. We expect
to find that penumbra flow will be the strongest predictor of outcomes, providing a therapeutic target in the clinic.
This study is significant because it will be the first to use metrics of autoregulation as a clinically useful diagnostic
tool in SCI. Therapeutically, it will provide a blood flow-based personalized target for MAP management."
10824202,"The transition from adolescence to adulthood is characterized by increased rates of prescription opioid use and related problems. These rates may be even higher among emerging adults who use cannabis. National surveys show cannabis use is rising in young adults and is related to increased opioid use and opioid use disorder. However, there is a substantial gap in our knowledge of what individual risk factors might contribute to the development of opioid and cannabis co-use and related problems, and we know little about co-use in the context of pain. Identifying malleable factors that convey risk for problematic opioid use in the context of cannabis co-use would inform the development of preventive interventions that could be targeted to modify substance use risk for emerging adults in medical settings. Emerging adults receive the lowest level of preventative medical care when compared to all other developmental stages. Thus, a single medical encounter in which opioid medications are prescribed to manage acute pain offers a unique window into substance use patterns, and a unique opportunity to develop and deliver future interventions. The proposed study will utilize a developmental model of the impact of opioid exposure by legitimate prescription during emerging adulthood, with consideration for existing substance use, as well as pain and psychosocial experiences of the individual. This prospective cohort study will enroll emerging adults (ages 18-25) who either have no lifetime history of cannabis (5% of sample) or have used cannabis in the past month (95% of sample) and are prescribed an opioid for acute pain management in the course of routine outpatient healthcare. These participants will be followed closely during the 2-weeks post-prescription, and then prospectively for 2 years, with multimethod assessments to capture short- and long-term trajectories of opioid and cannabis co-use in the context of pain experiences. The central hypothesis is that pain experiences as well as patterns of opioid and cannabis use in the acute pain period will influence opioid use, cannabis use, and related problems over time. We will also examine the contributory roles of psychosocial and pain-related risk and protective factors, including the use of non-pharmacologic pain management strategies and prescription characteristics. Objective data on dispensed opioid medications will be obtained from medical records and prescription drug monitoring databases, and bioassay data will verify self-report of substance use. Daily associations between pain experiences, pain catastrophizing, negative and positive affect, use of non-pharmacologic pain management strategies, cannabis use, and opioid use will also be examined. Importantly, many of these risk and protective factors can be impacted with biobehavioral treatments. Determining which malleable risk and protective factors are most important during this developmental period will provide critical information for the design of interventions aimed at reducing substance use disorders and chronic pain in emerging adults."

Prostate cancer is the second-most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American
men. Early detection of localized disease is common but is followed by the more challenging task of prognosing
a highly variable clinical course. Localized tumors are often indolent, but not always. Current clinical risk-
assessment schemes incorporating serum abundance of prostate specific antigen (PSA), tumor size & extent,
and tumor grade based on biopsy are limited in accuracy; over a quarter of patients are over-treated. The goal
of this proposal is to fill the urgent need for better markers discriminating indolent from aggressive localized
prostate cancers. An improved method of risk stratification may lie in hereditary factors. Prostate cancer is one
of the most strongly inherited (h2 = 57%), with accumulating evidence associating rare variants, common variants
and genetic ancestry with clinical outcomes. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that variant status of DNA
damage repair (DDR) genes, prostate cancer polygenic risk and genetic ancestry will improve clinical risk
stratification of prostate cancer. To address this hypothesis, the aims of this proposal focus on two clinical
outcomes representing key decision points in the management of the disease. Specifically, the aims are to
investigate the biomarker potential of the described germline factors to predict (1) progression from active
surveillance of a patient, informing whether they should defer treatment, and (2) biochemical relapse after
therapy of a patient, informing the most appropriate treatment course. For both aims, germline DNA samples
from a cohort of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and with extensive clinical follow-up data will
be sequenced using a targeted sequencing approach. A bespoke bioinformatics workflow will be used to derive
germline genomic endpoints: pathogenic and likely pathogenic DDR variants, genomic risk score and genetic
ancestry. For each aim, exploratory univariate and multivariate analyses will validate associations between
genomic and clinical endpoints, and control for clinical prognostic features. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards
regression models will be trained, validated, and evaluated for predictive performance to establish the utility of
germline genomic biomarkers in prostate cancer clinical risk stratification. The results of this proposal have the
potential to transform standard-of-care management for this disease and thus substantially contribute to
enhancing human health and quality of life."
10825228,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Within hospitals, infected patients are sources of bacterial transmission, often through the colonization of high-
touch surfaces and equipment. Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is the Gram-negative bacterium with the highest
rate of multidrug resistance, and is a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, bloodstream, soft tissue,
and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although infected patients are sources of bacterial transmission within
hospitals, no common reservoirs in the human body have been established for Ab. Hospitals often institute active
surveillance strategies to mitigate the spread of bacteria between patients. However, outbreaks of Ab are still
common. Moreover, there are increasing reports of community-acquired Ab infections across the globe,
suggesting the existence of extra-hospital reservoirs. Two questions remain unanswered: how does the first
patient get infected, and how are new Ab strains introduced into hospitals? We have recently demonstrated that
Ab can hide undetected in murine bladder cells and then reactivate when stimulated by medical intervention.
This lead to the hypothesis that Ab can be asymptomatically carried and introduced into hospitals by patients in
intracellular reservoirs before hospitalization, and that subsequent medical interventions, such as the use of
catheters, could trigger a resurgence of Ab infection from such reservoirs. Here we will employ murine models
to explore this hypothesis. We recently developed catheter- and non-catheter-associated murine Ab UTI models
by employing UPAB1, a recent MDR community-acquired urinary clinical isolate. In the non-catheter-associated
UTI (ncUTI) model, although immunocompetent mice were not susceptible to long-term ncUTI,
immunocompromised mice exhibited high bacterial burdens in urine, bladders, and kidneys, taking up to 8 weeks
to completely resolve the infection. Notably, we found that introduction of a catheter into resolved mice led to the
development of Ab CAUTI in ~50% of the mice in just 24 hours. Genetic characterization of the recovered
bacteria confirmed that the same strain re-colonized the urinary tract. Moreover, intracellular bacteria were
detected in the bladders of resolved mice up to two months after resolution of the initial infection. We named
these small groups of intracellular bacteria ABIRs (Ab intracellular reservoirs). Furthermore, we also detected
intracellular bacteria in alveolar macrophages during a respiratory infection. More than 300,000 patients receive
mechanical ventilation in the US every year. Several complications often arise from the use of ventilators, such
as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). We have developed a murine model for VAP. Here we propose to
investigate the relationship between ABIR formation and resurgent urinary and respiratory infections
Understanding how Ab strains reside in the host and the events causing resurgence may lead, in the future, to
modified surveillance strategies and/or preventative treatments to eradicate bacterial reservoirs previous to the
use of ventilators, catheters, and other treatments that weaken the host immune system."
10828389,"Project Summary/Abstract
The diverse group Bacteroidales is a predominant component of human intestinal microbiota, linked to numerous
disease processes. Manipulation of Bacteroidales at the genus and species level holds therapeutic potential, but
requires a more detailed understanding of the intestinal ecosystem. Bacteroides spp. genomes encode
polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL), allowing enzymatic breakdown, membrane transport, and utilization of
complex carbohydrates. Bacteroides spp. antagonize one another within the intestinal environment by delivering
toxic effectors via contact-dependent type VI secretion systems (T6SS), resulting in altered capacities for
colonization and persistence. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that contact among Bacteroides spp.
results in dynamic adaptive responses that alter cellular behavior and contribute to persistence in the intestinal
environment. The proposed experiments will discover contact-dependent proteomic responses important for
competition within Bacteroides communities using cutting-edge proteomics technology (Aim 1). Molecular
mechanisms of two known contact-dependent responses, altered polysaccharide utilization (Aim 2) and T6SS-
mediated delivery of hcp-effector fusions (Aim 3), will be elucidated and translated to competitive growth and
intestinal colonization in a gnotobiotic mouse model. A long-term research goal is to understand mechanisms
underlying interbacterial interactions among intestinal symbionts for the development of targeted therapeutics.

The broad goal of our T32 training grant program is to provide in-depth research training to talented individuals
who are committed to pursuing basic, translational and/or clinical research on topics in anesthesiology, critical
care medicine, pain medicine and the perioperative sciences. Our program structure ensures that trainees
learn state-of-the-art research techniques, the fundamentals of posing research questions, the critical thinking
involved in analyzing and reporting their results, and the tools and skills required to perform research rigorously
and ethically. Through direct mentored research, formalized didactic training, seminars and conferences, our
trainees learn to design and conduct laboratory experiments and clinical studies, to formulate and write grants,
to perform appropriate statistical analyses, and to understand the regulations, reproducibility and ethical issues
that are involved in research. Our program optimizes functional interactions between trainees and diverse
faculty mentors, and it provides an environment in which trainees can develop into high quality clinically
relevant researchers with the skills to effectively collaborate with both clinical and basic science investigators.
Faculty are organized into 5 tracks that encompass the broad areas of research focus in the Department of
Anesthesia: (1) Critical Care and Immunology, (2) Neurosciences and Pain, (3) Omics, Bioinformatics, and
Medical Informatics, (4) Outcomes and Disparities Research, and Implementation Sciences, and (5) Molecular
Biology and Biomedical Imaging. Each track is overseen by an appropriate senior faculty researcher and
includes physician-scientist and PhD-scientist faculty mentors. Faculty mentors come from the Department of
Anesthesia as well as from multiple clinical and basic science departments across the UCSF campuses. We
focus recruitment efforts on outstanding MD and MD-PhD candidates who are completing or have already
completed their anesthesiology residency or clinical fellowship in an anesthesia subspecialty. We also
occasionally appoint outstanding physician trainees from other clinical disciplines or PhD scientists, provided
they are doing research training with faculty in the Department of Anesthesia and that their research and
career goals are directly aligned with the mission of academic anesthesiology. We request to continue with 4
slots per year. This will allow us to accommodate the research trainee pool derived from the Research
Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, which is a 4-year program (PGY2-PGY5/CA1-CA4) that includes
2 years of protected research time, and to bring in additional individuals through our categorical residency and
clinical fellowships. We will require a 2-year minimum commitment to the T32 training program, but we will
encourage some trainees to do 3 years of training if it is appropriate for their individualized research training
program. Our T32 program prepares trainees to become independent investigators performing research on a
wide range of topics that are relevant to the field of anesthesiology and helps to lay the groundwork for their
development into leaders in academic anesthesiology and research."
10827052,"Project Summary
The decline in synaptic plasticity with age is thought to impose severe constraints on the recovery from
amblyopia in adults. Although this developmental loss was previously thought to be irreversible, our previous
work established that robust plasticity can be reactivated in the adult visual cortex by dark exposure (DE)
followed by light reintroduction (LRx). We outline a series of experiments to delineate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that couple DE/LRx to the rejuvenation of synaptic plasticity in the adult visual system.
We propose that DE induces homeostatic changes in the composition of synaptic NMDARs in the primary
visual cortex, which lowers the threshold for Hebbian plasticity. However, the response to DE over-
compensates for the loss of visual input and results in neuronal hyper-excitability. The threshold for activation
of perisynaptic proteolysis by LRx at thalamocortical synapses is also lowered by DE. The response to LRx
reduces feed-forward excitation to the cortex and is mediated by rapid plasticity of presynaptic function."

10932209,"Project Summary/Abstract
Underage drinking in the US is a serious public health concern. Early onset of alcohol use (<15 years old),
increases the risk of developing alcohol use disorder by seven times compared to those who start drinking later.
Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of biopsychosocial factors associated with early alcohol use onset
in adolescence is crucial to address this problem. To this end, extensive studies have been conducted and have
identified genetic factors linked to future alcohol use, such as family history of alcoholism and higher polygenic
liability. The limited scope of genetic studies poses significant challenges including the (1) primary inclusion of
participants of European ancestry, (2) exclusion of those in the early stages of alcohol use, and (3) unclear
clinical applicability. This necessitates the need for exploring non-genetic environmental exposures (i.e.,
exposome) associated with alcohol use onset. As such, the proposed study aims to leverage data from the highly
powered and nationally diverse cohort, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD; n = 11,000,
9-10-year-olds), and use a novel eXposome-Wide Association Studies (XWAS) approach to identify
exposomic risk factors and derive PolyeXposure Alcohol Risk Scores (PXARS) for alcohol use onset in
adolescents up to age 14. The performance of PXARS will be benchmarked against these established genetic
risk factors. Furthermore, the risk for alcohol use onset is linked to poor inhibitory control; thus, this proposed
project will comprehensively examine the neurobiological and behavioral correlates of prospective alcohol use
onset using data from the Stop Signal Task (SST). Studies also suggest that exposomic factors may influence
inhibitory control development; therefore, this study aims to uncover associations between neurobehavioral
factors, PXARS, and alcohol use onset. Unlike studying the genome, examining the exposome allows for
investigating the totality of the environment (i.e., natural, built, and social) to uncover potentially clinically
actionable targets. While many exposomic predictors may not be easily modifiable (e.g., racial biases,
socioeconomic barriers) but still warrant close examination; other predictors (e.g., peers, diet, and activities) may
be viable prevention and intervention targets for preventing and minimizing alcohol use in youth. The proposed
study offers the applicant a robust and comprehensive training program, which includes in-depth instruction on
big data and bioinformatics approaches, as well as task-based fMRI techniques and will significantly strengthen
the applicant's skillset. The applicant will receive exceptional support from a team of highly skilled sponsors and
consultants who have extensive experience in the fields of substance use neurobiology, exposomics, and
neuroimaging. Furthermore, the research will be conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine, a world-renowned
institution that offers top-tier training, coursework, and institutional resources including but not limited to the
Addiction Institute, the Institute for Exposomic Research, and the High-Performance Computing Core, making it
an ideal setting for executing the proposed study."
10826875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project includes both the development of advanced MRI sequences to study brain stiffness as well as
clinical application of this technique to study brain health in an aging adult population. A sensitive method to
establish and reliably detect the point where the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias
diverge from normal aging is crucial to developing methods for intervention. Early detection is critical in
lessening the financial burden of these diseases on the US healthcare system. Magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive, in vivo, MRI technique which provides information on the mechanical
properties of tissues and is uniquely situated to sensitively provide insight into microstructural tissue changes
that may occur prior to when structural changes caused by atrophy can be detected. The basis of the MRE
technique is that displacements induced in a tissue by an external actuation source can be measured using
phase-contrast MRI, and then turned into high-resolution maps of tissue mechanical properties such as
stiffness. However, this technique is often difficult to widely implement because it requires use of longer scan
times and then further requires specialized equipment to vibrate the tissue. We propose two major
improvements to MRE acquisition and processing to remove these barriers based on a novel sampling
technique and estimation scheme, EDGE (Elastography with Distributed, Generalized Encoding). EDGE
utilizes non-traditional sampling directions implemented in an optimized encoding matrix to collect data much
more efficiently, and be used in a novel algorithm to estimate harmonic displacement fields, together allowing
room for acceleration of acquisition or redundancies to be built into the data for rejection of bad data in the
post-processing step. We also extend this method to intrinsic actuation to capture motion that occurs naturally
from pulsatile cerebral blood flow to provide the motion necessary for MRE mechanical property estimation
(intEDGE), thus removing the need for external hardware and making the scan similar to any other for the
patient experience. We will confirm the validity of these techniques by evaluating differences in brain stiffness
between young and older adults using the traditional MRE method and the proposed EDGE and intEDGE
methods. Success of this project will result in a novel MRE technique that removes barriers to the wide
implementation of MRE as a measure of brain health in aging and aging-related neurological conditions."
10826925,"Project Summary. Vaccines have been crucial technologies to prevent and stop the spread of global diseases, such as
smallpox and COVID. Despite these accomplishments, more robust vaccines are needed to combat existing and emerging
pathogens. To be effective, vaccines must contain at least two classes of signals: i) an antigen – the specific identifying
molecular sequence on a pathogen, and ii) an adjuvant – a signal to the cell that the antigen is dangerous. Specialized antigen
presenting cells (APCs) take up antigen and adjuvants in the periphery, then migrate to specialized immune organs known
as lymph nodes (LNs) to present antigen and additional markers to naive lymphocytes, such as T cells. T cells then return
to the periphery, destroying cells or pathogens displaying that same antigen. Specialized subsets of these APCs, dendritic
cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs), are concentrated in skin and dermal layers; thus, targeting vaccines to these cells
has potential to increase vaccine potency. DCs and LCs contain toll-like receptors (TLRs) in and on their surface, which
recognize toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) - molecular patterns commonly found on pathogens but not mammalian cells.
Because activating TLRs induces inflammatory responses from these cells, TLRas are clinically used as adjuvants to
enhance vaccine responses against a variety of pathogens. Recent studies show that activating multiple TLRs can improve
disease outcomes compared to single TLRa delivery. One way to deliver multiple TLRas is by using biomaterials, which
can achieve controlled and targeted engagement of multiple TLRs on immune cells. Our lab has developed immune
polyelectrolyte multilayers, or iPEMs, comprised entirely of antigen and a TLRa. Injectable iPEM particles activate DCs
more potently than soluble signals. However, these materials do not specifically access the skin niche, where APCs are
concentrated. Microneedle arrays (MNAs) are emerging technologies being explored clinically that penetrate the skin via
projections long enough to reach concentrated APCs in dermal layers, but too short to trigger pain receptors. Motivated by
improved vaccine outcomes from combinatorial adjuvants, I have shown that constant amounts of antigen and varying
combinations of TLRas can be assembled on MNAs to develop a library of compositions. DCs treated with this library in
vitro presented antigen and costimulatory markers in a compositionally-dependent format. Funding of this proposal will
allow me to test the hypothesis that inclusion of two classes TLRas on MNAs maximizes APC activation at the site of
application. I will also link the relative TLRa compositions to APC migration to the LNs, resulting effector cell response,
and improvements in a melanoma model. These goals will be accomplished in three aims: 1) Connect defined ratios of
TLRas on MNAs to TLR engagement on skin-resident APCs in vitro, 2) Test how TLRa composition on MNAs polarizes
APC localization and T cell response in vivo. and 3) Use melanoma as a test bed to link TLRa composition on MNAs to
overall disease outcomes. These aims will provide understanding regarding the delivery of multiple TLRas via MNAs to
improve disease outcomes. Combined with my holistic training plan, the research planned in this F31 award period will
advance my ultimate goal of leading an independent research lab."

Cancer is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Increased understanding of mechanisms that drive cancer will
provide new avenues to reduce incidence and to treat the disease. Aberrant metabolism is a critical hallmark of
cancer cells that enable adaptation to a variety of external and internal stressors. Thus, identifying and targeting
key metabolic dependencies in cancer cells remains an important strategy for blocking cancer progression.
Therefore, this conference brings together researchers focusing on identifying cancer cell intrinsic mechanisms
alter metabolic state and how these pathways integrate with differential activity of key metabolic organelles such
as the mitochondria and the lysosome. The inter-connections between nutrient acquisition and utilization and
changes in the tumor microenvironment will also be explored. As an increasing appreciation for differences in
metabolic dependencies in primary versus metastatic disease emerges, this conference will also focus on
discussing unique metabolic vulnerabilities of metastatic cells as they seed and grow in secondary organ sites.
The conference also brings together investigators at the cutting edge of new imaging and quantitative tools for
measuring tumor metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the program will explore the latest developments in
targeting tumor metabolism and the next steps required for effectively translating preclinical findings into patients.
The numerous short talk opportunities and breakfast topic discussions will help to foster discussion and
collaboration between investigators at all career stages."
10825087,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eye movements serve as the front-end of the visual system, sampling visual information to bridge low-level
visual input and high-level visuo-cognitive processes. Smooth pursuit for tracking object motion, and saccades
for fixating objects are particularly important for these functions. Oculomotor coordination of these movements
requires a brain network spanning the cortex and subcortex, to provide input to the oculomotor muscles. While
smooth pursuit and saccade circuitry overlaps, they have possibly different developmental trajectories. As
such, disrupting these networks at different points in childhood may cause eye movement deficits, whose
patterns may elucidate mechanisms of compensation and recovery of the circuits generating intact eye
movements. While various brain lesions have resulted in ipsilesional smooth pursuit and contralesional
saccade deficits in adults, oculomotor disruption has not been described after pediatric lesions. Up to 11% of
pediatric epilepsy patients undergo pediatric epilepsy surgery to treat drug-resistant seizures, and surgery may
involve resection of either or both smooth pursuit and saccade network areas. Studying eye movement
patterns in these patients is crucial for delineating the recovery and limitations of oculomotor coordination and
its role in cognitive processes when the brain is at maximal neuroplastic potential. This study combines
behavior and imaging methods to investigate the integrity of smooth pursuit and saccades after pediatric
cortical resection, and the postsurgical malleability of these circuits. Aim 1 of this proposal characterizes
smooth pursuit and saccade profiles after pediatric hemispherectomy compared to controls.
Hemispherectomies result in only one functional hemisphere and are usually performed in childhood. As such,
this work will reveal the response of the oculomotor system at the limits of available functional cortex in
humans, and while developmental plasticity is possibly at its peak. Aim 2 uses functional MRI to study the
neural correlates of smooth pursuit and saccades after focal pediatric cortical resections in two major cortical
oculomotor areas – frontal and parietotemporal– compared to controls. This aim will demonstrate how focal
disruptions impact eye movement profiles, and whether unaffected neural circuitry adapts to support any intact
or compensatory oculomotor function. Finally, Aim 3 examines the neuro-cognitive implications of oculomotor
network disruption under more naturalistic conditions in fMRI. Visual search task performance will be
correlated with neural activity after pediatric resections involving both oculomotor and attentional areas (frontal,
parietal), relative to controls. Overall, this proposal will advance understanding of oculomotor disruption and its
neural and cognitive correlates after pediatric epilepsy surgery. This work will inform an understanding of
surgical risk, and future interventional investigations. My training plan leverages the expertise of my mentors
and resources at Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh to develop skills in rigorous design and analysis
of eye movement and neuroimaging data which I will apply, in future, to pediatric neurology populations."
10825166,"Project Summary:
The interactions between touch and temperature perception are essential for the human
experience & behavior, object recognition, thermoregulation, and avoidance of harmful stimuli.
Despite their importance, these modalities are mostly studied in isolation. Previous studies have
shown that innocuous and noxious skin temperature alters the perception of tactile stimulation,
and evidence suggests that thermo-tactile modulation may occur both peripherally and centrally.
However, it remains unclear whether innocuous and noxious thermo-tactile interactions occur
centrally or solely in the periphery. Additionally, the neural substrates that reflect thermo-tactile
interactions remain unknown in humans and non-human primates and it remains unknown
whether Primary Somatosensory (S1) neurons encode cutaneous thermal information during
these interactions. I hypothesize that innocuous and noxious thermo-tactile interactions
have a central locus of interaction and further hypothesize that S1 neurons may reflect
warm or cool temperatures via modulation of their neural firing rates to vibratory stimuli.
To address these gaps, I propose three specific aims. First, Aim 1 will determine if illusory thermal
cues modulate vibrotactile perception, where the vibration detection thresholds of human subjects
under veridical and illusory thermal cues (thermal referral illusion) will be compared. Second, Aim
2 will determine if illusory thermal pain modulates vibrotactile perception, where the vibration
detection thresholds of human subjects under veridical and illusory thermal pain (thermal grill
illusion) conditions will be compared. Third, Aim 3 will determine if S1 neural responses to
vibrations are modulated by skin temperature, where the neural firing rates of well-isolated single-
or populations of S1 neurons in NHPs will be recorded while vibration cues are delivered to the
finger pads under different thermal conditions. The findings of this study will provide the first
evidence of a central locus of innocuous and noxious thermo-tactile modulation in humans and
improve our understanding of the neural substrates that reflect thermo-tactile interactions.
Ultimately, this study has the potential to inform the development of therapies for patients with
impaired thermo-tactile perception."

 Environmental studies show that workers that are disproportionately exposed to air pollution have an
increased risk to adverse health or cardiopulmonary outcomes. Air pollution can include volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
each compound has unique toxicological effects. Emissions from cooking processes, such as combustion or
high temperature frying, are highly complex and variable due to factors such as oil type, temperature, cooking
technique, food type, and fuel type. Toxicological data on cooking emissions in industrial kitchens remain limited
as household kitchen and laboratory experiments do not accurately reflect the working conditions of culinary
workers who often face longer aerosol exposure periods in restaurant kitchens, where standard workweeks can
range from 50 to 70 hours. Furthermore, epidemiological data on the health of cooking professionals have yet to
be published in a U.S. context.
 To address these gaps, I propose a systematic characterization of cooking emissions in U.S. commercial,
western-style kitchens and an investigation into the health of career culinary workers. I hypothesize these
occupational environments subject cooks to high amounts of toxic aerosols, resulting in a disproportionate risk
for adverse cardiopulmonary health outcomes. This study will provide critical data on an industry that employs
approximately 10% of the U.S. workforce, as occupational exposure to cooking emissions has not been
systematically characterized, and the inhalable industrial kitchen environment may pose health risks to the 2.6
million culinary workers in the U.S.
 Preliminary data gathered from seven restaurant kitchens by our lab have quantified levels of PM2.5 and
BC that are cause for further investigation into health risks from aerosol exposure. This exposure assessment
will progress through two specific aims: Aim 1: Quantitatively assess the levels, trends, and composition of
cooking emissions in western-style restaurants using a stratified sampling process and conduct a risk
assessment with the collected data; Aim 2: Preliminarily investigate the health status and future health risks of
culinary workers through cardiopulmonary and urinary biomarkers to assess occupational exposure to cooking
emissions.
 The findings of this investigation will provide valuable toxicological data on the occupational health risks
faced by culinary workers in the food service industry and potentially contribute to the understanding of health
disparities among underserved communities. This study serves as a necessary first step in advocating for better
working conditions and improved health outcomes for millions of workers in the food service industry."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a second cause of cancer-related mortality because of metastatic disease
represented by liver and peritoneal metastasis. This disease is largely insensitive to modern immunotherapies
and is with limited curative options. Immune mechanisms regulating CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) are
not well understood and are likely to hold the key for better immune-based therapies.
 We surprisingly found that the levels of Interleukin (IL)27 cytokine are increased in human CRC and
relevant mouse models of CRC and that its increased levels correlate with poor prognosis. As a part of
preliminary data we found that genetic inactivation of IL27R (receptor) or neutralization of IL27 cytokine in
sporadic CRC models reduces tumor growth, progression and metastasis. This proposal aims to understand
how IL27 regulates CRC TME during metastasis development and how its inactivation drives anti-tumor immunity
exerted by innate and adaptive arms of immune responses.
 Our hypothesis is that IL27 suppressed anti-tumor immune responses mediated by adaptive immune T
cells and possible cells of innate immunity. We will use genetic models of IL27/IL27R deficiency as well as
neutralization of IL27 cytokine combined with cutting edge preclinical models of CRC spread and metastasis
and histological, cutting-edge imaging and molecular biological/advanced transcriptomics methods in mouse
and human CRC.
 Proposal will be based on three interconnected Specific Aims: 1) Examine effects of IL27 on
immunosuppressive TME of CRC liver and peritoneal metastasis; 2) Uncover cell type specificity of IL27 signals
within TME of CRC metastasis; 3) Test whether IL27 neutralization can aid other immunotherapeutic modalities,
particularly focuses on reactivation of adaptive (anti-PD1/anti-LAG3) and innate myeloid cell anti—cancer
immune responses (anti-CD47).
 Our experiments will therefore establish an unique role for IL27 signaling in liver and rarely studied
peritoneal CRC metastasis, uncover underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms and establish and test
rationale and feasibility of IL27 pathway blockade to facilitate anti-cancer immunity in difficult-to-treat advanced
cancer."

Wildfires continue to adversely impact public health in the United States and across the world, with increasing
prevalence of wildfires due to climate change. Evidence demonstrates that wildfire smoke is associated with
asthma exacerbation, decreased lung function, and altered immune responses, in addition to other pulmonary
health outcomes. However, the molecular mechanisms driving wildfire health effects, including those that
underly susceptibility of asthmatics, remain understudied. We have evidence that extraceullar vesicles (EVs),
an emerging mechanism of toxicity, likely play significant roles in mediating the health effects of wildfire smoke.
These changes have been observed alongside alterations in proteins associated with the the hypoxia inducible
factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF-1⍺) pathway in the lung, representing a key pathway underlying ashtma
pathophysiology. However, the role of EVs in influencing preexisting disease susceptibility factors to wildfire
smoke exposure health effects remains to be studied. This study is specifically designed to test the novel
hypothesis that canonical HIF-1⍺ pathway proteins will be enhanced in EVs both at baseline in asthmatics and
following wildfire smoke exposure, with inhibition of HIF-1⍺ resulting in attenuation of inflammatory effects. We
will test this hypothesis through two specific aims (SA): SA1 (in vitro) will examine whether EV release and
content associated with activation of the HIF-1⍺ hypoxia pathway differentiate responsivity of epithelial cells
from asthmatics and non-asthmatics to wildfire-relevant biomass smoke condensate and SA2 (in vivo) will
examine whether EV release and content associated with activation of the HIF-1⍺ hypoxia pathway
differentiate responsivity of asthmatics and non-asthmatic human subjects exposed to wildfire-relevant
biomass smoke. To investigate this mechanism in vitro, we will expose differentiated primary human lung cells
from asthmatic and non-asthmatic donors to wildfire-relevant biomass condensate with and without HIF-1⍺
inhibition in SA1. We will then analyze cellular transcriptomic and secreted extracellular vesicle proteomic
profiles to identify significant differences between disease groups and treatment conditions. Leveraging human
clinical samples, we will isolate EVs from induced sputum from human subjects (asthmatic and non-asthmatic)
exposed to biomass smoke and assess EV proteomic signatures from bulk and cell-type-specific EVs in SA2.
In both aims, data will be analyzed using both standard between group statistical tests and advanced
predictive modeling through machine learning to uncover critical mediators of wildfire smoke susceptibility.
Data from the two aims will be integrated to provide highly translational, innovative insight to understand
mechanisms of wildfire smoke health effects, highlighting therapeutic targets and exposure biomarkers to
leverage in the alleviation of wildfire-associated morbidity and mortality."

The gut microbiota influences many aspects of host physiology, spanning metabolism, gastrointestinal function,
neuroactivity, and immune homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the symbiotic
relationship between the host and gut microbiome remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that
immunological tolerance in the intestine is essential for maintaining healthy host-microbe interactions by
dampening immune responses to beneficial gut microbes and thus, promote commensalism. Interestingly, recent
studies suggest that specific microbes that preferentially reside in the colon can promote immune tolerance by
enhancing the development and function of regulatory T cells (Treg), a T helper (Th) subset important for
tolerance. For example, polysaccharide A from Bacteroides fragilis can increase the suppressive capacity of
Tregs, mediate the conversion of CD4+ Th cells to Tregs, and enhance microbe colonization onto host mucosa
in the colon. Furthermore, Clostridial species (Clostridial spp), an abundant member of the proximal colon,
produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can also promote colonic Treg development and function. In the
absence of SCFAs, Clostridial spp maintain some capacity to induce Treg development, suggesting an
undescribed alternative mechanism. Interestingly, Clostridial spp are also potent inducers of host serotonin
synthesis by colonic enteroendocrine cells. While commonly associated with neurotransmission in the brain
regulating mood and behavior, serotonin in the periphery can also regulate diverse processes including gut
motility and platelet activity. Furthermore, serotonin has immunomodulatory properties and can signal through
the variety of serotonin receptors expressed by immune subsets. In the gut, serotonin receptor 7 (5-HT7) is
highly expressed by innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, that are important for
Treg induction and maintenance. Since DCs are essential for T cell activation, we hypothesize that serotonin
signaling through 5-HT7+ colonic DCs contribute to immunological tolerance that support the symbiotic
relationship with gut microbes. To test this hypothesis, I will leverage novel transgenic mice and intersectional
genetic approaches to determine i) the spatiotemporal regulation of 5-HT7 expression on colonic DCs, ii) the
cellular consequences of 5-HT7-mediated signaling on colonic DCs, iii) the functional effects of DC-specific 5-
HT7-mediated signaling on immune tolerance to the gut microbiota. Moreover, immunological tolerance is
essential for dampening inflammatory responses during immune resolution to prevent chronic activation of
proinflammatory pathways. In the gastrointestinal tract, chronic inflammatory disorders, such as irritable bowel
disease (IBD), is associated with dysbiosis and dysregulated serotonergic signaling, suggesting a relationship
between IBD, gut microbiota, and the enteric serotonergic system. Thus, results from our studies will advance
our understanding of the crosstalk between the host and microbiota through serotonin-immune interactions and
raise the potential for identifying novel targets that promote immune tolerance and intestinal homeostasis."

Despite psychoeducational efforts highlighting consequences of opioid use, relapse remains common for
individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This clinical observation indicates a need for better understanding
how undesirable information about drug use is evaluated and incorporated into patient’s beliefs about personal
risk. People hold biased beliefs about their personal risk in various life domains, expecting more good outcomes
to happen to them than bad outcomes. This “optimism bias” can be explained by a biased belief updating process
that weighs better-than-expected past outcomes more heavily than worse-than-expected past outcomes when
forming future expectations. This “optimism bias” could explain mechanisms that drive opioid use despite well-
recognized risks for harm. Such biased beliefs in OUD have primarily been studied using self-report measures.
Additionally, neuroimaging work on these biases has been restricted to healthy individuals. The psychological
and neural determinants of these biases as they relate to drug use in OUD remain unknown. I propose to, for
the first time, quantify domain-specific optimism biases in OUD and to re-assess these biases as participants
engage with their daily life outside of the lab. Here, I will study the behavioral, neural, and longitudinal
mechanisms of biased beliefs in treatment-seeking individuals with OUD and matched healthy controls. Using a
neurocomputational framework, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), subjects will estimate
their likelihood of drug- and nondrug-related negative events occurring to them (e.g., overdose, bone fracture).
They will then be shown the true base rate of these negative events and will be given the opportunity to update
their estimates. In Aim 1, I will use this approach to test whether opioid users underestimate their likelihood for
negative events and whether they would update their beliefs more after receiving better-than expected vs. worse-
than-expected information, especially when outcomes are related to their drug use. To test how biased belief
updating emerges in the brain, in Aim 2, I will record brain activity during the initial estimation and updating period
of the task in Aim 1, which I hypothesize to involve cortico-limbic-striatal circuitry centered on the inferior frontal
gyrus and ventral striatum. Following the MRI session, in Aim 3, subjects will be enrolled in a 4-week ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) study and complete an abridged version of the optimism bias task to determine
the maintenance and durability of domain-specific optimistic beliefs. The proposed Diversity-F31 training and
research plan will support the formal training I will receive in my doctoral program by: (1) increasing my
knowledge in human addiction neuroscience; (2) increasing proficiency in methods and concepts in cognitive
neuroscience and advanced neuroimaging techniques; and (3) developing training in advanced multi-level
statistical and computational modeling. By using a rigorous decision neuroscience approach, this research has
the potential to inform future efforts to refine and develop more robust psychoeducational interventions for OUD."

To accommodate a vast amount of sensory information, the cortex selectively distills perceptually and behaviorally
salient features from stimuli. The visual system uses visual segmentation, the process of separating a visual scene
into individual elements, to achieve this. Mechanistically, visual segmentation is enabled by “surround suppres-
sion”, the attenuation of neural responses when a stimulus’ properties — such as orientation, contrast, or phase
— are homogeneous. For orientation, neurons are maximally suppressed when a stimulus is iso-oriented with its
surround and is relieved when they are orthogonal. Therefore, the orientation dependence of surround suppression
is an important cortical computation that underlies accurate and efficient visual processing of stimuli. However,
the exact mechanisms and organization of neural circuits responsible for generating oriented surround suppression
is unknown. This proposal will describe and test, in vivo, a detailed mechanistic circuit model explaining how
oriented surround suppression is generated in the cortex. The primary hypothesis is that orientation-dependent
surround suppression results from feedback connections from higher visual areas onto inhibitory interneurons in
the primary visual cortex. Specifically, I propose that neurons in the mouse higher visual area lateromedial (LM)
synapse onto somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons in V1 — a key mediator of surround suppression — such
that cells with similar orientation preferences are preferentially connected. In order to test this, I will exploit a
novel two-photon holographic mesoscope that can record and manipulate neurons across multiple brain regions
for the first time. With this microscope, I will holographically photostimulate excitatory neurons in LM, either
sequentially or simultaneously, while recording from multiple cell classes in V1. First, I will use this technique
to test the connectivity between single excitatory neurons in LM and their SST targets in V1 to determine how
orientation preference governs connectivity. Then, I will activate ensembles of iso-oriented LM neurons to generate
surround suppression when there should not be any. Together, these experiments will advance our fundamental
understanding of how neural architecture governs cortical computations in surround suppression. Consequently,
these results will also shed light on how neural circuits across brain areas coordinate to drive visual perception.
The proposed work not only improves our understanding of neural architecture, but also how disruptions in these
precise networks can lead to a number of psychiatric and neurological diseases."

Despite the importance of optimizing oral health as a public health goal, there remain significant disparities in
access to oral health care and in health outcomes. Although there have been multiple studies showing similar
risk factors for unmet oral health needs and emergency department (ED) utilization, and a high frequency of
ED utilization for oral health conditions, the optimal strategy for leveraging an ED visit to connect patients to
oral health care remains to be defined. Previous efforts to reduce ED utilization for oral health problems have
focused on improving access to insurance and have not been successful in reducing ED visits. This project
would use a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to perform a randomized controlled trial of an
intervention to reduce unmet oral health and social needs in the ED, while collecting information to inform
subsequent implementation strategies. We will assess individual, health system and community level impacts
of an intervention to identify and address adverse social determinants of health (aSDoH) along with unmet oral
health needs among ED patients. ED patients randomized to (1) standard of care handout of regional dental
clinics, (2) geographically-matched Medicaid-accepting dental clinics or (3) aSDoH screening + geographically-
matched resources for oral health and aSDoH and phone navigation as necessary to access resources. For
Aim 1, the primary outcome will be individual successful linkage to oral health care at 1 month; for Aim 2, the
primary outcome will be return visits for oral health concerns. In Aim 3, we assess the spatial association of (a)
dental clinics and (b) social resources with intervention efficacy to understand the community and policy needs
underlying successful intervention of linkage interventions. The proposed work builds on our team’s strong
track record in development of ED-based screening, with feasibility demonstrated by our pilot work and
successful enrollment. This work provides the baseline information to develop a patient-centered, technology-
driven strategy to integrate oral health and aSDoH into the emergency care workflow in a sustainable and
scalable way. In doing so, we fulfill two of the primary goals of the NIDCR Strategic Plan: (1) Enabling “precise
and personalized oral health care” by developing a model to identify patients at risk in the ED and facilitating
their connection to local, accessible, community oral health care; and (2) Using “multidisciplinary research
approaches to overcome disparities and inequalities” by using the ED to enroll patients who do not otherwise
have access to oral health care and ensure that they are connected to appropriate community resources for
their social needs and oral health care. By doing so, we address the potential drivers of poor oral health and
the challenges around accessibility of oral health care. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of untreated
oral disease in vulnerable populations by integrating screening and referral for oral health and aSDoH into ED
care, and thereby reduce potentially preventable ED visits, particularly for oral health conditions."
10829265,"Almost 2.5 million people visit the emergency room each year in the United States as a consequence of
sustaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of these almost 75% are diagnosed with a mild TBI or a concussion,
and almost a third of these patients go on to develop long-term behavioral problems. Executive function
deficits, emotional disturbances such as depression and anxiety, affective disorders and substance use
disorders are some of more common complaints of mild TBI patients. Adolescent boys and girls (high school
and college-age) are more severely affected by concussions compared to older (adult) patients. Emerging data
also suggest that girls and women are twice as likely to sustain a mild TBI, have different and more severe
symptoms and take longer to recover from than their male counterparts. We have developed a model of mild
TBI in the adolescent (5-week-old) rat and have demonstrated that despite similar extents of axonal injury in
the early post-traumatic period only the female rats exhibit cognitive deficits. Importantly, as these animals age
into adulthood, they begin to develop depression-like behavior, which manifests only in the estrus phase of the
estrous cycle. This phenomenon of transient helplessness and anhedonia are hallmarks of premenstrual
dysphoric disorder that some women experience. Our preliminary data demonstrate that activating the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit using chemogenetic approaches or agonist of the D2 receptor reversed the
depressive-like behavior observed in injured animals. The activity of the D2 receptor varies with phases of the
estrous cycle with the lowest activity occurring immediately after the hormone surge that occurs during
proestrus. Blocking this surge using estrogen and progesterone receptor antagonists was able to reduce
depressive-like behavior. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that mild TBI in the adolescent female
rat results in the development of a hypodopaminergic state characterized by a decrease in the activity of the
dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the expression of D2 receptors in the medial
prefrontal cortex (PFC). The specific aims are designed to test whether the estrogen receptor β isotype is the
key mediator of the decrease in D2 receptor expression (Aim 1), whether the activation of D2 receptors within
the medial PFC facilitate the reversal of the depressive-like behavior (Aim 2), and whether the activation of the
DA neurons in the VTA projecting to the medial PFC will reverse depressive-like behavior. Hormone receptor
antagonists will be systemically administered, D2 receptor agonist and retroAAV2 will be infused directly into
the medial PFC, and Gq-designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs will be expressed in the
VTA using an AAV vector. The data from these experiments will provide the mechanistic basis for sex-specific
behavioral deficits following mild TBI sustained in adolescence."
10829266,"Lysis of the host cell by bacteriophage is, as the most frequent cytocidal event in the biosphere, a truly
fundamental process. In addition, understanding the molecular basis of phage lysis is now clinically relevant
because phage therapy is emerging as an important tool against multi-drug resistant bacterial infections.
There are two general modes: Multi-Gene Lysis (MGL), used by dsDNA phages, and Single-Gene Lysis (SGL),
used by small single-strand nucleic acid phages. At minimum, MGL systems require a muralytic enzyme, the
endolysin, that degrades the cell wall or peptidoglycan (PG), and a small membrane protein, the holin, that
actively programs the function of the endolysin. At least 10 more classes of phage lysis proteins have also been
identified, including spanins functioning in destruction of the outer membrane in Gram-negative infections or
acting as regulators of holin and endolysin function. The lysis pathways have steps that both respond to and
cause biophysical changes in the host membrane, as well as featuring multiple examples of dynamic membrane
topology and massive quaternary rearrangements, ultimately resulting in holes in the bacterial membrane of
unprecedented micron-scale. Overall, these complex MGL systems make lysis a precisely-controlled, all-or-
nothing phenomenon.
 In contrast, the small ssDNA and ssRNA phages have no genomic room for MGL systems. Instead a single
Sgl (single gene lysis) protein acts to cause dysfunction in host PG biosynthesis or homeostasis, eventually
leading to a host autolysis. One class of Sgl’s that block steps in cell wall biosynthesis has been established and
designated as Protein Antibiotics, but the target of more than 20 other Sgl’s identified by bioinformatics and
phage genetics is not known.
 In the next five years, the focus will not only be on the remarkable spanins, which fuse membranes during
lysis, but also on two new classes of MGL proteins: releasins and disruptins. Releasins are unique in licensing
dynamic membrane topology of endolysins. Disruptins are small, amphipathic proteins that are used to
weaken the outer membrane; surprisingly, when purified and used in vitro, they function as phage-encoded
versions of the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) produced by mammalian cells. The unique power of
phage genetics will be used to determine the mechanisms of both these new MGL proteins. Our biophysical
and structural collaborators will be supp;oed with mutants, phenotypes and constructs to be used in
characterizing lysis at both the atomic level and in the context of the infected single cell. In the SGL area, the
recent hyper-expansion of the metagenomics of ssRNA phages will be exploited to solve the targets of many
new Sgl proteins. The hypothesis is that ssRNA phage Sgl proteins have evolved to attack every step in host cell
wall synthesis and homeostasis. Also, a new model that a major class of Sgl’s acts by binding the universal cell
wall precursor, Lipid II, will be tested."

PACS1 Syndrome is a recently identified neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a recurrent de novo missense
mutation in PACS1 (p.Arg203Trp). Patients carrying this missense mutation share several developmental deficits,
including intellectual disability, seizures and autism. The mechanism by which PACS1R203W causes PACS1
Syndrome is unknown and no curative treatment is available. PACS1 is a multifunctional sorting protein that
facilitates retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, for delivery of proteins to the primary
cilium and for genome integrity. This multifunctionality depends on a small segment of PACS1 called the furin-
binding region (FBR), which binds a broad range of client proteins and signaling molecules. The R203W mutation
is located in the FBR, and our biophysical studies reveal a change in the FBR dynamics when the R203W
substitution is present, suggesting the possibility of an altered interaction between PACS1 and one or more of
its client proteins in PACS1 Syndrome. Our preliminary studies strongly suggest PACS1R203W increases binding
to the deacetylase HDAC6 to profoundly disturb membrane traffic and impair neuron development. Consequently,
PACS1R203W reduces acetylation of known HDAC6 substrates, including α-tubulin, disrupting centrosome
positioning and leading to Golgi fragmentation and increased dendritic arborization in pyramidal neurons. This
dendritic overbranching is coupled to reduced inhibitory currents in L2/3 cortical neurons resulting in an increased
excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) ratio, similar to that found in other neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that
PACS1R203W severely affects neuronal function and behavior. Our long-term goal is to understand how
PACS1R203W causes disease and to use this information to develop effective therapies. The objective of this
particular application is to determine how PACS1R203W and HDAC6 combine to dysregulate neuronal arborization
and synaptic transmission. We hypothesize that the aberrant interaction between PACS1R203W and HDAC6 alters
organellar positioning, which contributes to excessive dendrite arborization and dysregulated synaptic activity.
Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how
the R203W mutation alters PACS1 structure and dynamics for influencing client protein interactions, 2)
Determine how PACS1R203W and HDAC6 combine to dysregulate Golgi positioning and dendrite arborization,
and 3) Determine how PACS1R203W alters synaptic activity and behavior. The approach is innovative because
we will characterize, from the atomic structure to the whole-organism, the mechanism by which the recurrent
R203W substitution causes neuronal dysfunction. This research is significant because it may identify new targets
and therapeutic approaches to treat this debilitating disorder."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by autoantibody production and immune complex
deposition and affects five to seven million individuals worldwide. Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
are common causes of early mortality in SLE, but immune-mediated mechanisms leading to this and other
disease sequelae are not well understood. Therefore, demand is high to identify targeted strategies to
overcome the undesirable side-effects of overt immunosuppression. In this application, we propose that the
cellular metabolism of follicular helper T cells (Tfh), critical in promoting autoreactive B cell responses, may
provide novel SLE therapeutic targets. Conversely, regulatory T cells (Treg) may protect. Our group has
demonstrated that activated T cells increase glucose and glutamine consumption as they proliferate and
differentiate into specific functional subsets. Importantly, differentiation and biosynthesis following activation
requires a distinct metabolic program. To date, Tfh metabolism remains poorly understood, but our data
suggest that both glucose and glutamine are essential and that Tfh appear to have high rates of glutaminolysis
and are limited by rates of glucose uptake. It is now clear that these metabolic pathways regulate chromatin
accessibility and gene expression by providing substrates for epigenetic modifications. Our data suggest that
Glutaminase (GLS) and ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACLY), which regulate glutamine-dependent production of α-
ketoglutarate (αKG) and conversion of glucose-derived citrate to acetyl-CoA, respectively, regulate epigenetic
marks, gene expression and differentiation essential for Tfh function. These observations build on our previous
work demonstrating that GLS-inhibition led to reduced αKG and differential alterations to histone methylation
and chromatin accessibility in CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells. Importantly, both GLS and ACLY-deficient T cells failed
to generate or maintain Tfh in an in vivo model of chronic inflammation. We have also used a model for SLE-
accelerated atherosclerosis and shown that T cells in atherosclerosis have increased rates of
metabolism. Further, Treg had reduced function and Tfh frequencies were increased. The current proposal
will test the hypothesis that Tfh cells require glutamine and citrate metabolism to regulate epigenetic marks and
chromatin accessibility to allow gene expression for germinal centers and autoantibody production in SLE and
that targeting GLS or ACLY will disrupt epigenetic regulation of Tfh differentiation to treat disease. We will: (1)
Establish the role of GLS and ACLY in differentiation, epigenetic regulation and gene expression, and
metabolism of Tfh cells, and (2) Test inhibition of GLS or ACLY to decrease autoantibody production in murine
SLE and impair circulating Tfh from SLE patients, and (3) determine the effect of manipulating Tfh metabolism
on SLE-accelerated atherosclerosis. Our proposal to test the metabolic regulators of epigenetic marks and Tfh
differentiation will leverage two targets that are currently under investigation as anti-cancer metabolism
therapeutics and will determine if repurposing these drugs may offer new opportunities in SLE."

While significant progress has been made in identifying de novo gene mutations linked to autism risk, much
less attention has been paid to environmental risks and the extent to which these risks cause autism pathology
in susceptible individuals. Environmental factors, including gestational exposure to pyrethroid pesticides and
valproic acid, are implicated in risk for autism. Prenatal exposure to pyrethroids is also linked to risk for
developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—one of the most common
neurodevelopmental disorders. However, these environmental risks were identified retrospectively, after a
large number of people were exposed. Thousands of chemicals are registered for use in the environment, and
humans are potentially exposed to many of these chemicals to varying degrees, including chemicals in plastics
and building materials. We currently lack a way to systematically evaluate which environmental-use chemicals
have the greatest potential to harm the developing brain. The inability to identify environmental threats to the
brain early—before they cause disease—represents one of the major public health challenges of our time.
This challenge is particularly relevant to autism, which now affects 1 in 59 individuals in America, and where
heritability studies indicate that genetic and environmental factors contribute to autism risk. Our research
program is guided by the hypothesis that “candidate” environmental risks for autism and other
neurodevelopmental disorders can be identified rationally, by identifying chemicals and mixtures that
target molecular pathways implicated in these disorders. Our long term goals are to 1) identify
environmental-use chemicals and mixtures that target molecular pathways implicated in neurodevelopmental
disorders. These studies will utilize primary human neural progenitor cells (phNPCs), primary neurons, and
endpoints that are compatible with high-throughput screening. 2) Assess real world exposure to these
chemicals/mixtures. If environmental sampling and biomonitoring data are not available for these
chemicals/mixtures, we will work with a network of Environmental Health Science (EHS) researchers to collect
these data. 3) Evaluate exposure risk in vivo using wild-type and CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mice that model
human de novo autism-linked mutations. We will prioritize chemicals/mixtures that a) impact one or more
phNPC/neuron assay endpoints, b) are verified exposure risks to humans, and c) enter the placenta and/or
developing brain following maternal exposure. While the specific projects will evolve over time, we plan to
initially focus on individual and joint exposures to pyrethroids and strobilurins—a new class of fungicides that
inhibits mitochondria. Both chemical classes impair neuronal functions and co-occur in the home environment.
We will evaluate the extent to which prenatal exposure to these and other prioritized chemicals and mixtures
exacerbate brain and behavioral phenotypes associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders
across the lifespan."

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is an early onset, heritable, prevalent and morbid neurobiological
disorder. While ADHD typically onsets in early childhood, there are lengthy delays in the identification of the
disorder frequently spanning many years, putting the children at elevated risks for developing serious adverse
consequences. This calls for improved efforts in early identification of young children at risk for ADHD. Such
efforts can help preventive interventions that mitigate the progression to the full disorder and its morbid
consequences. One opportunity to help identify children at risk for ADHD is through studying the preschool aged
offspring of parents with ADHD. This is so because 1) the most common age of children getting the clinical
diagnosis of ADHD is in the early elementary school years, hence the preschool years could be an ideal target
for the early identification of children at risk for ADHD, and 2) ADHD is highly heritable, and offspring of parents
with ADHD are at increased risk to develop the disorder. We have preliminary data that certain clinical and
neuroimaging characteristics could predict which child will develop ADHD. To this end, my proposed study will
include clinical and neuroimaging assessments of 100 pre-syndromatic preschoolers (ages 4-6) at risk for ADHD
by virtue of having a parent with ADHD, and 50 control preschoolers whose parents do not have ADHD. The
children will be followed prospectively for two years to be monitored whether they develop ADHD diagnosis or
not. Our central aim is to identify clinical indicators and neural biomarkers of the risk for ADHD that will foretell
which preschool aged, pre-syndromatic children will develop the disorder.
I am a board-certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist who has had a clinical and scientific focus on early
identification of pediatric psychopathology. In my early career, I utilized existing longitudinal clinical data of an
ADHD family study to evaluate clinical predictors of mood and anxiety disorders. I also conducted neuroimaging
studies examining neural biomarkers cross-sectionally associated with clinical indicators of adversity in older
children and adults. To further develop my expertise and become an independent investigator in the field of early
identification, training in statistical analysis, neuroimaging, early childhood, and prospective data collection is
necessary. I believe that by leading the proposed study titled, “Neural and clinical biomarkers of risk for ADHD: A
Focus on Preschoolers” which incorporates a longitudinal design involving preschool aged children assessing
clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers of the risk for developing ADHD, along with a pointed training plan with
didactics and mentorship that address my training goals, will help me establish independence."
10855393,"Although best known for its role in Alzheimer disease, the tau protein is a significant driver of neuronal network
dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy and autism, which have a devastating lifelong
impact on function and quality of life. Tau phosphorylation, detachment from microtubules, and toxic gain of
function are significant drivers of pathology in hypoxic-ischemic injury and two of its major developmental
sequelae: epilepsy and autism. Despite these toxic effects, tau is strongly evolutionarily conserved through the
entire mammalian lineage, suggesting that it has a physiologic function. Although tau knockout has been
studied extensively in mice, these studies are difficult to translate to humans because human tau has a unique
N-terminus insert in a region critical to tau localization and interaction with NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Tau is a
promising therapeutic target for multiple neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism, epilepsy, and early-
life hypoxic-ischemic injury. While the efficacy of tau-reducing agents in AD is controversial, they are safe in
adults and highly effective at reducing tau levels. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to adapt drugs
developed for Alzheimer disease for use in neurodevelopmental disorders. To ensure the safety of this strategy
in the developing brain, however, there is a critical need to understand the neurodevelopmental function of the
tau protein in an entirely human model system. Without this knowledge, developing safe and effective tau-
targeted therapies for these diseases is unlikely. Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective tau-
targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Our overall objective for this proposal, as a first step to
achieving this goal, is to determine the physiologic role of tau during neurodevelopment. We hypothesize that
tau is necessary for dendritogenesis in the developing human brain due to a human-specific N-
terminus insert that upregulates tau-NMDAR signaling. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data
demonstrating impaired dendritogenesis in human tau knockout neurons and a vital role for the human-specific
tau N-terminus insert in interaction with fyn kinase. It is supported by published literature showing that tau-fyn
interaction upregulates NMDAR signaling. This process leads to neurotoxicity in the postnatal brain, but
NMDAR signaling is necessary for dendritogenesis and dendritic arborization in the developing brain. We will
test our hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Determine the role of tau-NMDAR interaction in
human neuronal maturation and (2) Determine the role of the human-specific N-terminus insert in human
neurodevelopment. At the completion of the study, our expected outcomes are that we will have identified a
critical developmental function of the human tau protein and determined the role of the human-specific n-
terminus tau insert. These results will have a significant positive impact because they are a necessary first step
to determining the safe window for therapeutic tau reduction in neurodevelopmental disorders and because
they would identify a previously unknown human-specific physiologic function of the tau protein."

The main objective of the Animal and Cell Model (ACM) Core is to provide animal and innovative cell culture
models to the Project investigators and to coordinate and standardize the shared use of the models. Integrated
into the ACM Core is the Pathology Sub-Core, which will process animal tissues to meet the needs for the
individual projects. The impact of obesity on PDAC will be investigated in KC mice with diet-induced obesity
(DIO) or genetically-induced obesity, which will allow to distinguish direct tumor promoting effects of dietary
components from true obesity effects. For the DIO model, animals will be randomly allocated to either a control
diet or a high fat, high calorie diet (HFCD) and the effect on tumor development assessed. For the genetically-
induced obesity model, KC mice will be crossed into the leptin deficient ob/ob background (KCO). The ACM
Core will carry out in collaboration with all three projects the main interventional study, in which KC mice are
treated with statins. Tissues from this large study will be shared among and analyzed by all three projects. In
addition to the main animal study, the ACM Core will conduct Project-specific interventions and will back-cross
the KC model into additional genetic backgrounds. The main objectives of the Core are 1) to provide animal-
related services and novel cell culture models to all Projects, 2) to minimize duplication of effort and reduce costs
by coordinating experiments (shared animal and tissue use), and 3) to reduce variability introduced by different
environments and husbandry and to ensure consistency in animal handling and data collection (concentration of
resources and expertise). Services that the ACM Core provides for each Project include: obtaining and
maintaining institutional approval, designing the animal studies in terms of logistics and statistical power
calculations (together with Project PI's and Biostatistics Sub-Core), maintaining animal strains and setting up
breeding pairs, genotyping of all animals, randomization of animals to experimental groups, preparation and
administration of experimental diets or interventions, daily monitoring and animal care, euthanasia of animals,
harvest of tissues and blood at sacrifice, processing tissue, e.g. fixing in formalin and embedding in paraffin, and
sectioning (together with the Pathology Sub-Core), histopathological evaluation of tissue sections (together with
the Pathology Sub-Core), generation of primary cell cultures (PanINs and murine pancreatic cancer), generating
the murine and human pancreatic organoid cultures, storage of raw data, central banking of tissues and biological
samples, distribution of tissues to individual Projects, discussion of results with Project Leaders, and training of

10880501,"Project Summary/Abstract: This is a five-year career development proposal examining sex differences in
gonadal hormone and hypothalamic involvement in migraine with aura using cortical spreading depression as a
model. The candidate is an Instructor at Harvard Medical School and a physician at the Massachusetts General
Hospital in the Department Neurology, Division of Headache and Neuropathic Pain. This proposal advances the
candidate’s prior experience with a combination of optogenetic, chemogenetic, machine learning and
transcriptomic approaches to studying sex differences in migraine mechanisms in vivo. This proposal also
interfaces with the candidate’s clinical expertise in treating migraine and other disabling headache disorders.
The training plan focuses on enhancing the candidate’s aptitude in the field of sex differences migraine research
and gaining discrete skills in cutting edge experimental methods through an intensive supervised training
experience incorporating the expert knowledge of co-mentors Prof. Cenk Ayata, MD PhD who specializes in
spreading depression and Prof. Ursula Kaiser, MD who specializes in hypothalamic, sex and gonadal hormones.
The training program will enable the candidate’s transition to an independent research career whose long-term
goal is to discover sex dependent mechanisms of migraine.
Migraine accounts for considerable global suffering and disproportionately affects women. Cortical spreading
depression (SD), a slow wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is responsible for migraine with aura and is
widely used as a preclinical migraine model. SD can activate meningeal nociceptors and sensitize second order
neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). Furthermore, minimally invasive optogenetic SD produces
periorbital allodynia and increases mouse grimace, behavioral evidence of trigeminal nociceptive activation. That
migraine starts after menarche, worsens during menstruation, and abates after menopause implicates gonadal
hormones in migraine. Moreover, a growing body of evidence supports a role for the hypothalamus, one of the
most sexually dimorphic regions of the brain, in migraine. Activation of hypothalamic neurons, including those
expressing neuropeptide orexin, could act to mitigate the impact of SD on trigeminal pain via descending
inhibition of TNC neurons. However, sex differences in gonadal hormone modulation of migraine-relevant
behavior or the role of the hypothalamus has not been systematically investigated. Specifically, this proposal
aims to (1) investigate sex differences in female and male gonadal hormone modulation of SD-induced migraine-
relevant behaviors, (2) examine sex and hormonal influences on SD-induced lateral hypothalamic gene
expression and (3) examine sex differences in orexinergic modulation of SD-induced trigeminal pain behavior.
At the end of the proposed experiments, study results are expected to enhance the fundamental understanding
of mechanisms of sex differences in migraine with aura and contribute to uncovering putative targets for
subsequent mechanistic studies of sex specific hypothalamic neuronal involvement in migraine."
10880497,"Summary. The regulation of alveolar regeneration of injured lungs by exosomal signals in acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) are incompletely studied. We have identified exosomal proteins in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) of ARDS patients that are closely association with the severity of lung injury. In ARDS, clinical
severity is graded by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 in mmHg) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
We have identified stem cell-related niche proteins that are present in mild (200£PaO2/FiO2<300 mmHg) to
moderate ARDS (100£PaO2/FiO2<200 mmHg) but reduced in severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2<100 mmHg). A key
pathological process in ARDS is damage to the alveolar epithelium, which has been demonstrated in numerous
preclinical and clinical studies to be associated with ARDS severity. Therefore, we hypothesize that exosomal
signals for lung stem cell-mediated re-alveolarization are determinants of ARDS outcomes. Several
findings support this hypothesis. 1) Exosomes are effective autocrine/paracrine pathways for stem cell lineage
in injured organs. 2) Exosomal proteins are protected from catalysis by enzymes in inflamed tissues. 3) Unbiased
high throughput proteomic analysis and advanced bioinformatic platforms have successfully identified novel
biomarkers for other diseases. 4) Although the etiologies of ARDS are diverse, the repair processes mediated
by epithelial stem/progenitor cells regulated by niches seem to be similar based on preclinical studies. Our
objective is to test this hypothesis with BALF samples and patients' clinical data from NIH/NHLBI-supported
clinical trials, prioritize niche molecules, and validate the results in genetically bioengineered mice and organoids
of alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells. We will apply novel “exosomics” approaches, cutting-edge bioinformatics,
three-dimensional culture models, robust cell origin tracking, and supervised machine learning algorithms. There
are three specific aims: Aim 1 is designed to identify exosomal signaling pathways and networks in lavage that
regulate the lineage of lung stem cells for re-alveolarization. We hypothesize that stem cell-mediated re-
alveolarization has been suppressed in severe ARDS patients due to the disruption of key exosomal niches. We
will prioritize differentially expressed exosomal proteins and related signaling pathways and networks using R
packages. Aim 2 is designed to detect and optimize regenerative predictors for re-alveolarization of injured lungs.
We hypothesize that the significantly differential exosomal molecules in lavage will be associated with clinical
data in ARDS patients. We will perform unbiased clustering and supervised machine learning algorithms to
develop models for discovering critical signals for lung regeneration. The prioritized exosomal predictors will be
compared with traditional whole-protein markers for accuracy and applicability. Aim 3 will validate selected
exosomal signals for AT2-mediated re-alveolarization. We will confirm that the exosomal molecules regulate the
lineage of human and mouse AT2 cells in 3D organoids and mice. These studies will identify stem cell-specific
exosomal molecules as potential pharmaceutic targets for ARDS."

Staphylococcus (S.) sp. are ubiquitous colonizers of human skin and mucosa. Its commensal members, such
as S. epidermidis, make key contributions to skin health by modulating the immune system and promoting skin
microbiome homeostasis. Other species, such as S. aureus, can be asymptomatic colonizers or disease-
causing pathobionts. While S. hominis, capitis, haemolyticus and other species are ubiquitous, they are little
characterized vis a vis their role in the skin microbiome. Yet in our extensive surveys of healthy and diseased
skin, we have found significant shifts in the species level composition of skin staphylococci. For example,
healthy skin strongly favors colonization with epidermidis and hominis, while patients with congenital ichthyosis
shifts dramatically to a capitis-dominated microbiome. Eczema associated with primary immunodeficiencies is
also more prominently characterized by non-aureus staphylococci, including haemolyticus. Finally, in atopic
dermatitis, strain-level differences in epidermidis can be associated with active disease, not only the canonical
aureus. These species and strain-level differences are striking in their diversity, and we hypothesize that
genetically diverse Staphylococcus species and strains differentially affect skin homeostasis by altering the
inflammatory milieu and/or skin barrier. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how diverse staphylococcal
species and strains drive epidermal responses. We amassed and sequenced a collection of thousands of
staphylococcal isolates from human skin, and examined the transcriptional response of 3D human
reconstructed skin equivalents (RHE) to colonization with 180 of these diverse species and strains, identifying
species- and strain-level differences in the skin's response. Here, we will build on this preliminary data to
investigate host and microbial mechanisms underlying these interactions. Selecting a subset of 30 isolates that
produced signatures of interest from our RHE screen, we will examine transcriptional response in a
fibroblast+RHE (F-RHE) model from multiple matched donors to dissect how increased skin complexity
modifies the colonization response (Aim 1). We will use RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and
proteomics to isolate cell-type and layer-specific responses to colonization, as well as reconstruct likely cell-cell
signaling pathways. Second, given the recently identified impact of commensal microbiota on skin barrier and
immunity mediated through AhR, we will similarly investigate the ability of these staphylococci to modulate the
skin barrier by producing metabolites that activate AhR (Aim 2). Using our established metabolomics and
CRISPRi toolkits developed in staphylococci, we will investigate microbial mechanisms to identify likely
involved metabolites. These experiments will further our goal to investigate how diverse staphylococcal
species and strains drive epidermal responses, and will allow us to define mechanisms of a microbial
contribution to numerous inflammatory skin diseases that affect the skin barrier."

 Although fluorescence microscopy has matured into a prevalent imaging method for biomedical researchers,
fluorescence spectroscopy exhibits several fundamental limitations: (1) lack of composition information; (2)
inability of imaging small biomolecules; (3) color barrier of multiplexing imaging; (4) lack of chemical sensitivity.
 To this end, the advent of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy have revolutionized chemical
imaging. Most importantly, recent developments have proven that SRS microscopy can be complimentary to
fluorescence in addressing the above-mentioned limitations: (1) revealing chemical compositions by targeting
their endogenous chemical bonds; (2) employing a set of bioorthogonal vibrational tags (such as C≡C, C≡N,
carbon-deuterium C-D and 13C isotope) to image small biomolecules; (3) presenting an appealing strategy to
surpass the “color barrier” when coupled with super-multiplexed probes; (4) containing information about
structure and dynamics of the target molecule, as well as its interaction with environment.
 Although SRS has the promise to emerge as the next major modality in biophotonics, its utility has been
limited in the following two major aspects. First, the sensitivity of SRS microscopy has reached an impasse.
Currently, the detection limit cannot image many important small analytes and chemical drugs inside cells, which
are below the concentration of 100 micromolar. Second, although SRS is compatible with live cell biology, the
application of SRS inside live cells is significantly under-explored, largely due to that the available probes for
SRS imaging are seriously lagging behind. As such, many advanced applications of chemical imaging have not
been realized.
 We propose to develop the next-generation, ultrasensitive SRS microscopy by integrating innovations from
imaging instrumentation, probe chemistry and data science. We will employ a new laser source to push SRS
microscopy to the nanomolar range for small fundamental chemical bonds. Meanwhile, we will systematically
develop a library of responsive Raman sensors that can enter live cells and monitor important analytes there.
Moreover, we will deploy newly developed machine learning algorithms to further assist live-cell imaging. When
fully optimized, this will bring SRS microscopy to the ultimate sensitivity (comparable to that of fluorescence
microscopy), and fully open the application in live cell biology."

In the mammalian brain, early sensory areas are organized as stereotyped maps of stimulus qualities. The
anatomical features of these sensory maps underlie the neuronal computations and information processing
that are essential to generate appropriate perceptual experiences and behaviors. In the mammalian olfactory
system primary olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odorant receptor converge their axons
into the same insular glomerular structure in the olfactory bulb. The mitral/tufted cells in the bulb received
exclusively input from single glomeruli, but they project to various cortical areas with divergent output patterns.
There are also extensive intercortical connections with no apparent anatomical mapping. It is not well
understood how this pattern of strict convergence and segregation contributes materially to the processing of
olfactory information and odor-driven behaviors. Nor is it understood the role played by the intercortical
connections in the process of odor information. In this project, we establish a multi-disciplinary approach to
determine the contribution of intercortical connections to odor representation and perception. Specifically, we
will use activity marking to determine the stable representation of odors in various cortical areas and test the
hypothesis that intercortical interactions stabilize odor representation."
10861841,"The function of rhythmic oscillations in brain activity has long been a subject of both
speculation and research. Recent evidence supports theories than synchronization of such
oscillations between brain areas can contribute to modulating the strength of their connectivity;
such changes in coupling between areas have been reported during cognitive functions including
attention and working memory. Information can also be encoded in the timing of neuron’s action
potentials relative to these oscillations; indeed, such ‘phase coding’ can sometimes represent
different information than is available in the firing rate alone. These experiments will determine
whether phase coding is used to represent visual information during working memory and eye
movements, and test the role of interactions between prefrontal and visual cortex in modulating
this phase coding. The role of prefrontal signals in modulating phase coding in visual cortex will
be tested using both correlative measures of synchronization between prefrontal and visual areas
during memory maintenance, and pharmacological manipulation of prefrontal activity.
Pharmacological activation will be used to test whether certain patterns of activity in visual cortex
are sufficient to gate entry of a sensory signal into working memory. Lastly, the ability of a phase
code to multiplex information around the time of eye movements, thus disambiguating the source
of sensory signals and expanding the information capacity of the visual system will be directly
examined. Understanding the contribution of phase coding to the visual representation, along with
the role of interactions between prefrontal and visual cortex in modulating such representations,
will provide a necessary comparison point for neurological disorders involving impaired prefrontal-
sensory interactions, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, and autism spectrum disorders."

In the previous funding period we investigated the mechanism of rapid antidepressant activity of ketamine, an
ionotropic glutamatergic n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We demonstrated that Brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its high affinity receptor TrkB, are required for the rapid
antidepressant effects of ketamine as these effects are lost in forebrain specific BDNF knockout mice and
conditional forebrain specific TrkB knockout mice. We found the antidepressant effects of ketamine require
protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in increases in BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus that
are critical for the behavioral effect. Ketamine's blockade of spontaneous NMDA receptor mediated
neurotransmission inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) resulting in dephosphorylation of
its only known substrate, eukaryotic elongation factor 2, thereby increasing protein translation of target
transcripts, including BDNF. In turn, BDNF is postulated to act via eliciting insertion of 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, which results in potentiation of
AMPA receptor-mediated CA3-CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) by ketamine. While this
potentiation is suggested to be a cellular correlate of rapid antidepressant effects, its properties deviate from
classical Hebbian forms of plasticity and rather coincide with homeostatic synaptic scaling seen after activity
suppression. These data provide the basis for the novel hypothesis that BDNF-TrkB signaling regulates
synaptic scaling in vivo that is critical for the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. The objective of this
renewal is to specifically test the causal and instructive role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the hippocampus in
ketamine-mediated synaptic scaling and rapid antidepressant effects. Collectively, this information will provide
novel information on the synaptic locus, as well as key molecules, necessary for ketamine's rapid
antidepressant effects."
10827457,"Particle therapy is a technique for treating solid tumors that is potentially more precise than x-ray radiation therapy.
Charged particles enter the patient at relativistic speeds, depositing increasingly more dose as they come to rest inside the
patient. X-ray photon beams deliver an exponentially decaying dose along the beam path, dosing healthy tissue before and
after the tumor.
 Proton therapy causes less collateral damage, and when patient alignment is accurate, delivers less dose to healthy
proximal tissue and spares distal tissue altogether. Today, patients are positioned by matching bony structures in daily x-
ray images to planning CT volumes acquired days (or weeks) prior. Inter-fraction changes to soft tissue (weight loss, edema)
are common and intra-fraction changes (digestion, respiration, etc.) are unavoidable. Range errors incorrectly dose healthy
tissue and undertreat the tumor, limiting benefits of proton therapy. Therefore, the American Society for Therapeutic
Radiation Oncology currently supports proton therapy for tumors near the base of the neck, spine, eye and in pediatric
patients, and only in the context of research studies for most other tumor sites.
 Thermoacoustic range verification relies upon stress confinement and is suitable for compact synchrocyclotrons
recently introduced by two manufacturers, IBA and Mevion. A prototype system has been validated for use with IBA
systems and the same receive chain has been validated for Mevion.
 System design for a thermoacoustic range verification (tARV) device will be finalized and validated during Phase
II. The tARV consists of a wireless ultrasound array around which six thermoacoustic receivers are packed. A compact
(65mm x 55mm) data acquisition (DAQ) board provides 56-59 dB gain over the thermoacoustic frequency range of 10-100
kHz, samples at 500 ksps to minimize aliasing of high frequency noise, and stores data to a secure data card onboard. A
compact gamma detector monitors beam intensity and provides a trigger to the DAQ.
 End-to-end validation requires software integration with the treatment planning system (TPS) software used in
radiotherapy clinics. Furthermore, QA and clinically realistic test objects, called phantoms, are required. Thermoacoustics
is a hybrid technique that combines aspects of ultrasound imaging and radiation therapy. Commercial phantoms designed
for ultrasound imaging have not yet been vetted for radiation therapy. We will integrate software, quantify materials in
ultrasound phantoms already produced by CIRS, Inc and add dosimetric capability to enable end-to-end validation in a
clinical environment."

The etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia is
multifactorial, with increasing evidence indicating a role for immune cells such as microglia and peripheral
immune cells. Understanding how the immune system regulates critical periods in brain development is important
for a thorough comprehension of disease progression. While resident myeloid cells microglia can support cell
genesis, synapse formation, and myelination, less clear is the contribution of peripheral immune cells to these
phenomena. This includes mast cells (MCs), a type of innate immune cell that degranulates to release mediators
including histamine, cytokines, growth factors, and more in the settings of allergy, inflammation, and tissue repair.
We have discovered a robust population of MCs lining the lateral ventricles next to the hippocampus in the rat.
This population rises in number and peaks at postnatal day 7, then decreases so that MCs are undetectable by
week 3, reminiscent of a developmental critical period. The presence of these highly reactive immune cells,
associated with allergic and parasitic diseases, in a tightly regulated developmental space raises questions about
their physiological purpose in this niche at this time. The first two weeks of neurodevelopment mark the beginning
and expansion of hippocampal neurogenesis, axon outgrowth, and synaptogenesis, all of which are impacted
by immune signaling. Additionally, links between diseases with an overabundance of MCs (e.g., mastocytosis)
and autism point to a potential pathological role for MCs in neurodevelopment. This proposal seeks to decipher
the role of peri-hippocampal MCs during a critical period in hippocampal development. Importantly, these MCs
are replicative, unlike most tissue-resident MCs, and do not originate from peripheral bone marrow sources. I
hypothesize that these MCs originate from the embryonic yolk sac and seed the brain in embryogenesis, similarly
to microglia. An inducible Cre fate-mapping system combined with flow cytometry will test this hypothesis in mice
(Aim 1.1), followed by RNAscope for candidate yolk sac genes in rats (Aim 1.2), bringing this investigation back
to our original rat model. Preliminary RNAseq analysis on these MCs uncovered gene ontology terms related to
processes such as neuronal projection and synapse formation, informing our hypothesis that these MCs
participate in hippocampal synaptogenesis. In the preoptic area, MCs alter synaptic patterning via histamine
release, a viable strategy that we will explore by inducing peri-hippocampal MC degranulation and determining
the effect on dentate gyrus dendritic spine density in Aim 2. These experiments will help decipher the role of
MCs in hippocampal neurodevelopment, providing another piece in the puzzle of neuroimmune interactions
during development. Completion of these experiments, as well as mentorship from developmental neuroscientist
Dr. Margaret McCarthy and allergy immunologist Dr. Achsah Keegan, will provide comprehensive training in
neuroimmunology and establish a strong foundation for a physician-scientist career in pediatric neurology."

 The high rate of unplanned pregnancies suggests that currently available contraceptive methods are not
effectively meeting the needs of women. In addition, contraceptive options for men are limited to vasectomy and
condoms, leaving a significant unmet need for contraception. Our long-term goal is to develop a non-steroidal,
effective contraceptive that provides a more comprehensive approach to birth control. We propose that the
sperm-specific CatSper calcium (Ca2+) channel is an ideal target for the development of such a new class of
contraceptives that has no negative side effects in either men or women, as the CatSper channel is a validated
target required for sperm capacitation and male fertility in both mice and humans. Drug inhibition of CatSper at
the post-testicular and pre-fertilization stages would work without off-target side effects due to its post-meiotic
expression in male germ cells and functional divergence from other calcium channels. The recently solved struc-
tures of CatSper highlight its high accessibility in the cell membrane, allowing the study of the mechanism of
action and reversible contraceptives. However, the inability to reconstitute the channel in vitro has been a bot-
tleneck in the development of drugs that directly target the CatSper channel.
 We have recently overcome this hurdle by creating chimeric CatSper channels that heterologously express
functional channels. Using this new tool, the overall goal here is to ultimately develop CatSper modulators that
inhibit human sperm function. To this end, in R61 phase, we will perform in-depth biophysical and functional
characterization of these novel chimeric channels and do molecular dynamics studies to gain new insights (Aim
1) and develop the necessary assays for primary and secondary screening that measure CatSper activity in
high-throughput modes (Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will perform high-throughput screening for CatSper inhib-
itors as well as virtual screening (Aim 3), profile the identified hits, establish preliminary structure-activity rela-
tionships and perform the secondary screening (Aim 4), and test the selected compounds on human sperm
function (Aim 5). In the immediate term, successful completion of these aims will provide small molecule hits for
human CatSper that can be used for iterative lead generation. In the long term, the leads and knowledge gener-
ated will ultimately lead to the development of an innovative class of contraceptives targeting CatSper and sperm
capacitation with a mechanisms of action foundation."

Genomic instability, referring to a heightened frequency of mutations and DNA damage, is a hallmark of cancer.
A major consequence of cancer-intrinsic genomic instability is the activation of innate immune response, which
can confer an antitumor state to cells. However, many cancers co-opt regulatory pathways to escape immune
surveillance. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how innate immune
consequences of genomic instability are regulated. Particularly, our group studies the immunogenic potential of
cytosolic DNA, a molecular signal that arises from mitotic and nuclear aberrations. Cytosolic DNA activates a
DNA sensing pathway termed cGAS-STING to trigger the type I interferon response. Three prime repair
exonuclease 1 (TREX1) suppresses this pathway by degrading cytosolic DNA. Indeed, many cancers upregulate
TREX1 to accommodate cytosolic DNA without immune activation. Yet, TREX1-null mutations are linked to
inflammatory disorders like Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). Further, frameshift mutations that cause ectopic
TREX1 nuclear localization are linked to retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL). Therefore,
TREX1 plays a complex role in human diseases through degradation of cytosolic DNA, but molecular
mechanisms of TREX1 function are poorly understood. The goals of my project are to characterize the TREX1-
specific elements, the polyproline helix (PPII) and the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (C-IDR), in the
context of immune regulation (Aim 1); and to dissect the impacts of ectopic TREX1 localization in the nucleus
(Aim 2). My working hypothesis is that these TREX1-specific non-catalytic domains are essential for recruiting
protein partners that prime DNA substrates for digestion by TREX1, thus enhancing cGAS-STING regulation.
Further, I expect that PPII induces de novo interactions when TREX1 is ectopically expressed in the nucleus. I
propose to test my working hypothesis using molecular and cellular approaches in human cells to quantify the
activation of cGAS-STING, to identify protein-interacting domains of TREX1, and to examine the behavior of
nuclear TREX1. This project will characterize novel TREX1 structural features that confer its unique
immunosuppressive role, as well as explain how ectopic TREX1 localization can induces disease. It will also
identify novel TREX1 interactors, contributing to the discovery of molecular targets in cancer therapy."
10824863,"Over the next 20 years, the number of young adults in Sub-Saharan Africa will increase to 174 million, rendering
the health, fertility behaviors and child investments of this cohort critical factors for the future development of the
continent. Many young adults in low-income countries (LICs) have experienced substantial childhood adversity,
a likely important impediment to future health. For example, the young adults that we propose to study in Malawi,
82% experienced physical abuse in childhood, 8% reported sexual abuse, 8% were orphaned, and 70% wit-
nessed domestic violence. What happens next—in young adulthood—will have ramifications for their own health
and that of their children. Our study leverages this young adult cohort to study the impacts of adverse childhood
experience (ACEs) on health both across life courses and across generations. We draw on the Malawi Longitu-
dinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH), and specifically on the MLSFH-ACE cohort previously created to
study the longitudinal impacts of ACEs during adolescence. This cohort is now entering early adulthood, when
new health and parenting challenges emerge. This is a critical lifecycle stage to study pathways driving the
intergenerational transmission of adversities. We propose a new round of data collection on the MLSFH-ACE
cohort, their partners, and their children. In Aim 1, we will estimate the longitudinal impacts of ACEs on sexual,
reproductive, and mental health (SRMH) during emerging adulthood. Key outcomes include HIV incidence, early
pregnancy, and depression. In Aim 2, we will estimate the longitudinal impacts of ACEs on the timing and quality
of partnerships in emerging adulthood. ACEs may affect the timing and qualities of these partnerships, them-
selves a key determinant of emerging adult SRMH. For example, ACEs may influence when individuals marry
(e.g., child marriage), whom they select (e.g., age-disparate relationships), and the power dynamics that define
the relationship (e.g., partner violence). Thus, we will estimate the impact of ACEs on partnerships and the extent
to which this mediates SRMH outcomes. In Aim 3, we will estimate the longitudinal, intergenerational impacts of
ACEs on offspring of emerging adults. Our study will examine how the experiences and resulting wellbeing of
both mothers and fathers and their interaction influence young children (including their health, language and
social-emotional development. We will also document the intergenerational transmission of ACEs during early
life (eg, young children's exposure to domestic violence). In Aim 4, we will identify resilience processes that
reduce negative consequences of ACEs on emerging adults and their offspring. Despite experiencing ACEs,
many people thrive and create healthy families. Studying these processes in Malawi, an LIC where poverty is
endemic, will elucidate key sources of resilience that have evolved alongside such extreme adversities. Thus,
the study will provide unparalleled insights into how ACEs exert lasting impacts across life courses and across
generations in LICs, and identify key resilience processes that can inform policies. The public release of our rich,
multigenerational cohort data will be an important resource to study transitions to adulthood in LICs."

Gene amplification of the oncogene Myc is associated with increased metastasis, resistance to treatment, and
overall poor prognosis and survival across several cancers. In accordance with its role as a pro-growth
transcription factor, Myc upregulates protein synthesis globally by driving expression of ribosomal RNA,
ribosomal proteins, and protein translation initiation factors. This increase in protein synthesis capacity is
presumed to promote cancer cell growth and proliferation but also leads to dysregulated signaling in the form of
stress-response pathways usually associated with impaired proteostasis and translational stress. Key kinases
involved in these pathways include members of the integrated stress response, PERK and GCN2, but an
understanding of how Myc expression activates these stress response pathways remains underexplored. One
mechanism, however, may be through ribosome collisions, an aberrant translation event that activates GCN2,
along with the MAP3K ZAK⍺, to trigger either translation repression to prevent additional collision events or
apoptosis in severe cases. Ribosome collisions result from various translational stressors, and occur when an
elongating, trailing ribosome catches up to and collides with a stalled, leading ribosome on an mRNA transcript.
Given that stress-response pathways downstream of collisions may be hyper-active in cells with high Myc levels,
it is likely that ribosome collisions occur at a higher rate in Myc overexpression cell lines compared to cells with
lower Myc expression. As a result, these cells may be more susceptible to cellular stressors that induce ribosome
collisions as well. The central hypothesis of this proposal is therefore that upregulation of translation activity by
Myc overexpression will lead to increased apoptosis in the presence of ribosome collision-inducing drugs. I
propose to address this hypothesis through the following aims: Aim 1: Investigate the effects of Myc expression
on protein translation dynamics; Aim 2a: Assess how Myc affects ribosome collision frequency and sensitivity
to translation stress; Aim 2b: Determine if translation stress increases apoptosis in cancers with high Myc
expression. These aims will be achieved by utilizing my laboratory’s expertise in studying ribosome function and
regulation via biochemical and sequencing analysis to study translational activity and collision-induced signaling
in cell-based models for Myc overexpression and in cancer cell lines with known differential Myc expression.
Results of this work could reveal both novel therapeutic strategies for combatting the many cancer subtypes with
elevated levels of Myc and unique insights into how increased protein synthesis demands affect translation
dynamics in cancer."
10824707,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an unrelenting public health concern. Despite great strides in understanding the
neurobiological underpinnings of problem alcohol use in preclinical models, a limited amount of research has
translated those findings into clinical populations. Such translation is crucial to identify neurobiological circuits
that contribute to the problems posed by AUD and to guide treatment based on those clinical neuroscience
findings. One area of intense interest in preclinical research is the role of the orexin system in addiction.
Through extrahypothalamic transmission, the orexin system plays a key part in motivation for maladaptive
rewards like drugs of abuse. In preclinical studies, exogenous administration of orexin peptides increases
alcohol self-administration. Conversely, pharmacological antagonism of the orexin system reduces effortful
responding maintained by alcohol (e.g., on a progressive-ratio schedule) and alcohol-seeking behavior, relative
to vehicle. Pharmacological antagonism of orexin receptors also ameliorates sleep disruptions caused by
chronic alcohol exposure. Preclinical findings further indicate administration of orexin antagonists generally
does not affect responding for non-alcohol rewards. Taken together, these preclinical findings suggest orexin
system antagonism selectively reduces motivation for alcohol, as well as other maladaptive alcohol-associated
behaviors. Although a robust preclinical literature indicates a key role of the orexin system in motivation for
alcohol, along with alcohol’s other pharmacodynamic effects, this area remains essentially unstudied in
humans, except for some observational studies showing altered peripheral orexin levels during alcohol
withdrawal. The overarching goal of this project is thus to translate promising preclinical findings into clinical
populations, thereby demonstrating the orexin system plays a key role in motivation for alcohol in humans. This
project will also determine the influence of orexin antagonism on other pharmacodynamic effects of alcohol,
including subjective response, performance, physiological response and sleep. The research proposed here
will directly translate findings from preclinical research and provide the initial clinical evidence that orexin
antagonism reduces motivation for alcohol and other alcohol-associated maladaptive behaviors in individuals
with AUD. This study will also provide basic science information about the orexinergic mechanisms underlying
the pharmacodynamic effects of alcohol in humans. As such, the outcomes will contribute to our understanding
of the clinical neurobiology of AUD. Overall, the proposed work seeks to expand the scope of current clinical
neuroscience research on AUD by focusing on orexin, which has strong preclinical evidence supporting its
critical role in addiction but remains largely unstudied in humans."

This application is being submitted in response to the (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-22-056.
Background. The specific aims of the parent grant (RF1AG071024) are to estimate the risk of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) associated with wildfire
particulate matter (PM2.5) (Aim 1), to identify individual- and area-level susceptibility factors that exacerbate the
association between wildfire PM2.5 and MCI and AD/ADRD (Aim 2), and to estimate the risk of MCI and AD/ADRD
associated with living near a wildfire disaster and the extent to which specific sub-groups have better or worse
outcomes (Aim 3).
As part of the work conducted in Aims 1 and 2 of the parent R01, we are modeling daily exposure to wildfire-
specific PM2.5 levels using a two-stage machine learning (ML) approach. We have curated and processed a large
quantity of data from a range of sources including weather variables, satellite data, and Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) monitor data, in order to model wildfire specific PM2.5 levels. While we have expended
considerable effort on the data curation, we have not focused on making the data Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ML
ready and publicly available, both for our own researchers and for the broader research community. The data
sources required for effective wildfire analysis are disparate, not very accessible, and unfriendly to AI/ML
applications. Although the data is rich and publicly available through US agencies, acquiring it and preparing it
for analysis presents a significant investment for any researcher.
Overall Goals and Aims. With this administrative proposal, we plan to establish a new collaboration with AI/ML
and data experts at Harvard University with the goals of improving the vast and wide range of data sources,
developing reproducible pipelines, annotating, documenting, and processing the data, ensuring computational
scalability, encouraging community engagement, and disseminating these important AI/ML ready datasets for
the prediction of wildfire PM2.5 to a wider research community. Our specific aims are to improve the data for
AI/ML readiness (Aim 1), make the data publicly available to AI/ML applications (Aim 2), and demonstrate the
transformed data in an AI/ML application to predict wildfire PM2.5 exposure for California (Aim 3).
Impact. The final datasets will be AI/ML ready, reproducible, and disseminated to a wide user base. We will build
a collaborative environment allowing both internal and external researchers to use, contribute, and improve the
data inputs. This work will serve as a foundation for our group in the prediction of wildfire PM2.5 exposures for
the whole US and for the community and will strengthen the aims of the parent R01."

Corneal epithelium (CE) is a self-regenerating stratified squamous tissue that protects the rest of the eye by
serving as the anterior-most barrier.1, 2 Our long-term goal is to identify the regulatory networks that govern the
CE stratification and homeostasis, facilitating better understanding of the molecular basis for sight-threatening
corneal disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that the Krüppel-like factors Klf4 and Klf5 play crucial non-
redundant roles in maturation and maintenance of the ocular surface.2-17 In this proposal we seek to determine
their role in regulating distinct cellular and molecular pathways of CE stratification and homeostasis, and
elucidate how defects in these pathways affect CE plane of division and genetic stability, causing ocular
surface diseases. We will employ complementary and innovative cell culture and imaging systems, transgenic
mouse models and Next-Gen sequencing approaches to test the novel central hypothesis that `Klf4 and Klf5
orchestrate CE cell stratification and homeostasis by coordinating the CE cell plane of division and genetic
stability in a TGF-, BMP6-, and Pard3-dependent manner'. This hypothesis was formulated based on our
published work, 2-16 and exciting preliminary results. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will test if KLF4 and KLF5 play key roles in regulating CE cell shape, apical-basal polarity
(ABP) and plane of division, thereby elucidating the link between these transcription factors and the cellular
processes that regulate CE stratification. In Aim 2, we will test if CE stratification is driven by a crosstalk
between transcription factors Klf4 and Klf5, and signaling network involving TGF and BMP6 pathways,
thereby elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate CE stratification and homeostasis. In Aim 3, we
will test if Klf4 is a key regulator of genome stability that protects the CE from radiation-induced DNA damage
and tumor development by upregulating the ABP gene Pard3 (also called Par3) expression. By delineating the
regulatory pathways of corneal epithelial differentiation, stratification and carcinogenesis, and elucidating the
molecular underpinnings of ocular surface disorders such as pterygium and ocular surface squamous
neoplasia (OSSN), this proposal directly addresses the NIH mission of `seeking fundamental knowledge about
the nature and behavior of living systems' and offers the potential for translation to ocular surface disorders
which account for considerable healthcare burden in the world. The proposed research is significant as its
anticipated outcomes will identify the molecular factors and pathways important for normal growth and function
of CE cells, and their deficiencies that lead to sight-threatening corneal disorders."

This NIH F31 grant application presents a comprehensive four-year plan designed to facilitate the professional
development of Morgan Greene, the Principal Investigator, and equip her with the necessary skills to pursue
an independent career as a physician-scientist. The research project's overarching goal is to unravel the
transcriptomic programs driving the development of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells (Aim 1), which are essential
for successful pregnancy establishment and maintenance. Additionally, the study will explore the factors that
influence uNK cell differentiation into decidual natural killer (dNK) cells, a process critical to determining the
pregnancy's health. Employing advanced techniques such as transcriptome-wide association studies, single-
cell RNA sequencing, incubation assays, and flow-cytometry, the project's primary objective is to identify the
transcriptional programs that underlie uNK cell differentiation from peripheral blood cells into dNK cells. The
ultimate objective is to apply these findings to develop clinical tools that guide treatment strategies for
pathological reproduction, infertility, and miscarriage, ultimately leading to improved reproductive health
outcomes.
The proposed training plan for Morgan Greene is supported by her project mentor, Dr. Paige Porrett, and co-
sponsored by Dr. James George, and aims to establish a strong foundation for a successful career as a
physician-scientist. The project-based translational approach offers an ideal training environment, with
experiences designed to enhance Morgan's development in three key areas: 1) rigorous research in
reproductive immunology, encompassing literature review, data evaluation, and responsible research conduct;
2) training in genetic sequencing and bioinformatics; and 3) career and professional development, including
manuscript and grant writing, scientific communication, and translation of research outcomes to clinical
applications. This proposal is designed to equip the PI with the advanced immunology skills necessary for a
career focused on precision medicine and reproductive health outcomes as an obstetrics and gynecology
physician-scientist, and drive the development of rigorous scientific research in reproductive immunology."
10825309,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infection with a pathogen can have a significant impact on drug metabolism and disposition in the host
and can even determine treatment outcomes. This “pathobiome”, meaning the total amount of pathogenic
microbe present during an infection, may have a profound impact on drug metabolism in the disease state
when individuals are much more likely to receive drugs, particularly antibiotics. Despite the mounting evidence,
we still understand little regarding the capacity of pathogens to contribute to drug metabolism in the host.
Understanding the role of pathogens in drug metabolism will fill a gap in our current knowledge and it also has
the potential to lead to the identification of novel antimicrobial drug targets. Our preliminary data demonstrates
that CYPs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), an important opportunistic pathogen in the lung of cystic
fibrosis (CF) patients, are highly promiscuous and capable of metabolizing drugs - including the antibiotic
ciprofloxacin used to treat PA infections. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that secondary metabolites
produced by PA can induce expression of human CYP1A2, potentially leading to increased clearance of
ciprofloxacin in the host. This specific application focuses on characterizing the role of CYP enzymes and
secondary metabolites from PA. Our central hypothesis is that P. aeruginosa can modulate drug metabolism
in the local environment of the lung in order to reduce the effectiveness of drug therapy. In order to test our
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Characterize the metabolic capability of P. aeruginosa
CYPs to metabolize drugs relevant to the patient CF host; 2. Determine the potency and specificity of P.
aeruginosa secondary metabolites to induce expression of host CYP drug metabolizing enzymes in human
lung cells, and 3. Identify the structural contributions to substrate and inhibitor specificity for P. aeruginosa
CYPs using 19F biomolecular NMR. Characterizing the ability of PA to metabolize drugs in the host will allow us
to quantitatively determine the contribution of PA to host drug metabolism at the site of infection and develop
inhibitors that may limit PA antibiotic resistance. Understanding the impact of the P. aeruginosa pathobiome
contribution to drug metabolism and antibiotic resistance in the host is paradigm shifting in that it will expand
our idea of pathogen regulation of host processes and provide new opportunities for potential adjuvant drug
targeting in the pathogen to increase the sensitivity to otherwise effective antibiotics."

patients have limited collateralization and regenerative capacity in their tissues. Diabetic patients with
peripheral arterial disease have severe ischemic complications and are at grave risk of major amputation.
Reversing tissue ischemia by surgical revascularization prevents amputations, but many patients with diabetes

 As POC diagnostics transitions towards mainstream use, it would be valuable to establish a credible
and validated set of biodegradable materials to sustain future innovations in monolithic microfluidic devices, in
order to reduce waste and curb the environmental impact of biomedical products. Bioplastics are an attractive
biodegradable material for microfluidic diagnostics. In particular, bio-based materials made of plant byproducts
are of interest due to their renewable material source to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Existing
demonstrations of bioplastic microfluidics are limited; hence, despite the great potential of bioplastics for POC
diagnostics, there is a need for accessible fabrication, demonstration for diagnostic methods, and appropriate
degradability. Building on preliminary results with an accessible fabrication strategy, this proposal develops a
novel material fabrication method and device assembly strategy which direct each component of the life cycle
of a plastic microfluidic diagnostic device toward a more sustainable alternative to reduce the environmental
impacts of plastics and safeguard human health."
10825970,"Project Summary
The Gram-negative outer membrane (OM) is an effective permeability barrier against numerous chemical
assaults, including antibiotics. The intrinsic barrier capacity of the outer membrane in part due to its asymmetric
nature; the inner leaflet consists of phospholipids (PLs) while the outer leaflet is composed of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Although the systems responsible for the maintenance of OM asymmetry have been well-characterized
in enterobacteria like Escherichia coli, little is known about the mechanisms maintaining OM barrier function in
the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E. coli encodes three pathways that remove PLs from the outer
leaflet of the OM: the Mla system, PagP, and PldA. The Mla system removes PLs from the outer leaflet of the
OM and promotes their retrograde transport back to the IM. PagP removes an acyl group from outer leaflet PLs
and attaches them to LPS, converting the glycolipid from a hexa-acylated to a hepta-acylated form. Finally, PldA
is an OM phospholipase that cleaves outer leaflet PLs. Much less is known about how the highly antibiotic
resistant pathogen P. aeruginosa maintains the asymmetry of its OM. Like E. coli, it also encodes an Mla system
and PagP. However, it lacks PldA. A transposon-sequencing (Tn-Seq) screen for P. aeruginosa mutants
hypersensitive to an antibiotic that blocks LPS synthesis identified the OM phospholipase PlpD as a novel factor
involved in OM barrier function. To further investigate the potential role of PlpD in OM asymmetry maintenance
I will investigate whether PlpD is playing a role in P. aeruginosa analogous to that of PldA in E. coli by developing
assays to detect phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the OM in P. aeruginosa. I will also perform cross
complementation experiments to test whether E. coli PldA can substitute for PlpD function in P. aeruginosa and
vice-versa. To complement these focused experiments, I will take advantage of unbiased genetic approaches to
investigate the function in PlpD in OM barrier function. Suppressor mutants that restore normal drug sensitivity
to a plpD mutant will be isolated and characterized. Additionally, I will use Tn-Seq analysis to identify genes that
when inactivated result in a synthetic lethal phenotype when combined with a plpD mutation. In both genetic
assays, the identity of the genes with suppressive or synthetic lethal interactions with plpD will inform us about
the nature of the OM defect in cells inactivated for PlpD and tell us under what conditions PlpD function becomes
essential. The genetic results also have the potential to identify new factors in P. aeruginosa that play important
roles in OM barrier function. Overall, the knowledge generated from this proposal will shed light on the
mechanisms that underlie OM barrier function and promote drug resistance in a problematic gram-negative
pathogen."
10826034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major regulatory hub for gene expression control in tissues
like the brain and the muscle, which don’t undergo cell division. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a
strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of muscular and neurodegenerative
diseases including myotonic dystrophy (MD) and amyotrophic lateral dystrophy (ALS). For example, MD- 1
is provoked by the sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1 encoded by the gene muscleblind-1. MBNL1
and another member of the MBL family (MBNL2) have important and overlapping functions in RNA
processing and transport, in particular in muscle and neurons.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a highly abundant, not well-characterized type of non-coding RNA. These
RNAs are generated by circularization of specific exons, and their functionality is still controversial. Recent
work from my laboratory has demonstrated that circRNA production competes with pre-mRNA splicing,
suggesting that circRNAs are general cis regulators of gene expression. We found by studying of MBL, the
Drosophila homolog of MBNL1, that this protein regulates the production of a subset of circRNAs, including
one generated from its own locus (circMbl). Work from the previous period demonstrated that circRNAs
generated from the mbl locus regulate gene expression, physiology and behavior. We found that these
circRNAs act in cis and are part of a self-regulatory loop that limits MBL expression. In addition, we found
that circMbl has functions in trans as knockdown (KD) of circMbl provokes several developmental,
physiological and behavioral phenotypes which are distinct but related to the ones observed upon MBL KD.
Together, our data demonstrates that circMbl and MBL work in related pathways but have distinct functions.
Here we aim to unravel the molecular and physiological implications of circMbl production and
function. This work will result in pioneering functional characterization of circRNAs in vivo and will be key for
understanding how MBL production and function are regulated in vivo. For doing so we will: identify MBL-
dependent and MBL-independent mechanisms of action of circMbl. We will follow by determining the
physiological and neural roles of mbl and circMbl isoforms. This project will illuminate essential
regulatory mechanisms of mbl expression and function. As or more importantly, this project is both technically
and intellectually innovative in its analysis of the roles of circRNAs in central aspects of physiology, and
behavior. Our project builds on strong preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise
of our group."
10826033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Objective: The overarching goal of our research is to replace invasive radical prostatectomy with targeted, mini-
mally invasive image-guided focal resection of prostate cancer. We propose to accomplish this by combining novel
low-ﬁeld MRI techniques with a new kind of surgical robot capable of delivering two needle-sized manipulators
into the prostate through a standard transurethral endoscope.
Signiﬁcance: 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and it is second only to lung
cancer in the number of men it kills every year in the USA. The gold standard treatment, radical prostatectomy,
involves complications including all those of major surgery, as well as high rates of impotence and incontinence.
Recently, pioneering surgeons have noted the promise of patient-speciﬁc transurethral focal resection to reduce
complication rates. However the approach is currently fundamentally limited by the fact that cancerous tissue
cannot be visually differentiated from healthy tissue in endoscope images, forcing the surgeon to “guess” where
the cancer is, based on memory of preoperative MRI images. Ultrasound-MRI fusion cannot improve things,
since the ultrasound probe compresses the prostate, which collapses the urethra and precludes transurethral
interventions. We propose to eliminate the guesswork and enable accurate, precise, personalized focal resections
by fusing high-resolution preoperative MRI with intraoperative low-ﬁeld MRI and a novel robotic system.
Innovation: The central innovation of this project is to enable use of the emerging generation of inexpensive,
portable, and open low-ﬁeld MRI scanners to guide focal prostate resection. Additional innovation comes from
the robotic system which will enable precise and accurate use of imaging information. The robot will be the
ﬁrst MRI-conditional robot able to deliver multiple manipulators through an endoscope. It will feature needle-
sized, tentacle-like manipulators and deploy them into the prostate through a standard-diameter transurethral
endoscope, for precise resection and retraction of tissue. This will make the focal resection process much easier
and more accurate for the surgeon to accomplish.
Approach: We will create our MRI-guided robotic system through three Speciﬁc Aims. Aim 1 achieves fast in-
traoperative imaging to update the surgeon's image guidance display as they remove tissue. In Aim 2 we build
a novel MRI-conditional robot and integrate it with the low-ﬁeld MRI scanner. In Aim 3 we validate the integrated
system in anthropomorphic phantoms with urologic surgeons. Note that clinical translation of our system will be
rapid at the successful conclusion of this R01. This project includes two industry partners, Promaxo, Inc. which
has recently released an FDA-approved low-ﬁeld prostate MRI scanner, and Virtuoso Surgical, Inc. which is de-
veloping a (non-MRI-conditional) transurethral robot slated to be on the market by the time this R01 concludes.
Thus, successful completion of this R01 will pave the way for commercial translation and clinical trials, enabling
us to rapidly bring the beneﬁts of this research to doctors and their patients."

Through this predoctoral fellowship focused pollen, air pollution, and respiratory health, I will obtain in-depth
training in exposure assessment and health effect estimation, biostatistical methods for environmental
mixtures, science communication, and teaching and mentorship. Pollen-related illnesses affect 60 million
Americans, with direct medical expenses estimated in the billions of dollars annually. Trends suggest that the
prevalence of pollen-induced asthma and allergic rhinitis is on the rise, which is expected to increase health
disparities and the already-substantial health costs associated with these conditions. There is emerging
evidence that pollen is an under-appreciated environmental justice issue that adds to the disproportionate
environmental burdens faced by people from racial and ethnic minority groups or lower income groups.
Nevertheless, pollen is an understudied environmental risk factor with scarce evidence on several important
questions related to pollen-health associations. The project proposed here fills significant gaps in our
understanding through the following specific aims: 1) Implement a multi-location time-series study of pollen and
respiratory morbidity that includes assessment of individual- and area-level indicators of social vulnerability; 2)
investigate how pollen and air pollution may interact to influence the risk of respiratory morbidity; and 3)
develop a city-wide automated pollen monitoring network in that emphasizes community-level data production
to improve exposure estimates and quantify potential exposure disparities. I hypothesize that individual- and
area-level disparities in pollen-associated risk of respiratory illness exist (Aim 1) and may be exacerbated by
the synergistic effects of pollen and air pollution (Aim 2) as well as heterogeneous local pollen exposures (Aim
3). The proposed research will yield insight into pollen-related risk disparities across populations in 23 U.S.
locations, potential synergistic effects of pollen and air pollution via implementation of environmental mixtures
methods, and potential within-city exposure disparities via community-level pollen exposure monitoring. By
investigating the unequal burden of pollen-associated respiratory illnesses and improving how we monitor and
assess pollen exposure, this research has the potential to guide public health recommendations and improve
health outcomes for millions of people. The proposed work complements the NIH Climate Change and Health
Initiative Strategic Framework and connects directly to several NIH special interest areas on climate change
and health (NOT-ES-22-006; NOT-HD-23-006)."
10826045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, as part of the TGF-beta signaling family, is a major
driver of developmental processes. Mutations in genes encoding BMP pathway components are
associated with cardiovascular, pulmonary, and skeletal diseases as well as cancer.
Developmentally, BMPs serve as morphogens, with slight changes in signal level resulting in distinct
cell fates. For instance, during dorsoventral axial patterning, the BMP gradient patterns the axial
tissue with high BMP levels instructing ventral cell fates. Precise regulation of the BMP morphogen
gradient is required for proper signaling and patterning, though has mostly focused on how ligand
concentration and activity impact biological outcomes. Our lab has recently shown that during
dorsoventral patterning, there are two required Type I BMP receptors, Acvr1l and Bmpr1a; however,
only the kinase activity of Acvr1l is required for signaling. The specific requirement of Bmpr1a has not
been identified, nor have the distinct requirements for Type II receptors. Prior work in other systems
has also demonstrated that trafficking of TGF-beta receptors can attenuate or dampen signal
transduction, representing another mechanism by which receptor activity can alter BMP signaling.
Mutations in BMP receptors are associated with cancer and, specifically, mutations in Acvr1 are
associated with brain gliomas and the developmental disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva,
though how these mutations impact BMP signaling levels and lead to disease are still being defined.
Here, I propose to determine the molecular basis for BMP receptor specialization and trafficking using
zebrafish dorsoventral axial patterning as a model. I hypothesize that the BMP signaling gradient is
interpreted by specialized receptor functions and trafficking to fine tune signal transduction
downstream of ligand concentration. Building upon recent evidence that Type I BMP receptors have
specialized roles in the zebrafish gastrula, I will directly test the capacity for each Type I receptor to
be activated by Type II receptors and, therefore, perform its kinase function. I will also determine non-
kinase based requirements for Bmpr1a in forming the receptor complex. Finally, I will define
mechanisms of receptor trafficking in the gastrula, characterizing where and through which pathways
receptors are trafficked to and from the cell membrane. I will then functionally test the requirements
for trafficking on BMP signaling levels and dorsoventral patterning by disrupting trafficking pathways.
Together, these studies will elucidate specialized requirements for BMP receptors in signal
transduction."

Hospice is the gold standard of quality end-of-life (EOL) care. As compared to the de-facto option of dying in a
hospital, hospice improves quality of life (QOL), reduces EOL care expenditures, and improves caregiver
bereavement outcomes. Although most patients who die from cancer receive hospice care, adults with blood
cancers are a glaring exception, with less than 25% receiving hospice services. The few who enroll in hospice
typically do so in the last few days of life, negating most of its benefits. Lack of access to blood transfusions is
the prime barrier to hospice use for this patient population. Refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia are a
common final pathway for many blood cancers and cause debilitating fatigue, shortness of breath, and
bleeding. Transfusions palliate these symptoms and improve QOL; yet, most hospices do not provide access
to transfusions and none provide home transfusions. Faced with the terrible choice of continuing QOL-
preserving transfusions or accessing quality home-based hospice care, most patients opt for ongoing
transfusions. As a result, most blood cancer patients ultimately die in the hospital, subjected to painful and
unnecessary medical interventions, and separated from the home and the people they care most about in life.
In response to this great need, we have developed a novel model of hospice care—HEmatology-ModifiEd
Hospice (HEME-Hospice)—with structured input from blood cancer patients, their caregivers, and hematologic
oncologists. Through a unique partnership with a large hospice organization and an academic transfusion
service, HEME-Hospice combines core elements of hospice (e.g., visiting nurses, home health aides, social
workers, chaplains) with home transfusions that are triggered by symptoms (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath,
and bleeding) and informed by laboratory parameters. We propose a parallel cluster randomized trial of 350
hospice-eligible adult patients with blood cancers, clustered by hematologic oncologist, to test the efficacy of
access to HEME-Hospice versus usual care, with the primary outcome of hospice enrollment. Secondary
outcomes include length of hospice enrollment, high-intensity healthcare use, expenditures, patient/caregiver-
reported QOL and mood, and quality of death. We hypothesize that access to HEME-Hospice will result in
higher rates of hospice enrollment compared to usual care. We also anticipate that it will result in a reduction in
high-intensity healthcare use near the EOL, lower expenditures, and improved QOL and mood for patients and
their caregivers. This application offers the opportunity to rigorously address a critical barrier that results in
many patients with blood cancers dying without the benefits of hospice care. Ultimately, this research has the
potential to transform hospice care delivery and improve EOL care for blood cancer patients."

The goal of this project is to determine how developmental exposure to a mixture of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) disrupts humoral immune defenses against respiratory virus infection. There is evidence that
PFAS affect the immune system, but uncertainty about underlying cellular mechanisms. This project builds on
preliminary evidence that developmental exposure to a mixture of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and PFHxS perturbs the
response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, including significantly fewer T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells
are critical drivers of humoral immunity, controlling antibody production, isotype switching, affinity maturation,
and immunological memory. Additional pilot data show that fewer Tfh cells in PFAS-exposed offspring correlate
with reduced IAV-specific antibody levels. Our results are exciting because, although changes in antibody levels
are often associated with PFAS, how developmental PFAS exposure alters key cellular events that underpin
humoral immunity is not known. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that developmental
exposure disrupts Tfh cells, which contributes to alterations in B cell responses and antibody production. During
IAV infection, we can track responses of Tfh cells, germinal center B cells, and plasma cells over time using
multidimensional flow cytometry, and the kinetics of primary and anamnestic responses to IAV are well
established. The first aim will define the contribution of alterations in T cells and B cells to the effects of
developmental PFAS exposure on Tfh cells and anti-viral humoral immunity, including memory responses. The
second aim will delineate key parameters of developmental immunotoxicity of PFAS, including the critical window
during development that is most sensitive to PFAS exposure, and the dose-dependent and sex-dependent
nature of immune function changes caused by developmental PFAS exposure. This will include using ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure PFAS in the
offspring, allowing internal dose and immune function to be directly related. The third aim will identify the mode
of action through which PFAS affect immune function using conditional knockout mice and pharmacological
agents. This aim will resolve whether developmental immunotoxicity is mediated via peroxisome proliferator
activated receptors (PPAR). This research project will significantly advance knowledge of how developmental
exposure to a representative real-world PFAS mixture modulates the immune system. Major impacts include
that it will pinpoint cellular targets that contribute to clinical consequences, provide a framework to understand
sex differences in PFAS developmental immunotoxicity, produce new information to guide research in human
population studies, and refine our ability to identify at risk populations."

The prevalence of obesity has reached alarming levels, impacting approximately one-third of the adult
population in the United States. This epidemic poses a significant risk to individuals, increasing the
susceptibility to metabolic syndrome. In most cases, obesity is characterized by hypothalamic resistance to the
anorexigenic hormone leptin. Leptin resistance impedes the efficacy of leptin therapy in addressing obesity and
metabolic syndrome. While several regulators have been implicated in leptin resistance, it is critical to identify
additional regulators of leptin signaling to gain a full understanding in the development of leptin resistance,
particularly nuclear factors that influence the epigenetic landscape of chromatin architecture, which can be
susceptible to obesogenic environmental factors. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized
to trigger the onset of numerous diseases, including metabolic diseases. However, the interaction between
obesogenic diet and the epigenetic reprogramming of hypothalamus, where leptin elicits its action, remains
largely unknown. Jumonji D3 (JMJD3; KDM6B) is a histone lysine demethylase that epigenetically activates
genes by demethylating the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. While JMJD3's involvement in various
biological processes, such as development, immunity, and autophagy, has been demonstrated, its metabolic
roles in the hypothalamus remain unexplored. In our preliminary study using mice, we observed that a high-fat
diet (HFD) leads to the specific downregulation of JMJD3 expression in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus
(VMH), a region characterized by high leptin signaling activity. shRNA-mediated VMH-specific downregulation
of JMJD3 disrupts hypothalamic leptin signaling, contributing to the development of obesity. Conversely,
lentivirus-mediated VMH-specific overexpression of JMJD3 enhances leptin signaling, offering protection
against obesity and metabolic syndrome induced by HFD. The present study aims to demonstrate the crucial
role of JMJD3 as an epigenetic modifier in regulating hypothalamic leptin signaling and energy homeostasis.
Aim 1 aims to examine whether hypothalamic JMJD3 protects against obesity through an epigenetic
mechanism. We will create Jmjd3 knockout mouse models that are specific to the ventromedial hypothalamus
(VMH) region and leptin receptor-expressing cells to investigate the anatomical and functional role of JMJD3 in
hypothalamic leptin signaling and obesity development. Aim 2 will explore the molecular mechanism by which
JMJD3 influences leptin signaling. We will investigate whether JMJD3 induces epigenetic modifications in
known regulators of leptin signaling, such as the leptin receptor. Additionally, we will use ChIP-seq and RNA-
seq to identify other targets of JMJD3 in an unbiased manner. Aim 3 will explore nonpharmacological strategies
to enhance hypothalamic JMJD3 expression, aiming to alleviate leptin resistance. This proposal will establish
the significance of hypothalamic JMJD3 in the leptin signaling pathway, potentially identifying JMJD3 activation
as a therapeutic target for combating obesity by enhancing leptin sensitivity."

 Antimicrobial resistant organisms (ARO) have long been a concern in the acute healthcare setting, but
community rates have increased exponentially over the past decade, with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimating that 47% of all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales
(ESBL-E) infections are now community-associated (CA). Despite this, very little is known about community-
associated AROS (CA-ARO). The goals of this proposal are to characterize AROs in the community setting and
to identify risk factors for CA-ARO infection and colonization. Our central hypotheses are that there are
identifiable risk factors associated with CA-ARO infection and colonization, and that these data will lay the
groundwork for interventions to reduce the transmission of AROs and to ultimately prevent ARO infections.
 In Aim 1, we will characterize clinical risk factors associated with CA-ARO infections utilizing a database
of patients with urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections associated with both community and
healthcare settings. In Aim 2 we will determine the prevalence and clinical risk factors associated with CA-ARO
colonization in patients admitted to the acute care hospital setting. This will be achieved through recruiting
patients admitted to the hospital from the community setting and interrogating clinical specimens with selective
microbiologic culture to determine the prevalence of ARO colonization and identify risk factors for CA-ARO
colonization in this population. In Aim 3 we will determine the prevalence and characteristics associated with
ARO colonization in asymptomatic community volunteers and their home environment to identify risk factors and
reservoirs of CA-ARO colonization. We will achieve this through a prospective cohort study of community
volunteers and interrogation of human and environmental samples paired with detailed clinical data to document
reservoirs of CA-ARO and potential risk factors for CA-ARO colonization. Together, this data will provide key
insight to understand CA-AROs, a necessary first step towards creating interventions to combat AROs in
community settings.
 Results of this study will directly impact clinical practice by providing key data to guide the use of infection
prevention interventions for people at-risk for CA-ARO colonization or infection, environmental hygiene
recommendations, and empiric antimicrobial use in the community setting. This study is directly responsive to
the AHRQ FOA focused on the prevention of HAIs as it is aimed at reducing the transmission of AROs and
preventing HAIs. This project represents a necessary and novel approach to targeting AROs within the
community setting, and will lead to practice-changing paradigms to combatting AROs."

The Centers for Disease Control recommends breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant’s life due to
significant long term health benefits for the infant and breastfeeding parent. Beyond meeting the nutritional needs
of the infant, human milk is a dynamic fluid with composition that changes to meet the needs of the infant as it
develops and bioactive components which provide protective immunity to the infant. However, much is still
unknown about the cells in the mammary gland which produce these prized components of human milk.
Currently, there are no FDA approved interventions known to boost milk production, so the 60-70% of parents
who struggle to lactate are left with little support to improve lactation outcomes and set infants up for the long-
term health benefits of breastfeeding. Recent studies using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the
mammary gland cells exfoliated into human milk have begun to characterize the cells that produce this dynamic
substance with the ultimate goal of improving understanding of the factors impacting milk production at a cellular
level. Still, the transcriptional pathways involved in milk production as well as the way these pathways change
as a result of maternal and infant factors remains poorly understood. This proposal will utilize existing data
generated from human milk to improve the understanding of transcriptional basis of milk production by (1) using
integrative analysis of existing scRNA-seq data to identify shared transcriptional pathways of lactation, (2)
developing statistical models to expose genes and pathways that change in milk in concordance with maternal
and infant characteristics, COVID-19 infection and vaccination, antibody concentrations, and human milk
oligosaccharide concentration, and (3) apply these and other models to understand the changes in the mammary
gland and milk composition as a result of COVID-19 infection and vaccination. This improved characterization of
milk production will lead to future studies on interventions to improve lactation outcomes and immune protection
from human milk. Research will take place at the Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, a highly
collaborative research institution with a commitment to postdoctoral training. The trainee with receive training in
statistical analysis and method development, lactation biology, immunology, and responsible conduct of research
from an interdisciplinary and multi-institutional team of mentors and collaborators. The training plan will prepare
the trainee for an independent career as a computational biologist studying lactation and maternal and infant
health."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease that remains largely intractable.
Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, increasing its incidence and
reducing the age of onset. Hippocampal network hyperactivity, specifically in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)
regions critical for memory, occurs early in prodromal AD, is aggravated by apoE4, and is predictive of future
cognitive decline. CA3/DG hippocampal hyperactivity also occurs in young non-demented apoE4 carriers as well
as in human apoE4 knock-in (hE4-KI) mice where apoE4 has been shown to disrupt adult-born dentate granule
cell (DGCs) neurogenesis and network integration. Preliminary data from our lab revealed that DGCs in hE4-KI
mice are intrinsically hyperexcitable and exhibit a progressive excitation-inhibition imbalance compared to those
from hE3-KI mice. We also found two electrophysiologically distinct DGC classes: adapting DGCs (aDGCs)
which possess electrophysiological characteristics of immature neurons and are hyperexcitable compared to
neighboring mature non-adapting DGCs (nDGCs). aDGCs’ population increases in an age- and apoE4-
dependent manner. The two DGC functional subtypes are paralleled by two DGC transcriptomic clusters
uncovered by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis of hippocampal neurons from hE3-KI and
hE4-KI mice. Motivated by these findings and published data, I will test the central hypothesis in this proposal:
aDGCs are adult-born neurons that fail to reach functional maturity. ApoE4 expression modifies adult-born
DGC’s transcriptome, leading to disrupted maturation and integration process, and consequently in the increase
of hyperexcitable aDGC population with aging, resulting in hippocampal hyperactivity. I will also explore potential
genetic modification strategies to restore normal DGC and network physiology in hE4-KI mice for potential
therapeutic development. The proposed work will harness the combinatorial electrophysiological, transcriptomic,
and morphological analyses from individual cells to interrogate apoE4-related pathophysiology in DGC
maturation, circuit integration, and network dysfunction (Aim 1). In addition, I will use the multimodal high-
resolution data to generate and validate potential therapeutic gene targets to ameliorate apoE4-induced
pathology and provide new avenues of research into the underlying pathophysiology and treatment of AD (Aim
2). The fellowship program will provide intensive training in cutting-edge technical skills such as patch clamp
electrophysiology, scRNA sequencing, and CRISPRa/i methodology, as well as career development. My
sponsors, Drs. Zilberter and Huang at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease (GIND), will guide me
through this training. With state-of-the-art facilities and equipment and comprehensive support for career
development, Gladstone Institutes is an ideal place to conduct the proposed research. This rigorous and well-
rounded training will enable me to attain research independence in the future."
10824925,"SUMMARY
The goal of our studies is to understand RORα’s role in the transcriptional regulation of TH17 cell
pathogenicity and chronic inflammation. RORα is a member of the ligand-regulated nuclear receptor
(NR) superfamily of transcription factors. Significantly less is known about RORα in the transcriptional
regulation of TH17-mediated immunity. We and others recently published RORα is required for full
TH17-cell development, particularly in mouse models of chronic inflammation. Despite this evidence,
RORα is considered functionally redundant to RORγt, the lineage defining transcription factor of TH17
cells. As ligand-regulated transcription factors, NRs evolved to respond to endogenous small
molecules, translating these signals into changes in gene expression. Synthetic small molecules can
also be utilized to understand receptor function. Our data suggests that RORα/ligand-regulation may
protect from chronic inflammation, including colitis. Given the evidence that both intra- and extra-
cellular ligands regulate NR activity in TH17 cells, defining RORα and ligand mechanisms of action is
key to understanding signaling pathways underlying homeostasis vs. pathogenesis. Therefore,
understanding these processes may be essential to understand how RORα contributes to TH17 cells
and disease. Our overarching goals are to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate RORα’s
transcriptional activity and interacting partners, thus driving functionality in TH17 cells during
inflammatory processes. Understanding RORα’s transcriptional role in TH17 cells may reveal a novel
therapeutic option for the treatment of TH17-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders. We will achieve
our goals by: 1) establishing how RORα transcriptionally promotes and maintains pathogenic TH17-
mediated inflammation and 2) using pharmacological approaches to understand how ligands affect the
transcriptional activity of RORα in TH17 cells. Collectively, our studies will uncover important
transcriptional roles for RORα in TH17 cell biology and reveal whether targeting RORα may be
advantageous for the treatment of TH17-mediated chronic inflammation."

Opioids until recently were the drugs of choice to treat moderate to severe chronic pain. Decades of intensive
research has led to the pharmacological characterization of countless synthetic and semi-synthetic opioid
derivatives. However, an ideal compound, devoid of serious side-effects such as respiratory depression,
dependence, and addiction, has not yet been identified. Opioid activation of mu opioid receptor (MOR) G protein
signaling pathways is believed to cause both desirable analgesia as well as undesirable adverse effects like
respiratory depression. Since MOR can couple with six Gi/o/z subtypes, namely Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GOA, GOB and Gz, we
hypothesize that it may be possible to achieve functional selectivity by activating an individual Gα-isoform and/or
a combination of these isoforms. Our preliminary data shows that bitopics of fentanyl show unique Gi/o/z signaling
as well as a behavioral profile distinct from typical opioids. To this end, we have also obtained cryoEM structures
of MOR bound to one lead bitopics, C6 guano (3.3Å), and an analog of C6 guano named LG94 (3.4Å) getting
insights into distinct modes of ligand binding that also involves engagement of an allosteric binding site. We have
identified two distinct modes of engaging the sodium binding allosteric site in MOR and identified an antagonist
as well. In this study, we will interrogate Gα-subtype bias through screening of additional analogs, across both
fentanyl and morphinan based templates as well as novel indole-based templates and targeting the allosteric
site with additional bitopics with higher potency and optimal drug like properties. We will also develop a first in
class antagonist on the fentanyl template. High resolution cryoEM will be used on promising analogs to enable
structure-function studies and ligand binding fine-tuning. This, in turn, will enable us to design analogs that are
more effective and possibly display a more advantageous side-effect profile (no respiratory depression while
showing analgesia) than their parent compounds. These probes will also allow us to build a better framework for
understanding MOR Gα-subtype signaling and facilitate identification of useful preclinical candidates for the
treatment of pain/OUD in the near future. Furthermore, any novel antagonists could become tools in fighting
opioid-related substance abuse."

This heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) results in challenges to developing diagnostic,
prognostic, and treatment strategies applicable across the autism spectrum. A search has been underway for
decades to identify promising biomarkers, i.e. objectively measured indicators of typical or atypical biology or
response to therapy, for ASD. While progress is promising, one major limitation to this search is the bottleneck
of laboratory resources to conduct studies at sufficient scale to sustain the iterative development, evaluation,
and refinement needed to bring biomarkers to practical fruition. For studies of neurodevelopmental disorders,
the barriers are particularly challenging, as heterogeneity of behavioral presentation interacts with extensive
developmental variability leading to a need for massive resources just to establish baselines across protracted
periods of early childhood. One promising biomarker technology that has been noted as being potentially
highly scalable is eye tracking. Eye tracking offers a non-invasive, easily tolerated method for directly
characterizing child attentional processes. These attentional processes, in turn, are a moment-by-moment
account of visual information gathering strategies that are driven by more fundamental reflex and cognition.
Unfortunately, research-grade eye tracking is out of reach for the average end user: technically, operationally,
and financially. However, astonishing advances in computer vision have now made it possible to consider
bringing eye tracking not just into laboratories at low costs, but into clinics, communities, and homes.
 This study creates infrastructure for large-scale computer-vision-based eye-tracking data collection from
mobile tablet devices. Building upon existing, already-proven, mobile data collection methods designed, tested,
and deployed by the study team, this project seeks to develop a general-purpose research tool that is also
end-user-focused, with broad appeal, usability, and streamlined utility. The platform launches with a battery of
eye-tracking measures optimized for mobile device deployment and designed to probe mechanistic constructs
associated with non-social information preferences in toddlers with ASD. This battery will be tested in the lab in
2-year-old toddlers with and without ASD, with both mobile- and laboratory-based eye tracking designed to
validate the mobile adaptation and provide routes for subsequent optimization. A parallel remote-only sample
will also participate. Both in-lab and remote-only samples will be evaluated again at 36-months-old to confirm
developmental outcomes. A large community sample will be recruited to fill in the battery’s developmental
profile from 3-to-36-months of age. This study thus builds, validates, and improves upon novel remote eye-
tracking data collection infrastructure, but will also apply this technology to fill in mechanistic gaps in our
knowledge regarding atypical attentional signatures in toddlers with ASD. It is our goal that these advances
translate into clinical tools that can be easily deployed without advanced technological expertise, and then in
turn into new, effective, personalized strategies for more optimal treatment of children with ASD."
10825909,"Abstract: Nearly 60% of human conceptions are miscarried surrounding the window of implantation. During this
stage within a week after fertilization, the pluripotent epiblast tissue of the embryo transforms into a polarized
epithelium with a central lumen. The causes of significant pregnancy loss at this period are still not well
understood owing to the substantial challenges associated with human embryo research. Critical gaps in
knowledge include mechanistic understanding of the cellular morphogens driving epiblast tissue development at
the implantation stages. Further, animal models such as rodents, while highly valuable, have been found to
demonstrate distinct processes from humans at the implantation stages. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the
levels of conservation or divergence between key mammalian species at this stage remains incomplete, making
it difficult to extrapolate findings around the implantation period from model species to human health. The central
goal of this proposal is to enhance our comprehension of the human-specific mechanisms that govern embryonic
development by examining the regulatory mechanisms through which WNT/β-catenin signaling guides epiblast
tissue remodeling during implantation across different species. Based on my preliminary results, the overall
hypothesis that WNT/β-catenin signaling will show species-specific differences in its role in epiblast tissue
remodeling. I hypothesize that these differences are mechanistically tied to regulation of Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin
(ERM) proteins which control cell surface tension and actin architecture. Aim 1 will identify the biomechanical
effects of WNT/β-catenin signaling on human epiblast development at implantation using novel human 3D stem
cell-based models. Using these highly reproducible models, I will confirm that WNT/β-catenin acts through pERM
via Western Blot and loss-of-function experiments. I will then utilize live-cell imaging to analyze changes in actin
architecture over development, and then analyze changes in cell surface tension through use a fluorescent
membrane tension probe that will be quantified using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to validate
previous preliminary data using a secondary 5-dimensional state-of-the-art imaging software-based readout of
cell surface tension. Aim 2 will define species-specificity of the mechanism underlying WNT/β-catenin epiblast
remodeling control across humans, non-human primates and mice, through performing similar perturbation
techniques and characterizations using Western Blot and IF, live-cell imaging with actin reporters, 5D imaging
analyses, and FLIM. This proposal directly addresses the NICHDD’s research theme 1: “Understanding the
Molecular, Cellular, and Structural Basis of Development” through use of novel models to understand correct
processes of early human embryonic development, as well as how abnormal processes lead to undesirable
outcomes. A detailed understanding of the morphogen-driven mechanisms at this monumental developmental
stage, particularly in the clinically relevant context of human-specific development, can shed light on the
pathological alterations that lead to miscarriage at implantation."

The majority of alcohol users in the US consume alcohol at doses and frequencies that are not consistent with
alcohol use disorder (AUD). There is growing evidence that low-dose ethanol exposure impacts the brain and
behavior but despite this, the behavioral and neurobiological consequences of chronic low-dose alcohol
consumption are poorly understood. The decision to seek a reward has a direct relationship with its value. The
ability to reassess and update reward value is critical for adaptive value-guided decision making. Deficits in the
processes that moderate motivated behavior may contribute to the transition from casual alcohol consumption
to AUD. Data from our lab indicate that chronic low-dose ethanol enhances reward motivation in a progressive
ratio (PR) task in male, but not female, mice. In contrast, ethanol-exposed female mice are more sensitive to
reduced reward value than ethanol-naïve females, whereas ethanol exposure did not increase sensitivity to
change in reward value in males. These changes may result from an ethanol-induced dysregulation in the ability
to use reward value information to guide behavior, which can be determined experimentally through the use of
a value-guided decision making task. One potential neurobiological substrate mediating this effect is the
basolateral amygdala (BLA). The BLA is a key neuroanatomical substrate of reward value encoding and
participates in updating value information and influencing value-guided decision making. Preliminary data from
our lab suggest that chronic low-dose ethanol exposure decreases cFos expression in BLA and its projections
to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) following reward seeking. This proposal will test the overarching hypothesis
that chronic-low-dose ethanol alters BLA glutamate receptor expression, thus contributing to impairments in
detecting and using reward value information to guide behavior. In Aim 1, we will use a value-guided decision-
making task to test our hypothesis that chronic low-dose ethanol impairs the ability to update changes in reward
value for adaptive behavior. In Aim2, we will investigate the impact of chronic low-dose ethanol exposure on BLA
and NAc postsynaptic glutamate receptors and the relationship between these changes and performance on the
value-guided decision-making task. Aim 3 will use chemogenetic strategies to test the hypothesis that inhibiting
the BLA or BLA → NAc circuit activity will impair the ability to successfully use reward value information during
a value-guided decision-making task. The results from these experiments will expand our understanding of the
impacts of chronic low-dose ethanol exposure on behavior and neurobiology, which is an area that remains
severely understudied in the alcohol use field. Further, this fellowship will enable the applicant to build on her
expertise in learning and memory processes which may be dysregulated by alcohol use by integrating a
conceptual understanding of low-dose ethanol effects on molecular substrates, specific circuits, and behavior.
The abundance of resources and opportunities available in the Barker lab and at Drexel University will ensure
that the applicant is prepared and qualified for an independent alcohol research career."
10826840,"When learning about rewards in our environment, we learn that certain cues come to predict the presence of
particular rewards. This allows us to make decisions about where to exert effort based on the type of reward that
may be available. We are also able to learn when specific cues predict the absence of a particular reward, which
allows for flexible, adaptive decision making. Allocation of time and energy resources can be directed away from
rewards that are unavailable and toward rewards that are more likely to be available. The ability to use stimuli in
the environment to guide behavior towards the most advantageous options is critical and often impaired in disease
states, including substance use disorder. Associations that predict the absence of reward are prevalent but
understudied. This limits our understanding of the basic scientific principles of learning and prevents a complete
understanding of how impairments in this kind of learning emerge in disease states like substance use disorder.
Therefore, the broad goal of this project is to reveal the neuronal mechanisms by which inhibitory reward
associations are established.
 Accumulating evidence suggests that the basolateral amygdala helps us to learn that cues in the environment
predict specific available awards, so-called outcome-specific reward memories. The basolateral amygdala is critical
for the encoding and retrieval of such cue-reward memories. Whether the basolateral amygdala also helps us learn
when specific rewards will not be available is unknown, but plausible given evidence that is involved in learning
inhibitory aversive associations. I will ask whether the basolateral amygdala is involved in encoding the inhibitory
appetitive associations and, if so, whether such associations are uniquely linked to a particular outcome. My
hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala encodes identity-specific inhibitory reward memories to support adaptive
decision making. In Aim 1, I will determine the temporal dynamics of basolateral amygdala activity during the
development of inhibitory associations. In Aim 2, I will determine whether basolateral amygdala activity is necessary
and sufficient for the encoding of these associations. Evidence from our lab implicates projections from the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex to the basolateral amygdala in helping us learn when specific rewards are available. Therefore,
in Aim 3, I will examine whether lateral orbitofrontal cortex projections to the basolateral amygdala are necessary
for basolateral amygdala encoding of inhibitory reward associations. The resulting findings, whether for or against
my hypothesis, will provide novel information about the basolateral amygdala and its function. This will facilitate
future work mapping the circuitry that is important for encoding inhibitory associations. I will conduct this project in
the Wassum Lab at UCLA, with the guidance of a remarkable mentoring team. This environment will provide me
with exceptional intellectual and technical training in systems and behavioral neuroscience, fully preparing me for
an independent research career studying inhibitory control over behaviors."
10829820,"Abstract
Non-technical (NT) skills encompass teamwork, communication, decision-making, leadership, and situational
awareness and are critical aspects for safe care delivery in the operating room (OR). Non-technical skills of
surgery have been identified as the most frequent causes for sentinel events that impact patient mortality, post-
operative pain, and quality of life. Lapses in communication, teamwork, and leadership have been shown to
account for 60% of major perioperative complications, most of which are related to communication failures. Given
this strong link between NT and team skills and patient safety, several NT skills assessment tools have been
validated specifically for surgical teams. However, they require the presence of trained observers or retrospective
review of videos. Such methods are time-consuming and resource intensive to obtain. Importantly, these
assessments are subject to multiple assessment biases of the observer which threatens their objectivity and
value. Automated tools that do not require an expert observer to conduct real-time observations, do not need
time-intensive audio-video analysis, and could provide objective, quantifiable, and continuous measurements of
NT skill are, thus, highly needed and could allow for the more widespread implementation of NT skills training.
The objectives of the current project are to 1) investigate and develop predictive models linking objective sensor-
based data streams with individual and team non-technical skills, 2) test non-intrusive sensing devices in
simulated surgical team simulation training for practicing professionals, and 3) test sensor's accuracy in
distinguishing teams with and without TeamSTEPPS training. To achieve these objectives, three specific aims
are proposed. Aim 1 will validate our multi-modal sensing system for measuring NT skills in surgical simulation.
A collaborative team of human factors engineers and surgeon educators will perform summative usability
evaluation and determine usability with the System Usability Scale and Technology Acceptance Model. For Aim
2, our team will implement sensors in well-validated surgical simulations with experienced and inexperienced
teams. As sensors continuously collect data, observer-based non-technical skill assessment tools will be
performed real-time and video recorded. Analytics, data fusion, and regression analysis will be performed to
model sensor metrics with gold-standard ratings. Finally, we will evaluate whether sensors can distinguish
differences in team skills between teams with/without TeamSTEPPS training. The expected deliverables will
include usability validation of a non-intrusive sensing system and analytics framework for automated skill
assessment that can be implemented in surgical simulation. If proven valid and acceptable through the proposed
work, our objective NT skill assessments could be used in the future to assess effectiveness of team training
and provide structured, individually-tailored feedback to enhance healthcare providers' NT skills. Thus, this work
could ultimately reduce errors due to poor NT skills and enhance patient safety."

Children obtain more mental health services through schools than through any other public system or agency.
School-based mental health care often is provided by community mental health clinicians contracted to deliver
school-based services. A rate-limiting step to the team's success in providing effective, evidence-based care is
that the mission and work of the mental health teams, whose focus is on behavioral health service delivery, is
not always consistent with the educational mission and needs of under-resourced schools. Participants will be
drawn from school-based teams in Philadelphia's community mental health network and public schools.
Existing methods to enhance the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based practices
have not addressed the challenges that this common model of collocated services poses, such as disparate
goals and lack of coordination and collaboration. Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and
Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) has been widely disseminated in health care settings and provides a promising
strategy for addressing communication and climate in school mental health teams. Philadelphia provides an
ideal context in which to explore the impact of TeamSTEPPS on inter-organizational processes because
Philadelphia relies heavily on mental health agencies to provide services in schools. Most students are low
income minority children, allowing us to simultaneously address multiple AHRQ priority populations. We
propose to take a participatory approach to collaboratively identify solutions to challenges in collocated school-
based mental health services based upon the feedback of stakeholders using TeamSTEPPS to support mental
health team-school collaboration. Consistent with AHRQ priorities to minimize adverse events, maximize
recovery and support 360° person-centered team-based care, we propose the following aims. First, in Aim 1
we will capture key stakeholder perspectives about challenges in collocated school mental health services
through formative work to inform collaborative planning and capacity building activities in Aim 2. Then, in Aim 2
we will identify inter-organizational challenges and required components of TeamSTEPPS to adapt. We will
establish an advisory board and adapt TeamSTEPPS. The product of Aim 2 will be an adapted TeamSTEPPS,
directed toward both school mental health and school-employed personnel, and specific, tailored
implementation strategies to improve services in schools in conjunction with TeamSTEPPS. Finally, we will
explore the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of TeamSTEPPS and the strategies generated in Aim 2 on inter-
professional collaboration, teamwork, and student outcomes in eight schools."

 Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the U.S. health system’s capacity to provide such services is
severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes for
children with early signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment
within an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part C is publicly
funded, available in all areas, and serves children under age 3 who have developmental delays or disabilities.
Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-
based interventions. The study objective is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of
ASD by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of training EI providers to
deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT). RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)
that is ideally suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement, and
can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.
 This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation design, and will use a unique mixed
methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT at scale, pending positive trial
results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S. States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers
and 440 families of children with early symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but
also affords the opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their
implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training group (n=80) or
treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5 children in their caseload who are
16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220 children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multi-
method assessment technology will be used to measure the impact of the intervention on children’s language
and social communication, as well as parents’ self-efficacy and well-being. Importantly, this study will examine
putative mechanisms (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent contingent responsiveness)
through which the intervention improves clinically-relevant outcomes. Data regarding provider-initiated
modifications to the intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity-
inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality assurance procedures. In
sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement RIT at scale, thereby increasing the
capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective, evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing
population of children who show early signs of ASD."
10830087,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - ABSTRACT
The Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (CEED) aims to address the environmental health-related
concerns of New Jersey (NJ) residents by engaging community members, organizations, and agencies as
advisors and research partners. CEED provides critical investment and infrastructure for multidisciplinary,
collaborative research and organizes training the next generation of environmental health scientists. The primary
goal of the Administrative Core is to implement the strategic vision of CEED, coordinate and manage Center
activities, and integrate and synthesize input from components to ensure that the Center’s mission of improving
environmental health is achieved. Specifically, the Core coordinates and supports research, data management
and sharing, recruitment and training, community engagement, infrastructure, and mentoring. Providing
operational and fiduciary oversight, the Administrative Core will allocate resources from the grant and matching
funds from the University to facilitate cutting-edge basic research, community-engaged participatory research,
and training in environmental health sciences. Working closely with the Community Engagement Core (CEC),
the Administrative Core will ensure the translation and dissemination of research findings to communities and
valued partners. The Administrative Core will also ensure that CEED’s prevention and intervention strategies are
assessed for efficacy and implemented to address the environmental health concerns of NJ communities. During
the current funding period, the Administrative Core made notable progress in recruiting members across
departments and schools within Rutgers and three other NJ universities and capitalized on substantial
institutional support to improve research capabilities. Leaders of CEED are recognized across the university and
the scientific community for their outstanding mentorship and research. Collectively, these accomplishments
provide a significant platform to launch and advance research and training initiatives in the next grant cycle. Our
specific aims are to: (1) Create and foster a structured, interdisciplinary environment that facilitates impactful,
collaborative research that can be translated to improve the health of NJ communities and overburdened
populations across the nation; (2) Engage and amplify diverse backgrounds and perspectives in environmental
health research and translation; and (3) Provide support for the training and career development of the next
generation of environmental health scientists."
10830088,"TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH SUPPORT CORE - ABSTRACT
The Translational Research Support Core (TRSC) plays a key role in the research pursued in CEED by
supporting the design and implementation of innovative “research that matters” for communities in NJ and
beyond. TRSC offers expertise on planning and conducting research across the NIEHS translational research
framework. Informed by basic laboratory research within CEED and concerns of community members, TRSC
facilitates research through the design and execution of 1) population/observational epidemiology, 2) clinical
trials and intervention studies, and 3) implementation of meaningful results. This is accomplished through
bidirectional partnerships between TRSC leadership and CEED researchers and trainees, as well as close
communication with the Community Engagement Core (CEC). After consultation with researchers to identify
clear study objectives, TRSC offers an array of services including design of human/population studies; screening,
recruitment, and retention of subjects for panel studies, trials, and cohorts; management of protocols and data
to ensure regulatory compliance; collection of biospecimens; and data analysis, interpretation, and dissemination
of study findings. TRSC also provides field support for study management, survey research, and environmental
and biospecimen collection, as well as sample storage within a state-of-the art sample management system.
TRSC leverages the infrastructure available at the NJ Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS),
the first and only Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) in NJ. Through this partnership, TRSC has
been able to expand the reach of its services by greater access to populations and cohorts, as well as informatics
tools that enable broader recruitment of study participants. During the next grant cycle, CEED’s efforts will be
focused on addressing environmental health-related disease by placing affected communities at the center of
our research. Close relationships with local communities will enhance TRSC’s capacity to accelerate translation
of research findings to people who live/work in settings that put them at increased risk of exposure to hazards
using evidence-based implementation science approaches. TRSC will ensure rigorous and comprehensive
support for research involving human participants and community partners. In collaboration with the
Administrative Core and Career Development Program, TRSC will connect early career scientists and trainees
with opportunities to attain skills in translational science including workshops, asynchronous online learning, and
through individual mentorship by TRSC leadership. These activities support the ability of CEED to reduce health
risks and disparities within NJ and improve public health across the state and region."
10830089,"HUMAN AND ANIMAL EXPOSURE (HUMANE) FACILITY CORE – ABSTRACT
The HUMan and ANimal Exposure (HUMANE) Facility Core provides CEED members with unique and powerful
tools to fulfill the Center’s vision of addressing the environmental health concerns of NJ residents by focusing
efforts on the environmental challenges of its most affected populations. HUMANE works with basic and clinical
researchers to design and implement experiments that assess how individual or complex real-world exposures
affect biological response indicators linked to adverse health outcomes in humans and animal models. HUMANE
utilizes cutting-edge exposure generation platforms coupled to real-time and time-integrated measurement of
legacy and emerging environmental/occupational toxicants in the Core’s human Controlled Exposure Facility
(CEF) and the Animal Exposure Facility (AEF). HUMANE also assists CEED investigators with inhalation
exposure studies aimed at examining the interactions between relevant toxicants and variables such as
temperature, humidity, physical activity, psychosocial stress, and pre-existing conditions or co-morbidities.
During the current grant cycle, the Core has strengthened its longstanding expertise and capabilities in
generating controlled gaseous and aerosol exposures by incorporating platforms capable of generating and
characterizing environmental nanoparticles that recapitulate those generated by multiple sources including
wildfires, incinerated micro-nanoplastics, e-cigarettes, and engineered nanomaterials. The capacity of HUMANE
to conduct both controlled animal and human exposure studies facilitates bidirectional translation of research
findings. By studying biological indicators and responses in humans and animals, insight is gained into
mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, which can be targeted for intervention strategies. The Core benefits from
robust interactions with the Translational Research Support Core (TRSC) and the Biological/Environmental
Indicators and Responses (BEIR) Facility Core, which facilitate productive interdisciplinary collaborations and
ensure high standards of QA/QC and safety in study protocols. The Core’s utilization is expected to increase
significantly during the next grant period due to planned investments in mechanical systems and equipment for
the CEF and AEF that simulate extreme weather scenarios. These new capabilities will allow CEED investigators
to study the interaction of environmental pollution with climate change-induced conditions that disproportionately
affect already overburdened populations and communities. The renovation of the CEF will also allow CEED
investigators to assess the efficacy of interventions to reduce the transmission of airborne infections under
controlled environmental conditions that recapitulate climate changes."
10830090,"CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND DETECTION FACILITY CORE – ABSTRACT
The diverse research performed by Center investigators requires the ability to identify and measure a wide array
of contaminants in the environment and in biological samples. The Chemical Analysis and Detection (CAD)
Facility Core addresses this need through the development of new methods for detection and measurement of
small molecules and metals present in various matrices. As the number and quantities of new and emerging
environmental contaminants increases, CAD strives to develop high throughput analytical methods that can
measure 100 or more analytes in a single assay. The Core staff includes five PhD chemical analysts who prepare
and analyze samples, maintain cutting edge analytical capabilities, and develop methods as needed to respond
to new environmental challenges. Most analytical measurements are performed using the Core’s extensive
capabilities in mass spectrometry, which includes gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods for identification and quantitation of organic
contaminants, as well as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) for quantification of metals.
The Facility Core staff are highly experienced researchers who work with investigators on experimental design,
appropriate sample collection methods, customization of existing assays, and development of unique assays.
Following analyses, CAD assists with data interpretation and review of quality assurance and quality control.
CAD works closely with the CEED Translational Research Support Core, the Community Engagement Core and
the Research Cores to ensure that samples are prepared appropriately for analysis. CAD also offers training in
mass spectrometry to CEED members, students and postdocs, enabling them to run their own assays with
supervision from Core staff. During the current grant period, the Core has analyzed over 16,000 samples from
26 different CEED investigators. During the next grant period, CAD will expand and refine existing methods in
multiclass targeted analysis (e.g., endocrine disruptors, PFAS). CAD is also designing new methods based on
non-targeted LC/MS analysis for identification of contaminants in environmental samples, as well exposomic
approaches for hazard assessment. Additionally, CAD is developing laser ablation ICP/MS methods for use in
spatial and temporal quantitation of metals (e.g., teeth, tissue samples, and hair). As part of CAD’s role in rapid
response to disasters, core researchers also evaluate, optimize, and validate methods for the use of field ready
sensors and passive samplers. The Core’s combination of expertise, experience, and access to sophisticated
instrumentation provides critical support for CEED research projects that require either routine or state-of-the-
art science capabilities for measuring small molecules and metal contaminants that adversely impact human
health. CAD’s extensive analytic tools will be deployed in partnership with the CEC and community collaborators
to optimize the impact of CEED research and address environmental health concerns in New Jersey and beyond."
10932272,"Project Summary
Uncertainty is an often pervasive, stressful experience that arises when making judgments about others' beliefs,
intentions, or emotions (i.e., ambiguous social situations). Excessive uncertainty can have pernicious effects
upon memory, mood, and physical and mental outcomes. Yet, we understand little of how judgments of social
certainty form over time, the neural circuitry underlying these judgments, and how these judgments meaningfully
differ from non-social uncertainty sources (e.g., calculations, perceptions). Uncertainty is featured in every
developmental stage but adolescents and adults differ in their appraisals of and responses to ambiguity; both
social and non-social. Traditional univariate neuroimaging analyses, which compare average magnitudes of
activation across broad neural regions, are unresponsive to the subtle pattern differences that characterize
complex social cognition. Novel multivariate techniques, such as intersubject correlations (ISC), applied to
dynamic, feature-rich, and ecologically-valid sources of social ambiguity are crucial for understanding
fundamental aspects of social cognition but have not yet been applied to answer these important questions.
F99 Phase: My proposed pre-doctoral project uses a novel study design in which adult participants continuously
rate their certainty of a given social (e.g., a character's innocence or guilt) and non-social (e.g., frame luminance)
outcome while observing long-form narrative video stimuli (i.e., 45 min crime drama) during fMRI. This yields a
continuous time course of concurrently-recorded neural and behavioral data which can be analyzed via ISC to
determine the neural circuitry commonly implicated in uncertainty judgment formation among normative adult
populations. Interdomain neural-behavioral synchrony can underscore how social and non-social certainty
judgment formation mechanisms differ. Defining normative adult neural uncertainty responses provides a crucial
comparison to vulnerable populations with pronounced uncertainty responses, including autism spectrum,
anxiety, and mood disorders. Training during this phase includes instruction in computational methods relevant
to the neuroscience of social decision-making and neurodevelopmental theory to prepare for the K00 Phase.
K00 Phase: This phase extends my pre-doctoral research by applying the F99 Phase study design to adolescent
populations. This approach could identify whether adults and adolescents are generally relying on distinct or
similar neural circuitry to assess the same stimuli and inform subjective indicators of uncertainty (i.e., behavioral
ratings). Adolescence is a period marked by intense attention towards social others. The presence of ambiguous
social stressors during this period predicts susceptibility to and severity of anxiety and depression into adulthood.
Thus, how social uncertainty is processed has notable implications for researchers working at any later
developmental stage. The training plan in this phase of the proposal will focus on developing expertise in the
developmental social neuroscience literature, computational methods that can be applied to developmental
social neuroscience research, and mentorship skills to establish a diverse, inclusive independent research lab."
10828575,"Project Summary
This application seeks renewal of funding for an R25 that is building nationwide investigator capacity in
optimization of behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. Multicomponent behavioral and biobehavioral
interventions play a central role across many areas of public health, including but not limited to substance
abuse disorders, HIV, cancer, and diabetes. To date, intervention science has relied primarily on the classical
treatment package approach, in which a set of intervention components is identified a priori, assembled into a
treatment package, and then immediately evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Sole reliance on this
approach has prevented the field from addressing fundamental research questions—e.g., which components
are effective?—that are critical for development of interventions with sustained high public health impact.
Recently an innovative alternative has emerged called the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST, a
broad methodological framework for the principled optimization of interventions, is used to arrive at an
intervention that strategically balances effectiveness against affordability, scalability, and efficiency to ensure
that the intervention is practical to implement and therefore has the potential for sustained high public health
impact. Between 2016 and 2022, annual NIH funding awarded for projects involving intervention optimization
grew more than 450%, from about $30 million to about $144 million. At this writing, NIH has funded at least
245 projects related to MOST. We believe this growth has been enabled in part by the training efforts of the
previous R25. We prepared and placed 2 free comprehensive asynchronous introductory courses on the
Coursera platform, accessed by over 700 learners to date, and developed a synchronous virtual training aimed
at helping investigators gain the skill set they need to write successful funding applications and conduct high-
quality intervention optimization research. By the end of the first R25’s funding we expect more than 150
investigators will have completed our synchronous virtual training. In response to growing demand, we propose
to expand our training, outreach, and support efforts. Aim 1: We will continue to offer synchronous virtual
trainings, and coordinate with compatible existing NIH-sponsored training endeavors. Aim 2: In addition to
updating our existing offerings, we will offer exciting new courses on the Coursera platform. Aim 3: We will
enable investigators working with MOST to share the very latest findings, best practices, on-the-ground
experiences, and tips with each other by offering 12-16 informal webinars per year. Aim 4: We will provide
ongoing consultation, mentorship, support, and outreach for investigators at all career levels. Impact: The
proposed work will increase the number of investigators proficient in and funded for optimization of behavioral
and biobehavioral interventions. These investigators will, in turn, produce interventions that are effective,
readily implementable, and sustainable, i.e., have high public health impact, and thereby improve the nation’s
health in substance abuse, HIV, cancer, diabetes, and countless other important areas."
10829867,"Abstract
We are studying two classes of DNA binding proteins, DNA helicases and single stranded (ss)DNA
binding (SSB) proteins, that are both essential for genome maintenance in all organisms. DNA
helicases are ATP-dependent molecular motors that unwind duplex DNA to form the single stranded
(ss) DNA intermediates required for DNA replication, recombination and repair. SSB proteins bind
tightly to these ssDNA intermediates, protecting the DNA, but also bind directly to at least 17 other SSB
interacting proteins (SIPs) to bring them to their sites of action. Defects in DNA helicases are
responsible for a number of human diseases. We are undertaking quantitative studies of the
mechanisms of DNA unwinding and ssDNA translocation of a multi-subunit DNA helicase/nuclease, E.
coli RecBCD, which functions in repair of DNA double strand breaks and recombination, as well as the
E. coli UvrD and Rep helicases which function in several DNA repair pathways. RecBCD is a hetero-
trimeric complex containing two superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase/translocase motors (RecB, a 3' to 5'
motor and RecD, a 5' to 3' motor). Despite extensive study, the mechanism of helicase DNA
unwinding is not understood. There is also little known about how the two motors communicate within
RecBCD and the allosteric regulation of its motor and nuclease activities by ""chi"". We have discovered
that RecBCD can unwind duplex DNA processively even in the absence of ssDNA translocation by the
canonical RecB and RecD motors indicating that DNA melting and ssDNA translocation are separate
processes. This ability is regulated by its nuclease and arm domains. We are studying UvrD and Rep to
address the question of what is needed to turn a ssDNA translocase into a helicase and how this is
regulated. By accessory proteins such as MutL and PriC. Activation of a helicase is not well understood
process. E. coli SSB protein is a central player in all aspects of DNA metabolism. It can bind ssDNA in
multiple binding modes that differ dramatically in their properties, in particular ssDNA binding
cooperativity. A major focus is on the four intrinsically disordered C-terminal tails of SSB that we have
shown regulate cooperative binding of SSB to ssDNA and control the binding of the 17 SIPs. We have
developed SSB variants that selectively stabilize the different SSB binding modes and that have
different numbers of C-terminal tails and different properties and will determine how these affect protein
binding and DNA replication. An array of approaches, including thermodynamic, transient kinetic,
structural and single molecule approaches (fluorescence and optical tweezers), will be used in these
studies."
10829868,"Summary:
 Mast cell (MC) activation through the aggregation of cell surface IgE receptors (FcεRI) leads to life-
threatening conditions such as anaphylaxis and asthma. Recent exciting development in MC biology has been
the discovery that they express a novel G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) known as MRGPRX2 (mouse
counterpart MrgprB2), which contributes to a growing list of conditions such as pseudoallergy, neurogenic
inflammation, non-histaminergic itch, allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. The main objective of
this proposal is to modulate FcεRI and MrgprB2-mediated responses by targeting novel signaling pathways in
MCs.
 Following their activation, most GPCRs undergo desensitization via their phosphorylation by GPCR
kinases (GRKs) and the recruitment of the adapter proteins, β-arrestins (β-arrs). We made four novel
observations, which provide the basis of this proposal. First, we found that unlike most GPCRs, MRGPRX2 is
resistant to GRK2-mediated desensitization but it contributes to IgE-mediated MC degranulation and cytokine
production. Second, β-arr2 inhibits both IgE and MrgprB2-mediated MC degranulation by modifying unknown
components downstream of Ca2+ mobilization. Third, β-arr2 contributes to MC chemotaxis in vitro and allergic
contact dermatitis in vivo. Fourth, the effect of β-arr2 on MC chemotaxis is associated with Ser3
dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin. While activation of protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ)
promotes MC degranulation, PKCα phosphorylates cofilin at Ser23 and Ser24 to increase actin polymerization,
resulting in cessation of degranulation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that GRK2 promotes IgE-
mediated responses in MCs via the regulation of Syk/Akt/NF-κB signaling but β-arr2 modulates both FcεRI and
MrgprB2 responses by functioning as a scaffolding protein for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cofilin.
In aim 1, we will determine the role of GRK2 on FcεRI-mediated MC degranulation and cytokine generation in
vitro and allergic response in vivo. In aim 2, we will determine the role of β-arr2 on FcεRI and MrgprB2-
resposnes in vitro and inflammatory responses in vivo. Completion of this study may provide better rationale
for the development of novel therapeutics for the MC-mediated disorders."
10829870,"Health issues associated with liver diseases afflict millions of individuals and account for over 70,000 deaths
annually in the United States. Due in part to an aging population, liver diseases are expected to rise
significantly over the next two decades, increasing the need for more effective treatment therapies and
increased success rates with transplants. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments to curb the pathology
and there remains a shortage of available livers for transplantation. This challenge is further compounded with
alloreactive responses leading to transplant rejection. However, a viable solution is the use of a model liver
systems that accurately mimic the biomechanical and biochemical functioning of in vivo liver tissue.
Additionally, alternative methods to expand recipient autologous hepatic cells while maintaining function would
serve as efficient methods to generate liver systems for transplantation. However, while liver models for in vivo
use have been attempted, none have yet successfully expanded autologous hepatic cells in vitro followed by
successful implantation to alleviate liver failure in recipients using an in vivo model system. My laboratory has
recently demonstrated success in this approach, where we have established an effective in vitro 3D hepatocyte
culture system for rapid expansion. Furthermore our preliminary work shows great promise in applying the
system for in vivo adoptive implantation using our innovative in-house designed 3D scaffold system. Therefore,
this proposal's objective is to develop a method for rapid expansion of hepatic cells in a novel 3D printed
bioscaffold for assembly of a liver organoid for in vivo tissue restoration and ex vivo drug screening. The
central hypothesis is that primary hepatic cells seeded in a novel biomaterial scaffold will display similar
metabolic function, structure, and biomechanical properties to that of the original liver tissues. The success of
this approach will restore liver function following transplantation in a liver-damaged mouse model. The
innovative combination of rheological biomaterial tuning, 3D bioprinting, and culture methods that utilize a
novel bioscaffold will be applied in pursuit of two specific aims: 1) Engineering an ex vivo model for screening
therapeutic drugs targeting hepatocytes through 3D printed bioscaffolds and 2) Development of an implantable
hepatic organoid for in vivo tissue restoration to alleviate liver failure in a mouse model. These investigations
will establish a platform for novel 3D culture systems for both rigorous in vitro diagnostic screening and for in
vivo adoptive transfer approaches to physiologically restore failed liver function. The proposed work is
significant as the anticipated results will establish a platform for future investigations utilizing the biomaterial for
engineering cell seeded scaffolds to restore tissue function and in pursuit of drug discovery."
10902045,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for many forms of psychopathology, particularly depression,
anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. Disorders that emerge during this time have lasting consequences, including
elevated risk of recurrence, and poor psychosocial functioning. This vulnerability comes at a time when peer
victimization becomes more common and emotional and physiological responses to peer rejection are elevated,
rendering victimization particularly damaging during adolescence. Despite the strong links between peer
victimization and internalizing problems during adolescence, the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying
this association remain unclear, limiting our ability to prevent the onset of victimization-related psychopathology
in youth. The proposed project will test a novel conceptual model, in which it is proposed that two underlying
dimensions of peer victimization, peer threat (e.g., presence of negative social experiences, like rejection) and
peer deprivation (e.g., absence of positive social experiences, like ostracism) differentially shape neurocognitive
processes and social behaviors that have relevance for psychopathology. Specifically, it is argued that peer
threat influences neurocognitive and behavioral processes in ways that enhance threat detection and processing
(Aim 1), whereas experiences of peer deprivation may contribute to blunted reward sensitivity and low social
motivation (Aim 2). The project will then examine whether neurocognitive and behavioral alterations serve as
mechanisms linking peer victimization with internalizing psychopathology (Aim 3). The proposed research will
test this conceptual model by using a combination of experimental behavioral and fMRI tasks, as well as an
intensive longitudinal design, leveraging advancements in digital phenotyping, computational neuroscience, and
predictive modeling approaches. Critically, by implementing advanced statistical machine learning methods for
predictive modeling, the proposed research may be able to identify patterns of real-world social behavior that
are influenced by victimization and, in turn, predict the emergence of psychopathology. Identifying developmental
processes that are disrupted following peer victimization and ultimately lead to psychopathology is a necessary
first step in developing targeted intervention approaches. This award will also provide the candidate, who has a
strong background in developmental social neuroscience and clinical science, with critical training in the
implementation of digital phenotyping, computational modeling, and advanced statistical techniques to promote
a successful transition to an independent research career."

The female reproductive tract (FRT) microbiome consists of all microbes within that space, including the
bacteriome and the virome, which is comprised of the phageome (bacteriophages) and eukaryotic viruses. Low
diversity Lactobacillus-dominant bacteriomes play a pivotal protective role in maintaining women’s health,
including preventing pre-term birth, bacterial vaginosis (BV), yeast infections, and sexually transmitted infections.
However, shifts to high diversity FRT bacteriomes, such as in BV, result in increased FRT inflammation, and
consequent increased risk of symptomatic BV, pre-term birth, and STIs including HIV. Bacteriophages are natural
predators of bacteria and are more numerous and diverse than bacteria and may serve to regulate bacterial
populations. Our prior work showed the FRT bacteriophages form communities which corresponded with FRT
diseases; however, the mechanisms behind bacteriophage contribution to regulating FRT bacterial populations
is largely undetermined. Our main objective is to determine the how these phageome communities contribute to
FRT health by regulating alterations in the bacteriome. In this proposal, we will utilize metagenomic sequencing
on FRT samples from a unique longitudinal cohort comprised of US women living with HIV and AIDS compared
to healthy controls to investigate (Aim 1) the FRT phageome communities over time, (Aim 2) the impact of AIDS
and antiretroviral therapy on the phageome, and (Aim 3) identify predictive taxonomic and metagenomic
biomarkers of shifts to high diversity FRT bacteriomes using bioinformatic knowledge gained during my career
development plan. My long-term career goal is to become an independently funded physician scientist leading
a translational research team to elucidate the virome’s influence on human health and disease and to develop
novel strategies to mitigate disease. My career development plan lays out a detailed strategy to augment my
expertise in computational biology and microbiome biostatistics, with the overall goal to improve my viral and
bacterial metagenomic pipelines, including functional annotation. An improved understanding of bacteriophage-
bacterial interactions in the FRT including biomarkers predictive of pathogenic FRT shifts, will pave the way
toward novel preventative strategies and phage-based therapeutics for FRT diseases including BV and STIs,
thereby improving women’s reproductive health."

People living with HIV (PLWH) are particularly vulnerable to depression, which negatively
affects their quality of life, medication adherence, and even mortality. Nearly 60% of PLWH
suffer from depression, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms of depression in
HIV. Understanding how HIV-associated chronic inflammation interacts with neural mechanisms
to contribute to depression is critical in guiding future treatment efforts. We will test a model of
depression in PLWH in which inflammation contributes to a distinctive pattern of brain network
dysfunction. In a cross-sectional study, we will enroll PLWH who are depressed (n=80) and non-
depressed (n=60), and HIV- subjects who are depressed (n=80) and non-depressed (n=60).
We will address several significant knowledge gaps by Human Connectome Project protocols to
implement resting-state fMRI to measure functional connectivity and task-based fMRI to probe
Negative Valence Domain and emotion regulation networks. We will also measure peripheral
inflammatory markers and NF-κB (an upstream regulator of expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines) to assess inflammation. Measures of tryptophan catabolism will also be considered
as mediators of the effects of inflammation on depression. These data will elucidate how HIV
status, inflammation, and depression interact with critical brain networks to identify potential
biomarkers and treatment targets."
10855844,"ABSTRACT
The cardiac and pulmonary systems are inherently linked through the pulmonary vascular system which leads
to secondary pulmonary disease in cases of cardiac pathology. This is especially the case in congenital heart
disease where the pulmonary blood supply is often substantially altered by abnormal outflow tracts and
ventricular formation. Cross-sectional imaging has proven to be invaluable for assessing pediatric diseases,
including congenital heart disease; however, current cardiopulmonary evaluations typically require multiple
exams (SPECT, echo, MRI, and CT) to evaluate the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Each exam adds
risk to already fragile patients, introduces complex logistics of performing multiple exams, and can delay care of
patients who may require urgent management. Often, only a subset of exams are performed, and clinical
management is based on incomplete information and disregards the strong potential for cardiopulmonary
coupling. In this project, we aim to develop MRI methods that can simultaneously and efficiently evaluate both
anatomy and function in pediatric cardiopulmonary diseases. MRI is theoretically well suited for quantitatively
imaging both the cardiac and respiratory systems but is traditionally challenged by its slow imaging speed and
sensitivity to artifacts. Recently, our group has proposed methods for dramatically more robust lung imaging
using the combination of ultrashort echo time MRI with advanced motion corrected reconstruction strategies. In
this proposal, we extend these techniques and introduce novel methods to provide improved and comprehensive
diagnostics of the entire cardiopulmonary system. First, we introduce a free-running approach to
cardiopulmonary imaging to provide anatomical imaging and the quantifications of ventilation, perfusion, cardiac
function, and respiratory resolved cardiac flow dynamics. We specifically aim to image continuously with T1
weighted and velocity encoded sequences, and subsequently reconstruct this data with a high-dimensional deep
learning approach. The reconstructions use novel motion corrected methods to directly estimate images and
apply deep learning in a highly compressed space. Secondly, we aim to develop next-generation motion
management using an RF navigator technique, Beat Pilot Tone, that can be applied during any pulse sequence
to measure bulk, respiratory and cardiac motion. Beat Pilot Tone provides a basis for motion tracking that enables
improved imaging efficiency, a simplified setup without cardiac leads or respiratory belts, and much better
measures of bulk motion. These techniques will be evaluated in normal control participants and pediatric subjects
with congenital heart disease, each with comparisons to state-of-the-art imaging. The impact of this project is to
shift the paradigm for clinical management of cardiopulmonary diseases to a single-scan comprehensive imaging
study and supporting an integrated assessment of interaction between the pulmonary and cardiac systems in
disease. While this is targeted at pediatric cardiopulmonary diseases, the innovations can be applied broadly to
MRI studies throughout age ranges and to other studies that suffer from motion artifacts throughout the body."

Individuals with coexisting COPD and bronchiectasis have worse lung function, longer hospital stays, and an
increased risk of death. Bronchiectasis, a pathologic airway enlargement, is increasingly recognized in the US,
with 522,000 adults treated annually for bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is also a relevant abnormality in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affecting up to 72% of these individuals. While the development of
advanced imaging methods has facilitated our understanding of COPD progression, a critical factor hampering
our ability to examine bronchiectasis progression fully is the lack of an objective imaging tool applicable in large
studies.
In this proposal, we will use objective, automated, artificial intelligence-based computed tomography (CT)
measures of bronchiectasis. Our overarching hypotheses are 1) our artificial intelligence-based CT measures
are effective in detecting bronchiectasis changes in smoking populations and determining its clinical
consequences; 2) our approach of defining proteomic biomarkers will help identify subjects at risk of structural
progression, and ultimately, inform clinical care. We will quantify the extent of enlarged airways, a measure of
bronchiectasis, on baseline and follow-up chest CT scans from smoking individuals participating in two well
characterized cohorts, the COPDGene and Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate
End-points (ECLIPSE). In Aim 1, we will determine the association between pulmonary vascular changes and
longitudinal measures of radiographic bronchiectasis, gaining insight into pathogenesis. In Aim 2a, we will
determine changes in artificial intelligence-based CT measures of bronchiectasis and their association with
clinical measures of disease and lung-function trajectories; in Aim 2b, we will also determine clinical factors and
imaging features associated with the development and worsening of bronchiectasis on CT. In Aim 3, we will
determine blood-based proteomic biomarkers to identify bronchiectasis and its progression on CT.
This study will validate the effectiveness of our new AI-based imaging tool for determining bronchiectasis
progression; and proteomic biomarkers to identify subjects at risk of progression, which will inform the
development of new intervention strategies."

Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Metabolic and Mechanical Determinants of Reserve Cardiac Power
Output
Abstract:
Exercise capacity, a central factor in determining quality of life in healthy aging as well as
cardiovascular disease, is determined by a systems-level interaction of factors that are intrinsic to the
heart and myocardium and factors that are extrinsic to the heart. Cardiac intrinsic factors include the
metabolic power supply and mechanical pumping power of the myocardium. Extrinsic factors include
the capacity of the peripheral vasculature to vasodilate in response to increasing demands of exercising
musculature and the autonomic chemo- and baroreflexes. The overarching goals of this proposal are to
capture and test hypotheses on the mechanisms that determine physiological limitations to cardiac
power and output reserve and contribute to diminished left-ventricular power output (LVPO) and
exercise intolerance in heart failure (HF). The research plan uses a computational modeling approach
to simulate whole-body cardiovascular function, driven by a multi-scale model of myocardial
metabolism and mechanics, to analyze data from a battery of phenotyping assessments applied to
healthy control subjects and heart failure patients. The first aim of this proposal is to develop and refine
the multi-scale framework for simulating whole-body exercise and cardiac energetics and mechanics in
humans. This platform will be applied to integrate individual-specific data for testing and refinement of
hypotheses in Aims 2 and 3. Subject-specific model parameterization will be used to: (1.) assess the
relative contributions of cardiac intrinsic versus peripheral factors in limiting exercise capacity in heart
healthy control and failure subjects; (2.) test the hypothesis that the capacity of the myocardium to do
mechanical work is limited by its capacity to maintain ATP and its hydrolysis products ADP and Pi at
concentrations needed to support contraction and relaxation; and (3.) test the hypothesis that in
patients with impaired capacity to maintain these concentrations at physiological levels, this impairment
is causally linked to a diminished capacity of the myocardium to do mechanical work."
10858890,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), caused by deficiency of RNA binding protein Fragile X Messenger
Ribonucleoprotein 1 protein (FMRP), encoded by X-linked FMR1 gene, is the most common
heritable cause of intellectual disability and a top contributor to autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
The mechanisms underlying FXS are not fully clear. Our knowledge of FMRP functions in the
mammalian brain are mostly obtained from rodent studies. However, there are significant
differences between primate and rodent brains, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where
FMRP is highly expressed. PFC is critical for myriad higher-order brain functions, such as working
memory, planning, decision-making, language, and creative intelligence, which are severely
affected in FXS. Primate PFC is significantly larger proportionally and much more complex
compared to other species and exhibit gene signatures unique to primates. To date, clinical trials
based on rodent models have not achieved primary endpoints highlighting a critical need for
complementary primate models to better understand FXS. FMRP binds many mRNAs in the brain.
An established role of FMRP is that it promotes neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis during
postnatal development,. On the other hand, FMRP is also robustly expressed in human and
mouse cortex during prenatal development and its deficiency affects mouse cortical development.
In contrast to its well-established role in postnatal brain development and function, the role of
FMRP in prenatal brain development is not well studied, especially in primates. In addition,
Developmental stage-specific roles of FMRP have not been fully investigated and primate-specific
targets of FMRP have not been systematically identified. The goal of this project is to investigate
functions of FMRP in primate prenatal brain development and unveil developmental stage-specific
roles of FMRP in primate brains. We will test the hypothesis that FMRP regulates genes critical
for functional maturation of PFC neurons, and its deficiency leads to altered gene expression and
impaired cortical development. We determine the impact of FMRP-deficiency on gene expression
changes that impair neuronal maturation during primate prenatal development using Patch-seq.
We will identify FMRP-mRNAs and FMRP-protein interactomes in the PFC that regulate primate
brain development using CLIP-seq and Co-IP-mass spectrometry, respectively. The proposed
work will fill a major gap of our knowledge in understanding function of FMRP in primate brain
development. Such understanding is critical for better therapeutic development for FXS as well
as other neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD."

Abstract
Expanding the cadre of well-trained researchers committed to addressing the complex underlying drivers of
health disparities within the United States is an urgent priority. In particular, more researchers from health
disparity populations are needed to improve our capacity to cultivate new insights into the root causes of health
disparities and to identify innovative, culturally relevant solutions. The purpose of the Investigator Development
Core (IDC) is to support the overall goals of FIU-RCMI by fostering and promoting health disparities research
with mentorship, training, and research opportunities for early-stage investigators (ESIs), particularly those
from populations underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, population, and clinical research workforce.
For the proposed renewal application, the IDC will build on and improve its established pilot project and
mentoring program for promising ESIs to help enhance their career development. The IDC will provide ESIs a
three-phase support system, comprised of Pre-Pilot, Pilot Project, and Post-Pilot phases with the
accompanying 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Annually recruit and establish a cohort of promising ESIs (Pre-Pilot
Phase) by: a) providing health disparities research and grant writing training; b) soliciting R03-like health
disparities-focused pilot applications; c) providing a rigorous NIH-like peer-review process, in which all
applicants receive constructive feedback; d) providing ongoing grant writing support for unfunded applicants;
and e) evaluating the application and peer-review process for equity and transparency. Aim 2. Provide
multifaceted support to each cohort of ESIs during the implementation of their 1-2 year pilot project (Pilot
Phase) by: a) assisting each cohort in navigating university research procedures and implementation
challenges; b) ensuring all projects comply with applicable Federal research policies, laws, and regulations; c)
monitoring the progress of all projects; d) supporting each ESI in pilot research outputs of peer-reviewed
publications, presentations, and grant proposals; and e) providing Monthly Cohort Meetings with a professional
development curriculum. Aim 3. Provide a mentoring program for ESIs (Pre-Pilot, Pilot Project and Post-Pilot
Phases) by: a) assisting ESIs with identifying potential mentors and providing them with training about
establishing and maintaining mentoring relationships; b) providing mentors with mentorship and related
training; and c) monitoring mentoring team effectiveness. The mentoring program will be open to all ESIs
interested in health disparities research. By the end of the five-year period, the program will result in a
minimum of 100 ESIs – from a wide variety of academic and research backgrounds – who will have benefited
from participating in the trainings, mentorship, and support provided by the IDC. Between 17-20 of these 100
ESIs will receive pilot funding and have successfully completed their pilot projects. All ESIs will receive health
disparities, mentoring, and grant writing training to help bolster and prepare the next cadre of well-trained,
committed researchers to combat and address health disparities in the United States."
10850556,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: CORE B
The Clinical Core (Core B) will be responsible for providing the human tissues necessary for completion of
the Aims of Projects 1–3 and the Human Validation Core (Core C). The availability of tissues from ALS
patients and controls is essential for better defining the relevance of data generated from animal and in vitro
disease models. With a focus on ALS related to the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (c9ALS), Core
B will collect, bank and distribute cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), skin and/or blood samples for induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cell generation, and postmortem tissue from deeply phenotyped c9ALS patients, as well as patients
with sporadic ALS (sALS). Importantly, to investigate changes in biomarkers that reflect the transition from the
presymatomatic to the symptomatic phase of disease, we will seek out asymptomatic carriers of the C9orf72
repeat expansion, identified from family members of c9ALS patients, to be followed longitudinally. We will also
pursue postmortem tissue collections from patients who were studied during life, which will allow for the high
value comparison of data from brain and spinal cord tissue with spinal fluid and iPS cells. In addition to new
patients and samples generated during the course of this P01 program project, Core B will act as the
“clearinghouse” for samples already banked at our respective institutions (Emory, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville,
Massachusetts General Hospital, and Johns Hopkins), and from our collaborators at the NIH and the Target
ALS Foundation. Core B will maintain a database of available tissues for distribution to Project and Core
investigators. Project PIs will request biofluids and tissue samples from Core B, and Core B will identify
appropriate sources and facilitate sample shipments. Note that each participating institution retains its own
IRB-approved protocols for collecting patient data and biological samples, and banks all biospecimens locally.
Thus, Core B will act as a central coordination core that will maintain a database and arrange for distribution of
patient tissue samples at each institution."
10850562,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3
A major hurdle to identifying disease mechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the heterogeneous
nature of the disease. People with ALS exhibit a wide variety of clinical presentations, rates of progression and
underlying genetic risk factors. ALS is more likely a syndrome rather than a single disease that leads to a
recognizable clinical phenotype that we call ALS. Our approach to unraveling the pathophysiology of ALS is to
focus on a specific genetically-defined population where the disease is defined by a common underlying
mechanism. Here, people carrying the C9orf72 G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation (c9ALS) are
the genetically defined population. As opposed to sporadic ALS (sALS), where an array of genetic,
environmental, and unknown factors drive disease, a common disease-causing pathophysiology underlies
c9ALS. The proposition is that investigating this relatively homogenous ALS genetic subgroup will provide a
window of opportunity for understanding disease mechanisms and developing treatments. The hope is that
discoveries in this smaller group of patients will be applicable to the larger ALS population. In this project, we
will use next generation mass spectroscopy and systems biology analysis to discover biomarkers of disease
pathways and progression. In Specific Aim 1, we will interrogate human motor cortex from c9ALS and sALS
patients to generate proteomic networks and modules that define c9ALS. In Specific Aim 2, we will partner
with the investigators of Project 1 to define proteomic networks in a C9orf72 G4C2 mouse model; this will allow
us to analyze proteomic changes in brain at several time points during disease progression. In addition,
proteomic analysis of brains from mice treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting G4C2
transcripts will allow for the identification of protein signatures associated with a disease-modifying drug. In
Specific Aim 3, proteomic signatures common to both human and mouse disease will be targeted in CSF
samples from c9ALS patients and asymptomatic C9orf72 expansion carriers, both in cross sectional and
longitudinal analyses. The ultimate goal of this project is the discovery of novel biomarkers of disease
pathways and progression that will be important for ongoing research into disease pathogenesis and also for
future clinical trials."
10856797,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer in the US and the 4th most common cancer in males. Each
year, more than 80,000 people in the US are diagnosed with bladder cancer and over 17,000 will die. The vast
majority (74%) present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). NMIBC has the oldest median age
at diagnosis, intensive surveillance requirements, high recurrence and progression rates (up to 80%), and one
of the greatest lifetime treatment costs of all cancers. Treatment options following recurrence of high-grade
NMIBC include either BST (bladder sparing therapies with significant risk of cancer recurrence and/or
progression) or radical cystectomy (a life-altering bladder removal surgery with substantial short-term morbidity
and mortality). However, patients, their caregivers, and clinicians must make this complex treatment decision
based on limited evidence since bladder cancer research remains underfunded relative to other common
cancers, bladder cancer epidemiology cohorts are uncommon, RCTs have proven challenging to conduct, and
risk stratification models are inadequate. Thus, there is a critical need for high-quality research in recurrent
high-grade NMIBC across the full spectrum of outcomes to inform treatment decision-making. A recently
established and unique cohort can be leveraged to address these evidence gaps. Specifically, the PCORI-
funded Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) Study is a large
pragmatic multisite study of patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC patients who have selected BST or
radical cystectomy to manage their cancer. The CISTO cohort is a unique resource in bladder cancer care and
has potential to serve as the foundation for addressing critical questions relevant to optimal patient-centered
management. However, longer-term follow up of the CISTO cohort is required to fully assess the comparative
effectiveness and harms of management options for recurrent high-grade NMIBC. In addition, incorporating
molecular factors associated with bladder cancer progression has the potential to improve clinical staging and
augment risk prediction models. Finally, the financial impact of new BST options is an important consideration
for patients with what is already one of the most expensive types of cancer to treat. Therefore, we propose the
BEST CARE for Recurrent NMIBC study 1) To compare long-term outcomes (clinical and patient-
reported) between patients undergoing BST or radical cystectomy, 2) To determine whether prediction
of progression to muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer is improved by molecular staging, and
3) To evaluate the impact of newly approved BST options on financial toxicity. We aim to fill substantial
knowledge gaps about long-term oncologic and quality of life (QOL) outcomes, specifically addressing the
continued role of radical cystectomy. If radical cystectomy is associated with better long-term clinical
outcomes, less financial hardship, and similar long-term QOL as BST, in the context of additional information
offered through molecular staging, this would be impactful to clinical NMIBC practice."

ACCESS: Advancing Contraceptive Equity and Service Uptake through Telemedicine in the US
Safety-Net, 2019-2025
Unintended pregnancy is a key indicator of health inequity in the US. Unintended pregnancy rates are
decreasing overall in the US, but disparities are widening, with unintended pregnancy becoming more
concentrated among adolescents, women of color, and women living in poverty. Access to contraceptive
services for low-income and other marginalized identities is central to reducing inequities in
unintended pregnancy. Telemedicine (TM), has the potential to expand access to care, but widespread
use of TM for contraceptive care was limited prior to the COVID19 pandemic. The publicly funded family
planning “safety net” system of Community Health Centers (CHCs) is a critical provider of family planning
services to historically marginalized populations; however, existing evidence about use of TM for
contraceptive services in the US safety net system is limited. This proposal directly addresses this gap.
We leverage individual-level clinical data - real world health IT - from a common electronic health record
across a national network of CHCS and rigorous multilevel analytic methods to document use of TM compared
with face-to-face visits for contraceptive services. Aim 1. Assess whether there is a differential uptake of
the use of TM for contraceptive services across community health centers (CHCs). We will focus on key
populations (e.g., adolescents, uninsured, Latinas, Black women, rural), clinic characteristics (e.g., Title X
status), community-level SDH factors (e.g., social and economic conditions, computer and broadband access),
and state factors (e.g., Medicaid expansion) to identify differential uptake in the use of TM (versus face-to-face
visits) for contraceptive services for low-income populations. Aim 2. Quantify inequities or unintended
consequences of TM utilization for individuals and the health system. We will identify disparities in use of
long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods (which require an in-clinic visit), method switching at one
year, and no-show rates and cancellations by visit modality (TM versus in-person). Aim 3. Understand patient
experience of care and preferences for contraceptive services via TM versus in-person. We will conduct
semi-structured interviews with patients who receive contraceptive care at CHCs to understand their
experiences with TM, barriers and facilitators to receiving contraceptive services through TM versus in-person
care, and contextual factors that impact their ability to access contraception through TM versus in-person care."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, with a 5-year
survival rate of only 60%. The poor disease outcome associated with CRC highlights an urgent need to
understand the cellular mechanisms that influence initiation and progression of CRC. Several of the
well-known genetic drivers of CRC such as KRas and PIK3CA are dominant regulators of metabolic
reprogramming during cancer progression. Altered tumor metabolism facilitates generation of
molecules important for cell growth, signaling, and survival; yet, our knowledge of the precise
mechanisms that regulate metabolism and survival in chemotherapy resistant CRC remains incomplete.
One family of proteins important in coordinating metabolism with cellular survival and stress responses
is the NAD+-dependent sirtuin superfamily. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the loss of a
mitochondrial localized sirtuin, SIRT4, occurs in CRC and results in the reprogramming of nucleotide
biosynthesis to shift metabolites away from salvage nucleotide metabolism and upregulate de novo
nucleotide biosynthesis. We hypothesize this metabolic switch contributes to increased CRC cell
proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Our proposal will test this hypothesis in two
complementary, but independent Aims. First, using a biochemical approach, Aim 1 will examine the
mechanism by which SIRT4-mediated metabolic reprogramming increases cell proliferation by
examining SIRT4 activity and substrates. We will also examine the role of the metabolic by-products
downstream of SIRT4-mediated activity. Next, Aim 2 will test the consequence of clinically relevant
SIRT4 loss in physiological models of CRC using organoids, novel genetically engineered mouse
models, and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Finally, we will examine the consequences of
SIRT4 loss on CRC metabolism and chemotherapy resistance in vivo. This project will provide an
unprecedented map of metabolic reprogramming in CRC at a single cell level and improve
understanding of how CRC metabolism changes in the context of chemotherapy resistance, opening
the door for development of novel therapeutic strategies that leverage mitochondrial metabolism to treat
chemotherapy resistant cancers."

The current pain killer crisis, fueled by the overuse of opioids to manage chronic inflammatory pain, urges the
development of non-addictive pain relief medications. Local injection of drugs, at the site of injury, is one way
to circumvent adverse drug reactions, including diversion potential. For example, injection of corticosteroids
into arthritic joints is one of the mainstay therapeutic approaches to treat arthritic pain, circumventing opioid
use. However, recent studies have put into question their efficacy and point to potential long-term deleterious
effects of steroid therapy for arthritis. Thus, we require further identification of analgesic targets specifically at
nociceptive peripheral terminals, i.e. local targets. We have recently identified the adaptin 2 alpha 2 subunit
Ap2A2 and nociceptor endocytosis as promising targets for pain reduction in recoverable acute and chronic
animal pain models. We showed that AP2A2 binds to KNa channels to cause their internalization and
precipitate dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal hyperexcitability after protein kinase A stimulation. The AP2A2
subunit localized to CGRP+/IB4- nociceptors. Genetically knocking down AP2A2 or locally inhibiting
endocytosis with a lipidated decoy peptide provided prolonged reductions in pain behaviors in mouse and rats
during inflammatory pain. We showed that nociceptor endocytosis was required for both the development and
maintenance of inflammatory pain. Our exciting new preliminary data indicates that the AP2A2 subunit
localizes to large dense core vesicles and are transported down axons where the AP2A2 subunit eventually
finds residence at peripheral terminals. The first Aim of this study is to further understand the subcellular
localization of AP2A2 and other members of the AP2 complex in peptidergic nociceptors. We will also study
their expression during chronic pain. In the second Aim, we will test the contribution of AP2A2 and nociceptor
endocytosis to pain in a non-recoverable inflammatory pain model: the monoiodoacetate-induced osteoarthritic
pain model. We will use a genetic knockdown approach and intraarticular injection of our lipidated AP2 inhibitor
peptide to study the consequences of nociceptor endocytosis inhibition on pain behaviors. Maintenance of
inflammatory pain has been shown to be dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. We had previously
shown that Slack KNa channels constitutively associate with the 14-3-3 family of proteins in DRG neurons. Our
preliminary data indicates that 14-3-3 zeta causes PKC-dependent Slack KNa channel internalization. In Aim 3
we will test the hypothesis that 14-3-3 proteins confer additional endocytotic motifs to KNa channels important
for inflammatory signaling. We will use a novel lipidated 14-3-3 uncoupler peptide to study KNa channel
trafficking in DRG neurons and pain behavior. Positive outcomes should establish the central role of nociceptor
endocytosis to inflammatory pain and reveal druggable targets."

focuses on the specifics of research in implementation, technology, clinical care, etc. We do that, of course, but
we also integrate the synergistic research skills and orientations needed for biomedical informatics to move our
discipline beyond its current entanglements. In contrast, our department (now 7.5 years old) fits perfectly with
the ethos and focus of the NLM’s research training goals. We also realize that our location in a depressed area
offers us the obligation, opportunity, and privilege to recruit and train scholars so often excluded from this field.
They stay in familiar settings, and bring their insights to others. Also, our affiliated scholars, researchers,
practitioners, and linked institutes joins with us to train and inspire our students. We enable students to use
research to understand and improve the field--analyzing the complex interactions of workflow, evaluation,
CDS, usability, ethics, big data, clinical research, bioinformatics and patient care–researching biomedical

efficiency and medical knowledge. Our PhD program is comprised of core courses, required additional courses
in 1 of the 5 concentrations (“selectives”), and at least 17 credits of electives. In addition to didactic and lab
courses, all students are involved in extensive research, practicums, workshops, presentations, mock IRBs
and ethics reviews, EHR laboratories, patient safety and quality rounds, and human factors training. Because
of students’ varying expertise, we build in flexibility to reflect pedagogic requirements while ensuring mastery of
necessary knowledge, skills, judgment in our mentoring of students. Biomedical informatics continues to
frustrate, despite (or because of) its extraordinary promises. Only committed and skilled researchers can help
us close this gap; enabling our field to achieve what is so needed. We are so excited to continue and build on
our training program. We seek to create the researcher-leaders informatics needs, deserves and has wanted.
Biomedical informatics can fulfil its promise if wise and well-trained researchers guide our unbiased
evaluations, policies, applications, and research agendas. The UB T15 program’s trainees have published over
118 peer reviewed manuscripts, been awarded 4 NIH grants, and 10 are now in postdoctoral fellowships or

 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of non-heritable, preventable
mental disability, occurring in almost 5% of births in the U.S. There is no known cure for FASD, and its
mechanisms remain unclear. A wide range of cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments have been
reported in FASD, including deficits in behaviors related to the cerebellum. These changes in behavior may arise
from ethanol's effects on the cellular level. The sole output of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, as well as microglia,
the immune cells of the Central Nervous System, are both impacted by developmental ethanol exposure.
Reduced numbers of both neurons and microglia, as well as alterations in Purkinje cell excitability and firing have
been reported. After developmental ethanol exposure, microglia display a phenotype associated with immune
activation and release pro-inflammatory factors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists
can block this immune activation and have been shown to attenuate some of the inflammatory responses in
microglia and reduce Purkinje cell loss in rodents. This suggests that microglia may be a therapeutic target in
FASD. Microglia are known to shape neuronal circuit development and connectivity in the cerebellum, which is
linked to microglial structural dynamics. How ethanol affects these dynamics and how that impacts microglia-
Purkinje cell interactions is unknown. Additionally, it is not yet known when these changes occur and how they
are maintained or progressively altered into adulthood. Elucidating how ethanol-induced changes in microglia
mediate some of the pathological changes in cerebellar Purkinje cells may be critical for understanding the onset
of FASD pathology. Furthermore, modulating microglial survival and activity during ethanol exposure through a
PPAR-γ agonist may provide some answers and potential therapies for these diseases. Thus, I hypothesize that
ethanol induces neuroimmune changes in cerebellar microglia that alter their dynamics and interactions with
Purkinje cells, and reducing microglia-mediated inflammation through a PPAR-γ agonist mitigates the
pathological effects of ethanol. To test this hypothesis, I will pursue two aims using a mouse model of FASD.
The first will investigate how developmental ethanol and a PPAR-γ agonist affects microglial phenotype over
time using in vivo two-photon imaging of microglial dynamics, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real time
PCR. The second will determine if Purkinje cell and microglia interactions are affected throughout life by
developmental ethanol exposure and PPAR-γ agonist administration with two-photon imaging,
immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. These experiments will elucidate the effects of cerebellar
microglia on Purkinje cells in the cerebellum after developmental ethanol exposure and assess microglia as a
potential target to mitigate disease pathology in a mouse model of FASD."
10856086,"ABSTRACT
In the era of precision oncology, more patients are living longer with advanced cancer, yet many of the new
strategies require years of fatiguing treatment. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment
for fatigue in early-stage cancer, for advanced cancer a recent Cochrane meta-analysis found few trials and
“very low-quality evidence” for its enduring benefit on fatigue at follow-up. It is also unknown if addressing fatigue
improves adherence to cancer treatment. Finally, given that advanced cancer typically requires ongoing
treatment, it is more realistic to reduce the negative interference of fatigue with quality of life (“fatigue
interference”) than to eliminate fatigue itself. Thus, fully powered trials of promising interventions for fatigue
interference are critically needed to improve outcomes in advanced cancer survivors. Ovarian cancer represents
an ideal context to test such interventions as most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and, after initial
treatment, are prescribed oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for 2-3 years. PARP inhibitors,
which are increasingly used to treat other cancers, cause life-interfering fatigue in nearly half of patients (relative
to placebo). To address these limitations, we developed, refined, and piloted REVITALIZE – a telehealth
intervention to address fatigue interference among patients with advanced ovarian cancer taking PARP
inhibitors. Based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a CBT variant well-matched to the context of
advanced cancer, REVITALIZE has patients identify and reduce contributors to fatigue beyond PARP inhibitors,
clarify and align their behavior with their values, and use active acceptance strategies to reduce fatigue
interference in daily life. In a pilot randomized trial (N=44), relative to enhanced usual care (EUC), REVITALIZE
reduced fatigue interference at 12-week follow-up, p=.008, by a large effect; improved fatigue severity, self-
efficacy, and catastrophizing, and quality of life; and led to fewer dose delays and reductions. We propose to
conduct a fully-powered, randomized controlled trial that includes adherence outcomes and longer follow-up
across both community and academic cancer clinics that serve diverse communities, comparing REVITALIZE to
EUC (N=240) assessed at baseline, mid-intervention (to assess mechanisms), post-intervention, and 4- and 6-
month follow-up. Aims are (1) To evaluate REVITALIZE vs. EUC effects on fatigue interference (primary
outcome), fatigue severity, self-efficacy, and catastrophizing, and quality of life (secondary outcomes); (2) To
assess the effect of REVITALIZE vs. EUC on objective PARP inhibitor monthly adherence, dose interruptions
and reductions, and persistence using Wisepill medication monitoring devices and chart review; (3) To assess
the theory-driven mechanisms of REVITALIZE–active acceptance and alignment of behavior with values–by
examining mediators of REVITALIZE effects compared to EUC. If efficacious, REVITALIZE will provide a
scalable telehealth intervention to improve survivorship in advanced ovarian cancer, that can be readily adapted
to address fatigue among the growing community of advanced cancer survivors."

Although amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the current criteria for pathologic diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s Diseases (AD), only 9% of clinically diagnosed AD patients have ""pure"" AD pathology and most AD
cases have mixed pathologies, which significantly increase the odds of dementia . Because diverse intra- and
extracellular pathologies and stressors contribute to AD progression, it is essential to track how they affect the
various cell types of the brain by cataloging cell-type-specific transcriptomic responses to both intra- and
extracellular pathologies in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, this proposal aims to measure the effects of multiple
pathologies on each cell type in their native environment, then make this information actionable by
computationally identifying the drivers of these effects and testing them in human cell models. To this end, we
propose two approaches to simultaneously measure the cell transcriptomes and multiple pathologies in
millions of individual cells in their native context. The first approach, “pathology-indexing scRNA-seq,” is
designed for intracellular pathologies. It combines single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with a set of oligo-
barcoded antibodies against intracellular pathologies. This approach enables us to simultaneously measure
gene expression and multiple intracellular pathologies all in the same cell. The second approach, “pathology
spatial transcriptomics,” is designed for extracellular pathologies. It obtains gene expression of 1~10 cells (55-
μM resolution) in spatial registration with extracellular pathology. This enables us to quantify the effects of
extracellular pathologies and microenvironment on cell disease states. We will apply these two innovative
sequencing technologies to two brain regions, the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of
postmortem brains of deeply-phenotyped ROSMAP participants. Using univariate, systems biology, and deep
learning computational methods, we will identify candidate genes that drive cell-type-specific disease states.
To test predicted early driver genes and provide therapeutic targets, we will conduct CRISPR screens in
human cortical cell models derived from control and AD isogenic iPSC lines. Collectively, our study will shed
important light on the cell-type-specific driver genes in AD pathogenesis, define molecular pathways leading to
cell disease-states, and provide experimentally validated targets for preventing the disease-state transition
during early AD development."

In recent years, major advances in patient care in gastroenterology and hepatology have largely been driven by the application of translationally-oriented research employing animal models and human subjects. Increasingly, cross-pollination of basic and clinical research approaches is producing novel insights into gastrointestinal (GI) and liver biology as well as disease pathogenesis. The over-arching goal of this Training Grant (TG) is to prepare outstanding post-doctoral MD, MD/PhD and PhD researchers for successful and impactful careers in translational gastroenterology and hepatology. The Training Program (TP) emphasizes work at the interface between basic biology and translational medicine in order to fill important gaps in knowledge and develop effective therapeutics. The TP incorporates core goals of embracing diversity, equity and inclusivity at all stages: candidacy outreach, applicant and mentor selection, retention and oversight of trainees, and selected invited speakers. The TP is built upon the strengths of a highly experienced group of 20 NIH-supported trainee-focused mentors (8 from Pediatrics, 9 from Internal Medicine, and 3 from other Departments). The mentor pool consists of 10 of whom are primarily basic researchers, 4 principally clinical researchers, and 6 whose research portfolios are split evenly between basic and clinical research. Since many adult GI and liver diseases have origins in childhood that often continue through life, mentors from both adult and pediatric subspecialties are included. This TG application focuses efforts on enrolling 2 post-doctoral Trainees (MD, MD/PhD or PhD) each year. Trainees develop expertise and provide feedback as digestive health researchers under the oversight and guidance of the TP Executive Committee and mentors, integrating Internal and External Advisory Board input.

Obesity affects 42% of the U.S. population and is a major risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer.
Obese colorectal cancer patients have a five-fold increased risk of death compared to normal weight
counterparts. However, the mechanisms by which obesity increases colorectal cancer progression and
metastasis are poorly understood, which limits the development of effective prevention and treatment
strategies for colorectal cancer in obese individuals. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are initiated by loss
of the tumor suppressor gene Apc in colonic stem cells, and subsequent activation of the Wnt signaling
pathway. Wnt signaling is also required for maintenance of advanced colorectal cancers and metastases.
Research from our group demonstrates that diet-induced obesity markedly upregulates Wnt signaling in
intestinal and colonic stem cells by promoting a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-d)
transcriptional program, which in turn increases cancer development. These findings suggest that inhibition of
Wnt signaling is a highly attractive therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated colorectal cancer. We and others
have demonstrated that colon tumors are maintained by Lgr5+ cancer stem cells, and single cell RNA
sequencing data from our lab shows that these cells are Wnt-active, while non-cancer stem cells are Wnt-low.
However, development of Wnt inhibitors to treat Apc-deficient cancers or to target cancer stem cells has
proven elusive. Rac1-GTP, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, is an intracellular transducer that
promotes Wnt signaling by mediating nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Prex1 is a Rac-specific Rho
GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Rac1 by facilitating the exchange of GTP to GTP.
We found that Prex1 and active Rac1-GTP are highly enriched in intestines and colon cancers of mice treated
with high fat diet or an agonist of PPAR-d. Loss of Rac1 signaling markedly reduces intestinal tumor initiation
by inhibiting Wnt activation. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanisms of Wnt activation in colorectal
cancer and to develop new treatment strategies for this disease. Here, we hypothesize that Prex1-dependent
Rac1-GTP activity mediates obesity-induced tumorigenesis by inducing Wnt signaling in Lgr5+ cancer stem
cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of Prex1 signaling in high fat diet and PPAR-d-mediated intestinal
stem cell regeneration and tumor initiation. In Aim 2, we will determine the function of the Prex1 / Rac1-GTP
signaling axis in high fat diet and PPAR-d-dependent colorectal cancer stem cell function. In Aim 3, we will
identify the role of PPAR-d transcriptional targets in colorectal cancer stem cell function in the setting of diet-
induced obesity. The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms by which obesity-induced Wnt signaling
promotes colorectal cancer progression. Our studies will provide preclinical rationale for clinical trials to test
Rac1-GTP inhibitors for the treatment of colorectal cancer, particularly in obese individuals, by inhibiting Wnt
signaling."
10827960,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sound pressure produces force across the mammalian cochlear partition, ultimately creating a vibratory
traveling wave that propagates longitudinally up the cochlear duct. The key feature distinguishing this process
from the non-mammalian cochlea is amplification, whereby forces produced by thousands of outer hair cells
(OHCs) sharpen and amplify the traveling wave. Our overarching objective is to understand how the complex
biomechanics of the 3D multi-cellular and acellular arrangement that form the organ of Corti work together to
create cochlear amplification. Specifically, we will determine how this process, which stems from the broadly-
tuned basilar membrane, creates sharp frequency tuning and high sensitivity. This question is significant on a
basic science level because these biophysical processes underlie the ability to hear sounds just above the
Brownian motion of molecules in air with an exquisite frequency resolution. This question remains unsolved
and is clinically important because hearing loss is typically due to loss of cochlear amplification. Our central
hypothesis is that, beyond the broad tuning provided by basilar membrane mechanics, the forces produced by
OHCs are also tuned by additional mechanisms. In aim 1, we will use 3D Volumetric Optical Coherence
Tomography and Vibrometry (VOCTV) in mice to test whether the forces produced by OHCs are tuned by the
mechanics of the supporting cells and acellular structures that form the organ of Corti. In aim 2, we will use 1D
VOCTV in awake behaving mice to test whether cochlear amplification is modulated by brain state via the
medial olivocochlear efferent (MOC) system by varying OHC force production. Together, these data will be
interpreted so as to test our hypothesis. If our hypothesis is true, sharply-tuned differential motion within the
organ of Corti is necessary to generate the sensitivity and sharp tuning of the mammalian cochlea and brain
state modulates cochlear amplification via the MOC efferent system."
10825394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application proposes a customized research training plan designed to promote the development of the
applicant into an independent investigator. The plan includes advanced training in laboratory experimentation,
along with tailored professional and career development opportunities. The training plan is supported by the
outstanding availability of local and institutional resources at UIC. The proposed research will investigate the
role of extracellular vesicles in mediating endothelial cell-fibroblast communication in the healing wound. In
human skin, the process of wound repair involves angiogenesis, which includes the creation and then pruning
of vessels. Simultaneously, fibroblasts in the wound are responsible for the deposition of the extracellular
matrix components that surround the new vasculature. The goal of the proposed studies is to examine how
endothelial cells communicate with surrounding fibroblasts in the wound. Several previous studies demonstrate
that these two cell types may utilize paracrine methods of communication to influence or enhance their
functional roles, but how this intercellular interaction occurs is largely unknown. One potential mechanism by
which endothelial cells might communicate with fibroblasts is through extracellular vesicles and their microRNA
cargo. Recent studies in our lab have shown that fibroblasts treated with extracellular vesicles from endothelial
cells exhibit significant transcriptomic changes. Based on this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that in
the healing wound, endothelial cells secrete extracellular vesicles that influence the function of resident
fibroblasts. The research plan utilizes methods for extracellular vesicle purification and application, traditional
in vitro and in vivo wound healing assays, and advanced bioinformatics techniques to study extracellular
vesicle-mediated communication between these two cells types. Aim 1 will determine how fibroblast
phenotypes are altered by endothelial cell extracellular vesicle treatment, and will examine the role of cargo
microRNAs in the observed changes. In vitro studies will elucidate the effect of endothelial cell extracellular
vesicle treatment on the fibroblast transcriptome and key fibroblast functions, such as collagen contraction,
deposition, and proliferation. Aim 2 will evaluate how endothelial cell extracellular vesicles affect fibroblast
phenotypes in the wound in vivo using a splinted murine skin wound model. The effect of extracellular vesicle
treatment will be examined for multiple parameters of healing, including collagen content and architecture,
myofibroblast activation, angiogenesis, and wound closure. Finally, single cell-RNA sequencing of wound
fibroblasts will be used to determine how endothelial cell extracellular vesicle uptake modifies the fibroblast
transcriptional profile. Together, the aims will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which
endothelial cells might modulate fibroblast function, and may lead to the development of novel therapies to
treat wounds or various skin and fibrotic diseases."
10826442,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death due to infectious disease worldwide and is notoriously
difficult to treat. This is partially due to the emergence of drug-tolerant populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb), the causative agent of TB. Drug tolerance, defined as a non-heritable phenotypic state of reduced growth
induced by stressors such as antibiotic treatment, differs from drug resistance, which is permanent and heritable.
The transient nature of drug tolerant populations provides a major barrier to identifying drug targets that kill Mtb.
Our lab identified a key glycerol kinase gene (glpK) as a major determinant of drug tolerance in Mtb driven by
reversible mutations in a homopolymeric region. These mutants are found in clinical samples and are associated
with poor clinical outcomes. Identifying novel drug targets against these clinically significant glpK mutants may
significantly improve the outcomes of TB treatment. However, little is known about the bacterial and host factors
that confer drug tolerance to glpK mutants in vivo. To study this clinically important phenotype, we generated a
H37RV glpK strain with a permanent drug tolerant phenotype. We found that glpK strain mimics classic
phenotypes of drug tolerant Mtb; glpK strain forms small colony variants, exhibits drug tolerance, overexpresses
genes related to dormancy, differentially expresses carbon metabolism genes, and accumulates intracellular
lipids. Given that glpK strain lacks a functional glycerol kinase, it is likely that glpK strain depends on carbon
sources other than glycerol for drug tolerance. However, most experiments are performed in glycerol-containing
media. As drug tolerance in Mtb is often associated with cholesterol accumulation and Mtb persistence requires
host cholesterol, we selected this biologically relevant condition to test the role of lipid metabolism on drug
tolerance in glpK strain. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that macrophage infection can induce glpK
strain drug tolerance, but not all macrophage environments are equally likely to have a high drug tolerance
induction phenotype. We hypothesize that drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis glpK mutants is
connected to alterations in lipid metabolism, which occur in vitro as well as in infected macrophages.
The goal of this project is to identify new drug targets in Mtb glpK mutants under biologically significant conditions
to improve translatability and unlock novel therapeutics that enhance the overall efficacy of TB treatment. To
identify novel drug targets under biologically significant conditions, we propose two models: a cholesterol-
containing media model (Aim 1) and a macrophage infection model (Aim 2). We will probe the essentiality of
relevant genetic pathways and genes within Mtb that are required for drug tolerance and then use specific
macrophage mutants as well as a library of genetically diverse macrophages to study how specific host
environments as well as a variable host genetic background affect bacterial drug tolerance. Together, these
studies will identify within pathogen, within host, and host-pathogen interactions, including genetic and metabolic
cross-talk, that regulate Mtb survival and drug tolerance, leading to novel drug targets against drug tolerant Mtb."
10827039,"Abstract
The maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis relies on the tight regulation of cell growth and proliferation.
This regulation is predominantly controlled by two evolutionarily conserved pathways: the mammalian Target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the Hippo pathway. Dysregulation of both the mTOR and Hippo pathways
promotes aberrant cell proliferation, tissue overgrowth and tumor development. Elucidating how the mTOR and
Hippo signaling pathways coordinate their activities is therefore a vitally important, yet poorly understood, area
of cell cancer biology. Our lab previously demonstrated that STK25, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as an
upstream activator of Hippo signaling to limit cell growth. Using unbiased approaches, we have now generated
strong preliminary data suggesting that the STK25 kinase also functions to impair mTORC1 signaling. We have
found that that genetic depletion of STK25 leads to both mTORC1 pathway activation and Hippo pathway
inactivation. These data suggest that STK25 may play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor
suppression by coordinating the activities of both the mTORC1 and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the
mechanism by which STK25 regulates mTORC1 is unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that STK25
directly regulates and phosphorylates key regulatory components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, ultimately
attenuating mTOR signaling. Further, our preliminary studies of STK25 knockout in mice demonstrate that
conditional depletion of STK25 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, which is congruent with bioinformatic
evidence that STK25 is significantly focally deleted in a variety of human cancers. Combining this with our in
vitro findings, we also hypothesize that STK25 deficient tumors are dependent on YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1
activity for growth and survival. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cell
biological and biochemical approaches to mechanistically define the role of STK25 kinase in regulating mTORC1
activity by characterizing its direct phosphorylated substrates. In Aim 2, we will use a conditional STK25 knockout
mouse that we have already generated to determine if STK25 loss facilitates tumorigenesis through increased
YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1 activity. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of
mTORC1 and Hippo signaling, and reveal significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving tumor
development. Moreover, the proposed training plan will greatly enhance my repertoire of skills in microscopy and
imaging techniques, molecular cell biology, mouse cancer studies and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis. Altogether, this will facilitate the development of my scientific expertise in the fields of
mTOR and Hippo signaling in cancer biology required for success as an independent scientist."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapies with lentiviral or CRISPR based gene modification are
demonstrating favorable safety profiles and remarkable efficacy to treat severe monogenic blood disorders with
unmet clinical need, including X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (X-SCID) and Sickle Cell Disease
(SCD), with feasibility of rapid progress from target discovery and preclinical validation to first-in-human trials.
Despite these successes, the technologies and procedures used in these trials require complex ex vivo bespoke
manufacturing of autologous cell products, are expensive and difficult to scale to treat many patients, and
intrinsically associated with significant risks related to ex vivo manipulation, myeloablative chemotherapy and
bone marrow transplantation. We here propose a novel technology platform based on alpha-retroviral vectors
that shares many of the advantages with the currently dominating delivery platform, lentiviral vectors, but has
increased flexibility to deliver diverse therapeutic payloads, including non-integrating Cas9-based genome
editors, high potential for in vivo gene delivery, and compatibility with scalable production systems. The long-
term goal of our proposal is to further develop this platform for the delivery of gene therapy payloads (integrating
DNA and Cas9/base editor ribonucleoprotein complexes into HSCs in vivo to enable simple, more economical
and widespread application of gene therapies to serve diverse patient populations. A shorter term goal is to
employ the same technology for improved ex vivo delivery of gene therapy payloads to HSCs. Our central
hypothesis is that a single platform based on alpha-retroviral vectors is suitable for ex vivo and in vivo delivery
of genetic therapies with diverse requirements in terms of the type of therapeutic payload and targeting
specificity. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that both integrating vectors and non-integrating
genome editors can be delivered into HSC ex vivo and in vivo. Here, we will capitalize on these results and
further expand the reach of these innovative genetic engineering tools with the objectives to: i) develop
integrating vectors to deliver a curative transgene to HSCs in vivo as a modality to treat X-SCID; ii) engineer
virus-like particles for the delivery of Cas9 into quiescent HSC with minimal toxicity both ex vivo and in vivo to
treat SCD; and iii) to modify virus-like particles for the transfer of base editors into HSCs for correction of the
common mutation underlying the bone marrow failure disorder Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. The alpha-
retroviral based viral particle technology will be used to develop treatments for this exemplary group of diseases
and is also intended to address key general shortcomings of current GT approaches and could be readily
transferable to many other monogenic diseases."
10856389,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a leading cause of female infertility worldwide. The syndrome is diagnosed
by ovarian symptoms, including cystic ovaries, disrupted or absent menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism.
However, changes in the brain play a significant role in the development of PCOS. Under normal conditions,
neurons in the hypothalamus release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile manner to elicit the
secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. LH pulses act at the ovary to control
folliculogenesis and steroid hormone release. Ovarian steroid hormones, in turn, act back in the brain through
an afferent network to suppress GnRH secretion in a homeostatic negative feedback loop. In women with PCOS,
the ability of steroid hormones to suppress the frequency of pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion is impaired, leading to
ovarian dysfunction. The neuronal population with a diminished response to steroid hormone feedback is
currently unknown. However, cells that express Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, and Dynorphin peptides, termed KNDy
cells, are a promising candidate as they are hypothesized to play a role in steroid hormone feedback and
demonstrate synchronized episodes of activity that generate GnRH/LH pulses. Our recent research using a
mouse model of PCOS induced using prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure demonstrated that KNDy cells have
lower expression of receptors required for steroid hormone feedback and a significant reduction in synaptic
innervation by GABAergic afferent networks. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that increased GnRH/LH
pulse frequency in PCOS is mediated by changes in the regulation of KNDy cells by steroid hormones and
afferent networks. To investigate this, our first aim will use in vivo calcium imaging, which permits the visualization
of individual cell activity within a population of neurons in freely behaving mice, to define if increased LH pulse
frequency in PNA mice is associated with an impaired ability of estradiol and progesterone to suppress KNDy
cell activity. Our second aim will identify the origin of reduced GABAergic afferent input to KNDy cells using
retrograde monosynaptic rabies-mediated tract tracing. We will then define how a loss in GABAergic afferent
input functionally impacts KNDy cell activity by combining in vivo calcium imaging of KNDy cells in fertile mice
whilst optogenetically manipulating the activity of apposing GABAergic axon terminals. Finally, we will use
chronic chemogenetic inhibition of KNDy cells to determine if exogenously regulating KNDy cell-mediated
GnRH/LH pulse generation is sufficient to override neuroendocrine dysfunction in PNA mice and restore
reproductive capacity. Together, this research will greatly improve our understanding of how GnRH pulse
generation is regulated, both in individuals who are healthy and in those who develop PCOS. As there are
ongoing clinical studies aiming to reduce synchronized KNDy cell activity in PCOS patients, such as through the
use of pharmaceutical antagonists against the neurokinin B receptor, this research may offer valuable information
to guide the development of treatments targeting central dysfunction in the syndrome."
10827869,"Project Abstract
The in-utero environment, including maternal weight gain and exercise habits, can “program” a child towards
disease or health after birth and into adulthood. The often-intergenerational cycle of obesity begins with a
significant number of women who are overweight or obese (OW/OB) at the time of conception and throughout
pregnancy; these women are more likely to give birth to infants who are macrosomic. By age 5, overweight (OW)
children already have signs of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risks (e.g. obesity,
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension). While research has demonstrated benefits
of both aerobic and resistance exercise for pregnant women as well as decreased adiposity and improved
motor/heart function in their infants, no studies have been done to determine which exercise modes are most
beneficial for mother and baby when a woman is overweight or obese at the time of conception. For adults in
general, combined aerobic and resistance exercise (AERE) delivers the greatest metabolic improvements (e.g.
increased insulin sensitivity, improved heart function, decreased adiposity). Therefore, the purpose of this study
is to identify which prenatal exercise type(s) will elicit the greatest positive impact on maternal and infant health
while reducing metabolic risk markers in OW/OB pregnant women relative to non-exercising counterparts. Using
a randomized design, 284 pregnant women will undergo an exercise intervention (AE, RE, AERE) from
enrollment (~13-16 weeks gestation) until delivery (~40 weeks gestation). The central hypothesis of this study is
that adding RE improves outcomes; thus, the COMBINATION of aerobic and resistance exercise not only will
improve infant cardiometabolic health outcomes, as compared to AE alone, but will have the best compliance of
all groups. We will test this hypothesis with two specific aims to: (1) Determine the influence of different exercise
modes during OW/OB pregnancy on infant cardiometabolic health and growth trajectories; and (2) Determine
the most effective exercise mode in OW/OB pregnancy on improving maternal cardiometabolic health. Methods
will include measurements such as weight, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, lipids, and other
biomarkers for both mothers and infants. The study will also track maternal and infant cardiometabolic outcomes
through the post-partum period, up to 12 months. This work has the potential to impact clinical practice by
revealing the earliest and most effective intervention to reduce the intergenerational cycle of metabolic
dysfunction, including obesity, in women and children.

10827872,"Ultrastructural studies of human patient brains with prion disease have revealed the accumulation
of misfolded PrP within dystrophic neurites inside endolysosomes. Other complex structures co-
exist within these dystrophies and are now considered common features of prion pathologies,
including autophagic vacuole-like membrane-bound organelles, lysosomal electron-dense
bodies, and enlarged endolysosomes. The mechanisms leading to the formation of these
structures remain unknown. Our studies have identified an endolysosomal pathway in mammalian
neurons that we call axonal rapid endosomal sorting and transport-dependent aggregation
(ARESTA), that drives the formation of neurotoxic axonal aggregates of a misfolded mutant prion
protein (PrP) inside endo-membrane structures that we call “endoggresomes”. The long-term goal
of this proposal is to characterize the endocytic pathways that play a role in the pathophysiology
of prion diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, and of Alzheimer’s disease related dementias, that will
provide actionable targets for their pharmacological treatment. The objectives of this proposal are
(i) to determine the generality of the ARESTA pathway in formation of endoggresomes in axons
of neurons expressing various familial PrP mutations, and to characterize the molecular and
ultrastructural architecture of neurotoxic endoggresomes; (ii) to determine the mechanisms of
mutant PrP endoggresome-mediated axonal impairments; and (iii) to determine how the
endolysosomal ARESTA pathway modulates the formation of axonal mutant PrP aggregates in
vivo. The central hypotheses are (i) ARESTA drives the formation of endoggresomes in various
familial prion diseases by interactions with co-factors within endocytic routes; (ii) mutant PrP
endoggresome-induced pathologies act as axonotoxicity hubs that inhibit neuronal function by
impairing local axonal cytoskeletal-organelle interactions, and (iii) endolysosomal pathways
modulate the formation and pathology of mutant PrP aggregates in vivo. The proposed research
is innovative because it provides a conceptual framework for developing models that include novel
endolysosomal pathway-mediated mechanisms to explain how intra-axonal aggregates form and
impair neuronal function in the prionopathies. The proposed research is significant because it
identifies the endocytic pathway and specifically ARESTA and endoggresomes, as anti-
aggregation targets for therapies to inhibit aggregate formation and reverse related pathologies.
As amyloid-b peptides, tau, and most proteins that misfold in neurodegeneration transit within
endocytic routes at some point in their processing routes, our findings are expected to be relevant
to Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias."

to multidisciplinary HIV care. VA Video Connect (VVC), a VA-supported mobile health video technology that
allows Veterans and providers to complete clinical visits from any remote location including the home, has the
potential to transform delivery of multidisciplinary care for HIV and other chronic conditions by increasing
access to care. VA leadership wants 5% of Veterans to receive care via VVC in FY2018, but less than 0.1% of
Veterans with HIV have used VVC. VVC could help fill these gaps in care.
Specific Aims: The aims are: Aim 1-Clinical Effectiveness: To determine the effectiveness of VVC-delivered,
multidisciplinary HIV care compared to routine care on retention in care. Aim 2-Implementation: To conduct a
mixed-methods formative evaluation to refine and evaluate our implementation facilitation (IF) strategy to
improve the reach of VVC-delivered HIV care, increase provider and Veteran adoption, and determine potential
for sustainability. Exploratory Aim: To assess the implementation potential of VVC- delivered HIV care across 6
diverse VHA settings and identify contextually specific barriers and facilitators to adoption.
Significance to Veterans’ Health: The VA is one of the largest providers of HIV care in the US, and improving
retention in care and HIV suppression is associated with improved survival with HIV.
Priority areas: Improving access to care, modernization of VA, healthcare equity and health disparities.
Innovation: While VVC is gaining a foothold in mental health care, it has not been widely used in specialty
medical care. We will determine if multidisciplinary care delivered by VVC can improve retention in care and
clinical outcomes for vulnerable Veterans in need of specialty medical care. The research will provide models
and evidence for a transformative solution to increase Veterans' access to multidisciplinary care.
Methodology: Aim 1 will be achieved with a pragmatic, Hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation study
within the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center infectious diseases clinic, which cares for nearly 1000
Veterans with HIV. We will deploy an IF strategy to facilitate uptake of VVC and randomize Veterans to either
be offered or not offered VVC. The study will enroll 360 Veterans and is powered to detect a 12% absolute
improvement in retention in care, the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include adherence to
antiretroviral therapy, HIV suppression, and safety measures. Guided by the RE-AIM QuEST framework, Aim 2
layers a mixed-method evaluation on top of the effectiveness trial, enrolling 40 Veteran participants and
numerous staff in in-depth interviews at all phases of the trial. The Exploratory Aim will be conducted working
with 6 diverse VA HIV clinics and includes assessing organizational readiness, deploying the IF strategy,
conducting in-depth interviews, and assessing reach and adoption of VVC in these clinics.
Expected Results: We hypothesize that VVC will improve engagement and clinical outcomes and be
acceptable to patients and providers. We will generate extremely valuable data and experience on
implementation of VVC outside mental health care, regardless of impact on HIV care, and identify IF strategies
that could be used in later implementation of VVC.
Next Steps: If successful, we will work with partners to disseminate and implement VVC for multi-disciplinary
HIV care throughout VA. We will also foster work in other chronic medical conditions. Our results could lead to
accelerated uptake of VVC, improved access to care, and improved health for many Veterans."

There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of how mitochondria homeostasis contributes to immune re-
sponses to infectious pathogens. The overall objective of this proposal is to define how the tripartite motif con-
taining protein TRIM14 regulates STAT3 activity to modulate mitochondria health and innate immune outcomes
during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Recent studies have shown that TRIM14 negatively regulates
type I IFN responses during Mtb infection through interactions with the cytosolic DNA sensing kinase TBK1 and
the transcription factor STAT3. Specifically, TRIM14 was shown to be required for TBK1 phosphorylation of
STAT3 at S727, which controls STAT3’s ability to translocate to the nucleus and turn on expression of negative
regulators of IFNAR to dampen type I IFN responses. Interestingly, additional studies of Trim14-/- macrophages
demonstrated several mitochondrial-related defects, including altered metabolic profiles during Mtb infection and
a propensity to undergo intrinsic apoptosis. STAT3 is a classical transcription factor, but recent studies have
highlighted its role in mitochondrial respiration, generation of reactive oxygen species, and maintaining mito-
chondrial membrane potential. These connections prompted interest into how this novel TRIM14-TBK1-STAT3
axis influences mitochondrial health and how disruption of this pathway impacts innate immune responses to the
intracellular bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis
that TRIM14 is a critical player in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial network by directing TBK1 phos-
phorylation of STAT3 and promoting STAT3 accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix. Aim 1 of this proposal will
define how TRIM14 alters TBK1’s ability to phosphorylate STAT3 and how STAT3 phosphorylation alters its
subcellular localization. Aim 2 will investigate how TRIM14 and STAT3 control mitochondria depolarization and
apoptosis during Mtb infection. Aim 3 will investigate how TRIM14’s regulation of mitochondria metabolism,
apoptosis, and changes to innate immune cell populations alter the outcome of Mtb infection in a mouse model
of disease. This work will further fundamental understanding of how the TRIM14-TBK1-STAT3 axis regulates
mitochondria health, which may inform novel therapeutic interventions that could help control Mtb and improve
tuberculosis patient outcomes."

Monogenic variants were once thought to be fully penetrant (all carriers will have disease) and have high
expressivity (carriers will have a severe phenotype). However, increased accessibility to sequencing has
shown that many monogenic variant carriers are asymptomatic or have milder than expected phenotypes. The
factors that affect incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are unknown. Our preliminary data has
shown that common genetic background variants and the specific monogenic variant carried affects
penetrance and expressivity within the 200,000 exome release in UK Biobank. Our results show that carrier
polygenic risk scores are predictive of carrier phenotype, and that common genetic variants may be interacting
with monogenic genes to affect phenotype. We also show in our preliminary results that protein language
scores are able to differentiate variants of uncertain significance into loss-of-function (LOF), gain-of-function
(GOF), and benign categories. We propose to study how common genetic background and the specific
monogenic variant carried affects penetrance and expressivity in a more diverse patient population by
collaborating with biobanks across the nation, including the Colorado Center of Personalized Medicine at the
University of Colorado under guidance of Dr. Chris Gignoux and the BioMe biobank at Mt. Sinai under the
guidance of Dr. Eimear Kenny. In Aim 1, we will understand how common genetic background affects
penetrance and expressivity. We will apply polygenic risk scores to predict the phenotype of carriers to
understand how common genetic variants affect phenotypes, outside of the causal monogenic variant itself
(Aim 1.1). We will also run RHE-mc to detect if gene-by-gene interactions between common variants and the
monogenic gene affect phenotype (Aim 1.2). Because genetics research has been primarily focused on
studying patients of European ancestry, we aim to make our results accessible to patients of all genetic
ancestries by comparing our results of Aim 1.1 and 1.2 across all patients in these diverse biobanks (Aim 1.3).
We will also study how differing monogenic variants have differing penetrance and expressivity by applying
ESM1b protein language scores in Aim 2. We will apply these ESM1b scores to first classify missense variants
of unknown significance in carriers within these biobanks as LOF, GOF, and benign in Aim 2.1. Further, we will
also prioritize which monogenic missense variants have the highest impact on phenotype for carriers of
multiple missense variants in these biobanks (Aim 2.2). Our findings will not only provide more understanding
behind the factors that influence penetrance and expressivity, but also have potential to be applied
translationally to identify which monogenic carriers will need more aggressive treatment for their phenotype."

 Nucleus-forming bacteriophages (phages) are a recently discovered class of lytic phages that protect
their genome by encapsulating it in a nucleus-like protein shell (phage nucleus). The goal of the proposed
research is to determine whether the unique properties of nucleus-forming phages make them advantageous
therapies for human Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. ΦKZ and ΦPA3 are nucleus-forming phages that
infect P. aeruginosa and demonstrate the ability to selectively localize proteins to their phage nucleus and
exclude others, including DNA-targeting bacterial phage defense proteins. Preliminary data show that ΦKZ
gp69 is a conserved protein in P. aeruginosa nucleus-forming phages and plays a key role in mediating
selective protein trafficking into the phage nucleus. This research will determine the structure of gp69 in
complex with other nuclear shell-associated proteins, the mechanism by which gp69 mediates protein transport
into the phage nucleus, and other factors that facilitate transport into the phage nucleus. Furthermore, this
research will determine the motifs that signal a protein to be imported into the phage nucleus, how those motifs
differ between P. aeruginosa infecting phage, and the competitive advantages selective protein import imparts
on nucleus-forming phages. Lastly, resistance to phages is known to select for costly evolutionary trade-offs in
the host bacterium. This research will determine how pathogenicity and antibiotic sensitivity are altered in P.
aeruginosa resistant to nucleus-forming phages. Together, the results of this study will provide crucial
information for the development of nucleus-forming phage therapeutics."

The relationship between alcohol use (AU) and aggression (AGG) is widely recognized. In fact,
epidemiologic data demonstrate that 40% of individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the
community display clinically significant levels of AGG. Moreover, aggression frequency in
individuals with AUD+AGG increases as overall alcohol consumption increases, making alcohol-
facilitated aggression a major public health threat. While the relationship between AUD and AGG
may be bidirectional, our data indicate that more than 90% of those with AUD+AGG report the
onset of problematic aggression before the onset of problematic drinking. As such, premorbid
AGG represents a risk factor for the development and maintenance of problematic drinking. In
addition, experimental studies suggest that alcohol increases aggression primarily in those who
are already aggressive. To date, the literature contains little treatment research in those with
AUD+AGG. More importantly, AUD treatments, in general, minimally focus on treating AGG in
AUD, including considering it an optional element of care. Fortunately, full cognitive behavioral
treatments for AGG exist, notably CRCST (Cognitive Restructuring, Relaxation and Coping Skills
Training) which we have shown has good efficacy in reducing aggression in those with AGG. In
addition, based on our work in aggression, we posit that individuals with AUD+AGG constitute an
important subgroup of those with AUD and that this comorbidity (AUD+AGG) represents a target
for a personalized medicine approach for AUD. At this time, we have developed a provisional
Integrated CBT manual containing the most critical elements for treating AUD and for treating
AGG. In this R34 project, we will refine our Integrated CBT-AUD+AGG Treatment Manual in a
small study in patients with AUD+AGG and then conduct a pilot RCT comparing this integrated
CBT AUD+AGG intervention with CBT-AUD Alone (from Project MATCH). The goal of this study
is to obtain acceptability, feasibility, and effect size data, which will be used inform the next steps
in this program of research (e.g., a large scale clinical trial)."
10825680,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodegenerative disease (ND) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the progressive loss
of specific neural clusters within the central nervous system (CNS). Mitochondrial dysfunction and branched-
chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism have been linked to loss of CNS structure and function, hallmarks of ND
pathogenesis. However, the precise sequence of events leading to metabolic-induced neurodegeneration is
unknown. Growing evidence suggests chronic accumulation of BCAAs is pathogenic due to their pivotal role in
modulating the cerebral metabolism of glutamate. Recently, it was discovered that knockdown of BCAT1, a
crucial enzyme in the BCAA degradation pathway, is sufficient to induce widespread dopaminergic cell death
and motor impairment. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial respiration is required for BCAT1 neurotoxicity
through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage, indicating an alternative mechanism between
disease etiology and metabolic dysfunction in disease. Our lab has recently identified pathogenic biallelic
missense variants in BCAT1 in a pediatric neurodegeneration patient. The mechanisms underlying abnormal
BCAA metabolism and BCAT1-associated neurotoxicity in ND pathogenesis have yet to be investigated. In this
study, human BCAT1 will be directly tested for its ability to induce neurodegeneration in vitro. I hypothesize that
loss of BCAT1 function disrupts BCAA catabolism and increases mitochondrial respiration to promote
neuronal degeneration through ROS-mediated oxidative damage. Using a combined model approach of
lentiviral RNAi-mediated and CRISPR/cas9 BCAT1 knockdown in differentiated neurons (B1N) and human-
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (B1hiPSC-dN), I will address this hypothesis and define the
mechanism of a novel pediatric neurodegenerative disorder in the following specific aims. In Aim 1A, I will test
if BCAT1 deficiency contributes to neuropathology by quantifying the presence of neurodegeneration in
mammalian neurons B1N and B1hiPSC-dN. To investigate the impact of BCAT1 downregulation on BCAA
catabolism, in Aim 1B, I will measure the accumulation of BCAAs and identify metabolic alterations in B1N and
B1hiPSC-dN using high-throughput metabolomic analyses. In Aim 2, I will assess whether BCAT1 deficiency is
sufficient to induce ROS-mediated oxidative damage. If so, this will further support a novel metabolic mechanism
underlying neuronal degeneration and suggest common therapeutic avenues. The findings from these aims will
provide the first in vitro investigation into the role of BCAT1 in ND pathogenesis and BCAA accumulation toxicity
in vitro, with significant implications for defining mitochondrial dysfunction disease mechanisms. As there is no
effective treatment available for neurodegeneration, understanding the metabolic contributions to disease
pathology will help to better inform future therapeutic interventions."
10825805,"AAV-mediated gene replacement is a powerful approach to treat genetically defined disease. It is often believed
that there is a straightforward path to the clinic once gene replacement efficacy is shown in preclinical models.
However, major obstacles limit safe and effective gene therapy for many diseases, particularly in systemically
delivered contexts. Some diseases are not yet tractable because therapeutic gene expression in one tissue
might be toxic in another, or because the therapeutic window of cargo expression is too narrow to safely
administer. Toxicity in liver and dorsal root ganglia have been observed in several gene therapies, regardless of
capsid or cargo. More versatile, fined-tuned, and self-regulated gene expression cassettes are required for safer
and more effective gene therapies. Many approaches exist to regulate gene therapy cargoes, including synthetic
promoters and tissue-specific microRNA binding sites. However, despite the ubiquity of RNA processing in the
genome, few efforts have incorporated alternative splicing into gene therapies. In Aim 1, we will leverage tissue-
specific splicing patterns to generate cargoes facilitating expression in certain tissues but not others. In a first
example, we will use develop methods to restrict cargo expression to skeletal muscle and de-target the heart.
We have already incorporated muscle-specific exons not expressed in heart into AAV and tested their activity in
vivo; we will further optimize these cassettes by testing hundreds of splice site and cis-element motif variations.
In a second example, we will identify and test exons that de-target liver and dorsal root ganglion but preserve
expression in muscle, heart and/or central nervous system tissues. We will individually validate “winner”
cassettes for both examples. We term this approach Tissue-specific Alternative splicing to Restrict Globally
Expressed Therapeutic-AAV (TARGET-AAV). In Aim 2, we will re-purpose naturally occurring auto-regulatory
cassettes to design and test gene therapies that can sense and regulate their own expression levels. We will
use RNA binding proteins mutated in motor neuron disease as test cases, given that RNA binding proteins are
well established to regulate their own expression. We will incorporate intronic miRNAs knocking down the
corresponding endogenous proteins in the same cassette as an auto-regulated, healthy version of the same
RNA binding protein. Similar to Aim 1, we will optimize auto-regulatory behavior by making alterations to intronic
and exonic sequences. We will establish proof-of-concept for this approach in cell culture and in iPSC-based
models of these disease. We call this approach Biologically Regulated Interchangeable Tuneable Elements
(BRITE). Completion of this work will provide guiding principles for the field of gene therapy to incorporate
alternative splicing into gene therapy cargoes."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a public health crisis affecting one third of the US adult population.
NAFLD is an obesity related disease with serious health and quality of life consequences including type 2
diabetes, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Despite serious threats to health and wellbeing,
NAFLD has not received the same attention as other cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. In addition,
NAFLD is often asymptomatic and patients are frequently diagnosed when hepatic steatosis is reported as an
incidental finding on imaging studies or a patient develops advanced liver disease. Our prior work found
hepatic steatosis reported in just under 10% of written radiology reports. Unfortunately, lack of awareness often
leads to hepatic steatosis being overlooked by providers and unreported to patients leading to delays in
diagnosis and referral to specialty care. Our recent survey revealed only 13% of providers always reported this
finding to patients. This project, Improving Diagnostic Safety through STeatosis Identification, Risk
stratification, and Referral pathway in the ED (STIRRED), proposes to improve diagnostic safety by
ensuring that patients receive timely notification of the new finding and referral to follow up care. To date, we
have developed the building blocks for the STIRRED CDSS by employing natural language processing and
machine learning to identify hepatic steatosis in written emergency department (ED) radiology reports and
combine it with common clinical data and comorbidities in the electronic health record to create an
individualized risk profile and follow up recommendations for patients with suspected (NAFLD). Providing risk
stratified appropriate referrals for patients from the ED will increase diagnosis of NAFLD, enable those deemed
high risk for advanced liver disease to receive specialist referral and begin the important process of cancer
screening and intervention to improve steatosis. Communicating this incidental imaging finding and initiating
referral from the ED will enable linkage to care to improve health outcomes and reverse or slow disease
progression for those at all risk levels. While the groundwork for this intervention has been laid, for STIRRED
to be successful, it must be both refined further and implemented thoughtfully. Through Aim 1 and 2, we will
seek to: 1) determine the barriers, facilitators, and additional strategies to implement the STIRRED CDSS, and
2) conduct usability testing of the STIRRED CDSS. Upon finalizing the optimized STIRRED CDSS and
implementation plan, we seek to: 3) evaluate STIRRED across a large health system. This work will be led by
a team of experienced researchers with expertise in clinical trials, risk communication, patient communication,
diagnostic uncertainty, hepatic steatosis and NAFLD, incidental findings, implementation science, and health
services research. Completion of these aims will result in tools to improve care transitions and diagnostic
safety for patients with hepatic steatosis and suspected NAFLD. Findings will inform future work to implement
STIRRED in EDs nationally and develop ED-based interventions for patients with suspected NAFLD."

Internally administered targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) with radio-labeled molecules that deliver cytotoxic
radiation to tumor has been successfully used to treat multiple cancers. Despite promising results, there is much
room to improve the durable response and survival rates achieved with TRT. TRT is ideally suited for the
theranostic approach to treatment because emission imaging performed before initiating a treatment cycle can
be used to predict the absorbed doses (ADs) that will be delivered. Thus, the activity needed for a therapeutic
effect on tumor while keeping critical organ toxicities at an acceptable level can be planned on an individualized
basis. While precise treatment planning is routinely used in external beam radiotherapy, in TRT however,
treatment with fixed or weight-based activities without consideration of delivered ADs continues to be the
standard of care. The main barrier to dosimetry guided personalization of TRT is the lack of dosimetry tools that
are valid yet practical for the clinic environment. To improve this situation the objective is to develop, validate
and bring to the clinic a platform for patient-specific dosimetry-driven treatment planning that is practical for
clinical use and adaptable to various TRTs. The proposed system will integrate a toolbox for SPECT/CT imaging
based voxel-level dosimetry with end-to-end testing (Aim 1), validated protocols for reducing the imaging burden
associated with patient specific dosimetry (Aim 2), robust dose – outcome models that include clinical factors
and imaging biomarkers as covariates (Aim 2), and an interactive user interface that the clinician can use to plan
the therapy considering dosimetric and clinical factors and the resulting efficacy/toxicity trade-off (Aim 3). The
system integrates new components that will be developed exploiting recent advances such as learning-based
methods for low-count SPECT reconstruction and efficient image segmentation atop our existing foundation that
includes a previously developed fast Monte Carlo dosimetry code. The collaboration with an industry partner with
a track record in translating innovative tools for medical image analysis will help ensure clinical translation of the
system. To demonstrate the capacity of the tools developed, patient studies will focus on 177Lu DOTATATE
treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. This recently approved therapy is administered in four cycles with fixed
activity although there is a unique opportunity to perform SPECT imaging-based lesion/organ dosimetry after
each cycle to plan the next cycle. The system can be adapted to therapies with other radionuclides and targeting
agents that can benefit from SPECT/CT imaging based planning such as radioligand therapy with 177Lu PSMA
for prostate cancer and emerging therapies with alpha emitters. The proposed system integrates adaptations of
tools developed in the past by both teams and new tools to bring a new capacity to the end user to effectively
plan TRT with all data handling conveniently performed within one platform. This will have a significant positive
impact because a personalized dosimetry guided approach to TRT is likely to substantially improve efficacy while
maintaining low toxicity, compared with the current arbitrary ‘one dose fits all’ approach."

The Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (CEED) at Rutgers University is a recognized leader in
New Jersey (NJ) - the most densely populated state in the Union, with many of its residents living in close
proximity to major congested roadways, and industrial and commercial centers. NJ is also the home of more
Superfund sites than any other state due to a long history of poorly regulated industry, as well as active efforts
to identify contamination. Over 85% of the state’s land area is already ‘built-out’ or preserved, meaning there will
soon be no remaining undeveloped land. Thus, NJ is a microcosm that reflects the longstanding and emerging
environmental problems confronting the entire nation. The strategic vision of CEED is to address the
environmental health concerns of all NJ residents by centering our efforts on its most affected populations. We
aim to accomplish our strategic vision by engaging community members, organizations, and agencies as
advisors and partners through all stages of our research, providing critical investment and infrastructure for
multidisciplinary collaborative research, and training the next generation of environmental health scientists. Our
approach to achieve this vision is to identify and prioritize the most urgent and hazardous environmental health
concerns of community members through an engaged community advisory board and community-driven
research initiatives that are integrated with the innovative translational research of CEED scientists. Over the
next five years, CEED will confront environmental health-related disease by working with affected communities
at the center of our efforts. Through bidirectional partnerships, rigorous science and training, cutting edge
technologies, and effective communication, CEED will work to reduce health risks and disparities within NJ, and
thereby improve public health across the state, the region, and the world."
10840344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Faithful replication of the genome is a core mission of all dividing cells. Accordingly, cells have evolved
mechanisms to monitor replication fidelity and to coordinate completion of replication with other cell cycle
events. In eukaryotes, chromosome replication is initiated at multiple initiation sites (origins), which are a
key target of the cell’s regulatory mechanisms ensuring proper genome maintenance. Cells can regulate
origin choice (which potential origins they use), efficiency (how likely they are to use it in any given cell
cycle), and initiation time, to choreograph the overall duplication of the genome. Disruption of this
choreography has been linked to a variety of human disorders including cancer. Although origins are not
conserved at the sequence level, the protein machinery is highly conserved, allowing discovery of key
aspects of these fundamental processes in simple models such as Baker’s yeast because of its small
chromosomes, well defined origin sequences, ease of altering chromosome structure, and exceptional
systems for genetic and genomic analysis. A recent discovery is the key role played by the rDNA—the
locus containing tandemly-repeated copies of ribosomal RNA genes—in modulating genome duplication
and maintenance. Over the next five years, this project will investigate how the choreography of
chromosome replication is established and why it is so important in eukaryotes: How is rDNA replication
regulated, and how does rDNA copy number affect genome stability? How are origin preference and
replication timing determined genome-wide? And how do alterations in the choreography of genome
replication contribute to phenotypes such as those seen in human disorders?"

EFFICACY & SAFETY OF PHARMACOKINETICALLY-DRIVEN DOSING OF MYCOPHENOLATE
MOFETIL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC PROLIFERATIVE LUPUS NEPHRITIS - A
DOUBLE-BLIND CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL
The Pediatric Lupus Nephritis Mycophenolate Mofetil (PLUMM) Study
PROJECT SUMMARY:
Meta-analyses in adults suggest equivalence of clinical efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide and
mycophenolate mofetil when dosed based on patient weight or body-surface-area (MMFBSA) as is the current
standard for the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) treatments in the U.S. Pharmacokinetically-
guided precision dosing of MMF (MMKPK) may offer a beneficial modification of the current standard treatment
in that MMKPK promises over 30% higher LN response rates than MMFBSA. The objective of the proposed,
adequately powered, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of
pharmacokinetically-guided precision dosing of MMF (MMFPK) with conventional dosing regimens of MMF
(MMFBSA) among children with proliferative LN. The principal hypothesis to be tested in this 2-arm 104-week
study is that, compared to MMFBSA, MMFPK results in significantly higher rates of renal remission in children
with proliferative LN. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving at least partial renal
remission (PRR) at week 26 of the study in the intention to treat population. The key secondary endpoint is
achievement of complete renal remission (CRR) at week 26 of the study. Our approach will be to enroll 105
pediatric subjects, ages 8 years or older, who have been newly diagnosed with proliferative LN plus have
chosen MMF for induction therapy plus tolerate oral MMF. Randomization will occur at baseline (1:1) to the
MMKPK arm or the MMFBSA arm, respectively. After week 26, non-responders will be discontinued from the
active study intervention, and subjects randomized at baseline to the MMFBSA arm who achieved PRR but not
CRR will cross over to the MMFPK arm. Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling (VAMS) devices will be used to
facilitate estimation of the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA) in whole blood as is needed to personalize
MMF dosing in the MMFPK arm. Use of corticosteroid will be standardized and closely regulated during the
study, and adherence to MMF will be monitored. Patented biomarkers will be assayed in the urine in support
of the superiority of MMFPK over MMFBSA in controlling LN activity. Upon completion of this trial, we expect to
have unequivocal evidence of the superiority MMFPK therapy compared to MMFBSA use, and to show that
MMFPK dosage is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile in children.
RELEVANCE:
The proposed trial is relevant to public health because therapies for LN are investigated, i.e. disease
complications that concern the majority of children with cSLE. In this setting, optimizing drug use promises to
improve long-term disease outcomes through rapid control of kidney inflammation, while minimzing
unnecessary exposures to an immunosuppressive and teratogenic medication. This is relevant to the part of
NIH’s mission that pertains to fostering research in treatment; and the dissemination of information on research
progress in lupus. LN is central to NIAMS Strategic Plan and its Lupus Research Agenda in pursuance of
improved public health and patient-centered personalized care."
10840354,"Although there is a rich history relating single-neuron spiking activity to brain function, our understanding
of the neural bases of perception and behavior depends on identifying information processing within neuronal
circuits that operate over different spatial scales. Despite their importance as a canonical model of information
flow, our understanding of whether and how such bidirectional hierarchically organized circuits contribute to
auditory perception remains elusive, especially in primate models of hearing. The overarching goal of this Roi
proposal is to fill this knowledge gap by identifying bidirectional, hierarchically organized circuits that contribute
to auditory perception. We will use predictive coding (PC) -a highly influential theoretical framework for
auditory statistical learning and perceptual inference- as an experimental lever to test whether its predictions
are instantiated in cortical circuits of the ventral auditory pathway. We focus on the ventral pathway because, in
rhesus monkeys, this pathway contributes causally to auditory perception. To test the circuit predictions of PC,
we insert multi-contact electrode(s) orthogonally to the cortical laminae and record single-unit and neuronalpopulation
activity in the core auditory cortex and in the ventral auditory pathway While recording, rhesus
monkeys participate in passive listening paradigms and an active listening task. During passive listening,
monkeys listen to sequences of auditory stimuli containing both predictable and unpredictable events, which
allow probes of prediction-error and prediction-related activity. During active listening, monkeys implicitly learn
to use auditory cues to predict the onset of an auditory target; this task is a direct behavioral assessment of the
strength and temporal dynamics of auditory statistical learning. In Specific Aim #1, we identify the interlaminar
circuitry underlying PC and its hierarchical organization along the ventral auditory pathway. In Specific Aim #2,
we identify the feedforward and feedback circuitry between the prefrontal and auditory cortices that underlies
PC. The findings from this proposal will provide invaluable insights into the functional organization of cortical
circuits underlying PC and statistical learning along the ventral auditory pathway. In turn, these insights may
lead to the formulation of testable hypotheses regarding the neurophysiological underpinnings of deficits in
statistical learning that have been identified in clinical conditions such as autism and schizophrenia."
10840360,"Salmonellae cause an estimated 150 million cases of gastroenteritis and 25 million cases of invasive disease
(enteric fever and non-typhoidal bacteremia), leading to 300,000 deaths per year. Findings based on inbred
mouse strains and rare human mutations indicate that the clinical presentations and outcomes of salmonellosis
are influenced by the host’s genetic makeup. However, we do not understand the impact of common, naturally
occurring human genetic differences on Salmonella infections. Our long-term goal is to leverage high-
throughput cellular phenotyping of infection and natural genetic diversity to define molecular parameters of
susceptibility to human infectious diseases. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of enteric fever and
bacteremia identified genetic differences regulating susceptibility, such studies are limited by high variability in
patient exposure, pathogen genetic diversity, and a limited understanding of the pathophysiology of identified
variants. We developed a complementary cellular GWAS approach (Hi-HOST: High-throughput Human in vitrO
Susceptibility Testing; http://h2p2.oit.duke.edu) to perform high resolution analysis of human genetic differences
that impact host-pathogen traits while enabling experimental dissection of these traits. In the previous funding
period, we focused on human genetic variants that regulate Salmonella invasion of host cells. We identified a
regulatory variant in VAC14 that modulates levels of plasma membrane cholesterol and thus limits the docking
of the Salmonella SPI-1 type III secretion system to host cells. Humans with the high-invasion allele of VAC14
have increased risk of typhoid fever and bacteremia. The objectives of this application are to define and
characterize human genetic differences that alter the full spectrum of Salmonella host-pathogen
interactions and assess their impact on disease.
Building from our unique resource of Hi-HOST cellular GWAS of Salmonella invasion, replication, and host
cytokine levels, we have identified SNPs mediating susceptibility to infection phenotypes that will undergo
experimental validation and mechanistic studies. We will determine how regulatory SNPs affecting ARHGEF26
and MCOLN2 expression impact Salmonella invasion and replication and the role these genes play during
infection in mice. For ARHGEF26, a Rho GEF that stimulates Salmonella-induced membrane ruffling, our
association data and experimental evidence indicate SNPs regulate ARHGEF26 expression to increase invasion
dependent on the Salmonella effector sopB. For MCOLN2, we hypothesize that this divalent cation channel is a
novel factor that regulates intracellular replication by modulating nutrient access, metal toxicity, and/or immune
cell polarization. Using Arhgef26 and Mcoln2 mice, we will elucidate how altered expression of these genes
regulates bacterial burden and immune response during infection. Finally, we will test whether SNPs identified
by Hi-HOST are associated with enteric fever and bacteremia in humans. Revealing these mechanisms could
lead to new therapeutic strategies for salmonellosis and other diseases impacted by the same genetic variants."

 Late talkers are at risk for language impairment and have high rates of co-occurring mental health
impairments, estimated to range from 30-70%. Our group has shown that as early as 12 months, children’s
dimensional irritability is related to their vocabulary size, and late talkers have significantly more frequent and
severe temper tantrums than typical talkers. Despite the frequency of late talking, language impairment and
internalizing and externalizing (INT/EXT) mental health impairments, few studies have examined the
multifaceted trajectories that lead to them. Further, few studies examine multi-faceted predictors of outcome or

late talker-enriched W2W samples, and WashU’s adversity-enriched eLABE sample), we are poised to
deepen and accelerate the aims of the MHESC, via supplementary study of the precursors and
consequences of late talking. To do so, we enrich consideration of language development and ecological
environment within the MHESC risk models designed to predict preschool psychopathology, using
computational approaches, and employing a health equity lens. We pursue the following supplementary
aims, within scope of MHESC grant’s Aim 2a: Supp Aim 1a. Apply the MHE-RiskCalc algorithm with deeper
phenotyping measures of child language at 24 months (e.g., language sample analysis) and joint consideration
of language and irritability measures to improve precision of prediction (beyond the base model) for three
outcomes at age 4+ years: a) INT/EXT, b) language, and c) co-occurring language and INT/EXT impairments.
1b. Test whether a RiskCalc based on 12-month measures can predict 24-month late talking status. 1c. Test
whether a RiskCalc based on 12-month measures can improve prediction of (a) INT/EXT (b) language & (c)
INT/EXT+language impairments at age 4+. Supp Aim 2. Test whether adding promotive factors, including
observed measures of dyadic language environment (caregiver responsiveness to child communication,
language input quality) and child social-emotional competence improves RiskCalc precision and reduces bias
of language and INT/EXT prediction, especially increasing accuracy for children from historically
marginalized/under-resourced communities. Supp Aim 3. Use computational machine learning methods to
determine data-driven indicators of risk of language and mental health impairments in the MHESC cohort, with
emphasis on bias reduction and equity for diverse demographic sub-groups. In sum, we are poised to advance
the objectives of the MHESC to accelerate pace of translation and equitable assessment for detection of late
talking, language impairment, and co-occurrence of early mental health impairment."

Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) is an important public health problem. This is particularly true in two
serious mental health disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and major depressive disorder
(MDD), in whom 5% and 1.9% die by suicide over their lifetimes, a rate 100 times higher than in the general
population. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying SIB is therefore critical to address this issue.
Recently, we found that a questionnaire-based measure (the UPPS-P) of emotionally based impulsivity
(urgency) is highly elevated with suicide risk in SSD (d = 1.13) and was correlated with suicidal ideation and
lifetime suicide attempts. We also found that high levels of SIB in SSD were associated with reduced activation
in putative urgency circuitry during an urgency proxy fMRI task. These regions included right dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right rostral anterior cingulate, right superior temporal gyrus,
and right middle cingulate. Activation in most of these regions correlated with lower levels of urgency. Prior
work in SSD also implicates the frontal pole and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction in higher levels of
urgency. We propose a transdiagnostic study to examine the role of urgency and its neural circuitry in
these high-risk populations. We plan to leverage prior collaborations among NYU Grossman School of
Medicine, Nathan Kline Institute, and Weill Cornell Medicine to enroll 80 people with SSD and 80 people with
MDD. These individuals will be stratified into high and low SIB groups within each diagnostic group based on
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; 40 per SIB group/diagnosis). 20 Healthy Volunteers will be
enrolled to provide normative imaging data. Those in the high SIB group will have at least one lifetime actual or
aborted or interrupted suicide attempt and a history of preparatory acts for suicide attempt over the past 3
years or 2+ lifetime suicide attempts. Those in the low SIB group will have at most passive suicidal ideation
lifetime. Participants will receive interviews, questionnaire measures of impulsivity (including urgency),
cognitive testing, and an MRI scan. This approach will allow us to his approach will allow us to highlight that
there is higher negative urgency (Hypothesis 1), lower fMRI BOLD activation in specific neurocircuits
(Hypothesis 2), and lower cortical thickness (Hypothesis 3) in those with high SIB transdiagnostically.
Moreover, in exploratory analyses we will examine the relationship between SIB and resting state functional
connectivity (RSFC) in urgency-related neurocircuitry in both SSD and MDD. We will determine the neural
circuits affected in transdiagnostic patients with elevated NU, identifying the ideal regions to target using
neuromodulation and other neuroscience-informed therapies, with the aim of reducing NU and ultimately, SIB.
By establishing the relationship between NU in transdiagnostic populations beyond SSD, we will determine
whether urgency related interventions could be effective in a larger cohort of patients."

Approximately 7.7% of the US population have asthma, and incidence has been increasing since the 1980s. In
Arizona, asthma prevalence exceeds the national average, with the majority of asthma diagnoses made in the
Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Genetic risk factors have been identified in asthmatics. However, the steady
increase in the prevalence of asthma in the US population suggests that environmental exposures or other
extrapulmonary factors, such as diet and the gut microbiota, may play a critical role in asthma development.
Health disparities in asthma prevalence and morbidity are highlighted in individuals from low-income urban
areas where nutritional health disparities are more likely to exist. For example, poor-urban residence is an
individual risk factor for reporting an asthma attack and having higher odds for an asthma-related visit to the
Emergency Department. Minority children are disproportionately affected by low socioeconomic status. A
recent study demonstrated that 31.4% of non-Hispanic Black children, and 25.2% of Hispanic children lived
under the poverty threshold compared to 9.4% non-Hispanic white children. Economically disadvantaged
urban populations also experience a nutritional health disparity, including a low fiber diet that leads to shifts in
the gut microbiome and may explain differences in asthma risk. Dietary fibers are complex carbohydrates that
resist metabolism in the small intestine by host enzymes and are fermented in the colon by resident microbes.
Gut microbial fermentation of soluble fibers results in production of metabolic by-products such as the short
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are important molecules that act as a link
between the microbiota and host immune system. We hypothesize that a low fiber diet is a critical, but
understudied, factor in asthma health disparities. The overall goals of this proposal are to determine the effect
of a gut microbiome modifier (fiber) on microbial composition and function in an underserved population. In
addition, we will determine the effect of soluble fiber supplementation in reducing airway inflammation via the
gut microbiome-airway axis. The hypothesis governing this proposal is that gut microbial metabolism of dietary
fiber to SCFAs will reduce airway inflammation by altering the phenotype of T cells and eosinophils. We have
assembled a strong team of clinicians and scientists, and we draw on our pilot study of fiber intervention in a
pediatric asthma cohort to achieve 3 aims. First, we will build on the community partnerships through the PCH
Mobile Asthma Clinic (Breathmobile) to assess baseline fiber consumption and gut microbiota across
underserved communities in Maricopa County. Second, we will evaluate the effect of a soluble fiber
supplement in a pediatric asthma cohort. Finally, we will evaluate the effect of microbial-derived SCFAs on key
immune cell populations. Completion of these aims will provide evidence that can guide public health
nutritional interventions in low SES populations to improve asthma outcomes and advance health equity."

Overview: Cultured cells form the basis of almost all TEMPs and Regenerative Medicine-based therapeutics.
The long-term goal of this TR&D is to develop new technologies and strategies to achieve automated culture of
cells that are phenotypically and functionally optimized for a particular TE application. Selecting cells with
consistent attributes, including differentiation and expansion potential, is notoriously difficult because of variable
donor genetics and a lack of understanding of cells responses to their environment.
To overcome these limitations, we focus on (1) dynamic, inducible molecular reporters and non-invasive sensors
to track, and control, cell and tissue manufacturing workflows in real time, and (2) targeted modifications of
intracellular pathways and cell enrichment that result in more predictable and controllable cell phenotype and
function. We will begin with human mesenchymal stem cells; but the strategies can easily be applied to, e.g., to
tissue specific stem cells or iPS cells. This will be done following 3 Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Generating genetically encoded cell sensors for dynamic and continuous sensing of cellular
phenotype and function. We will generate fluorescent and/or bioluminescent (BLI) molecular reporters specific
to the tissue types in development by our CPs, based on miRNA- and promoter-driven. These reporters will emit.
BLI is useful to detect gene-expression activity in early differentiation events, as quantifiable data to track these
events in real-time. High-resolution fluorescence imaging allows the spatio-temporal assessment of biomarker
expression at a single-cell level. TR&D-1 will collaborate with TR&Ds-2, -3 and -4 to validate their technology,
providing higher throughput than commonly used end-point destructive assessments.
Aim 2: Developing molecular sensors for ultra-sensitive, non-invasive monitoring of cell function. We
will develop molecular sensors and reporters to sense, at very low concentration, specific biological molecules
within- or produced by cells in real-time, through fluorescence and electrochemical sensing systems. Our
validated universal electrochemical biosensor will be adapted to any molecule of interest using aptamers and
the high specificity of the CRISPR-Cas12(13) platforms. These non-invasive measurements will be designed for
integration into the Tissue Foundry automation backbone as described in TR&D-4.
Aim 3: Achieving dynamic control of cell phenotype and function. After assessing the spatio-temporal
dynamics of differentiation using real-time molecular reporters (SA-1 & -2), inducible genetic control and/or
enrichment and pre-conditioning of cells will be implemented. This will be accomplished using inducible systems
such as CRISPR-activation, Tet-inducible systems and miRNA mimicking/antagonist. Alternately cell populations
can be enriched for desirable biological features through novel sorting techniques (e.g., microfluidic
immunomagnetic sorting, label-free enrichment)."
10862621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The striking disparities in disease dynamics and health outcomes between various socio-demographic groups
observed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have highlighted the critical need for improved modeling
approaches that help us understand and predict such disparities. Most modeling studies currently produce
insights at spatial scales that are too coarse (e.g., counties, states) in scale, and are usually insensitive to local
socio-demographic variations in disease dynamics; this limits their practical value for informing public health
planning in local communities. What is needed is a set of standardized methods to efficiently create fine-
grained models capable of exposing and capturing key spatial features and socio-demographic factors that
impact transmission dynamics and disease outcomes, and that can reveal how different socio-demographic
sub-groups may experience disparate disease outcomes. Here we propose a novel SSCIMA (Social-Spatial
Clustering, Interconnection, and Movement Analysis) modeling approach to efficiently expose linkages
between local mobility, socio-demographic composition, and evolving disease surveillance and to optimize the
construction of meta-population disease models that can make more accurate disease forecasts at the scales
of census blocks (i.e., local neighborhoods). We will use SARS-CoV-2 and simulated data sets to drive the
design and rigorous testing of generalized methods and software that will be useful for future pandemic
preparedness. In Aim 1, we develop statistical methods that ingest disease data, mobility patterns, and socio-
demographic statistics at the scale of census blocks and use these data to determine the features that most
strongly explain patterns of local and regional transmission dynamics as well as disease outcomes (e.g.,
hospitalization rates). In Aim 2, we develop efficient methods leveraging the linkages revealed under Aim 1 to
fit meta-population models to sparse data at the scale of census blocks, integrating mobility data, and socio-
demographic features to yield high-fidelity meta-population models structured directly based on evolving
observed patterns of disease dynamics. Analyses driven by simulated and real data will reveal the potential for
SSCIMA-driven configuration of meta-population models to improve local forecast accuracy; and we will also
produce freely available software and a cloud-based modeling portal to allow exploration and testing of our
method and tools. In Aim 3, we will focus on dissemination and education, developing a new educational
module for deployment within SHERC’s existing outreach infrastructure, as well as a half-day training
workshop for the modeling community to learn about, engage with, and provide feedback on our technique and
tools. We expect the SCCIMA approach to enable more rapid, spatially refined, and equity-focused modeling
efforts that will better equip us for future epidemic events."

During the process of fabricating an engineered tissue construct, it is critical to be able to assess the initial cell
seeding and subsequent cell functions in real time. This TR&D will focus on the development of biosensor tech-
nology that will leverage the widespread use of scaffolds in tissue engineering to produce sensor-enabled scaf-
folds in different materials and configurations to serve our CPs/SPs. Our key innovation is to incorporate sensing
functions into the scaffolds that can be used to monitor multiple specific biological properties dynamically and
longitudinally, thus enabling the potential to control and modify cell seeding, nutrient exchange, metabolic waste
removal and differentiation cues in real-time. We will accomplish this in two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Generation of sensing scaffolds to monitor and automate cellular seeding. During the automated
fabrication process of a TE construct, it is critical to be able to assess cell attachment in real-time in order to
validate the seeding process or take remedial action if called for. Because different scaffold biomaterials and
syntheses provide different microenvironmental cues for cells, assessing the attachment and distribution of cells
within the scaffold during TEMP assembly can help optimize the process. We will design beacon-type aptamers
that bind and react to cell whole cells or alternately to cell surface molecules and are therefore usable as short-
term sensors in this application. The aptamers will have a molecular beacon-type of reporter chemistry that will
be activated by conformational changes upon binding their target cell and will provide a fluorescent feedback
signal proportional to the number of cells seeded to the scaffold. Our aptamer sensor that can be attached to or
integrated into scaffolds/biomaterials/bioinks. Variations of the technology will include optic light guide aug-
mented scaffolds to assess the interior of thick structures.
Specific Aim 2: Sensor platforms to measure O2, glucose and lactate. O2, glucose and lactate are 3 key markers
of metabolic activity. Monitoring of these is essential during differentiation and/or maturation of tissues to deter-
mine both their functionality and biochemical quality, and to, again, provide signals for remedial action if needed.
We will develop O2, glucose, and lactate optodes using novel chemistries, and integrate them with scaffolds in a
variety of application-specific ways to measure levels of O2, glucose, and lactate in the tissue interior, at the
tissue surface and eventually in the bulk medium. We will also develop a system to measure oxygen uptake rate
at the surface of the engineered construct. The sensors will use biocompatible materials and will be integrated
into the scaffolds or reversibly attached to them using novel micro-anchors. The sensors will be tested for stability
during scaffold storage, and for biocompatibility and stability during tissue differentiation and maturation."

Bioreactor systems are critical for cohesive engineered tissues to mature from cells and scaffolds. Many
bioreactors are compatible with the periodic, non-invasive measurement of basic environmental parameters, like
dissolved O2, pH and temperature and other, tissue-specific in-process and final product quality attributes.
However, the ability to (1) non-invasively measure cell and tissue maturation against a series of redetermined,
tissue-specific biological and mechanical quality attributes and (2) to provide biological and mechanical
stimulation to structural tissues, does not exist. Furthermore, closed/sealed systems to mitigate contamination
require non-invasive measurement technologies, especially for measuring quality attributes of
autologous/personalized tissues of which only a single unit may exist. We will develop a closed, bio-instructive
bioreactor platform, amenable to the culture of various structural tissues, and incorporating sensing and actuation
for feedback control of process parameters using the following specific aims. Aim 1: Development and
integration of sensors to monitor physio-chemical cell status/maturity, and tissue mechanical
properties. We will first investigate integration of optical sensors into bioreactor vessels with a focus on
optimized signal acquisition and analysis. We will develop (and then also integrate) ultrasonic assessment of
tissue construct mechanical properties such as one-dimensional modulus, and tissue inhomogeneity and surface
defects. Together with the off-line analysis of key metabolites and nutrients (e.g., amino acids, growth factors),
these inputs will provide detailed information on the phenotype and health of the engineered tissue. Aim 2:
Modular bioreactor development, including actuators for mechanical stimulation, sequential growth
factor regulation, and injection systems. Inputs from embedded, in-line, and off-line sensors will be processed
and exported to two types of programmable actuators:1) fluid dispensers for chemical stimuli, and 2) mechanical
stimuli delivered via flexion, sheer, and/or compression. The bioreactor platforms will be developed with
emphasis on integration with Tissue Foundry modules, and on downstream compatibility with its automation and
data management backbone. The internal configuration of the bioreactor will be specific to the tissues in
development by our CPs and will be designed for optimal fluid flow paths for cell seeding, media exchanges and
nutrient addition via PLC-controlled actuators and valves. For tissues requiring mechanical stimulation, the
modular reactor will have integrated deformable polymeric walls, through which the tissue can be mechanically
manipulated in a sterile manner. Sterile ports and fiberoptic ports will be embedded into the bioreactor walls for
the delivery of biological effectors and to enable O2 uptake or other analyte measurements. Feedback control
algorithms will be developed for sensing and actuation for mechanical quality control of a single tissue type."

Despite research showing that diversity improves creativity, decision making, and scientific outcomes, people
from racially/ethnically minoritized communities or disadvantaged backgrounds are significantly
underrepresented in the sciences and health professions, with greater disparities at each higher academic
level. Grounded in a diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) framework, the Southwest Health Equity
Research Collaborative (SHERC) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) aims to enhance the institutional and
regional capacity to conduct health equity research. The overall goal of the Investigator Development Core
(IDC) is to support the development of early-stage investigators (ESIs) and underrepresented (UR) faculty
in biomedical, clinical, and behavioral sciences. This goal will be met through 2 aims that build upon an
established and highly successful Pilot Project Program (PPP). Aim 1 will enhance the PPP program with a
focus on translational research and team science, providing investigators $50,000/year for up to 2 years to
establish successful programs of research in health equity. Investigators will use translational research
techniques to systematically address basic mechanistic questions; apply findings to preclinical, biomedical, and
behavioral research problems; and design clinical or behavioral interventions to improve health care and health
outcomes. Outreach and recruitment strategies will leverage institutional connections to maximize ESI and UR
applicants. Faculty selected for PPP funding will be expected to complete proposed research aims within set
timelines; work directly with team science experts to enhance translational impact of their work; produce
deliverables including peer reviewed publications and externally submitted grant proposals; and participate in
RCMI activities, faculty mentoring programs, and research development activities. Aim 2 will support career
development of PPP research leads and other ESI and UR faculty through an Individualized Mentoring
Program (IMP). PPP applicants will receive individualized support throughout the proposal process and in
selecting a mentorship team. Formal mentoring support will specifically address barriers commonly
experienced by ESI and UR faculty. Overall program evaluation will combine objectively verifiable outcomes
(promotions, publications, and submitted/funded grant proposals), validated outcome measures (mentorship
effectiveness, competencies, self-efficacy) and qualitative methods to gain deep insight into factors impacting
career progression. In 5 years, we anticipate supporting both ESI and UR faculty (13 total investigators)
through pilot research funding and participation in the IMP. We expect the investigators’ publications, external
grant submissions, and ratings of mentor effectiveness and mentee self-efficacy to increase over time.
Through these outcomes, IDC will strongly enhance ESI and UR scholar career development at NAU which in
turn will greatly improve institutional capacity for health equity research."

TR&D-4 will demonstrate process automation on ARMI|BioFabUSA’s Tissue Foundry, a scalable, modular,
automated and closed tissue manufacturing platform. The Tissue Foundry is the integration of primarily off-the-
shelf components to perform the sequential, modular steps of producing a tissue. The Tissue Foundry automates
thawing a vial of adherent cells, expanding them on microcarriers in stirred tank vessels, harvesting cells and
exchanging cells into media promoting subsequent differentiation or tissue development steps, culturing the
tissues during maturation, and preservation and packaging of the final product. To re-design the manual process
to the closed, automated Tissue Foundry process, ARMI’s Deep Tissue Characterization Center deconstructs a
manual process and develops tissue-type specific setpoints at both the endpoint and at intermediate stages of
production using experimentation and modeling after deep multiparameter characterization of the cells and
tissue. Once these setpoints are identified significant gaps remain in available tissue specific sensors and
equipment to control and monitor tissue quality.
Advanced sensor technologies (developed in TR&D-1 and –2) and prototype, actuator-enabled
bioreactors (TR&D-3) will be integrated into the Tissue Foundry and demonstrated through production
of CP target tissues in a tissue manufacturing relevant environment. This objective will be carried out in 3
specific aims: Aim 1: Physical integration of sensors with Tissue Foundry cell culture system. We will
integrate newly-developed biosensors developed in TR&D-1, -2, and -3 into the Tissue Foundry for both
measurement of parameters specific to the tissue process, and as a proof of concept for the feasibility of
controlling these processes through feedback loops. Aim 2: Efficient control by integration of sensors and
actuators with Tissue Foundry backbone automation and data management system. Tissue Foundry
control is based on a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) architecture and on the use of
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which will interface directly with sensors and actuators executing
processing steps and real-time feedback control. Aim 3: Automated production of up to 10 tissues
simultaneously. A manual tissue engineering process, starting with CCMEEC’s articular cartilage, will be
assessed to identify optimal automation and sensor implementation. Once configured, the Tissue Foundry will
be used to produce up to 10 tissues simultaneously using integrated bio-instructive bioreactors. Data from each
step and the final product will be collected through integrated sensors, analysis of media aliquots, and destructive
sampling to compare the manual and automated processes. TR&D4 will deliver an automated manufacturing
system, leveraging the existing modules of the prototype Tissue Foundry, with vastly improved
capabilities developed by TR&D-1, -2, and -3, for reliably producing complex tissues"

Over the last decade, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) Unite to End Structural
Racism, the shift from health disparities to social determinants of health (SDoH) and an intentional commitment
to health equity-focused research signals a paradigm shift rooted in a critical understanding of the impact of
justice and fairness on both the biomedical enterprise and population health. Using this same level of
commitment and an SDoH focus, the overall goal of the Southwest Health Equity Research Collaborative’s
(SHERC’s) Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to sustain existing successful initiatives and to engage new
relationships with multi-sectoral organizational stakeholders and community leaders representing urban, rural,
tribal, and United States (US)-Mexico border populations of the southwestern US to address health equity. Aim
1 focuses on accountability, by cultivating and maintaining an active Community Expert Board (CEB) of multi-
sectoral community stakeholders to advise SHERC operational activities. CEB will: (1) inform CEC’s focus and
serve as reviewers for the Pilot Project Program and the Community Campus Partnership and Dissemination
Support program; (2) strengthen sustainable community and system-level changes through the Fairness First
Network; and (3) assist with identifying Community Engagement Studios expert panels. Aim 2 focuses on
relationships through a shared vision of health equity, by strengthening university and community capacity to
translate research findings into action. CEC’s Fairness First Network, a geographically diverse network of
multi-sectoral stakeholders representing rural, tribal, and US-Mexico border interests, will engage in multimodal
community efforts to facilitate: (1) community-based strategic planning through Community Health Equity
Consensus Models; (2) timely and appropriate dissemination of information from the Center’s research and
pilot projects; and (3) other activities for diverse and lay community audiences. Aim 3 focuses on action, by
building on the CEC’s Community-Campus Partnership Support program, which supports emerging university-
community partnerships to conceptualize community engaged research projects. CEC will enhance SHERC
translation and dissemination activities through the Community Campus Partnership Development and
Dissemination Support program and Community Engagement Studios, and will stimulate mentoring teams’
effective dissemination of research results to inform intervention and policy. CEC’s approach will yield
sustainable relationships through targeted strategic planning with small groups of community experts, large-
scale coalition building among geographically diverse, multi-sectoral health equity stakeholders, and preparing
early-stage investigators (ESIs). Ultimately, CEC efforts will contribute to strong academic and community
foundations for transformational biomedical, clinical, and social behavioral health research initiatives which
target the environmental, economic, and social root causes of health inequity."

The goals of CM2OST are to draw on our collective expertise to develop, demonstrate and deploy novel
technologies that enable a Quality-by-Design approach to the manufacturing of structural tissues. These efforts
are predicated on the dissemination and commercialization of our products, especially those that facilitate the
scalable manufacture of therapeutic products. Recognition that success in creating an industry will exacerbate
the existing labor shortage in the manufacturing segment is reflected in the dual foci of the education/workforce
development (E/WD) roadmap, which leads to projects that both engage the next generation of the field and
enriches the workforce in manufacturing and adjacent fields. As such, roadmap responsive projects must
demonstrate that the solutions have broad commercial uses. All staff will take part in the training and
dissemination mission of the Center as part of their effort. The core aims of the Center’s Training and
Dissemination component will be:
Specific Aim 1: Specific Aim 1: Promote the dissemination and understanding of the Center’s
technologies throughout the existing TE community, adjacent scientific and industry fields, as well as
the more general society. CM2OST will sponsor at least one prominent event annually to highlight its activities.
CM2OST T&D also will leverage existing avenues such as publications, invited presentations, short courses and
sponsored conferences, as well as create novel avenues of dissemination such as V/R or hybrid cloud-based
educational instruction. The Center will leverage BioFab’s nationwide membership (>165 strong) to reach a wide
audience including the next generation of TE scientists.
Specific Aim 2: Hardware/software dissemination through commercialization. The two key factors for
moving forward with a manufacturing hardware/software development project to commercialization will be: 1) if
it addresses an identified a manufacturing bottleneck; and 2) if it is generalizable beyond the prototype test bed
used to validate its design and function. CM2OST projects that meet both criteria are more likely to successfully
translate into commercially viable products and will be emphasized by CM2OST dissemination activities.
Specific Aim 3: Train researchers and manufacturers in the use of our technologies such that they can
correctly apply them to their own research or commercial product development. E/WD efforts to increase
the diversity, skill and size of the workforce are essential to success of the field. CM2OST training will create a
“cadre of early adopters” for our new technologies. This cadre will demonstrate the benefit of CM2OST-developed
technology by using it in their research and product development. We will leverage both proven educational
methodologies such as one-to-one training sessions, and short courses followed by training sessions, as well as
newer methodologies of training such as remote video-assisted training."

SUMMARY
The Administrative Core (AC) will provide an organizational framework for the proposed multi-investigator
project, the MEDIC – MicroED Imaging Center at UCLA. The AC will be led by the two PIs, Drs. Tamir Gonen
and Pawel Penczek. The joint directorship of the MEDIC center will ensure efficient functioning of the Resource
uninterrupted by other responsibilities of the PIs. The activities of this Core will include synchronization of the
research and technology development of all groups, the maintenance of communications with and between
Driving Biological Projects, the resolution of budgetary issues, organization of monthly meetings for an Internal
Advisory Committee, a yearly meeting of an External Advisory Meeting, and up to two training and dissemination
workshops per year. It will also be responsible for the preparation of the yearly Progress Report and will maintain
and update the Resource Sharing facility. The center will benefit from Dr. Gonen having extensive experience in
managing cryoEM resources and multi-user facility projects. Dr. Gonen established and directed several cryoEM
facilities around the USA in the last 15 years, including the most prolific cryoEM user facility at the Janelia
Research Campus of HHMI which was the first synchrotron-like facility for cryoEM in the world. Dr. Penczek has
20 years of successful NIH-supported research including participation in multi-PI program project and joined PI
grants. In addition, for 12 years Dr. Penczek served as a Director of the UTH Structural Biology Imaging Center,
a multi-user facility supporting structural biology research at UT Medical Center, including NMR, X-ray
crystallography, and cryo-EM and operating under an independent budget. Under his leadership the facility grew,
culminating in the successful acquisition of a UT-funded Krios TEM in 2017. Since 2017 Dr. Penczek serves as
a co-director of the UT Center. Together, Drs. Gonen and Penczek will formulate an Internal Advisory Committee
comprised of elite members of the Technology Research and Development projects (TRDs) and select key

10823536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bioactive peptides, or drugs made of small proteins, are used to treat an increasing number of human diseases.
However, the fact that almost no peptide drugs can be delivered orally limits their use. A long-term goal and
potential solution to this unmet need is the development of bioengineered probiotics – healthy gut bacteria
designed to be taken orally and deliver drugs inside the gut. This strategy has shown promise: the probiotic
Limosilactobacillus reuteri has recently been engineered to produce ShK-235, an analog of an injection peptide
currently in clinical trials for treatment of autoimmune disease. While oral ShK-235 peptide or L. reuteri alone
are ineffective in treating disease, oral L. reuteri engineered to secrete ShK-235 (LrS235) successfully treats
autoimmune arthritis in rats, circumventing the requirement for injection. Nevertheless, it is not currently
understood why the microbially delivered peptide can overcome barriers to oral delivery which the
peptide alone cannot. This information is necessary for the continued characterization, development, and
improvement of this novel drug delivery strategy. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to uncover
the unique mechanisms enabling oral LrS235 to deliver ShK-235 intact into the bloodstream. The central
hypothesis is that live LrS235 adheres to intestinal mucus, where secreted ShK-235 is concentrated and
diffused between epithelial cells into circulation to exert its therapeutic effect. This hypothesis will be
tested with two specific aims, each focusing on a distinct arm of this host-microbe interaction. For both aims,
absorption studies will be performed in rats, using electrophysiology and immune cell proliferation assays as
functional metrics of drug absorption. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine the microbe-intrinsic factors
necessary for absorption of ShK-235 from oral LrS235. Strains of LrS235 deficient in mucus adherence or
secretory capacity will be used to determine what properties of LrS235 govern successful absorption.
Experiments proposed in Aim 2 will determine the primary pathways by which ShK-235 from oral LrS235
permeates the gut epithelium. The permeability of microbially delivered ShK-235 across rat intestinal tissue ex
vivo will be characterized with Ussing chamber assays as well as localized in vivo using immunofluorescence
microscopy to tease apart what path microbially delivered ShK-235 takes from the intestine into the bloodstream.
The Principal Investigator’s training environment, spanning labs with expertise in probiotic engineering and
immune modulation in collaboration with experts in intestinal microscopy and absorption, is ideal for tackling this
interdisciplinary research question. The integrated training plan proposed builds experience in microbiology and
immunology and comprehensively prepares the Principal Investigator for a translational academic physician-
scientist career. Ultimately, the proposed research is broadly significant as it will provide new information to guide
novel drug delivery strategies and broaden our understanding of host-microbe interactions."

In 2020, U.S. electricity customers faced an average of 8 hours without power, the longest duration on record.
Climate change is expected to cause more severe weather events, which can damage electricity grids and dis-
tribution pathways. Outages may be particularly problematic for cardiovascular health, as they disrupt access to
temperature-controlling tools (e.g., air conditioners, fans). Climate change will also result in higher temperatures,
which can exacerbate cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD affects 126.9 million American adults and is the lead-
ing cause of death and disability in the U.S., with communities color and socially marginalized communities
disproportionately affected. Understanding the impact of power outages on CVD and how this relationship varies
across community sociodemographic characteristics is central to climate and environmental justice. A critical
research gap remains about the health effects of power outages generally and the extent to which they affect
acute CVD risk. Partly due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution measures for outage exposure, most
prior studies have not measured neighborhood-level electricity availability. Additionally, previous studies did not
consider the potential dual threat when outages co-occur with anomalous temperatures or whether certain com-
munities may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of power outages. In particular, we will consider whether
individuals living in communities with higher social vulnerability or more racial/economic segregation experience
worse CVD outcomes after power outages. We will use 2017-2020 New York Statewide Planning and Research
Co-operative System (SPARCS) hospitalization data and 30-minute resolution power outage data within 1,831
power operating units statewide to fill this gap. Using diagnostic codes, we will identify hourly hospitalizations for
the acute cardiovascular outcomes, myocardial infarction and stroke. We plan to implement case-crossover
study designs with conditional logistic models, which inherently control for non-time-varying individual-level con-
founding variables. Our overarching hypothesis is that more outage hours are associated with increased risk of
CVD hospitalizations, particularly during anomalous temperature events, and that there will be disparities in this
exposure-response relationship across area-level vulnerability and segregation. We aim to (1) investigate the
association between power outages and CVD hospitalizations, (2) determine the impacts of exposure to power
outages during anomalously hot and anomalously cold temperature events separately on CVD hospitalizations,
and (3) identify communities vulnerable to the effects of outages on CVD. This research supports the NIEHS
Strategic Plan to evaluate co-exposures and considers issues of environmental justice. Collectively, we will pro-
vide crucial information that can inform future climate adaptation policies to reduce CVD-related morbidity in an
equitable manner."
10825292,"Intraoperative identification of metastatic lesions is challenging due to unpredictable locations and coverage
by normal tissue. Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) uses targeted radioisotopes and/or fluorophores to
guide surgeons to cancer tissue and distinguish tumor margins from normal surrounding tissue. Radioactive
isotopes and near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores complement each other in dual-labeled probes by providing both
depth of detection (radioisotope) and visual delineation of tumor borders (fluorophore) with common clinically
used handheld detectors. Metastatic osteosarcoma is one type of cancer that could benefit from IMI for improved
resection given the difficulty of identifying lesions and tumor margins.
 Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents with an overall 5-
year-survival rate of 60-70% for localized disease and only 20% for metastatic disease. Macroscopically
complete resection of primary and metastatic lesions is associated with longer survival, making intraoperative
detection critical. Ninety percent of OS metastases occur in the lungs, though preoperative CT misses small
pulmonary metastases. Further, lesions are difficult to detect below the lung surface, necessitating an invasive
thoracotomy to palpate the lesions, which unfortunately can still be missed. Fluorescent agents have shown
promise in aiding OS metastasis resection but have limited depth of detection. There is a critical need for
methods to improve the completeness of metastatic tumor resection and decrease the invasiveness of surgery.
 GD2 is a tumor antigen that is weakly expressed in normal CNS tissue and melanocytes but highly
overexpressed in multiple cancers, including neuroblastoma and primary, recurrent, and metastatic OS. The
FDA-approved chimeric antibody, dinutuximab, targets GD2 for maintenance therapy in neuroblastoma. Our
group recently constructed DTPA[111In]-dinutuximab-IRDye800CW (111In-dinutuximab-IR800), composed of
dinutuximab to target GD2, DTPA[111In] to detect primary neuroblastoma at up to 5 cm depth with a handheld
gamma probe, and IRDye800CW to visualize the cancer with a handheld NIR camera. After promising
neuroblastoma xenograft studies in mice, 111In-dinutuximab-IR800 is poised for clinical translation for a primary
GD2-expressing cancer but has not yet been evaluated for metastatic disease.
 We hypothesize that 111In-dinutuximab-IR800 can be developed for clinical use in primary and
metastatic pediatric tumor resection. In Aim 1, we will optimize consistency of manufacturing, and study its
pharmacology, toxicology, and stability profile to enable clinical use. In Aim 2, we will test its ability to detect OS
metastases in vivo. The long-term goal of this project is to translate this IMI agent into clinical trials for use in
resection of neuroblastoma, metastatic OS, and other GD2-expressing tumors. We will use results from these
aims to prepare an IND and design an early phase clinical trial for intraoperative use of 111In-dinutuximab-IR800
in the surgical resection of primary neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma metastases."
10825293,"PROJECT SUMMARY
NK cells are required for antiviral immunity against viral infection in mice and humans. Patients with NK cell
deficiencies display increased susceptibility to infection from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella zoster
virus, and other herpesviruses. During the response to viral infection, activated NK cells expand, produce
inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and directly kill virally infected host cells. Potent induction of
these effector functions is tightly linked to metabolic reprogramming, as NK cells undergo drastic metabolic
changes to optimize energy production. Recent studies have identified the mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORc1) and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors
as being key regulators of activated NK cell metabolism. Despite the importance of these metabolic adaptations,
however, the precise molecular regulators linking extracellular activating signals to these intracellular metabolic
mediators remain poorly understood. Our results indicate that the transcription factor myocyte enhancing factor
2C (MEF2C) is a central regulator of mature human NK cell proliferation, IFN-γ production, and cytotoxicity.
CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated knockout of MEF2C resulted in impaired human NK cell
effector function in vitro. Likewise, MEF2C loss resulted in impaired expansion of mouse NK cells during mouse
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in vivo. Metabolic analyses revealed that MEF2C promotes glycolysis,
oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid uptake and accumulation in cytokine-activated human NK cells. MEF2C
expression was induced by IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation in a phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner,
while Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) analysis indicated that MEF2C binds at the SREBF1
locus encoding SREBP1 to increase transcript expression. These results suggest that MEF2C is required for
cytokine-activated NK cell proliferation, effector function, and metabolism through regulation of SREBP1. Thus,
we propose studies to test the hypothesis that MEF2C activates SREBP1 to increase lipid synthesis and import
after IL-2/15 activation to fuel NK cell effector function and proliferation to mediate protective antiviral responses
during CMV infection. Aim 1 will i) test whether MEF2C is required for mouse NK cell antiviral activity during in
vivo MCMV infection and ii) determine if MEF2C augments human NK cell clearance of HCMV-infected targets.
Aim 2 will i) determine the MEF2C-dependent metabolic pathways in human NK cells and ii) test whether neutral
lipid supplementation can restore effector function and metabolism in MEF2C-deficient human NK cells. Our
proposal will delineate a novel transcriptional regulator of human NK cell metabolism that enhances our
understanding of basic NK cell biology as well as clinically relevant mechanisms of antiviral immunity."
10825294,"Disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBIs), the most common GI problems world-wide, are characterized by
recurring, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including dysmotility (constipation/diarrhea), GI pain and
abnormal gut-brain communication. Treatment options for DGBIs are extremely limited due to a poor
understanding of their pathophysiology. What is known about DGBIs is that the majority of affected patients
have a co-morbid mood disorder, mainly anxiety (AD) but also depression (DD). Like DGBIs, AD and DD are
common and with limited treatment options. Further, studies show an increased risk of DGBI development
with a pre-existent mood disorder and vice versa. Identifying links between DBGIs and mood disorders is
thus highly likely to elucidate mechanisms that instigate development of novel therapies for both conditions.
The transmitter, serotonin (5-HT) modulates symptoms of DGBIs, AD and DD, leading many treatments to be
targeted towards 5-HT regulation. In particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are highly
prescribed. Yet, SSRIs have severe limitations: low remission (<50%) and resolution (<1/3) rates and;
adverse effects (e.g., GI pain, dysmotility, and [paradoxical] anxiety). SSRIs function by inhibiting the
serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), thus increasing 5-HT transmission. SERT is located in the CNS, ENS
and the GI epithelium and SSRIs are systemically absorbed, leading to SSRI action/SERT antagonism in the
CNS, ENS and GI epithelium. Yet, it is not known where SSRIs precisely act to induce their beneficial versus
adverse effects. Our data show that: (1) beneficial SSRI effects (anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-nociceptive)
result from SERT antagonism in the GI epithelium and may involve vagal- and 5-HT3-mediated signaling and;
(2) detrimental SSRI effects result from ENS or CNS SERT antagonism (AD, dysmotility, pain). Thus,
selective pharmacologic blockade of GI epithelial SERT could be beneficial for treating DGBIs, AD and DD
without producing negative effects linked to systemic SSRI exposure. We have created a state-of-the-art
SSRI delivery system that maximally disperses and retains SSRI locally on the intestinal epithelium while
minimizing systemic absorption. We now propose to: (1) elucidate the roles of vagal signaling in linking gut
epithelial 5-HT to beneficial effects on GI pain and mood; (2) examine how ENS SERT ablation affects DGBI
symptoms and mood, to determine if avoidance of ENS SERT antagonism is necessary to prevent negative
and efficacy-reducing effects of systemic SSRIs; (3) determine whether our novel SSRI delivery platform
provides the beneficial mood effects of SSRIs while avoiding deleterious effects on GI pain, GI motility and
mood. If successful, the platform is known to be safe so can be efficiently translated to clinical studies."
10824946,"Project Summary
Malaria remains one of the most significant public health concerns with a substantial proportion of the global
population at risk for disease. In malaria-endemic regions, chronic exposure to the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum leads to the development of antibody responses that confer protection from symptomatic disease.
However, naturally acquired immunity to malaria develops slowly, leaving children susceptible to severe disease
and warranting the development of a highly efficacious malaria vaccine. The only malaria vaccine currently
approved for broad use in malaria-endemic areas has low efficacy and will be insufficient to decrease the burden
of P. falciparum malaria. Because of the challenges in malaria vaccine development, a combination vaccine that
targets multiple parasite stages may be a favorable approach to achieve high vaccine efficacy. Among recently
discovered vaccine candidates for the blood stage, the symptomatic stage of infection targeted by naturally
acquired immunity, the highly conserved and previously uncharacterized P. falciparum protein, PF3D7_1136200
has high potential. Previous studies have shown that antibody responses against PF3D7_1136200 correlate with
protection from symptomatic disease. Despite this strong correlation with protection from disease, little is known
about how antibodies against PF3D7_1136200 inhibit the parasite or what role this protein plays in normal
parasite biology. Our preliminary data suggest that PF3D7_1136200 has low antigenicity during natural infection,
similar to the leading P. falciparum blood stage vaccine candidate PfRh5. However, some malaria-experienced
individuals develop relatively strong antibody responses against the protein and harbor PF3D7_1136200-specific
B cells. Based on previous findings and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that PFD7_1136200 is essential
for parasite invasion and that PF3D7_1136200-specific antibodies are cross-strain reactive and inhibit P.
falciparum growth in vitro. In Specific Aim 1, we aim to characterize PF3D7_1136200-specific antibodies and
determine which regions of the protein are targeted by inhibitory antibodies in an effort to better guide vaccine
design. In Specific Aim 2, we aim to utilize PF3D7_1136200-specific antibodies to determine the localization
and expression of PF3D7_1136200 during the P. falciparum asexual replication cycle. Additionally, we aim to
determine the importance of PF3D7_1136200 through the generation of a drug-inducible PF3D7_1136200
knockdown parasite line and subsequent growth and survival analysis. The data generated from these studies
will elucidate the importance of PF3D7_1136200 in normal P. falciparum biology and identify the domains on
PF3D7_1136200 best suited for targeting via vaccine strategies."
10856149,"SUMMARY
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. The disease is characterized by
the death of retinal ganglion cells after the initial injury to their axons in the optic nerve head and by extensive
changes in the structure of the connective tissues of the optic nerve head. There is consensus that the
intraocular pressure generates a biomechanical response in the tissues of the optic nerve head that is
fundamental to the development of glaucoma axon damage. Mechanical deformation and remodeling of the
optic nerve head in response to a long-term IOP elevation can damage the retinal ganglion cell axons both
directly and indirectly through mechanical activation of the astrocytes and lamina cribrocytes and disruption of
blood flow from the distortion of blood vessels. The cells of the optic nerve head can also react to changes in
the mechanical properties of the connective tissue structures of the optic nerve head in ways that compromise
the physiological support for the axons. The scientific premise of the proposed study is that biomechanical
behaviors and properties of the tissues of the optic nerve head will predict the risk of axon injury in open angle
glaucoma. In Aim 1, we will image the eyes of human subjects with primary open angle glaucoma at different
stages using an optical imaging method called spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Images will be
acquired before and after a change in the intraocular pressure to measure the deformation using digital volume
correlation. The IOP will be changed by laser suture lysis as part of the post-operative care of patients who
have had recent trabeculectomy surgery and by starting or stopping glaucoma medication. In Aim 2, we will
develop patient-specific finite element models. The models will be used to analyze the deformations measured
in Aim 1 to determine the patient-specific mechanical properties of the tissues of the optic nerve head. The
mechanical properties and strains will be analyzed to determine how they vary with age, sex, race, stage of
glaucoma damage, and the rate of past progression. In Aim 3, we will analyze the outcomes in Aims 1 and 2 to
identify potential biomechanical markers for prospective longitudinal studies to evaluate the ability of the
biomechanical markers to predict glaucoma progression. We will also reimage the eyes of participating
patients to measure remodeling to the structure and mechanical properties of the optic nerve head. These
studies will determine whether the deformations and material properties of the tissues of the optic nerve head,
measured by current imaging, image analysis and modeling methods, are predictive of glaucoma progression
and enhance fundamental understanding of how the tissues remodel in open angle glaucoma."
10824717,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 People born preterm are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) and heart failure that will
profoundly shorten their lifespan. This is an emerging epidemic of growing concern because conservative
estimates suggest there are 4 million survivors of preterm birth living in the United States, 40% of which have
subclinical PH. The risk of developing disease is highest in adults born extremely preterm and thus directly
associated with their need for supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth. But how hyperoxia at birth triggers
disease, and whether PH and heart failure are integrated or separate diseases is not known. We propose to fill
this gap in knowledge using lungs of preterm infants, adults who were born preterm, and an established mouse
model wherein hyperoxia between postnatal days (PND) 0-4 causes PH via three distinct stages. The first or
priming stage occurs when the lung is exposed to hyperoxia. During this time, hyperoxia stimulates endothelial
expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) responsible for producing the vasoconstrictive peptide
angiotensin (Ang) II and driving PH when uncontrolled. Hyperoxia also suppresses proliferation of
cardiomyocytes lining the pulmonary vein and extending into the left atrium, resulting in left atrial dilation and
insufficient filling of the left ventricle. This is followed by a latency period where ACE and Ang II levels continue
to increase even though the lung is no longer in hyperoxia and the loss of atrial cardiomyocytes causes
progressive diastolic dysfunction. The third or disease stage is characterized by high NADPH oxidase (NOX) 3
in pericytes, vascular remodeling and congestion, and mortality. The high expression of NOX3 in pericytes was
unexpected and may explain why hyperoxia causes post-capillary remodeling, thus distinguishing it from
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) where smooth muscle cells express NOX4. Building off these findings,
we hypothesize neonatal hyperoxia stimulates expression of ACE in pulmonary endothelial cells, which
persists and increases because of ongoing endothelial injury and diastolic dysfunction, and causes PH
when it dysregulates Ang II and NOX3 later in life. We will determine how hyperoxia regulates ACE in
pulmonary endothelial cells (Aim 1), how NOX3 contributes to vascular remodeling (Aim 2), and whether
suppressing ACE/Ang II signaling effectively reduces PH and diastolic dysfunction caused by hyperoxia (Aim 3).
Understanding how hyperoxia causes cardiovascular disease could advance new concepts on how to best
manage it in people born preterm."
10824902,"This study examines differences in reactive stepping responses between older adults with mild cognitive
impairment and cognitively intact older adults when exposed to novel and repeated gait-trip perturbations. Falls
occur in >30% of older adults each year, most often due to trips, and lead to ~2.8 million hospital admissions,
32,000 deaths, and $50 billion in medical costs. Fall incidence is doubled in older adults with mild cognitive
impairment (OAwMCI), which is a prodromal stage of dementia that affects about 17% of the aging population.
Substantial evidence indicates that OAwMCI have impaired volitional balance control and gait compared to
cognitively intact older adults (CIOA); however, the underlying mechanisms that explain why OAwMCI have a
greater predisposition to falls are yet to be investigated. The main causative factors of falling have been identified
as deficits in reactive balance control, including reduced center of mass (COM) stability and insufficient vertical
limb support post-perturbation, which could be associated with impaired neuromuscular coordination (reduced
muscle synergies). Further, evidence from mobile neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography
(EEG) suggest the role of the cortex in generating a reactive stepping response, as indicated by perturbation-
evoked potentials (e.g., N1) and increase in beta frequency power when exposed to unpredicted perturbations.
However, it is unknown how the pathology related to MCI (structural neural damage, reduced sensorimotor
integration) affects reactive balance responses. Further, it is unknown if OAwMCI are capable of improving their
reactive balance through repeated perturbations. Perturbation training has been introduced as a novel fall
prevention paradigm involving repeated exposure to simulated balance disturbances (e.g., slips, trips), with
robust effects on laboratory and real-life fall reduction. Trial-by-trial analyses indicate that CIOA can acquire
motor adaptations in as little as 5 perturbation exposures, including improvements in biomechanical outcomes
(fall rate, COM stability) and enhanced neuromuscular control (increased muscle synergy number). In theory,
perturbation training could be implemented in OAwMCI to mitigate increased fall risk, however it is first necessary
to assess 1) the magnitude of reactive balance impairment, and 2) the ability to acquire motor adaptations to
repeated perturbations in this population. Thus, we propose a mechanistic investigation to determine differences
in the biomechanical, neuromuscular, and cortical control of reactive balance between OAwMCI and CIOA when
exposed to a novel treadmill gait-trip (Aims 1&2). We will also examine differences in the rate and magnitude of
motor adaptation between OAwMCI and CIOA when exposed to 8 repeated treadmill gait-trips (Aim 3). The
clinical impact of this study will be to mechanistically understand how pathology related to MCI may contribute
to balance impairment and increased fall-risk. Further, with an understanding of how OAwMCI are able to adapt
to repeated perturbations, this study will pave the road for the future design of effective perturbation training
protocols that could significantly improve balance control and reduce fall incidence in OAwMCI."

Policy makers, researchers and public health officials rely on forecasts from infectious disease models to
anticipate resource use, assess risk, and plan public health interventions. In order to effectively and accurately
predict future cases and hospitalization rates of COVID-19, these models depend on high quality data on
infections in the population. However, as clinical testing becomes less reliable with the ubiquity of at-home
antigen tests and the frequency of case reporting is decreased in many states, there is a critical need to identify
alternative data sources. Wastewater-based surveillance is a promising supplement to traditional data sources
for monitoring infection at the population level: it is anonymous, cost-effective, and unaffected by variation in
clinical testing and reporting. It also reflects infections in the population days or weeks sooner than they would
be captured by reported cases or hospitalizations. While there is ample evidence that wastewater concentrations
of SARS-CoV-2 correlate with COVID-19 cases, wastewater data have rarely been used to inform modeling and
forecasting, and the benefit of incorporating wastewater surveillance data into data-driven dynamical models for
forecasting has not been rigorously assessed. The goal of this project is to leverage a rich dataset from the New
York State Wastewater Surveillance Network to evaluate the potential for wastewater surveillance data to
improve inference of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Partnering with the New York State Wastewater
Surveillance Network, which includes over 150 wastewater treatment plants across 61 counties of New York
State and represents a population of more than 15 million, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the value
of wastewater surveillance for modeling at a larger scale. We will build on an existing metapopulation model
developed by the Shaman Lab to test how inference and forecasting of transmission dynamics can be improved
by integrating wastewater data. In other words, we will use retrospective data from New York State to rigorously
assess: can we predict future cases more accurately by using wastewater data to inform our models? This study
would be the first that we know of to use a metapopulation structure, which considers population movement, to
model SARS-CoV-2 with wastewater surveillance data. By more realistically modeling how human populations
move and mix, this model structure can better capture real-world transmission dynamics. This will be crucial to
realistically evaluate whether wastewater data can be relied on in the future to forecast COVID-19 incidence,
which will be particularly important as clinical testing fluctuates and case reporting becomes sparser. It may also
motivate the application of wastewater-based modeling to other pathogens detectable in feces, facilitating the
development of prompt, cost-effective forecasts of other communicable diseases in the future."

Combinatorial screens characterize the molecular pathways of the cell by identifying interactions between
perturbations. Quantifying interactions requires a notion of non-interaction (i.e., a null interaction model), which
is well-established for combinatorial screens measuring cell survival and other simple phenotypes. However,
recent advances in single-cell omics and automated microscopy have enabled combinatorial screens with high-
dimensional phenotypic profiles. These phenotypic profiles consist of features with unknown, non-linear
behavior, such as gene expression or image features. As a result, there is no well-defined null interaction model
for combinatorial screens with high-dimensional phenotypes.
The goal of my proposal is to establish a null interaction model for high-dimensional phenotypes. My approach,
termed DENIM (Data-driven Estimation of Null Interaction Models), aims to use robust estimation models to learn
an additive representation for null perturbations and improve quantification of interactions across combinatorial
screen datasets. In addition, this framework has a key application in drug target identification by enabling
accurate prioritization of chemical-genetic interactions from microscopy-based phenotypic profiles.
My central hypothesis is that null interaction models which accurately model the diverse behavior of high-
dimensional features can substantially improve interaction detection. In Aim 1, I will develop and critically assess
DENIM using both simulated and real-world combinatorial datasets with gene expression or high-content imaging
readouts. I will evaluate DENIM against existing baselines on the ability to accurately interaction strength in
simulation, as well as recapitulate known interactions between gene pairs or drug pairs. Preliminary data from
simulation demonstrates that DENIM can accurately identify and learn non-linear perturbation trajectories, which
leads to improvement in performance relative to the standard baseline (i.e., vector addition). In Aim 2, I will
leverage the improved prioritization of interactions provided by DENIM to perform drug target identification. This
target identification platform requires large-scale genetic perturbations and the study of chemical-genetic
interactions. To this end, preliminary results show that large-scale genetic perturbations can be accurately
conducted using pooled genetic screening followed by in situ sequencing for guide demultiplexing. Moreover, I
analyzed a pilot screen on a well-established MEK1/2 inhibitor, where I accurately recovered target pathway
components, with similar performance using drug-relevant or drug-agnostic biomarkers. Together, completion of
this proposal will result in a rigorous framework for high-dimensional interactions, benchmarking of null
interaction models, and a novel platform for chemical-genetic target identification using microscopy-based
phenotypic profiles."
10827961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adults in the United States. Acute kidney injury
(AKI) is a common, expensive, and lethal complication of cirrhosis. The strongest predictor of AKI in cirrhosis
patients, regardless of etiology, is chronic kidney disease (CKD), as measured by estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). Given that there is a rising incidence of both AKI and CKD in this population, there is a
developing critical need for clinical tools that identify cirrhosis patients at risk for AKI before its development.
This proposal’s three research aims address this need. Leveraging an ongoing cohort with >1000
decompensated cirrhosis patients with >2500 banked biospecimens, these aims will: (1) establish the
independent association between renal health biomarkers and AKI and compare the discrimination of novel
renal health biomarkers to serum creatinine (sCr) to predict AKI (Aim 1); develop and internally validate a
clinical risk tool to identify cirrhosis patients most vulnerable to AKI (Aim 2); explore the association between
longitudinal changes in renal health biomarkers on AKI reversibility (Aim 3).
I am a hepatologist specializing in liver transplantation at the University of California, San Francisco. Through a
pilot award provided by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, we have generated the
preliminary data needed for this application. These data, coupled with a strong foundation of hepatology and
nephrology research (Master of Advanced Studies in Clinical Research, >10 publications), have prepared me
for this proposal. However, there are several gaps in my training that this NIDDK K23 Career Development
Award will address (e.g., cohort development, advanced statistical techniques). Under the direct supervision of
a multidisciplinary team of leaders in nephrology (Hsu, Liu), hepatology (Lai), and biostatistics (McCulloch), I
will execute a detailed career development plan to accelerate my path toward 4 career goals outlined in this
proposal: (1) to develop a foundation of core nephrological principles; (2) to acquire analytic skills to validate
biomarker use; (3) to learn novel methodologies at risk prediction, including machine learning techniques; (4)
to expand a cohort and to apply methods of longitudinal data analysis. As part of my 5-year plan, I will actively
engage in coursework and structured tutorials in nephrology and biostatistics, and interdisciplinary
development and leadership programs. In addition, I will integrate myself into the nephrology research
community and establish a network of nephrology researchers for current and future collaboration.
RELEVANCE: Identifying a metric that captures which cirrhosis patients are at greatest risk for and least likely
to reverse from AKI has important clinical implications—it will allow for the implementation of interventions that
prevent the occurrence and halt the progression of a major driver of mortality in this population."

Personal neoantigens have been conceptualized as optimal tumor antigens but their broad applicability across
cancers has been limited by the variability in mutational burden across tumors. Recent clinical experiences in
targeting neoantigens, such as by vaccination, in high and moderate mutation-rate tumors (e.g. melanoma,
glioblastoma) have been promising, but such promise for low mutation burden cancers remains under evaluation.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an example of such a low mutation burden malignancy where improved
tumor antigen identification could open new therapeutic opportunities. Indeed, although a growing
armamentarium of clinically active therapies is now available for CLL (i.e. targeted inhibitors, CAR-T cells, CPB),
CLL remains largely incurable. While inherently immunogenic, as highlighted by evidence of spontaneous
regression and its responsiveness to the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity of allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (allo-HCT), CLL patients demonstrate inconsistent ability to mount antigen-specific immunity.
Notably, we have achieved several exciting technologic advances over the last 5 years that impact antigen
discovery, including: (i) new understanding of the cancer genome and transcriptome, advanced by new
sequencing technologies, yielding potential alternative sources of cancer neoantigens; (ii) establishment of a
scalable approach to rapidly validate peptide-MHC interactions, providing essential experimental feedback to
our prediction efforts; (iii) improvements in the sensitivity, throughput and analysis of immunopeptidome data;
(iv) expanded computational infrastructure to rapidly incorporate findings into prediction models for HLA class I.
In this application, we hypothesize that novel classes of neoantigens are discoverable in CLL and that
antigen-specific interactions arising from recognition of these alternative neoantigens could contribute
to leukemia control. We propose an integrative strategy for the discovery and validation of novel neoantigen
species. This commences with detection analyses of alterations that could encode these alternative CLL
neoantigens through long-read and ribosomal sequencing, that can be used to inform improvements on the
analysis pipelines. It then proceeds with validation using new high throughput binding assays, immunopeptidome
detection and T cell response assessments (Aim 1). Our strategy further involves systematic improvement of
our class I prediction tools through generation of experimental data from which we can iteratively correct and
refine the epitope predictions. We furthermore incorporate the feature of peptide-MHC stability, which has been
increasingly identified as relevant in peptide-MHC immunogenicity (Aim 2). Finally, we propose to confirm the
functional relevance of alternative tumor neoantigens through their evaluation in the context of variation in natural
history of CLL in a newly-assembled cohort of >1000 molecularly characterized samples, and within the setting
of therapeutic response following whole CLL cell vaccination after alloHCT (Aim 3). We thus propose to expand
the ‘universe’ of CLL neoantigens and to define their impact within informative clinically annotated CLL datasets."

Ciliopathies are genetic disorders that arise from cilia loss or dysfunctional signaling, characterized by a multitude
of defects, including neurological symptoms. A subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are enriched in
primary cilia, including receptors for the modulatory neurotransmitter, dopamine. Dopamine receptor (DR) cilia
localization was described a decade ago, yet the underlying cellular trafficking machinery remains largely
undefined. Interestingly, published work from our lab and others supports the hypothesis that the DR cilia
targeting mechanism is selective and distinct from other ciliary GPCRs. Moreover, the impact of cilia-specific DR
signaling on neuronal function and activity is largely unexplored.
This proposal aims to test two central hypotheses: (1) DR cilia trafficking is mechanistically distinct from the
prevailing understanding of GPCR cilia localization, and (2) DR signaling from the primary cilium impacts
neuronal cAMP downstream of dopaminergic stimulation. We will take a multifaceted approach in order to tackle
these questions using IMCD3 cells, an established ciliated cell culture model ideal for investigating the molecular
mechanisms underpinning GPCR cilia trafficking. First, we will elucidate and refine the DR sequence motifs
necessary and sufficient for cilia localization. We will then employ unbiased, quantitative proteomics to uncover
novel factors that bind directly to DRs, and are required for cilia localization. Next, we will test whether DR cilia
targeting requires a distinct subset of cilia transport machinery from other cilia-localized GPCRs using standard
biochemical and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. Furthermore, this proposal will test the hypothesis that
the structural determinants and cilia trafficking proteins required for DR cilia trafficking in heterologous cells are
conserved in striatal medium spiny neurons, the endogenous DR context. Finally, we will examine the
downstream consequences of cilia-specific DR activation, focusing on cAMP, in striatal neurons. The proposed
experiments will greatly expand our understanding of selective ciliary trafficking mechanisms, and be the first to
examine the impact of localized DR signaling from primary cilia in neurons. In addition, the training plan and
institutional support detailed in this proposal provide exceptional tools for advancing the applicant towards a
career as an independent scientist."

This research project focuses on testing and finding cures for patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), the most common adult blood cancer. CLL is still an incurable type of cancer derived from B
cells, which normally produce antibodies to protect the human body from infections. Although ibrutinib and
venetoclax have been approved by the FDA to treat CLL, a large group of CLL patients suffer from chronic
toxicities and have to stop using these two drugs. In addition, some CLL patients develop drug resistance and
their disease becomes diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is even harder to treat than CLL. We
have shown that both mouse and human CLL cells require activation of a protein called spliced X box-binding
protein-1 (XBP-1s) to support their growth and survival. We have developed a drug named B-I09 that can
effectively suppress XBP-1 and kill CLL cells. In addition, our new results have shown that CLL cells
significantly reduce their expression of a protein called stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Based on our
results suggesting that reduced STING in CLL cells may contribute to their survival, we propose to use ADU-
S100, a STING activator currently in clinical trials, to stimulate the remaining STING to kill CLL cells. Based on
the link between XBP-1s and STING in regulating the same survival mechanism, namely, B cell receptor
(BCR) signaling, we propose to test whether B-I09 and ADU-S100 can synergize to kill cultured mouse and
human CLL cells. To enable these studies, we have engineered a novel mouse model in which CLL cells
produce no STING. We will use this model to test whether ADU-S100 can activate the immune system to
synergize with B-I09 to effectively eradicate CLL. Finally, based on our recent progress in successfully
developing stimuli-responsive inhibitors of the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway, we propose to conjugate B-I09 to a
single-domain antibody (or nanobody) against human CD20, an integral membrane protein expressed at high
levels in CLL cells in order to target the drug to these cells. The resulting nanobody-drug conjugate (NDC) will
be evaluated in cells and in vivo for suppression of XBP-1s, reduction of tumor burden, and synergy with ADU-
S100 in a novel STING-deficient, human CD20-expresssing CLL mouse model. These studies will serve as the
foundation for initiating phase I clinical trials to treat human patients diagnosed with CLL, DLBCL, or potentially
other solid tumors with an inhibitor of XBP-1s in combination with an activator of STING. The development of
the first NDC to target XBP-1s will open a new and important avenue to enable cell-specific inhibition of XBP-
1s in various cell types as long as such cells express a unique cell surface marker. These novel XBP-1s-
targeting NDCs can also be used to interrogate the biology of the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway in various cell types,
and as therapeutics."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Obesity: Causes and Consequences,
organized by Drs. Giles S.H. Yeo, Karine Clément and Murielle Véniant-Ellison. The conference will be held in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from February 4-7, 2024.
Over the last four decades, the prevalence of obesity has tripled in the population. Along with its wide range of
comorbidities, obesity is associated with a substantial proportion of the worldwide non-communicable disease
burden. In parallel, the emergence of innovative therapies is transforming the field of obesity. This Keystone
Symposia conference is designed to explore the latest research focused on the causes of obesity, including
genetics, environmental impacts, and hypothalamic dysfunction, as well as how the heterogeneity of obesity
affects the field’s approach to its precision management. The sessions also emphasize the metabolic
consequences of obesity, including Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, as well as cardiovascular, liver and
renal disease. Finally, the program will touch on innovation in treatment and new molecular targets. While the
value of model organisms is recognized in the field, this program was designed to focus on the model that matters
most: humans. This conference will be paired with another Keystone Symposia conference entitled
Cardiometabolic Diseases: The Role of Ethnic Diversity in Precision Medicine, where shared scientific sessions
will explore cross connectivity of genetics and precision obesity management. These joint conferences will also
bring together an interdisciplinary group of investigators with different focus areas within the field, ranging from
‘big data’ to detailed mechanistic studies. Participants of both conferences will also have an opportunity to
network at shared meals and poster sessions. This unique environment will lead to new scientific collaborations
and the implementation of precision medicine approaches directed at better understanding and treating
cardiometabolic disease."
10825724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a common, serious, and costly condition among older adults. Weight loss (WL) is an effective strategy
to combat obesity-related comorbidities; however, the safety of WL interventions for older adults remains
controversial due to potential exacerbation of age-related muscle and bone loss that increases fracture risk.
Mechanical stimuli, such as resistance training (RT), can be effective in mitigating WL-associated bone loss, but
there are many barriers to success of RT programs for older adults, including low adherence and accessibility.
In response, our group has proposed that a weighted vest may serve as an alternative for maintaining mechanical
stress during intentional WL, but it is unclear whether this vest will have similar preservation effects on bone
when compared to RT. Therefore, our ongoing 12-month WL trial of 150 older adults living with obesity, INVEST
in Bone Health (NCT04076618) is exploring the effects of WL alone versus WL plus weighted vest use or WL
plus RT on indicators of bone health and fracture risk, with the primary outcome being 12-month change in total
hip volumetric (vBMD) as measured by computed tomography (CT). This F31 proposal enhances the parent
study by adding new analyses of the CT scans acquired for this study to investigate indicators of muscle health.
As WL-associated muscle loss often precedes bone loss, preserving muscle health may also have clinical
relevance to the reduction of fracture risk. Aim 1 will develop an automated image analysis platform to process
baseline, 6- and 12-month participant CT scans to measure muscle quantity and quality and assess intervention
effects. Aim 2 will utilize CT data for development of subject-specific finite element models to assess longitudinal
bone strength and muscle-bone associations in response to WL. Taken together, completion of these aims will
provide automated techniques to support future large-scale research projects and opportunistic CT assessments
of muscle in clinical care, while also furthering our understanding of the mechanistic relationship between WL-
associated changes in muscle and bone. In addition to augmenting the suite of musculoskeletal outcomes in the
INVEST trial, this fellowship will provide the predoctoral principal investigator (PI) with valuable training from an
experienced mentorship team in the areas of: 1) aging and clinical trials, 2) data management, interpretation,
and biostatistics, 3) muscle and bone epidemiology, 4) machine learning and imaging informatics, and 5)
computational biomechanics. This research will be conducted at Wake Forest University as an interdisciplinary
collaboration between the Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Health and Exercise Science, Radiology,
and Statistical Sciences. Together, this collaborative environment and an expert team of mentors will support
the PI’s training to achieve independency in her research career while successfully completing her doctoral
dissertation. This project, as an extension of the PI’s ongoing work with the INVEST trial, will refine her technical
engineering and professional skillsets, and launch her career as an independent bioengineering researcher
focused on developing and applying advanced image analyses to study musculoskeletal health in aging."

Structural birth defects (SBDs) encompass a spectrum of congenital abnormalities affecting a wide range of
human organ systems. Progress in sequencing technologies has enabled significant advances in the discovery
of coding mutations underlying SBDs through whole-exome sequencing. Nonetheless, to date most cases
continue to remain “unsolved”, creating a major barrier to diagnostic interpretation and therapeutic development.
In particular, the identification and interpretation of mutations in noncoding sequence, which constitutes 98% of
the human genome, has presented a formidable challenge. The present proposal addresses the hypothesis that
noncoding sequence represents a major reservoir of causal mutations explaining many unsolved SBD cases.
Specifically, we will focus on distant-acting transcriptional enhancers, a predominant class of noncoding genome
elements with critical regulatory functions in embryonic development. There are isolated examples of SBD-
causing enhancer mutations, but three principal hurdles have prevented their identification at scale: a) the lack
of whole genome sequence data (WGS) from unsolved cases; b) inadequate annotations of noncoding genome
functions; c) the lack of testing pipelines to assess the in vivo relevance of enhancer mutations and determine
their causality. In this proposal, we address these challenges by creating an integrated pipeline for the
identification, function-based prioritization, and in vivo validation of causality of enhancer mutations in SBD
cases. This proposal will take advantage of growing aggregated WGS data, advanced analysis pipelines for
mutation identification, a unique catalog of prioritized predictions of developmental in vivo enhancers, and
advanced mouse engineering capabilities for in vivo validation of enhancers and enhancer mutations. Our
specific aims include: 1) Prioritize de novo noncoding gene regulatory mutations identified in growing
WGS catalogs in SBD patients. Taking advantage of preexisting aggregated WGS genetic data and innovative
analysis strategies, we will identify noncoding mutations in SBD at unprecedented scale. Noncoding findings will
be interpreted and prioritized using DevCisReg, a comprehensive catalog of gene regulatory sequences we
developed from analysis of >800 human and mouse epigenomic data sets. 2) Functionally test prioritized SBD
noncoding mutations for impacts on gene expression in scaled transgenic mouse enhancer assays. We
will use a targeted CRISPR-enabled transgenic approach to characterize 200 candidate enhancer alleles in mice
and determine which mutations impact on gene expression in vivo. 3) Functionally model prioritized SBD
noncoding mutations in knockin mice. We will create and phenotype 40 knockin mouse lines with human
alleles to test the in vivo impact of regulatory mutations in live animals. We will focus on mutations from SBDs
that can be modeled and studied by streamlined phenotyping in mice to increase the likelihood we can detect a
defect in vivo. Together, these efforts will create an integrated mutation-to-phenotype identification and testing
pipeline that will provide conclusive in vivo evidence for establishing the causality of enhancer mutations in SBD."

Chronic low back pain (LBP) is one of the major contributors to musculoskeletal pain, disability, and lost workdays
in the United States. LBP is highly correlated with degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Discogenic pain,
specifically, is the leading cause of LBP. Patients with chronic discogenic LBP often exhibit aberrant sensory
nerve growth deep within the disc. Once nerves are present in the degenerate disc they can be subjected to a
complex milieu of pro-inflammatory mediators and dynamic mechanical loads causing stimulation and therefore
pain. Binding of pro-inflammatory mediators to receptors on nociceptors results in lowered stimulation thresholds
of ion channels responsible for action potential generation. Whereas mechanical loading of the disc can cause
direct stimulation of mechanosensitive ion channels resulting in pain sensation. Previous work has explored the
use of local delivery of an anti-inflammatory to the disc, however, incomplete pain resolution was observed. No
work has examined targeting mechanoreceptors in the disc to alleviate chronic discogenic LBP. Further, no
studies have yet been able to parse out which the role of nerve presence, inflammation, or mechanical loading
is the major contributor to emergent pain. This question remains unanswered due to a lack of animal models that
accurately mimic human presentation of chronic discogenic LBP.
Taken together, these data support our overarching hypothesis that the presence of new nociceptors in the disc
combined with inflammation and/or mechanical loading leads to chronic discogenic LBP, and targeted peripheral
therapies may alleviate LBP. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an animal model of chronic discogenic
LBP that exhibits a robust behavioral pain phenotype and nerve infiltration deep within the disc. By using
innovative rodent models and targeted blockade of nerve growth, inflammatory mediators or mechanical sensing
we will probe the roles of nerve presence, inflammation, and loading in LBP. We will then use this information to
develop novel approaches to alleviate chronic discogenic LBP. Further, findings will be validated in aged animals
which are more representative of a human LBP patient. The proposed work will use novel approaches using
targeted neuro-inhibition, anti-inflammatories and mechanoreceptor antagonism to decouple the role of nerve
presence, inflammation, and mechanical loading in LBP. The outcomes from this work include and better
understanding of the specific mechanisms of LBP, laying the foundation to develop peripherally targeted pain for
an intractable and widespread condition that is increasing in prevalence."
10826792,"Preclinical and clinical research provides strong evidence that psilocybin and other 5-HT2A agonist/partial
agonist psychedelics have antiaddictive effects. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial of psilocybin-
assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD), administration of psilocybin resulted in robust decreases in
drinking which were sustained for 28 weeks following drug administration. Self-report measures showed that
psilocybin treatment was associated with decreased alcohol craving and decreased negative emotionality (NE).
Data from an fMRI pilot study in a sub-sample of trial participants (n = 11) showed normalization of response to
alcohol cues and negative emotional stimuli following psilocybin (relative to active placebo). A substantial body
of research investigating on the antidepressant effects of psilocybin have confirmed the positive effects of
psilocybin on NE in several animal models of depression and chronic stress, and four recent randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of psilocybin in the treatment of major depression have demonstrated consistently large
effects of psilocybin on mood, persisting for weeks or months after a single administration of the drug.
 Building on the work described above, we now propose a mechanistic trial specifically designed to
elucidate the effects of psilocybin on neural activity in AUD, and the relationship of these effects to treatment
outcomes. We will focus primarily on the effects of psilocybin on the processing of alcohol cues and NE stimuli.
Participants (n = 90) with moderate to severe AUD who are currently engaged in residential treatment and have
achieved initial sobriety will be randomly assigned to receive a single administration of high-dose psilocybin (n =
60) vs. low-dose psilocybin control (n = 30), using a low-intensity supportive therapy model designed to minimize
and account for the effect of patient and therapist expectancies. While in residential treatment, participants will
complete fMRI sessions 3 days before and 2 days after psilocybin administration. fMRI measures include a well-
validated task to evaluate neural and subjective response to negative affective visual stimuli and alcohol cues,
as well as resting state functional connectivity. Alcohol use data (self-report and serum biomarkers) and self-
report measures tapping NE, craving, and aspects of executive function will be collected prior to psilocybin
administration and during the 24 weeks following discharge from residential treatment.
 Aims are 1) to evaluate the effects of high- vs. low-dose psilocybin on AUD patients’ neural response to
visual negative affective stimuli and alcohol cues, drinking outcomes and self-report measures related to NE,
craving, and EF; 2) to identify neural metrics (activation and functional connectivity) that best predict drinking
outcomes (TLFB) and self-report measures of craving and negative affect; and 3) to identify likely responders to
high-dose psilocybin treatment by using machine learning and other advanced statistical methods.
Understanding psilocybin’s mechanisms of action may lead to new therapeutic targets in AUD and new
medications that engage them, including both psychedelic and non-psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists."

Long-term success of transplantation and achieving transplant tolerance in the clinic is hindered by recipient
sensitization and immunological memory, which predominantly arise as a result of graft rejection, pregnancy and
blood transfusions. Paradoxically, semi-allogeneic pregnancy provides a unique example of allogeneic tolerance
spontaneously induced in adults. Using preclinical mouse models, we showed that semi-allogeneic pregnancy
simultaneously induces T cell tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus and to subsequent offspring-matched heart
grafts. However, pregnancy also induces humoral sensitization to fetal antigens, and this sensitization overrides
pregnancy-induced as well as co-stimulation-induced allograft acceptance. Our research aims to define the
mechanisms underlying humoral sensitization by semi-allogeneic pregnancy, and how this sensitization over-
rides pregnancy-induced and co-stimulation blockade-induced T cell tolerance of offspring-matched heart grafts.
In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that at a cellular level, pregnancy enables the differentiation of CD4+ T cells
into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells providing help to fetus-specific B cells and facilitating their differentiation into
post-partum B cells and antibody-secreting cells. Simultaneously, pregnancy induceds a persistent state of cell-
intrinsic hypofunction in fetus-specific non-Tfh cells. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that pregnancy-
sensitized Tfh, B cell and antibody responses synergize to constitute a barrier to the induction of transplantation
tolerance by co-stimulation blockade. Completion of this project will provide an in-depth mechanistic
understanding for the basis and consequence of humoral sensitization by semi-allogeneic pregnancy, and
identify treatments capable of preventing and reversing this sensitization. The long-term goal of this project is to
improve access to transplantation in historically-disadvantaged multiparous women and to optimize their post-
transplant outcomes through the induction of transplant tolerance."

Label-free optical microscopy has emerged as a promising method for rapid imaging of fresh, unprocessed
surgical specimens. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) – a label-free, non-destructive, high-sensitivity optical
imaging method – combined with artificial intelligence (AI) has been used for bedside brain tumor diagnosis,
margin delineation, and molecular genetic prediction. Previous AI methods are limited because they rely on
weak, slide- or patient-level annotations for model training. Importantly, these annotations fail to capture the
cellular complexity and spatial heterogeneity found in diffuse gliomas, the most common and deadly primary
brain tumor. A major barrier to advancing the role of label-free optical imaging in diffuse glioma research and
patient treatment is developing strategies to allow AI-based computer vision models to learn rich, high-
resolution, single-cell optical image features, which allow for a more complete description of the underlying
tumor biology. The objective of this research is to determine if an AI-based computer vision system can learn
single-cell optical image features. I will (1) detect single cells in diffuse glioma specimens imaged using SRH;
(2) optimize learned single-cell features using representative single-cell examples, which we call exemplar
learning; and (3) identify patient-level clusters based on optical single-cell features. Successful completion of
this proposal will reduce the reliance of AI on weak annotations, and advance the role of AI in diffuse glioma
research and treatment via single-cell optical features and patient-level clusters. In the long term, AI methods
in this proposal can be integrated with the diagnosis workflow using optical imaging, and provide physicians
with additional tools to further differentiate diffuse gliomas, and enable better and more personalized care."

Despite a long-term focus on the role of Amyloid Beta (Aβ) peptide plaques in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
pathology, downstream processes connecting cause to effect remain unclear, limiting the synthesis of targeted
therapeutic compounds. Furthermore, controversy surrounds which species of Aβ are cytotoxic, and clinical
trials designed to target Aβ directly have been less successful than anticipated. This adds critical importance to
the need to step back and define alternative systems-wide changes that exacerbate AD pathology and might
instead be modulated to lower disease risk. Loss of metabolic homeostasis is one of the hallmarks of the aging
process that might contribute to AD pathophysiology and neurodegeneration. In support of this hypothesis,
recent data show that, beyond type II diabetes, obese patients with metabolic dysfunction have increased risk
of AD, while dietary restriction (DR) maintains metabolic homeostasis and is neuroprotective. Taken together,
these data suggest a key underlying risk factor for AD that might be targeted for therapeutics is metabolic
dysfunction. However, causal links between age-onset changes in energetics and AD are unclear. AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved master regulator of energy homeostasis that we and
others have shown links energetics to the rate of aging in multiple species. AMPK is a central homeostatic
regulator of multiple cellular systems including transcriptional and post-translational signaling networks, protein
homeostasis, and organelle dynamics. Which of these links the effects of AMPK and metabolic dysfunction to
AD is unclear. Since negative feedback loops tend to exist to return a cell to homeostasis, targeting multiple
effectors of AMPK in tandem rather than AMPK alone may prove more effective in AD. We recently reported
that AMPK increases lifespan in C. elegans via remodeling of systemic mitochondrial metabolism, which
correlates with mitochondrial network fragmentation in peripheral tissues. In addition, we have shown a role for
RNA splicing homeostasis in the effects of AMPK on longevity and the UPRER modulator XBP-1. Here we use
C. elegans to expedite discovery of cellular mechanisms that modulate the effect of AMPK on AD
pathophysiology, and target multiple networks simultaneously to reduce age and Aβ induced decline in
neuronal function."

Background: Approximately 300,000 Hispanic individuals experience respiratory failure each year in the U.S.
Hispanic patients are twice as likely to die from respiratory failure as non-Hispanic patients. There is an urgent
need to identify and remediate mechanisms for this disparity. The investigative team’s preliminary work
identified two potential mechanisms: Hispanic patients with respiratory failure are more likely to be deeply
sedated and less likely to receive physical therapy than non-Hispanic patients, which are both associated with
mortality and poor long-term functional outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to promote equitable
outcomes for Hispanic patients with respiratory failure through changes in intensive care unit (ICU) practice.
Specific Aims and Project Methods: Aim 1: Evaluate trajectories of long-term functional outcomes for
Hispanic and non-Hispanic survivors of respiratory failure. An analysis of a unique registry of patients with
respiratory failure will examine risk-adjusted trajectories of six-month mortality and functional outcomes among
96 Hispanic and 96 matched non-Hispanic control patients. Aim 2: Characterize care delivery for respiratory
failure by ethnicity. Detailed site visits at ten diverse U.S. hospitals will be integrated with interviews and
surveys of ICU clinicians to understand delivery of deep sedation and other care processes that preliminary
work demonstrate to be differentially applied by ethnicity. Aim 3: Refine and pilot an intervention targeting
inequitable care delivery. The team’s preliminary intervention to promote equity in care delivery for respiratory
failure will be iteratively refined through patient, family, and clinician engagement and piloted at two U.S. ICUs.
Unique Aspects of this Proposal: This proposal tackles an enduring problem in critical care—detecting,
understanding, and eliminating disparities—by uniting a sociologist with expertise in disparities research and
intervention design with a critical care physician with expertise in health services research. With an
experienced team of co-investigators, preeminent National Advisory Board, and rigorous mixed-methods
design, the PIs are uniquely equipped to address this pressing challenge.
Anticipated Impact: NHLBI’s Report on Addressing Respiratory Health Equity emphasizes the elimination of
disparities in respiratory health will remain aspirational without robust evidence and innovations in intervention
design. The outcome of this study will be a characterization of care delivery contributing to inequitable
outcomes among Hispanic patients with respiratory failure and an intervention aimed at mitigating disparities."

This is an entrepreneurship-focused educational program with the overarching goal of training the workforce of the future with the necessary broad knowledge base required for the successful commercialization of promising clinical and translational research that will help to address the growing public health crisis posed by Alzheimer’s Disease and AD Related Disorders (ADRD). We will be taking a national approach to this challenging area in order to engage with the most promising graduate and postdoctoral researchers from around the country, leveraging the robust NIH investment in Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) and Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) programs. This R25 program will provide trainees with a keen understanding of the interdisciplinary, clinical and translational nature of research and commercialization related to ADRD, how it depends on fundamental underpinnings of both science, engineering and regulatory science, and how commercial products are developed. The knowledge base, mentorship and ecosystem supported by this R25 will help them prepare competitive SBIR/STTR grants to further their work. 
We have identified a robust network of commercial, regulatory and academic experts that will allow us to address our core aims: 1) Training in entrepreneurial skill development for ADRD technologies in a structured didactic curriculum that includes foundational elements, case-based learning, and personalized components tailored to their specific domain (i.e., ADRD small molecule development, biologics, digital health, etc.) leveraging the extensive resources developed at the University of Pennsylvania, including the Academic Entrepreneurship for Medical and Health Scientists textbook (of which Dr. Gooneratne is the lead editor); 2) Mentored research experience with tailored guidance to maximize stakeholder/customer discovery and product iteration and experiential learning opportunities to complement any gaps in their commercialization plans; 3) Curriculum development through innovative modification of Individual Development Plans (IDPs) to incorporate entrepreneurship; and 4) Workforce diversity enhancement through efforts to support participation of under-represented minorities (URM). Five to ten trainees will be enrolled each year, and they will have a research mentor, a business mentor and an R25 program mentor to ensure that they receive comprehensive support and guidance. Trainees will participate in the program for two years, with the first year dedicated to learning and development with the goal of submitting an initial SBIR/STTR grant application by month 15 or sooner, then the second year devoted to additional activities to support a grant resubmission or successfully initiate the funded grant. We seek ultimately to develop a community of highly trained entrepreneurs and researchers in ADRD that can engage in interdisciplinary team science with sustained engagement through an active, participatory ecosystem to serve as the nidus for meaningful advances as we confront the looming healthcare challenge posed by ADRD."

Over the past several years, we have experienced the social and physical consequences of a viral pandemic;
however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair following such infections are not fully understood. The
lung serves as the site of gas exchange. Due to this function, it is constantly exposed to noxious environmental
stimuli—including bacteria and viruses. Following viral respiratory infection, many of the epithelial cells lining the
airways are lost and must be reconstituted. The epithelial-intrinsic mechanisms underlying such recovery are
well understood, but the role of the immune system in this process is not well defined. In close contact with
epithelial cells in the distal lung are alveolar macrophages, innate immune cells capable of sensing diverse
stimuli and integrating these signals into effector responses. Our previous work has shown that macrophages
engage in reciprocal growth factor exchange with fibroblasts, a communication circuit we predict to be active in
other cell types and contexts. In the lung, macrophages have been observed to help mediate inflammation and
repair via communication with epithelial cells following injury, however, the role of these interactions in the context
of viral infection remains unknown. Using a mouse-adapted influenza A virus, we observe a marked loss of
epithelial cells followed by rapid recovery, all under a constant presence of macrophages. This study aims to
determine the role of macrophages in this repair process. We hypothesize that optimal epithelial repair
requires macrophages at specific time points and anatomical locations following viral-induced damage.
We also propose that bidirectional crosstalk between macrophages and epithelial cells promotes tissue
repair. The proposed work will serve to 1) define when and where macrophages are required for optimal repair
following viral injury and 2) provide mechanistic understanding of macrophage-epithelial communication
networks in the injured and regenerating lung. Completion of this project will allow us to identify molecular targets
whose modulation may improve patient outcomes following viral infection. The Franklin lab is the ideal research
environment to perform these studies. Dr. Franklin (sponsor) is an expert in macrophage biology and has
previously unraveled interactions between macrophages and non-immune cells. Our location at Harvard Medical
School also grants access to world-class experts and resources to complete our aims. For example, Dr. Carla
Kim (co-sponsor) is an expert on lung damage and repair and will provide guidance on lung biology and epithelial
progenitor cell function following damage. Together, my mentoring team and institutional resources will help me
achieve the goals outlined in this proposal and allow me to grow both as a scientist and an individual."

Language learning is a critical aspect of children’s development, laying the groundwork for future social and
academic success. Understanding how language learning begins in infancy has long been a key project of
developmental psychology and cognitive science. However, current theories of language acquisition make
unrealistic assumptions about the nature of speech, infants’ entry point to their future native language. Current
accounts assume that words in speech can be translated into consistent phonological (sound) representations
by infants and adults alike. In reality, how a speaker pronounces a given word is fundamentally variable, so
much so that many pronunciations, even in infant-directed speech, are unintelligible on their own and can only
be understood by adults because adults can leverage their top-down linguistic knowledge about the
surrounding sounds and words. The proposed studies represent one of the first forays into how infants manage
this fundamental pronunciation variability while they are learning the system itself.
Using a multimethod approach, the proposed research investigates the hypothesis that infants rely on temporal
context to interpret reduced pronunciation variants. In normal discourse, including speech to children, first uses
of words are often more clearly spoken than following uses. If infants can connect clear uses and closely-
following reduced forms, this could help them recognize instances of words that would be unintelligible on their
own. Characterizing this process will help make it possible to create better models of how infants begin to
connect the speech signal to meaning.
Study 1, a corpus analysis, analyzes the language input that parents provide by asking how often parents
produce reduced pronunciation variants in different contexts and how these contexts line up with ideal word-
learning opportunities. Studies 2 and 3 use eye-tracking procedures to experimentally investigate infants’ initial
encoding of novel words and recognition of familiar words given naturalistic pronunciation variability. Together,
these three studies will help guide scientific theories of word learning by providing new insight into this
unsolved problem in children’s language acquisition and demonstrating powerful new methods for future
research on how young children handle the messy reality of spoken language.
The proposed research will provide the applicant with the ideal training to advance her career, empowering her
to expand her previous work into a full research program, learn new computational and experimental methods,
and gain critical professional development experience communicating her findings and mentoring students.
These training goals are further supported by a strong institutional environment with many pertinent student
resources and intellectual communities. This training will ultimately prepare the applicant to become a
successful independent researcher."
10825054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver cancer incidence and mortality continue to rise, and new therapeutic targets are needed. This
fellowship application will explore how the enzyme histone deacetylase eleven (HDAC11) drives liver cancer,
and tests HDAC11 as a potential new target for therapy. HDAC11 acts primarily as a lysine fatty acid (KFA)
hydrolase, an enzyme that removes fatty acids from proteins (de-KFA). HDAC11 is expressed at low levels in
most healthy tissues, but is increased in liver cancer, and high levels are significantly correlated with poor
patient outcomes. Proteomic studies have implicated HDAC11 in alternative mRNA splicing, which is prevalent
in most cancers. The overall goal of this application is to understand the role of HDAC11 in liver cancer and
assess the potential of new, highly specific HDAC11 small molecule inhibitors. In two aims, this application will
test the hypothesis that HDAC11 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma through de-KFA of the splicing factor
SF3B2, and that inhibiting HDAC11 will block hepatocellular carcinoma progression. In Aim 1, SF3B2 will be
authenticated as an HDAC11 substrate in established hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a click
chemistry-based approach. Preliminary data confirms the feasibility of this technique and establishes that
SF3B2 can be lysine fatty acylated. Proposed studies will test if HDAC11-mediated de-KFA of SF3B2 changes
its nuclear localization, thereby changing its ability to regulate RNA splicing in the nucleus and resulting in
alternative mRNA expression. To detail the alternative splicing outcomes driven by HDAC11, mRNA isoform
specific long read sequencing will be conducted. The abundance of isoform specific alternative mRNAs in
HDAC11 wild type versus knockout and inhibitor-treated liver cancer will be quantified. In Aim 2, HDAC11
specific small molecule inhibitors will be tested to establish HDAC11 inhibition as a potential cancer treatment
approach. Preliminary data show that HDAC11 inhibition specifically decreases colony formation and increases
drug sensitivity, leading to the inference that HDAC11 may promote cancer cell stemness characteristics such
as self-renewal and drug resistance. Oncogenesis in vivo will be tested following wildtype, knockout, and
inhibitor treatments with disease progression monitored by luminescence imaging. This study will provide new
knowledge on the molecular functions of HDAC11 in alternative mRNA splicing and liver cancer progression,
and evaluate clinically-relevant small molecule inhibitors for potential liver cancer treatment. Completion of the
proposed project will develop necessary research and professional skills that are essential for a career as a
cancer investigator."
10828304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candidate: Daphna Stroumsa, MD, MPH, MSc, is an obstetrician-gynecologist and early career health
services researcher at the University of Michigan, focused on improving healthcare access and quality for
transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) people. Dr. Stroumsa’s long-term career goal is to become an independent
physician-researcher leading the development and evaluation of interventions to decrease health disparities
affecting gender minorities.
Research Context: TGNB people are a highly marginalized population, with unmet gender-affirming needs
and staggering mental health disparities. There is a critical need for effective interventions that address this
significant burden. Peer support interventions hold immense promise in providing critical gender affirmation
and in countering the effects of stigma on health. It is, however, necessary to understand how best to design
and deploy such interventions to meet the specific needs of this population.
Specific Aims: The overarching goal of this proposal is to adapt and pilot-test a peer support intervention to
decrease mental health disparities among TGNB people. The study’s specific aims are to 1) identify the
desired properties and structure of a peer support intervention for TGNB people accessing gender affirming
hormones (GAH), and how these vary by intersecting gender and racial identities; 2) adapt a peer support
intervention to improve mental health among TGNB people presenting for GAH; and 3) evaluate the feasibility
and acceptability of the intervention for improving TGNB people’s mental health in a clinical setting.
Research Plan: The plan relies on a community-engaged, structured process with 1) interviews with TGNB
people and other stakeholders to identify the desired properties of the intervention, 2) An iterative refinement of
the intervention with expert feedback, and 3) A six-month pilot RCT to assess feasibility and acceptability.
Career Development Plan: To achieve independence, Dr. Stroumsa requires additional training in 1)
Community-engaged research, 2) Adaptation of behavioral interventions for marginalized populations, and 3)
Conducting and evaluating clinical trials. Dr. Stroumsa’s training will be supported by an interdisciplinary team
of NIH-funded mentors. The primary co-mentors, Drs. Paul Pfeiffer and Rob Stephenson, have extensive
mentoring experience and expertise designing and evaluating interventions to improve mental health outcomes
with gender and sexual minorities, respectively. Drs. Amy Schulz and Kristi Gamarel (co-mentors) are experts
in community-based participatory research and peer-delivered behavioral interventions designed with and for
TGBN communities, respectively. The training is further supported by regular feedback from advisors,
advanced didactic coursework, and participation in workshops/seminars. These will enable Dr. Stroumsa’s
seamless transition to becoming an independent researcher, working to improve TGNB people’s health
outcomes by developing and testing patient-centered interventions."
10828305,"Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a remarkably adaptive disease. First line therapy for PCa is androgen
deprivation. However, resistance invariably emerges, resulting in a lethal phase termed castration-resistant PCa
(CRPC). Even with the profound AR-targeting achieved by current standard of care agents abiraterone and
enzalutamide, CRPC remains incurable. CRPC is characterized by multiple compensatory signaling
mechanisms including reciprocal activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and AR-ErbB receptor cross-talk.
Notably, these pathways converge on the signaling networks, feedback loops, and cellular mechanisms that
mediate oncogenic lipid metabolism, which is now recognized as a central driver of CRPC growth and
progression. Meaningful improvement in anti-tumor efficacy is likely to require novel strategies that
simultaneously target the AR axis and the network of compensatory signaling pathways on which CRPC depends.
We have identified Sigma1 as a multi-functional scaffolding protein that is aberrantly expressed in PCa and that
it is required for PCa cell growth proliferation. Sigma1 allosterically modulates cancer-specific associated
proteins involved in driving oncogenic lipid metabolism, including AR and ErbB receptors. Sigma1 also regulates
cellular lipid and protein homeostasis pathways, and plays a critical role in supporting the increased demand for
lipid and protein synthesis associated with tumor growth. We have developed a series of novel small molecule
inhibitors of Sigma1 that disrupt lipid homeostasis and induce targeted degradation of AR and ErbB receptors in
PCa cells, resulting in inhibition of PCa growth in vitro and in vivo with minimal toxicity to normal cells. The
overarching problem addressed in this proposal is how to target the critical mechanisms by which lethal CRPC
becomes resistant to AR-targeted therapy. We hypothesize that Sigma1 serves as a multifunctional nexus
between oncogenic driver proteins and lipid metabolism in PCa, such that Sigma1 inhibition disrupts not only
key drivers of tumor growth and lipid metabolism (AR, ErbB), but also inhibit their downstream and convergent
pathways. In Aim 1 we will define a novel Sigma1-AR-ErbB/PI3K/mTOR-lipid metabolism pathway and feedback
loop that engages ErbB/PI3K signaling in CRPC. We will show that the anti-tumor efficacy of Sigma1 inhibitors
in PCa is due to suppression of this pathway as well as disruption of key convergent and complementary cellular
processes critical for PCa growth fueled by lipid metabolism. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate the efficacy of Sigma1
inhibition in a cohort of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models that encompass the genotypic and phenotypic
heterogeneity of CRPC, using in vitro organoid and in vivo tumor models. Inhibition of Sigma1 in PCa represents
a novel therapeutic approach that targets multiple, interdependent mechanisms involved in CRPC progression and
development of resistance, and it provides a rational basis for designing vertical and horizontal combination
treatment strategies to block the enhanced lipid metabolism that fuels lethal, treatment-refractory CRPC."
10828307,"Despite being the most frequent and deadly of the interstitial lung diseases (ILD), Idiopathic Pulmonary
Fibrosis (IPF) remains challenging to diagnose and treat. The diagnostic process for IPF relies on subjective
interpretations of clinical data while current antifibrotic therapies employ a “one size fits all” paradigm. Our
clinical collaborators have been at the forefront of developing `omics approaches to diagnose and define
prognosis in ILDs. Importantly, they identified the first pharmacogenomic interaction suggesting that IPF
patients with rs3750920 TOLLIP T/T genotype strongly benefited from use of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC). Our
project leverages existing partnerships with the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF) Patient Registry and
Biorepository studies. This group has recruited ILD patients who have provided extensive baseline phenotypic
and longitudinal outcome data, biological samples and have consented to be re-contacted for future research.
Our overall objectives are to 1) efficiently conduct a novel precision genotype-based IPF trial using PFF
Clinical Care Network sites; and 2) molecularly characterize a broad range of ILDs and identify genetic variants
associated with IPF risk. An experienced Data Coordinating Center (DCC) with strong statistical leadership and
expertise is key in both design and analysis, particularly when unanticipated issues arise during the conduct of
a clinical trial. The University of Michigan Statistical Analysis of Biomedical and Educational Research
(SABER) unit in a top-ranked Department of Biostatistics will serve as DCC, bringing together an experienced
group of faculty and staff in biostatistics, research design, project management, study monitoring, database
design and data management, and research administration. SABER has a strong track record of collaborations
with the participating pulmonary investigators in the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and clinical sites. The
overarching goal of the UM DCC is to collaborate with study investigators, the CCC, and NHLBI to enable
successful achievement of the study on time and within budget. We will accomplish these goals through the
three specific aims: (1) Enhance scientific rigor by providing statistical and clinical trials methodological
expertise to design, analyze and disseminate research findings; (2) Ensure the collection of timely, accurate
and reproducible data, and maximize adherence to the study protocol; and (3) Provide established
infrastructure and services for study administration and operations and for communication among study
stakeholders. Our leadership, experience, and expertise will promote collaborations, encourage scientific
productivity, and facilitate timely dissemination of findings on “precision medicine era” IPF diagnosis, and
benefits of a “precision” approach with a genotype-driven clinical trial."
10930116,"Project Summary
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that mainly manifests in girls without
effective treatment. RTT is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the Methyl CpG-binding Protein 2 gene
(MECP2) on the X chromosome. The majority of RTT patients are females heterozygous for MECP2 mutation,
in which random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) during development leaves ~50% of neurons without
functional MeCP2 protein, thereby creating cell-autonomous neuronal dysfunction. Corresponding mutations in
hemizygous males lead to severe neonatal encephalopathy and early death. Mice carrying null alleles of Mecp2
closely mimic symptoms seen in patients, including irregular breathing, stereotypical limb movements and
shortened lifespan, and are thus faithful models of RTT. Male Mecp2-null mice start exhibiting symptoms as
early as 30-60 days of age, with only half of the animals surviving beyond 75 days. Heterozygous females have
a near-normal lifespan with neurologic deficits that are delayed (~6 months) and highly variable in severity. A
major breakthrough in RTT research was the demonstration that RTT-like symptoms in adult mice can be
reversed by genetic or viral restoration of MeCP2 protein. Thus, reactivation of the silenced wild type (WT) allele
of MECP2 from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) presents an exciting therapeutic opportunity that attacks the root
cause of this disease by restoring MeCP2 function. Our preliminary data demonstrate that targeted
demethylation of the MECP2 promoter is sufficient to reactivate MECP2 from the Xi in human RTT ESCs and
neurons in vitro as well as in vivo in the RTT mouse brain. This was accomplished using a dCas9-Tet1 protein
targeted to the MECP2 locus via sgRNA, a DNA methylation editing tool pioneered by Dr. Shawn Liu. We
hypothesize that reactivation of MECP2 from the Xi will rescue RTT-associated phenotypes in mice. We have
developed two new transgenic mouse models (1,2) and two novel methods of delivery of epigenetic editors (3,4)
for MECP2 reactivation in vivo including: 1) Xi-linked Mecp2-NanoLuciferase-tdTomato dual reporter mice,
which enables high sensitivity detection and quantification of Mecp2 reactivation; 2) MeCP2-null heterozygous
female model of severe RTT with exclusive inactivation of the X-chromosome harboring the WT Mecp2 for
measuring reactivation-induced rescue which circumvents evaluating delayed and variable phenotypes in Mecp2
heterozygous with random XCI; 3) Cre recombinase-dependent dCas9-Tet1 transgenic line enables efficient
and tissue-specific DNA methylation editing in vivo; and 4) dCasMini-Tet1, in which the bulky dCas9 (4.1 kb) is
replaced with a compact dCasMini (1.6 kb) for delivery of a methylation editor via a single AAV9 vector. This
combination of transgenic models to measure reactivation efficacy (1) and rescue (2) with those that enable
efficient in vivo editing via genetic means (3) and single vector AAV9-mediated delivery (4) comprise a state-of-
the-art tool kit to evaluate the in vivo feasibility of a MECP2 reactivation strategy for treatment of RTT and other
X-linked disorders in females."
10828355,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and calcium (Cav) channels generate action potentials and initiate synaptic
transmission in neurons. Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy, migraine, chronic pain, and periodic
paralysis, and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Nav
channels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We will
further define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building their
characteristic structural features into NavAb, including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation, ion
selectivity, and fast inactivation. Based on these results, we will determine the structural basis for impaired Nav
channel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgia
and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging and
neurodegenerative disease, yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processes
and we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.
Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. The
activity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins, including calmodulin and
related calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticity
in transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation is
inserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channel
regulation, determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neural
circuits, and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatial
learning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into the
mechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrain
function. C. Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novo,
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1. We developed a mouse genetic model with all the features
of DS, including thermally induced and spontaneous seizures, ataxia, circadian rhythm and sleep disorders,
cognitive deficit, autistic-like features, and premature death via SUDEP. Physiological and genetic studies
show that all these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneurons,
without consistent effects on excitatory neurons, which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural
circuits. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS, we will determine the
neural cells and circuits responsible for DS using specific deletion by the Cre-Lox method, identify the sites of
hyperexcitability in neural cells and circuits that appear first in DS mice in vivo, and optimize next-generation
combination therapy for seizures, status epilepticus, cognitive deficit, and premature death in DS."
10828439,"The overall goals of the T32 Postdoctoral Training Program in Medical Genetics at Johns Hopkins are to
recruit and educate physician-scientists who have the potentials to become leaders in the field of Genetic
Medicine. Our program is designed to expose trainees to all facets of modern medical genetics and genomics
extending from research programs to patient care. This postdoctoral training experience emphasizes mentored
research in medical genetics and genomics, and prepares trainees for a career in academic medicine. Since the
majority of our trainees are physicians, we utilize a physician-scientist training model to bridge the gap between
genetics research and clinical medicine.
 Johns Hopkins provides leadership in the categorization and mapping of inherited traits, the application
of genomic and computational methods to the identification and understanding of genes and their roles in human
diseases, and in clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment of Mendelian disorders and multifactorial disorders
with significant genetic contributions. The McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine (DGM), the home
of this training program, oversees the clinical, educational, and research activities in human and medical genetics
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
 This T32 postdoctoral training program in medical genetics is in its 44th year of operation with supports
from NIGMS. The mentored research training is integrated into a medical genetics residency, which is designed
to optimize the utilization of the rich clinical and research resources and training environments at Johns Hopkins

diversified trainee populations and training resources by developing combined programs with pediatrics, internal
medicine, MFM, REI, and a training consortium with NHGRI, and established structured research fellowships to
support the interests and career goals of individual trainees to advance their careers as physician scientists."
10828441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 9.8 million adults have gained oral health insurance since the implementation of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA). However, utilization of dental services among disadvantaged groups remains low, resulting in
the stubborn persistence of oral health disparities. These findings suggest that there are persistent barriers to
oral health care beyond just coverage alone. According to the Andersen model of healthcare utilization, oral
healthcare utilization is driven by enabling factors (such as insurance access) as well as predisposing factors
(such as oral health literacy). Hence, it is critical to identify the bottlenecks in boosting the uptake of oral
healthcare services, thereby improving the oral health status of minority and low-income Americans. Our overall
objective is to assess whether the availability of dental providers poses a barrier to accessing dental care among
low-income and minority adults. We propose to conduct a field experiment to simulate the experiences of patients
with Medicaid coverage in obtaining dental appointments. Our design takes into account state variations in
Medicaid policies and neighborhood characteristics, thus enabling us to examine the extent to which underlying
structural factors contribute to disparities in access to dental care. Our specific aims are: 1) To examine the
geospatial distribution of dental providers according to neighborhood characteristics; 2) To identify the
association between Medicaid insurance status and availability of dental appointments; and 3) To assess the
cross-level interaction between structural barriers (state Medicaid dental policy and neighborhood
characteristics) and availability of dental appointments among Medicaid beneficiaries. Findings from this study,
using a robust experimental approach and primary data collection, will provide direct and objective measures of
access to dental care to guide states in implementing effective policies to reduce disparities in oral health."

translate basic discoveries into human therapies."
10829843,"The optimal host response to microbial pathogens requires balancing effective pathogen killing
with limiting tissue pathology caused by the pathogen or by the host’s own immune response.
This host disease tolerance phenomenon is especially critical in infections with helminths, which
are macroparasites that can cause severe tissue damage and inflammation. Using a mouse
model of hookworm infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), we identify Resistin-like
molecule (RELM)a as a highly secreted protein that protects the host from potentially fatal
infection-induced lung tissue damage at the expense of optimal hookworm killing. Our central
hypothesis is that RELMa is a host disease tolerance mechanism that shifts the balance from
helminth killing to resolution of inflammation and tissue healing. RELMa is expressed by immune
cells such as macrophages and non-immune cells such as epithelial cells (EC). In preliminary
data utilizing bone marrow chimeras and macrophage co-cultures, we identified that RELMa-
expressing alternatively activated macrophages (AAMac) are less efficient at Nb killing, but
instead dampen lung inflammation and promote tissue repair. Further, we generate unique
Arginase1/RELMa AAMac dual reporters, that reveal AAMac heterogeneity and implicate
RELMa+ AAMacs as a new wound healing macrophage subset. Based on these findings, the
focus of this proposal is to combine novel cell-specific RELMa KO/reporter mice with functional
co-culture assays and new RELMa reagents to delineate RELMa function in macrophage-
helminth interactions and mucosal tissue healing. In Aim 1, we will employ cell-specific RELMa
KO/reporter mice and adoptive cell transfers to delineate the contribution of RELMa derived from
innate cells (AAMac or eosinophils) or EC to Nb immunity and tissue healing. In Aim 2, we will
investigate RELMa regulation of macrophage-Nb interaction using AAMac dual reporter mice,
RELMa fusion proteins and blocking antibodies, and optimized co-culture assays. In Aim 3, we
will employ 3D lung scaffold and EC air-liquid interface co-cultures with AAMacs and
mesenchymal stem cells to determine how RELMa-expressing AAMacs and ECs interact with the
lung stroma and aid lung tissue recovery. We anticipate that a better understanding of the
beneficial versus pathogenic effects of RELMa in helminth infection could guide therapeutic
strategies to enhance anti-helminth immunity while limiting pathologic inflammation and
promoting tissue healing. Our findings provide new insight into alternatively activated macrophage
biology and macrophage-stromal cell interactions, which could be broadly applicable to resolving
mucosal tissue injury and inflammation that are of significant public health concern."

10829844,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The QUIT-Mobile study proposes to use mobile phone self-monitoring and feedback
to enhance and sustain over 12-months the impacts of the Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT), an ef-
fective screening and brief intervention (SBI) previously successful in reducing risky drug use (i.e., moderate
use) in low-income, diverse patients over a 3-month follow up. We propose to conduct the QUIT-Mobile study
for primary care patients who receive care in 8 clinics of federally qualified health centers (FQHC) in Southern
California over 12-months follow up, comparing to QUIT and Usual Care (UC). The proposed study is an Effec-
tiveness-Implementation Hybrid Type 1 design consisting of a single-blind, 3-arm, RCT with adult, mostly La-
tino FQHC primary care patients with risky drug use (ASSIST score 4-26), randomized to 3 conditions
(n=320/arm, n=960 total): 1) QUIT-Mobile; 2) standard QUIT; 3) Usual Care. Qualitative data on implementa-
tion facilitators and barriers will inform future scale-up and sustainability, in addition to cost data and cost-effec-
tiveness analysis. The aims are to examine effectiveness in reducing risky drug use and cost-effectiveness
comparing the three arms over 3-, 6- and 12-months. Drug use measures include urine drug tests, and timeline
follow-back self-reports for past 7-days and past 30-days (risky drug users have sporadic drug use patterns
requiring longer self-report recalls for drug use that urine screens may not detect). The 3-arm study enables
testing of the independent and synergistic effects of QUIT-Mobile compared to QUIT and both to Usual Care,
acknowledging that mHealth components alone may not be effective outside of a clinical/coaching relationship.
The 12-month timeline reflects anticipated scale-up scenarios of annual primary care visits when screening
and brief intervention would be repeated routinely. QUIT contains 3 components: 1) patient screening with the
WHO ASSIST, 2) brief clinician advice (<4 minutes) including opioid overdose prevention education, and 3) 2-
and 6-week telephone drug-use health coaching sessions utilizing motivational interviewing and cognitive be-
havioral techniques, delivered by paraprofessional health coaches. QUIT-Mobile proposes to test the addition
of mobile phone self-monitoring, feedback, and coach monitoring dashboard to enhance and sustain QUIT's
drug use reductions using mobile app, text-messaging (SMS), or interactive voice response (IVR) to allow par-
ticipation by with varying technological preferences. This study does not test which technology platform is more
effective, but rather, the effectiveness of the intervention functions (i.e., self-monitoring, automated feedback,
coach monitoring) that are delivered via patients' preferred technologies. This study is novel and timely in inte-
grating massively scalable mobile phone tools into an effective primary care BI to prevent substance use disor-
der (SUD) in FQHC patients delivered by paraprofessionals. QUIT-Mobile is responsive to the National Opioid
Crisis, and the US Mental Health Parity Act and National Academy of Medicine recommendations to integrate
behavioral health SBIs into primary care settings to prevent higher level SUD requiring specialty treatment."
10829846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic β-cells within the islets of Langerhans are required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
and glucose homeostasis. Dysfunctional β-cell activity and identity results in diabetes, a growing disease
affecting millions of Americans, thus creating an enormous fiscal and health burden. Strategies to improve
outcomes for the mounting number of diabetic patients requires understanding the complex programs that
coordinate a proper insulin release in response to changing blood glucose levels. Developing upon existing
knowledge of how islet enriched transcription factors (TFs) coordinate signals that influence gene regulatory
programs will allow us to understand how such programs are dramatically altered in islet β-cells of diabetes
patients. Pdx1, one of the most important TFs in the developing and postnatal β-cell, has been shown to recruit
a diverse set of coregulators which could potentially modulate its activity. This proposal is focused around how
Pdx1 interactions with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex are influential to normal
β-cell function and are altered in pathophysiological conditions associated with the development of Type 2
diabetes (T2D).
 The central ATPase subunit of the NuRD complex, Chd4, was found to interact with and control a subset
of Pdx1 target genes and is recruited to genes important for normal β-cell function in vitro. Preliminary studies
demonstrate that conditional removal of Chd4 from mature islet β-cells significantly impacts glucose tolerance in
vivo. This proposal will test the overall hypothesis that Pdx1-bound Chd4:NuRD complex controls chromatin
accessibility and gene expression programs important for physiological β-cell function which are compromised
during the development of diabetes. In Aim 1, we will fully characterize how β-cell dysfunction occurs due to the
absence of Chd4 in a new conditional Chd4-deleted mouse model and in Aim 2 we will uncover the mechanistic
actions of Chd4 in controlling chromatin accessibility and gene expression using unbiased genome-wide RNA-,
ATAC- and ChIP-Sequencing approaches. The influence of Chd4:NuRD on human Pdx1 and β-cell action will
be investigated. Aim 3 will evaluate how T2D associated stressors influence Pdx1:Chd4 interactions using
biochemical and in situ methods from rodent and human islets, in vivo models of T2D and primary human tissues.
 Upon successful completion of this grant, we will have determined the mechanistic actions of Chd4:NuRD
on controlling Pdx1 activity and β-cell function, and defined how stressors associated with diabetes development
impact the vital Pdx1:Chd4 regulatory mechanisms. This research will identify critical targets that contribute to
the pathogenesis of T2D, which will open new avenues for diabetes research."

 Reconstruction of the urinary tract in urologic surgery oftentimes involves utilizing the small intestine to
replace a segment of the urinary system, and as a result, patients may suffer from the side effects of connecting
the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Patients that undergo urinary diversion surgery, for example, are at risk
of infection, electrolyte abnormalities, and ileus as a result of this practice. If a better substitute for the urinary
tract were available, outcomes from urinary diversion or reconstructive surgery involving the small intestine would
be drastically improved. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a source of autologous urothelial stem cells
that can potentially be used towards the development of alternative bladder or urothelial substitutes. In this
proposal we hypothesize that urothelial stem cells can be generated via direct conversion of fibroblasts and can
reconstitute the bladder urothelium in the mouse. First, we will aim to generate urothelial stem cells via direct
conversion, or transdifferentiation (Aim 1), and we will achieve this by overexpressing transcription factors
associated with bladder development and screening for suprabasal and basal urothelial markers. We will
validate our screening results with functional assays with organoids as well as multilayered assembloids.
Second, we will map the epigenetic changes that take place during urothelial stem cell differentiation to
suprabasal cells (Aim 2), and we will accomplish this by performing Omni ATAC-seq on control bladder organoids
and urothelial stem cell organoids in basal and differentiation media conditions. By identifying differences in
areas of chromatin hyperaccessibility, we will be able to identify transcription factor binding motifs enriched in
stem cell and differentiated cell states. Finally, we will develop a bladder urothelial stem cell transplant protocol
using mouse models of urothelial ablation and injury (Aim 3). We will determine if urothelial stem cell
transplantation can reconstitute all cell types within the urothelium utilizing urothelial stem cells obtained from
mouse bladders as well as those obtained from transdifferentiation, and we will test for functional outcomes. If
we are successful in these aims, we will demonstrate that autologous urothelial stem cells can be generated via
direct conversion of fibroblasts, and we will establish a source of cells for bladder substitute tissue engineering
as well as a basis for cell-based therapy for disorders of the urothelium that are typically treated with surgical
reconstruction using the gastrointestinal tract, such as severe radiation cystitis or severe interstitial cystitis. The
impact of this work on human health will be significant as this work will potentially make urinary diversion and
reconstruction surgery a much less morbid surgical option for patients with severe urothelial disorders."
10829938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developing a new generation of interventions for cocaine use disorder (CUD) constitutes an important scientific
gap and, if addressed, will open innovation opportunities. To address this gap, we employ the Experimental
Medicine approach to mechanistically examine Reinforcer Pathology, an emerging novel framework for
addiction, that may provide a principled foundation for intervention development. Reinforcer Pathology specifies
that reinforcers are integrated over a temporal window, and the length of that window determines the relative
value of different reinforcers. When the temporal window is short, reinforcers such as cocaine, which are brief,
intense, and reliable, will have greater value. Conversely, as the temporal window lengthens, other more
temporally extended reinforcers begin to have greater influence and cocaine valuation will decrease. The
concept of Reinforcer Pathology identifies the temporal window, measured with delay discounting (i.e., the
decline in the value of a reinforcer as a function of its delay), as a therapeutic target for CUD, and it permits
target engagement via innovative interventions (e.g., episodic future thinking; EFT) to provide novel insights into
cocaine valuation. This project uses multiple analytical levels (e.g., the behavioral laboratory, neuroimaging, and
computational modeling) to quantify, predict, and modulate cocaine valuation among individuals with CUD. In
Aim 1, we will examine manipulations that increase and decrease the temporal window in parallel to
mechanistically test the Reinforcer Pathology framework. In Aim 1a, we will examine the effects of successive
exposure to an intervention that increases the temporal window (EFT) on concomitant changes in cocaine
valuation (demand and craving). In Aim 1b, we will examine the effects of a manipulation that decreases the
temporal window (stress probes) after exposure to EFT on concomitant changes in cocaine valuation.
Throughout Aim 1, neural activity associated with changes in the temporal window will also be examined. In Aim
2, we will use multi-voxel analyses of fMRI data to explore two independent sub-aims related to Reinforcer
Pathology in CUD. First, in Aim 2a, we will build multivariate group regression models of fMRI delay discounting
data in a subset of participants with CUD to predict discounting in an independent subset of participants. Second,
in Aim 2b, we will use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to enhance participants’ ability to control their temporal
window, and hence their ability to modulate delay discounting and cocaine valuation. In Aim 3, we will model the
temporal window by computationally quantifying results from Aims 1 and 2 (Aim 3a), and connecting subjective
value to brain regions of interest using computational neuroscience (Aim 3b). Together, the findings from this
rigorous and innovative research project will improve our understanding of CUD and highlight potential novel
and efficacious intervention strategies."

The current clinical standard for quantifying fluid pressures relies on the invasive placement of pressure
catheters or needles. These measures are costly and not without risk, thereby reducing how often data is
collected. Ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) are gas-filled microbubbles that, when insontated at a
fundamental frequency (f0), act as nonlinear oscillators, generating signal components ranging from the
subharmonic (f0/2) through higher harmonics. The subharmonic amplitude of UCA exhibits a linear relationship
with hydrostatic pressure, leading to the technique of subharmonic-aided pressure estimation (SHAPE).
SHAPE optimizations to date have relied primarily on empirical evidence to identify optimal acoustic
parameters and select a commercially available UCA. Currently, SHAPE provides up to 14 dB reduction in the
subharmonic amplitude over a pressure increase of 180 mmHg (0.6 dB/kPa). Clinical trials using SHAPE for
the diagnosis of portal pressures, cardiac pressures, and interstitial tumoral pressures during therapy have all
shown success. However, large variations in SHAPE have been observed at lower fluid pressures, indicating a
need to improve the technique's overall sensitivity. Using a variation of the Rayleigh–Plesset equation, our
group and others have modeled the SHAPE response of individual commercial bubbles and identified potential
sensitivities > 2 dB/kPa using optimized acoustic parameters. Thus, the potential exists to more than triple the
current sensitivity of SHAPE, thereby greatly reducing the overall errors associated with lower pressure
measurements.
Monodisperse microbubbles can be created using either buoyancy separation of existing UCAs or microfluidic
techniques. We hypothesize these agents will allow us to better refine previous modeling efforts, while also
greatly improving the overall sensitivity of SHAPE by tailoring the UCA to its application. To support this
hypothesis, we recently showed that monodisperse UCA nearly doubled the sensitivity of SHAPE (even
without full acoustic optimization). This proposal will be a first step towards the long-term goal of translating
SHAPE-specific UCA into clinical trials for improving the overall sensitivity of SHAPE as a noninvasive
pressure estimation technique. As part of this application, we propose to test the in vitro sensitivity of SHAPE
using monodisperse UCA using two fabrication approaches, to refine and validate our prior models of SHAPE
with empirical evidence from monodisperse UCA, and finally, to determine the ability of a customized,
monodisperse UCA to improve the sensitivity of SHAPE in in vivo models of cardiac pressures and portal
hypertension. At the conclusion of this project, we will have developed and validated a SHAPE-specific UCA,
capable of improving the sensitivity of SHAPE. These findings are expected to reduce the variability of SHAPE
as a noninvasive clinical measure of fluid pressures, enabling safer and more available clinical care."
10855982,"Project Summary/Abstract
Children with medical complexity (CMC) are an extremely vulnerable population with significant morbidity
and mortality risk. To facilitate the study of CMC, Complex Chronic Conditions (CCCs) were defined in 2000
as a set of ICD-9-CM codes specified as “CCCs” with categories (such as neurologic, cardiovascular,
metabolic, and other congenital or genetic defect). Three important concerns regarding the widely used CCC
system motivate this proposal. First, the CCC system is now used “off-label” for different tasks including
adjustment of health status in studies not specifically focused on CMC, and for the identification of children
who might benefit from comprehensive complex care services. Accordingly, the CCC system needs to be
evaluated regarding performance accuracy for various tasks. Second, the CCC system needs to be assessed
for potential embedded associations between ICD codes and patients’ socioeconomic status (which, for
historical reasons, is associated with the structural bias markers of race and ethnicity), arising from
differential access to healthcare and diagnostic testing, as well as genetic conditions related to genetic
ancestry. Embedded associations might bias the aggregated CCC system, affecting the identification of or
adjustment for medical complexity. Third, these two concerns must be considered jointly: the CCC system
might be accurate but, due to any embedded associations, perpetuates disparities. To address these
concerns, we propose the CCC EQUATE (Equitable Quantification And Task Evaluation) project. We will
create scenarios using two data sources, Medicaid claims data and 52 children’s hospitals inpatient data. We
will focus on the representative outcomes of hospitalizations (including readmissions) and mortality
(specifically, inpatient mortality). Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1. Evaluate the performance of the CCC system
across settings for these specific outcomes. Aim 2. Quantify the degree of embedded associations between
ICD codes and patients’ race and ethnicity. Aim 3. Quantify potential perpetuation of bias in CCC system
performance due to embedded associations in ICD codes. In sum, this project will safeguard against the CCC
system having subpar task performance in certain settings for specific outcomes, and from inadvertently
perpetuating bias. Furthermore, the methods and findings will be generalizable to all ICD-code based
classification systems. Ultimately, the project will enhance equity, enable future research, and help improve
care for CMC and their families."
10856794,"Summary:
A key question in neurobiology is how neural stem cells (NSCs) produce the vast diversity of neural
subtypes required for precise control of behavior. The human cortex is generated from a specialized
population of outer radial glia NSCs (oRGs) in the outer subventricular zone, which divide to produce
intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that themselves divide to produce 8-12 neurons. Drosophila Type
II NSCs (T2 NSCs) divide in a similar pattern and generate INPs to produce most neural cells of the central
complex (CX)— a conserved brain region across insect species involved in producing complex high-level
behavior. Thus, T2 NSCs are a good model for investigating the genetic mechanisms of neural diversity
adopted by neural progenitors across species. We previously discovered a series of transcription factors
(TFs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are sequentially expressed in T2 NSCs and INPs over
developmental time. These are ideal candidates for specifying the identity of the CX lineages through
combinatorial temporal patterning. Here, using an innate goal-directed behavior in flies— odor-guided food
search—associated CX circuit, we will identify which temporally expressed TFs and RBPs play a role in
specifying olfactory navigation circuitry and determine the role of these genes in specifying the number,
morphology, and identity of each circuit element (Aim 1). Next, we will use genetic birthdating to determine
the lineage and birthtime of each circuit element and to examine the link between birth timing and function
in a single T2 NSC lineage—DL1 (Aim 2). Finally, our proposed training, mentoring, and science outreach
activities through the Pueblo Brain Science program in New Mexico will target trainees at multiple levels
and will improve science education awareness and promote diversity in neuroscience (Aim 3). While
investigating mechanisms regulating neural diversity, our long-term goal is to make the neuroscience field
diverse through training, mentoring, and promoting science education in resource-limited and historically
neglected Pueblo communities. As many of the identified factors have human homologs, our results will
identify conserved principles governing the development of CX and provide insights into the development
of the human cortex."
10862391,"CORE C PROJECT SUMMARY
The principal goal of this Center is to understand how gene expression and associated function within key
neuronal subtypes regulates neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable
decision-making and behavioral adaptations. Ras and Rho-like small GTPases play fundamental biological
roles within neurons by controlling cell-autonomous growth-related signaling pathways and orchestrating
neuronal circuit assembly. Consistent with the biological importance of GTPase signaling in brain
development and function, several prominent neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes are upstream
regulators of neuronal small GTPase signaling. We will focus on the neurobiology of two major genetic
regulators of GTPase signaling, TRIO, a top 10 risk factor for schizophrenia, and SYNGAP1, a top 10 risk
factor for ASD and intellectual disability. TRIO/SYNGAP1 are molecular effectors that orchestrate neuronal
migration, neuronal morphogenesis, synaptic connectivity, synaptic plasticity, in vivo neural circuit function,
and associated behavioral adaptations. However, it is currently unknown how their expression and function
within specific neuronal subtypes and defined developmental time windows refine cortical circuits to impact
cognitive processing and associated behaviors. Our interdisciplinary, multi-institutional “Center for GTPase
Regulation of Neuronal Cell Biology and Behavior” will study the contributions of TRIO/SYNGAP1 in cortical
circuit assembly at cellular, synapse, circuit, systems, and behavioral levels in complementary model
systems, including mouse models and human iPSC-derived neurons. The Mouse Resource Core will
facilitate studies using mouse models. Mouse somatosensory cortex shares similar overall architecture and
approximates human molecular pathways, neuronal function, and circuit organization. Thus, mouse models
are a valuable system for studying cortical development at the level of neurons, synapses, circuits and
systems, as well as for evaluating potential therapeutic strategies. The mouse genome is a tractable system
for engineering mutations in orthologous genes to enable study of genetic variants in the context of brain
tissue. Conditional deletion strategies allow for dissection of cell-type specific effects underlying synapse
and circuit dysfunction. Combining genetic manipulation with electrophysiologic and optogenetic tools,
allows for detailed, multilevel mechanistic studies in the context of an intact cortex, our Center will address
gaps in knowledge about the contribution of small GTPase regulators to cortical circuit assembly. The
primary objectives of the Mouse Resource Core are to provide centralized support of mouse model needs
for the Center Projects, including generation of novel knock-in mouse lines; maintenance and specialized
breeding of genetically modified mice; and facilitating sharing of mouse lines with the academic community.
Our centralized mouse core will provide efficient generation of experimental mice to generate rigorous and
reproducible data across projects in a cost-effective manner."
10862420,"OVERALL – SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With an ever increasing aging population and prolonged life spans, there has been a significant increase in the
number of older transplant recipients. At the same time, older patients represent the fastest growing cohort
waiting for a transplant. Those older patients are treated in the same way as young recipients, yet their
alloimmune responses differ substantially. There is thus a significant unmet need to provide treatments for older
transplant recipients that are based on a solid understanding of age-specific changes in alloimmunity. However, that
cannot be done until cellular and humoral mechanisms regulating alloimmunity in aging are fully elucidated. The
unmet need to conduct studies such as those proposed in this PPG is further stressed by: A) our extensive data
indicating that immunoregulation controlling allo-specific responses is distinct in aging, B) that established transplant
immunosuppression has been designed for a youthful immune system with an exclusion of older recipients from the
vast majority of clinical studies, and C) that current immunosuppression strategies are not fully effective in older
individuals and predisposes them to undesired effects. Indeed, our collected data indicate that the current aged-
related immunosuppressive paradigm is overly simplistic and does not recognize important heightened
inflammatory features of aging alloimmunity. Our overall hypothesis is that cellular senescence in fibroblastic
reticular cells (FRCs) of lymph nodes induces a maladaptive T and B cell response leading to a dysregulated
alloimmunity in aging. Clinically, this dysregulated immunity results in age-specific effects of established
immunosuppressants. Co-stimulatory agents, although prime candidates for use as immunosuppression in older
recipients due to the absence of nephrotoxic effects, work effectively only in young but not old recipients.. To
this end, our major goals are to fully examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive transplant
immunity in aging. This PPG sets forth a platform that merges three highly synergistic teams (Drs. Abdi, Tullius,
and Sage) with complementary skills and expertise in LN stroma, T and B cell immunity. Project 1 will test the
hypothesis that aged FRCs contribute significantly to the divergent immune responses observed in aged vs.
young mice. Aim 1 will study the mechanisms by which senescence in FRCs regulates alloimmunity in the LN.
Aim 2 will examine the importance of lymphotoxin pathways for transplant immunity in the stroma of aged LN.
Aim 3 will study novel approaches to rejuvenate the aging LN stroma thereby restoring immune tolerance
following co-stimulatory blockade. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that increased age-specific changes in
innate and T cell immunity rewire allorecognition, T cell metabolism, and immunosuppressive targets. As our
corollary hypothesis we submit that cellular senescence augments alloimmunity and that the depletion of
senescent cells improves transplant outcomes in old recipients. In Aim 1, we will delineate the mechanisms by
which aged DCs regulate T-cell alloimmunity. In Aim2, we will delineate age-specific metabolic reprograming of
allo-reactive T cells. In Aim3, we will test age-specific treatments of old recipients with a focus on nano-delivery
of glutamine inhibitors and senolytics. Project 3 will test the hypothesis that aging causes transcriptional
rewiring in Tfh and B cells altering solid organ transplant rejection. Aim 1 will determine how aging alters
transcriptional rewiring in Tfh cells during antibody mediated rejection making them resistant to costimulatory
blockade. Aim 2 will delineate how alterations in developmental stage progression in aging contributes to a
cellular senescence-like pathogenic state in Tfh cells, and Aim 3 will determine how aged Tfh-targeted nano-
therapeutics can alter allo- versus anti-viral immunity in the settings of aging. An Administrative Core (Core A),
Nano-Immune Imaging Core (Core B) , and Microsurgery Transplantation Core (Core C) will provide necessary
support so these three projects accomplish their goals."

Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs), including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leuk-
emia (AML), are severe, often rapidly fatal bone marrow disorders that occur in a small fraction of solid tumor
patients who have received cytotoxic treatment. Ovarian cancer (OC) survivors have one of the highest inci-
dences of tMNs among all cancer patients, reflecting both an increased risk due to platinum exposure and a
recently recognized further increase in risk with PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy. Collectively, these PARPi-as-
sociated myeloid neoplasms are approximately as frequent as acute promyelocytic leukemia, a rare AML sub-
type that previously had a high fatality rate but has become among the most curable myeloid neoplasms through
the concerted efforts of the research community. In this context, our team has contributed to studies showing
that a disproportionate number of PARPi-associated tMNs in OC patients have biallelic inactivation of the TP53
tumor suppressor gene. Like other TP53-mutant myeloid neoplasms, tMNs in OC patients receiving PARPis
respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy and relapse quickly, with a median survival of 4-8 months, high-
lighting the need for improved therapies. In preliminary studies, we have shown that replication checkpoint mod-
ulators, including inhibitors of the kinases CHK1, WEE1 and ATR, exhibit antileukemic activity in AML cell lines,
xenografts, and primary AML samples, including TP53-mutant AMLs. This activity reflects TP53-independent
induction of apoptosis at therapeutically achievable concentrations through at least two distinct apoptotic path-
ways, one of which involves leukemia cell-intrinsic transactivation of the TNF gene followed by TNF receptor-
dependent caspase activation and the other of which involves the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway but is less
completely defined. These observations lead to the hypothesis that replication checkpoint modulators, admin-
istered as monotherapy or in combination, will have antileukemic effects in the tMNs that develop in OC patients.
To further advance the study of these agents, we now propose to define the second pathway by which replication
checkpoint modulators induce apoptosis in TP53-mutant AML, thereby providing deeper insight into determi-
nants of tMN sensitivity to this emerging class of drugs (Aim 1); determine the antineoplastic effects of replication
checkpoint modulators in vitro, alone and in combination with hypomethylating agents and BH3 mimetics (two
classes of current standard-of-care AML agents), in samples of PARPi-emergent tMNs from OC patients (Aim 2);
and assess the efficacy of replication checkpoint modulators in vivo, alone and in combination with hypomethyl-
ating agents or BH3 mimetics, in patient-derived xenografts generated from PARPi-emergent AMLs of OC pa-
tients (Aim 3). Collectively, these studies are designed to provide new insight into the antineoplastic action of
replication checkpoint modulators and simultaneously position our multidisciplinary team to perform a future early
phase clinical trial of replication checkpoint modulator-based therapy in OC patients with PARPi-emergent tMNs."

highest possible resolution achievable with existing methods falls short of goals set for the next generation
Human Connectome Project (HCP) or the BRAIN Initiative that calls for the capability to study the organizing
principles of the human cortex at the mesoscopic or sub-mesoscopic scale. Our long-term goal is to advance
ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI through innovative technical developments applied at the highest possible magnetic
field available for human studies. The overall objective of this study is to develop a new suite of MRI tools that,
when synergistically combined with the unique UHF of 10.5 Tesla (10.5T) and optimized instrumentation (RF
coils and gradients), will enable us to acquire high-quality, whole- and partial-brain functional MRI (fMRI) at
unparalleled spatiotemporal resolutions, ushering in the next generation HCP and approaching the ambitious
resolution target (i.e., 0.01-µL voxel volumes) set in the strategic plan developed by the second BRAIN Initiative
Working Group. The overall objective will be accomplished by pursuing four specific aims: Under aim 1, we will
develop and optimize new high-channel-count transmit and receive RF arrays to leverage SNR gains available
at 10.5T while enabling RF parallel transmission (pTx) for flip angle homogenization and SAR reduction. For aim
2, we will devise two new pTx pulse design frameworks that incorporate RF-power-related constraints for water-
selective excitation tailored for whole-brain scan without the need for additional fat saturation, and a fat-selective
saturation and a water-selective excitation, suitable for partial-brain scan of a single imaging slab. Under aim 3,
we will develop i) a comprehensive pTx-enabled 3D GRE EPI sequence for rapid high-quality high-resolution
whole-brain and partial-brain scans, all with joint motion and field correction, ii) a computational toolkit enabling
real-time motion detection, background field measurement, and GIRF-based field dynamics determination using
NMR field probes, and iii) a tailored image reconstruction for producing motion- and field-corrected images based
on field dynamics and motion detection. The results will be compared to those obtained with our long-standing
and extensively used 2D simultaneous multi-slice EPI sequence. For aim 4, we will develop and demonstrate
brain fMRI at spatiotemporal resolutions that are much higher than what is possible with existing methods. The
research proposed in this application is significant because it is expected to have a broad positive impact on
various fields including ultrahigh-field MRI, RF hardware, high-resolution fMRI, parallel transmission, data
acquisition, image reconstruction, and neuroscience. The proposed research is innovative because it represents
a new and substantive departure from the existing approaches by shifting focus to developing a synergy of
various technical innovations that can help realize the full potential of 10.5T, enabling ultrahigh-resolution fMRI
and increasing our ability to study brain function at the mesoscopic scale."

Summary
Sample preparation for microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is challenging and it is a rate-limiting step.
Here, we will develop methods for growing nanocrystals, optimizing them, and work out a protocol for
reproducible grid preparation for MicroED. Currently, we prepare samples for MicroED using single particle
cryoEM protocols. This involves pipetting the sample solution onto an EM grid, blotting the excess, and freezing
the sample by plunging the grid into liquid ethane. This process is harsh on the sample, particularly that blotting
can expose it to the water-air interface compromising its structure and collapsing the underlying crystal lattice.
For membrane proteins the problem is exacerbated by the growth of “soft” crystals of protein surrounded by
lipids or detergents. Moreover, growing crystals in lipidic cubic phase is even more challenging as they embed
into a lipid matrix that is viscous and thus are almost impossible to blot without damaging the crystals.
Understanding which crystallization and sample preparation approaches are applicable to MicroED requires a
consorted and systematic effort challenged by and tested on select biological projects. Here we propose to
systematically test conditions for nanocrystal growth and determine which procedures yield nanocrystals of the
highest quality. We will establish new strategies for nanocrystal cryo protection and develop nanocrystal gwoth
and preservation kits. Finally, we will decide, through a series of experiments, what are the best practices for
FIB milling to serve MicroED as a strategy for preparing nanocrystals of membrane proteins grown in lipidic cubic
phase. We will achieve these goals through three aims: 1. Directed nanocrystal growth and detection; 2.
Strategies for nanocrystal cryo protection; 3. Strategies for grid preparation MicroED for experiments. Overall,
we will deliver reproducible and reliable procedures for sample preparation, detection, and preservation for
MicroED including membrane proteins grown in LCP. The long-term goal is to enable routine and high-
throughput crystallization and structure determination by MicroED."

Summary
Similarly as X-ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) delivers amplitudes of the imaged
object Fourier transform and the phase information is lost. Several procedures have been developed in X-ray
crystallography for solving the phase problem for de novo structure determination. These include Patterson
difference, molecular replacement, ab initio statistical methods, heavy metal (multi- and single isomorphous
replacement), damage-based phasing, and anomalous dispersion. We already successfully applied MicroED to
the determination of new protein structures using two approaches: (1) direct ab initio and molecular replacement
using idealized models and (2) molecular replacement using homologues. However, ab initio methods are
feasible only in cases when the obtained resolution is better than ~1.2Å while molecular replacement is only
possible if the new protein is homologous with another already known structure. Other X-ray methods are either
not applicable to MicroED (for example anomalous dispersion) or were not yet adapted and implemented for
MicroED. Here we will expand the pallet of available tools by developing dedicated MicroED phasing methods
for routine de novo structure determination in cases in which the diffraction spots do not reach spatial frequencies
required by ab initio methods and molecular replacement is not possible due to lack of homologous structural
information. To facilitate phasing, we will develop comprehensive MicroED data scaling and integration
methodologies taking advantage of maximum likelihood approaches to deliver accurate intensity values. For de
novo phasing we will adapt two methods that were historically most successful in X-ray crystallography: (1) heavy
metal isomorphous replacement strategies and (2) phasing by specific radiation damage. The aims are: 1.
Development of a comprehensive MicroED data scaling and integration methodology; 2. De novo phasing using
isomorphous replacement; 3. De novo phasing using radiation damage. The successful completion of the Aims
listed will bring MicroED to an equal footing with X-ray crystallography. In the long-run, the proposed
developments will lead to establishment of MicroED as a method capable of phasing and solving structures of
entirely new and biologically important systems that currently are not tractable by X-ray crystallography."

Summary
The discovery, design, and synthesis of small molecule drugs and peptide inhibitors is slow and inefficient as it
requires large amounts of material for successful structural characterization. Over the past 50 years, NMR and
other powerful spectroscopic techniques were developed to address this challenge. While almost all of them rely
on inference of atomic connectivity, the unambiguous determination of a small molecule's structure requires use
of X-ray and/or neutron diffraction methods. In reality, X-ray crystallography is rarely applied in such cases for
routine drug development. This is because of the significant effort is required for performing crystallization assays
and because of the large quantity of material that is needed, while specimens are often available only in
femtogram amounts. We recently demonstrated that microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) can be used as
a powerful and potentially routine method for unambiguous structural determination of small molecules. Using
seemingly amorphous powders and peptides straight off of a purification column without further crystallization,
MicroED delivered atomic resolution structures using only femtogram amounts of material. The process took
minutes and required little personnel effort. Here, we will establish MicroED as a method of choice for structure
determination of small molecules and as an analytical tool for drug development through high-throughput
pipelines for small molecule structure determination. We will extend the use of MicroED to structure
determination of natural products for drug discovery efforts and study neurotoxins and nerve agents that typically
block ion channels. The aims are: 1. Real-time structure determination and high-throughput drug discovery; 2.
Evaluation of MicroED methodologies' applicability to studying natural products; 3. Neurotoxins, nerve agents,
and identification of neutralizing agents. Overall, we will develop procedures for sample preparation for small
molecules, natural products and toxins, and deliver a large library of their atomic resolution structures with the

Summary
The initial development of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), and subsequent improvements to the
technique, have been driven by new data collection methods and hardware for controlling the microscope. Of
particular importance is turning MicroED into a high-throughput method with time-resolved capability to be able
to rapidly determine time-dependent structure-function relation of functioning macomolecular complexes. This
will propel the technique forward, but it requires additional design and engineering efforts in order to make these
desired features a reality. Here, we will focus on three MicroED engineering aims: (1) the development of high
throughput on-grid crystallization equipment to increase the efficiency and success rate of MicroED experiments,
(2) the adaptation and design of new equipment and methods to conduct time-resolved MicroED experiments,
(3) the design of a multi-functional grid surface, or “lab on a grid” for the streamlined preparation of small molecule
samples for MicroED structure determination. The aims of this project are 1. Development of high throughput
on-grid crystallization for MicroED; 2. New sample preparation methodology for time-resolved MicroED; 3. “Lab
on a grid” for MicroED analysis of small molecules. Overall, we will design, engineer, and implement new tools
and techniques for three major aspects of MicroED. These new tools will greatly accelerate the throughput
capabilities of the MicroED and improve the quality of collected data. Additionally, new experimental modalities
will be made possible through the work in Aim 2, opening the door to precise time-resolved studies by MicroED."

Summary
We selected the Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) for this proposal to encompass the forefront in biomedical
research and cover the US from coast to coast. Some of the most fundamental questions in biochemistry are
being addressed using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED): How do ligands regulate the structure and
function of G-protein coupled receptors? (Lefkowitz, Stevens); What are the conformational dynamics that are
involved in substrate recognition and transport in the largest family of membrane transporters? (Abramson,
Zheng); Structural biology of large porous protein complexes that are involved in neurotransmission and fusion
(Hurley); The protonation and charged state in membrane proteins and how those affect protein function (Rees,
Yeager); How proteins are recognized by antibodies and how proteins can regulate gene expression (Bjorkman,
Feigon); and the utility of MicroED in understanding and discovery of natural products (van der Donk). We chose
to focus our efforts on the study of natural products, protein complexes and of membrane proteins because these
are extremely challenging and yet very important targets for drug discovery and medicine. The interactions with
the DBPs will be supervised by Dr. Gonen, who has more than 20 years' experience working with membrane
proteins of different kinds, including, channels, transporters and receptors and has determined several key
membrane protein structures by cryoEM and X-ray crystallography. Moreover, he holds a degree in Chemistry
which allows him to effectively communicate with chemists and biologists alike. Many of the DBP targets are
hard to express, purify and crystallize. By applying MicroED we help to alleviate these difficulties; when a
membrane protein of interest if expressed in low amounts, the resulting material may still be sufficient for
structure determination by MicroED. Finally, MicroED can deliver atomic resolution structures from femtogram
amounts of small molecules and natural products without additional purification and crystallization . All DBPs
benefit from the Technology and Research Development projects of this application and are good testbeds for
them. They are also excellent vehicles for dissemination of MicroED technology."
10862672,"HUMAN ENERGY BALANCE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Kansas Center for Metabolism and Obesity REsearch (KC-MORE) Human Energy Balance (HEB) core
integrates facilities, equipment, and expertise currently on the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC)
campus to support research and training on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity and to
evaluate the impact of weight loss on obesity-related co-morbidities in a variety of populations including adults,
children, and in special and underserved populations including individuals with intellectual and developmental
disabilities, physical disabilities, Alzheimer's disease, and in rural residents. The HEB core will include 3
divisions. The Energy Expenditure and Exercise Physiology Division will support assessments of energy
expenditure (laboratory-based and portable indirect calorimetry, stable isotopes, whole-room indirect
calorimetry), body weight (calibrated scales), and body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, air
displacement plethysmography). This Division will also provide the capability to deliver and document laboratory-
based exercise dosed at specific levels of intensity and energy expenditure and to deliver and monitor both
weight management and exercise inventions remotely to groups of participants in their homes. The Energy Intake
Division will provide assessments of energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intake (direct observation,
weighted and digital image plate waste, self-reports), assessments of biomarkers that are indicators of
compliance to diet recommendations or nutrient absorption, and analysis of the gut microbiome which may play
a role in energy balance. This Division also has the capacity to prepare and serve meals of specific energy and
macronutrient intake for controlled feeding trials. The Clinical Weight Management Division will utilize the
facilities and staff of our on-going KUMC clinical weight management program to provide training, a venue for
pilot research projects, and a mechanism for the delivery of evidence-based weight management interventions
developed by KC-MORE COBRE supported and other investigators. In addition to opportunities for training in
clinical weight management, our clinical weight management program provides a venue to conduct pilot weight
management trials and maintains a registry of data and contact information on over 3,000 previous and current
participants for secondary analysis and pilot surveys. The establishment of the HEB core will centralize, for the
first time on the KUMC campus, the facilities, equipment, expertise, and training opportunities to provide access
to multiple techniques for the assessment of energy intake and energy expenditure suitable for use in weight
management trials conducted in both laboratory and community settings. In addition, HEB core will provide
training in the conduct of weight management trials in both laboratory and community settings using a variety of
strategies for intervention delivery, reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity in adults, children,
and in special and underserved populations."

Preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial pregnancy syndrome that affects up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide,
and is defined by new onset of hypertension and proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction appearing after 20
weeks of gestation. Although the well-accepted underlying pathophysiology of this disease involves both
maternal and fetal/placental factors, the symptoms resolve following the delivery of the placenta pointing to
the importance of placental involvement in this disease. The placental histological phenotype of PE is known
to have a wide range of lesions. Maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), one of the predominant placental
injuries associated with PE, is known for abnormal syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast
differentiation and function, with some cases overlapping with fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM). However,
the detailed underlying molecular and cellular pathophysiology associated with PE placenta showing MVM,
with or without FVM, is not well-understood. Therefore, we have set the following three aims in this proposal,
combining a novel trophoblast modeling system, the molecular characterization of the placenta, and
evaluate influence of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) at the chorionic villi and elucidate the detailed
mechanism associated with this pathology. Aim 1 will identify the optimal stem cell-based method to study
abnormal trophoblast differentiation in PE placenta. Aim 2 will focus on in-depth characterization of PE-
MVM placentas with or without FVM, and bank and characterize the cellular phenotype of each MVM
subtypes of umbilical cord-derived MSCs. Aim 3 will evaluate the trophoblast-MSC crosstalk within the
chorionic villi of PE placentas with different MVM-subtypes. The successful completion of this proposal will
establish subtype-specific cell-based models of PE, providing effective tools for identifying diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for each sutypes, leading us to the better pregnancy care for woman
and babies."
10858943,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute an array of neurocognitive and behavioral deficits exhibited
by individuals who experience some disability as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). In the United
States, the incidence of FASD is estimated to be 20-50/1,000 children. With no curative treatments available, it
is of paramount importance to consider fresh perspectives and improve our understanding of factors driving
FASD-associated deficits. Much research has focused on neuronal-specific defects in the central nervous
system with less attention given to the vascular compartment and in particular to endothelial cell-specific defects
mediated by PAE. Considering the intimate relationship between the developing neuronal and vascular networks
during embryogenesis, it is likely that abnormal vascular development contributes to PAE-associated brain
pathology. Using an established mouse model of moderate PAE, we found that microRNA (miR)-150-5p was
significantly increased in the PAE embryonic cortices and in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs)
isolated from those cortices compared to controls. miR-150-5p is a negative regulator of angiogenesis and the
blood brain barrier (BBB), and its targets include endothelial-specific transcription factors and matrix
metalloproteinases as well as adherens and tight junction proteins, which were significantly reduced in the same
tissues. Additionally, we found that the vasculature of PAE embryonic cortices displayed significant alterations
including reductions in vessel area and volume, the mean diameter of blood vessels, and BBB integrity. Inhibition
of miR-150-5p or overexpression of its targets restored angiogenesis and decreased permeability of BMVECs
exposed to alcohol. Our long-term goals are to discover novel targets and develop strategies that may be useful
for reversing or alleviating the adverse consequences of PAE. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify
molecular mechanisms and regulators of miR-150-5p that lead to endothelial cell and vascular dysfunction, which
could be harnessed as potential therapeutic targets for improving PAE-mediated effects. Our specific aims are
to first investigate the mechanisms by which miR-150-5p levels are enhanced in BMVECs, examining its
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We will then evaluate the effect of miR-150-5p on the
molecular and cellular properties of BMVECs and the neurovascular unit (NVU) following PAE, preserving
physiological context and spatial information. Finally, we will examine whether the miR-150-5p-mediated
deviations in vascular morphology and function persist into postnatal life following PAE, using tissue clearing
combined with fluorescence microscopy of the cortical vasculature as well as functional studies of ex vivo
cerebral vessels. This work will uncover novel molecular mechanisms that contribute to vascular defects in PAE
and will provide insight into RNA-based strategies that could be developed for improving PAE-mediated effects."
10858972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background and Objectives: Neurons and their synapses require high amounts of energy to sustain normal
levels of activity. Mitochondria are the main energy source, producing ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. In turn,
oxidative phosphorylation proceeds through the action of large protein complexes, like Mitochondrial Complex I
(MCI). But much work shows that mitochondrial components in neurons and at synapses also do far more than
generate ATP. Mitochondria buffer calcium, drive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) signaling, and influence cell
survival. Using the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we found loss
of MCI components impact distinct synaptic tissues in profoundly different ways. The objective of this proposal
is to use this model to understand exactly how mitochondria impact discrete parts of the synapse.
Specific Aims and Research Design: We found that MCI impairment causes profound cytological abnormali-
ties at both the pre- and postsynaptic NMJ. But important differences emerged upon examination of individual
tissues. NMJ activity is dampened when MCI is impaired in the postsynaptic muscle. NMJ activity can also be
dampened when MCI is impaired in neurons – but curiously, this only happens when it is combined with other
insults. This project has two specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how loss of MCI in the muscle causes a
diminishment of NMJ function. This phenotype is noteworthy for multiple reasons. First, the NMJ displays phe-
notypes reminiscent of neurodegeneration when MCI is lost in muscle. Second, the NMJ is known to employ
numerous muscle-to-nerve signaling paradigms to sustain normal activity. We can test if any of those retrograde
signals are occluded. Aim 2 is to define how the presynaptic neuron eludes dysfunction when MCI is lost. Com-
bining genetics, pharmacology, electrophysiology, and imaging we will test if known homeostatic signaling com-
ponents and modalities are co-opted to maintain normal activity. The expected outcome of our work is new
understanding of how mitochondrial function and dysfunction impinge upon discrete synaptic compartments.
Health Relatedness: Impairment of mitochondria is associated with neurodegenerative conditions like Parkin-
son’s Disease, neuromuscular conditions like Leigh Syndrome, as well as forms of epilepsy and ataxia. For any
genetic disease or disorder caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, we require better cell-specific models to eluci-
date what is happening on the levels of synapses and circuits. Based on our data, the tractable Drosophila NMJ
is a good way to define how synapses react to normal mitochondrial function or dysfunction. In turn, this kind of
foundational information from the NMJ model could edify downstream investigations into neurological conditions
caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, like forms of Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and ataxia."
10858973,"Project Summary
Adult diffuse gliomas that harbor mutations in the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are
common in younger adults, and universally evade the current aggressive therapies and remain lethal. Our team
led by Co-PIs Drs. Cahill and Wakimoto have identified unique metabolic dependencies and combinatorial
therapeutic strategies for IDH-mutant glioma. We have found that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP)
activation induced by the alkylating chemotherapeutic temozolomide can be therapeutically exploited by
inhibition of the PAR breakdown enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), resulting in aberrant PAR
accumulation and catastrophic NAD+ depletion. In parallel, PARP “trapping” inhibition has been found to be
synthetic lethal with IDH1 mutation, exploiting a replication-stress mechanism convergent with BRCA1-mediated
homologous-recombination deficiency. However, systemic hematologic toxicities have limited the PARP inhibitor
dosing in glioma patients. Therefore, the goal of our R01 application is to dissect the PAR-driven signaling
pathways in IDH mutant gliomas, providing a mechanistic understanding in malignant glioma cells of the
mediators of sensitivity, to maximize cancer cell targeting and minimize systemic toxicities, ultimately
accelerating translation of laboratory discoveries to the clinic. Focal radiation therapy is part of standard care for
gliomas and an its enhancement is an unmet need. Radiation also offers the opportunity to overcome the
systemic toxicities associated with TMZ-based combination therapies. Aim 1 will determine how radiation
therapy-induced DNA damage and PAR-ylation co-operates with PARG inhibition in IDH mutant tumor models
in vitro and in vivo. Employing genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PARG, we will determine the therapeutic
effects and molecular mechanisms of PARG inhibition in preclinical models of glioma. Mechanistically, PAR
signaling activation can drive multiple downstream molecular pathways including NAD+ depletion, replication
stress, DNA damage and AIF-MIF-driven parthanatos, all of which can contribute to cell death. Aim 2 will
determine whether signaling downstream of PAR polymers directly contributes to cell death after treatment with
alkylators and PARG inhibition to understand the molecular basis of the combination of TMZ and PARG inhibition.
Our ongoing research has revealed that genotoxicity-triggered aberrant PAR-ylation perturbed DNA replication
stress checkpoint signaling in IDH-mutant tumors, motivating us to investigate the ability of potent, selective,
clinical DNA-PKcs inhibitors to disable radiation-induced replication stress responses in Aim 3. The successful
completion of these specific aims will open new avenues for targeting the specific vulnerabilities of IDH1 mutant
gliomas, driving potential clinical therapies for patients with these tumors."
10824472,"New approaches are needed to treat acute and chronic pancreatitis which is a major health problem in the US.
One novel approach is to promote mitochondrial health to protect pancreas from damages caused by various
stressors. We have identified important roles for mitophagy in resistance to pancreatitis. These new findings, in
the setting of the urgent medical need for new approaches to treat pancreatitis, led to this new SBIR application
to fully leverage prior discoveries. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a key regulator of autophagic clearance
of damaged mitochondria. As such, activation of ubiquitin pathway enzyme critically involved in promoting
mitochondrial health is expected to have therapeutic effects. Pogenra’s UbiProTM drug discovery platform was
employed to discover novel, potent and selective activators of UPS enzymes. We demonstrated that UPS
activator inhibited pancreatitis in vivo. In this Phase I grant, we propose to evaluate these novel molecules for
their efficacy in cellular and animal models of acute and chronic pancreatitis and perform mechanism of action
studies. The ultimate commercial goal of this project is the development of small molecule UPS activators as
novel drugs that could treat pancreatitis."
10825032,"PROJECT SUMMARY (30 lines max)
Incarceration, which disproportionately impacts minoritized and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, is a
salient form of structural inequality that impedes individuals’ sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and
autonomy. Most research in this area, which focuses almost entirely on females, finds that women involved in
the criminal justice system have minimal access to SRH services, experience high rates of unplanned and
undesired pregnancies, and are more likely to underutilize contraception to help meet their reproductive goals.
However, we know almost nothing about the SRH needs and care of young men (aged 15-29) involved in the
criminal justice system, despite this group being identified as a “high-priority target population” among SRH
experts for at least the past two decades. Instead, the few studies related to justice-impacted men’s SRH have
taken a harm reduction approach (e.g., an exclusive focus on sexual risk reduction) that overlooks other facets
of men’s reproductive lives. This proposed R21 breaks new ground by focusing on young males’ reproductive
attitudes, behaviors, and SRH needs prior to the birth of children, in order to identify upstream social
determinants for intervention that contribute to the cycle of disadvantage faced by justice-impacted individuals,
their partners, and their families. Informed by the socio-ecological framework of young men’s SRH care, the
proposed study will examine formerly incarcerated young men’s SRH attitudes and behaviors, as well as their
experiences with, and barriers and facilitators to, accessing SRH education and care. In Aim 1, we will employ
secondary, population-based data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) for the years 2011-2019
to compare SRH outcomes between eligible participants with and without incarceration histories. We will focus
on outcomes including risk for unintended pregnancy, need for family planning, and SRH education exposure
and care use. In Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with recently incarcerated young men (ages
15-29, incarcerated in the past 12 months) who have yet to father children. We will recruit a diverse sample
across three regions: the Mid-Atlantic [Maryland], the Midwest [Minnesota], and the Southwest [Texas]. In Aim
3, we will conduct key informant interviews with national and regional justice, medical, and public health
experts to elicit their perspectives and experiences pertaining to formerly incarcerated young men’s SRH
education and care. We will identify potential intervention approaches using a consensus building
methodology. Critically, we will organize a Justice-Impacted Youth Advisory Board for this study to integrate
the input of youths with lived experience into all stages of the research. Study findings will inform the
development of regionally focused interventions to support the SRH goals, education, and care of formerly
incarcerated young men, and will provide critical preliminary data to develop a national agenda for further
research centering this neglected and understudied group."

The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical
research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation
identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the
98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible
resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning
regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its
ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional
and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from
individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that
affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA
methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and
displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web
accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g.
db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants
identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies
to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic
information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this
unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community."

My prior training, background, and experiences are very relevant to my specific plans as described in the grant.
My overall career development goal is to develop the skills necessary to pursue a career as an independent
clinical researcher, able to conduct investigations that will broaden our understanding of the relationship
between functional decline in aging and medication use.
My specific research training objectives during the 5-year award period are: 1. To enhance my knowledge
of neural correlates of gait and cognitive dysfunction. 2. Advance my knowledge of the brain Renin
Angiotensin System (RAS) and connected pathways as a biological pathway that may link cognitive and
motoric declines in aging. 3. Learn neuroimaging modalities and analytic techniques to identify and quantify
structural findings related to cognitive and functional decline in aging. 4. Improve my knowledge of
epidemiological methods and biostatistics for observational studies and longitudinal analysis. 5. Apply for an
ROI grant at the end of this K23 award to extend this line of research into additional cohorts that will allow for
more detailed investigations into the use of CACE-I and related agents in protecting against declines in gait
and cognition in older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.
My research aims will add to our knowledge of the clinical and neurobiological consequences of medication
use in aging by focusing on medications with less of a negative impact on functional decline than similar
medication counterparts. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) are widely used for a number of
conditions beyond hypertension. They can be categorized as centrally or peripherally acting based upon their
ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Available data suggests that centrally acting ACEI decrease the rate of
cognitive and functional decline among those with Alzheimer’s Disease and related disorders. My specific
aims focus on older individuals without Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders and are to 1) To
quantify motoric consequences (gait velocity) of CACE-I versus PACE-I use in older adults using the nationally
representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) database. 2) To determine cognitive consequences of
CACE-I versus PACE-I use in older adults using the HRS. 3) To examine the relation of CACE-I and PACE-I
use with neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies linked to dementia using the Alzheimer’s disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
Early identification of older adults at risk for the development of cognitive impairment and decline in physical
performance, coupled with a better understanding of how ACEI subtypes affect cortical regions associated with
dementia, is of paramount importance as a prelude to identification of targeted therapies to slow the
progression of cognitive impairment in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease. There is a knowledge gap regarding
clinical consequences of different classes of ACEI that limits evidence based prescribing. This proposal will
produce clinically relevant data that will form the basis of an R01 designed to extend this line of research into
additional cohorts, to allow for more detailed investigations into the use of CACE-I and related agents in
protecting against declines in gait and cognition in older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related
disorders."
10861755,"Summary
Polygenic risk scores have the potential to change management for common diseases. However, concerns
exist about the clinical implementation of PRS including the likely decreased performance of PRS in non-white
populations and the need to develop improved communication and extended informatics support for use of the
PRS in health care decisions. At Northwestern we will address these concerns through three major scientific
questions related to the clinical use of PRS: 1) Does use of PRS contribute to improved adherence to risk
management strategies and improved clinical outcomes? 2) Does a high risk PRS presented with culturally
sensitive and tailored risk communication improve adherence and outcomes across diverse racial and ethnic
groups? 3) Can we develop and test information technology that stores PRS in the EHR and delivers clinical
decision support (CDS) to aid providers in PRS use clinically? To enable recruitment, retention, and outcome
monitoring, we will create and then disseminate a smartphone application across Northwestern and, as
possible, the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network to facilitate the goals of eMERGE
4 (e4). Northwestern has been a primary contributor to all phases of eMERGE with Northwestern investigators
holding key leadership roles in the network. Northwestern’s previous rich experience in electronic phenotyping
involves using information extracted from our enterprise data warehouse, along with genomics and
epidemiology expertise in many areas, including PRS, for genomic discovery projects. We have a
demonstrated ability to recruit and retain large and ethnically diverse clinical populations for genetic result
return, and repeated successful integration of genetic results into Northwestern’s electronic health record as
discrete, computable lab values enabling effective clinical decision support. We will employ innovative
enrollment techniques that have higher success rates in diverse populations. As participants in the e4
consortium we will implement a program called ENDORSED (eMERGE Northwestern Develops Optimized
Risk Scores for Everyone’s DNA). Through the following aims ENDORSED will assess the utility of PRS,
including in diverse populations. In Aim 1, we will calculate and validate PRS for common disorders selected
specifically because they have medically-actionable outcomes. Aim 2 will recruit 2500 subjects for
participation in eMERGE 4, taking advantage of Northwestern Medicine’s extensive clinical network. Aim 3 will
use behavior theory to create culturally sensitive communication tools and then integrate PRS data into the
electronic health record. Aim 4 will then examine outcomes and uptake of behaviors before and after PRS
return. The completion of these aims will assess and evaluate PRS use for common diseases in diverse
groups producing important data about real-world implementation of genomic medicine."
10861732,"Project Summary:
The primary objective of this research is to develop novel statistical and computational tools to evaluate new
and existing cancer therapies for precision cancer medicine, with a principal focus on integrating multiple data
sources including randomized controlled trials (RCT) and real world data (RWD). All of the aims are motivated
by multidisciplinary collaboration. Evidence-based clinical decision making involves synthesizing available
research evidence from multiple resources, including RCT and RWD. Pivotal RCTs are the primary evidence
that established the oncologic equivalence or efficacy of local and systemic treatments. However, a recent
systematic review found little agreement between population-based RWD and RCTs when comparing the
same oncologic treatment regimens. This difference is thought to stem from the highly selective criteria used
for trial enrollment coupled with the rapidly changing nature of multidisciplinary cancer care. Moreover,
heterogeneous treatment effects by disease biologic tumor subtype on survival outcomes has not been
examined sufficiently in early RCTs. We will develop statistical tools and software to evaluate the agreement of
findings from RCTs and the real-world patient population, reassessing standard treatment guidelines on local-
regional therapies for early-stage breast cancer by patients’ clinical and tumor subtypes. While the proposed
methodology is agnostic to disease type, we will use breast cancer patients as proof of principle for the
approaches proposed.
The specific aims are: (1) to estimate and assess the agreement of treatment efficacy on survival outcomes
across multiple studies (e.g., RCT and RWD) using nonparametric calibration weights to adjust for treatment
selection bias and heterogeneity between studies; (2) to test the existence of a subgroup of patients with
enhanced treatment effect and predict subgroup membership of a treatment using a semi-parametric isotonic-
Cox model, and to develop a concordance-assisted learning tool for threshold identification to guide patient
treatment selection; (3) to infer the treatment effects on breast cancer-specific survival when the cause of
death is unknown in RWD by integrating data from RCT and RWD; (4) to estimate treatment effect for rare
subtypes of breast cancer by combining external aggregate data with individual-level data to improve inference
efficiency; and (5) to develop and disseminate publicly available, user-friendly software and facilitate the
reproducibility and applications of our methods to multiple existing databases, including large-population-level
data and RCT data for breast cancer research. The proposed research will advance general methodologic
development in comparative effectiveness and precision medicine research by efficiently integrating multiple
data sources. More importantly, the study findings could improve evidence-based treatment recommendations,
better informing clinicians to select optimal treatments according to patients’ tumor subtypes and other
characteristics, thus furthering clinical care via better integration of clinical science."
10861794,"The objective of this proposal is to refine the understanding of the signaling mechanism(s) within the primary cilium in relation to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Renal cysts interfere with kidney function and lead to major, long-term health complications. PKD and its related health complications result in a $7 billion per year economic burden in the United States so identifying molecular targets for treatment is a pressing unmet clinical need. Cilia, the slender protrusions on all renal cells, play key roles in cell signaling and cystogenesis but the details and underlying mechanism are ill-defined. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is primarily due to mutations in the cilia-associated polycystin genes, PKD1 and PKD2. Normally, the polycystins function in cilia to suppress a pathway that promotes cysts. Identification of the molecular components of this pathway, termed the cilia-dependent cyst activator (CDCA), represents a clear molecular target for therapeutic strategies to counter ADPKD. The major challenge in working out the CDCA pathway, and in understanding ciliary signaling more generally, is that the tools in the field are too blunt. Mouse models typically delete genes, resulting in complete loss of both the ciliary and cellular pools of protein, making any interpretation of cilia-specific function impossible. We circumvented this challenge with the ciliary GTPase ARL13B, a proposed mediator of the CDCA. We removed ARL13B specifically from cilia by engineering a mouse expressing a cilia-excluded ARL13BV358A variant that retains all known biochemical activities. Arl13bV358A/V358A mice are viable and fertile yet display cystic kidneys indicating that it is the absence of ciliary ARL13B that is specifically critical to kidney cyst formation. Our goal in this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that ciliary ARL13B plays key roles in regulating kidney cystogenesis. The proposed work is important in forging fundamental knowledge of the identity and the timing of critical signaling mechanisms from within the primary cilium that could lead to therapeutic intervention for PKD."
10861799,"For decades, diagnostic errors have constituted a blind spot in the effort to improve health care quality.
Compared with the multitude of metrics available to assess the quality of treatment, clinicians and policymakers
have few tools with which to measure and improve the quality of diagnostic decisions. Without better methods
to systematically measure the quality of diagnostic decisions at the clinician level, it will continue to be difficult to
identify patterns in diagnostic errors, categorize types and causes at scale, and develop and evaluate
interventions to prevent them. Our long-term goal is to develop tools to measure diagnostic quality across clinical
providers from large-scale data, and to build frameworks and knowledge to translate those measures into
appropriate interventions. The objective of this application is to apply and validate a system for measuring
diagnostic quality across radiologists in the setting of pneumonia diagnosis among 5.5 million visits with chest
X-rays in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) emergency departments (EDs). In this project, we will address
three challenges fundamental to any data-driven approach to measuring quality of diagnostic care. The first is a
lack of observable ground truth against which to benchmark diagnoses, particularly in large-scale data. This
challenge is particularly problematic when policies seek to balance type I errors (false positives) against type II
errors (false negatives). Second, rates of diagnostic errors depend on the underlying prevalence of disease in
the patient population, which may be incompletely observed. Third, small case numbers per clinician can
complicate comparisons between clinicians, since measured differences may reflect underlying diagnostic
quality or may arise from random noise. We will address these challenges with a novel combination of methods
from statistical classification and applied economics, building on prior work. We propose the following specific
aims: (1) We will validate data-driven measures of pneumonia diagnoses and diagnostic outcomes. In prior
conceptual work building on the econometric literature of selection, we show that we may infer relative
differences in diagnostic quality—as differences in type I error rates and type II error rates—even if individual
type I errors are unobservable, under quasi-experimental assignment of cases to radiologists; (2) We will
interpret provider-level rates of type I error and type II error in a receiver-operating curve (ROC) framework in
which diagnostic errors may arise from incorrect diagnostic thresholds (trading off type I and type II errors) or
poor diagnostic accuracy (incurring both too many type I errors and type II errors); and (3) To explore the
determinants of clinician diagnostic quality, we will correlate our measures of radiologist diagnostic quality with
their characteristics and actions across thousands of radiologists. To assess the potential consequences, we will
study health outcomes of patients quasi-experimentally assigned to radiologists of differing diagnostic quality.
Our project will lay the groundwork for data-driven measurement of diagnostic quality across clinical providers,
a necessary first step in understanding and improving the diagnostic performance of our health care system."
10824129,"Although brain oscillations are a promising target for neuromodulation for cognitive disease, we have a poor
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to oscillatory activity. Motivated by this gap in knowledge,
the Lega-Konopka collaboration has developed groundbreaking techniques to study the links between gene
expression and memory-enhanced brain oscillations. By integrating gene expression data and memory-relevant
iEEG signatures of the same human epilepsy patients, the collaboration discovered significant associations
between memory-associated oscillations and specific gene expression patterns in the temporal pole. This work
identified SMAD3 as a highly promising candidate for future study. We found strong links between SMAD3 gene
expression and slow theta oscillations, which are uniquely important for human cognitive processes. We also
found evidence that SMAD3 binds the regulatory elements of dozens of other genes connected with slow theta
oscillations. Many of these putative SMAD3 gene targets are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders
characterized by cognitive dysfunction. Taken together, this evidence suggests that SMAD3 may coordinate the
transcription of many genes that affect brain activity during memory processing. However, the brain-specific
transcriptional targets of SMAD3 and the precise impact of SMAD3-mediated gene networks on human neural
activity have yet to be definitively identified. The few studies on the functional role of SMAD3 in the brain showed
that Smad3 knockout mice have impaired neurogenesis and long-term potentiation. Although animal models
generate valuable insight into brain function, the complicated nature of human cognitive processes and related
oscillations decreases the translational value of approaches using animals. To overcome these problems, I will
use human organotypic slice culture (OSC) to define the function of SMAD3 in the regulation of memory-related
gene networks and neural activity in the human brain. In Aim 1, I will enhance SMAD3 activity in human OSC
then use snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq to identify SMAD3 gene targets. In Aim 2, I will demonstrate the ability to
silence SMAD3 expression in human OSC using lentiviral shRNA constructs. I will then use high-density
microelectrode array recordings to understand how the loss of SMAD3 impacts activity at the single neuron and
network levels. By increasing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory-relevant brain activity,
the completion of this project will lead us toward new therapies for cognitive disorders. This would be impossible
without the stellar support of Drs. Lega and Konopka, who have expertly guided my development as an aspiring
physician-scientist. The training plan in place for this fellowship period will allow me to learn and develop
innovative skills for studying human brain tissue in vitro with a combination of electrophysiology, molecular
biology, and genomic approaches. Benefitting from the unique combination of expertise from my mentors and
the resources provided by UTSW, this training will allow me to grow as a rigorous, passionate physician-scientist
with the tools to develop novel methods to study and treat the neurological disorders of my patients."

The human nuclear pore complex (NPC) consists of !1000 proteins of !30 different types. It is embedded in
the nuclear envelope, and controls macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Mutations
in constituent proteins of the NPC have been connected to various human diseases including autoimmune dys-
functions, neurological diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. While static structures of the NPC have
been modeled, additional research is necessary to understand the assembly process of the NPC. An improved
understanding of NPC assembly pathways may elucidate the crucial role the NPC has played in eukaryotic evo-
lution and eventually decode the link between genetic alterations in NPC associated proteins and a variety of
human diseases. However, the size of the NPC complex and timescales approaching one hour for assembly
completion have posed challenges to previous studies. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to compute
a spatiotemporal integrative model of human NPC assembly in collaboration with experimental characterization
from Jan Ellenberg at the European Microbiology Laboratory, Heidelberg. To build our spatiotemporal integrative
model of NPC assembly, we will model static snapshots of intermediate states throughout interphase NPC as-
sembly, connect snapshots to produce assembly trajectories, and refine our model based on new experimental
characterization. Our initial snapshots of NPC assembly will be modeled by a Bayesian posterior model density
that explicitly scores our model based on its agreement with both experimental data and physical theories. Our
model at each time step will be informed by the coarse-grained structure of the fully assembled NPC, atomic struc-
tures of its components, physical theories, and cryo-electron tomograms and fluorescence correlation spectra of
the intermediate states. Next, we will consider implicit connections between these modeled intermediate states
to form trajectories. We will score this ensemble of trajectories based on both the probability of static structures
sampled along the trajectory and the probability of the implicit transitions between static structures. Finally, we
will verify our model through experimental collaboration with Dr. Ellenberg. Specifically, we will predict proteins
crucial for rate limiting steps in NPC assembly, and then test our model’s predictions with new auxin-degradation
experiments and correlative light-electron microscopy. If our model cannot sufficiently describe NPC assembly,
we can refine our model by reflecting this new data as a new likelihood function, incorporating this likelihood
into our Bayesian posterior model density, and reweighting our integrative model. This entire process will be re-
peated iteratively until we reach sufficient agreement between simulation and experiment. The end result will be
an experimentally informed and validated molecular model of NPC assembly. Moreover, we will have produced
a general methodological framework, implemented in our open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), to
enable characterization of dynamic biomolecular processes in general."

Autoimmune Regulator gene (AIRE) prevents autoimmunity by promoting thymic deletion of self-reactive T cells.
While most studied in the thymus, AIRE is also expressed in secondary lymphoid organs, where it is thought to
contribute to peripheral tolerance through interaction with and deletion of self-reactive T cells. However, AIRE’s
role in extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) is likely more multi-faceted than in the thymus. We recently
identified AIRE expression in multiple myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These include
dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, but are predominantly composed of tumor associated macrophages
(TAMs), which are known to inhibit anti-tumor immune responses. While tumor associated eTACs were only
recently discovered by our group, prior work implicates AIRE in inhibiting anti-tumor immunity. Recently available
tools to study AIRE in mice have facilitated investigation of peripheral AIRE expression in the TME. We have
found tumor associated eTACs in several common solid tumor models expressing myeloid lineage markers by
both flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Critically, we also demonstrated that ablation of Aire+ cells
dramatically slows tumor progression. This preliminary data together with the therapeutic potential for targeting
eTACs in the TME to improve cancer immunotherapy make this a population deserving of thorough functional
investigation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that tumor associated eTACs are an
immunosuppressive, pro-tumoral cell population. Aim 1 of this proposal will define the phenotypic and
transcriptional profiles of tumor associated eTACs, as well as their spatial organization. Aim 2 will determine the
mechanism by which Aire+ cells can promote tumor progression. Aim 3 will define the signals that drive Aire
expression and elucidate the cell-intrinsic role of Aire in tumor associated eTACs. This research approach will
be carried out using a variety of methods including single cell analysis via RNA-seq, CyTOF, flow cytometry and
in vivo assays utilizing novel genetic mouse models. These proposed studies will be the first characterization
of AIRE expression in any tumor resident immune cells and will further our understanding of the function
of peripheral AIRE-expressing cell types. This could result in the discovery of novel pathways relevant to
therapeutic resistance and improve our understanding of global AIRE function. Translationally, this work may
identify novel immune targets for cancer therapies. This research project and fellowship training will be
conducted at a top-funded research institution, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in the
laboratories of Dr. James Gardner and Dr. Matthew Spitzer, with expert mentorship from Dr. Vasilis Ntranos. Dr.
Gardner has expertise in the study of peripheral AIRE and mouse model generation. Dr. Spitzer has expertise
in systems immunology and tumor infiltrating myeloid cell biology. Dr. Ntranos has expertise in computational
analysis of single cell datasets. Overall, this facility and team provide a rich training environment for completion
of this research and development of professional skills necessary for a career in academic research."

Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) regulate almost all aspects of embryonic
development, and are key regulators of homeostatic, metabolic and tissue repair processes in adult tissues.
Accordingly, abnormal FGF signaling results in a wide-range of diseases including genetic diseases, neurological
disorders, metabolic diseases, inflammatory syndromes, and cancer. The field of FGF signaling, therefore, unites
diverse biomedical disciplines that significantly impact human health. The overall goal of this proposal is to
galvanize multidisciplinary interactions between academic and industrial scientists, clinicians, and
trainees with a common interest in Fibroblast Growth Factor biology to accelerate the pace and enhance
the impact of our research on human health. To achieve this goal, financial support is sought for the 9th
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on FGFs in Development and Disease and its associated 6th Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) to be held at the Grand Galvez in Galveston, Texas on March 23rd- 29th, 2024. The
GRC/GRS on FGFs in Development and Disease is a unique opportunity to unite an international group of
researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds, promote the exchange of tools and ideas, and forge new
collaborations. At the 2024 conference entitled “Expanding the Frontiers of FGF Signaling: Fundamental
Mechanisms of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling and their Clinical Applications”, our specific aims are to (1)
emphasize new innovations that impact our mechanistic understanding of FGF-related diseases and their
therapeutic advancement, including the crosstalk with other Receptor Tyrosine Kinases; (2) encourage scientific
discussions and new collaborations among trainees, academic and industry scientists, and clinicians, and (3)
grow our existing network of innovators and enhance diversity in future generations of FGF researchers. To
maximize the success of the 2024 meeting, the program places particular importance on balanced representation
(geographic, gender, ethnicity, career level, and discipline) in both the speakers and attendees. Moreover, a
‘Power Hour’ is dedicated to discussing current obstacles to and novel approaches for promoting wider
participation of women and other under-represented groups in science."
10824955,"Abstract
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a b-herpesvirus that is ubiquitously spread throughout the human
population. CMV is the most common perinatal congenital viral infection among neonates and is also a
common postnatal infection targeting immunocompromised hosts. CMV induced pneumonitis is among the
most common manifestations of infection. Although an abundance of research has been conducted on the
immune response to CMV, the true route of initial infection is still in contention. Through research with murine
CMV (MCMV), it is thought that infection first occurs in the upper respiratory tract, specifically the olfactory
epithelium, with a subsequent primary seeding of susceptible cells in the lung. Traditionally, experiments with
MCMV have utilized systemic infection methods that may not accurately recapitulate in vivo dissemination.
Therefore, re-examination with physiologically relevant viral infection methods are of the utmost importance.
Following intratracheal administration of MCMV, I observed a distinct viral dissemination pattern with viral
replication only occurring in the lung with later salivary gland colonization. This contrasted with intraperitoneal
infection which resulted in robust infection of peripheral tissues, but no lung infection, with later colonization of
the salivary gland. Preliminary data also suggests that following acute respiratory infection, there is an increase
in the frequency of lymphocytes in the lung tissue with an outsized role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in response
to pulmonary CMV as compared to other innate lymphoid cell (ILC) compartments. Based on these data, I
hypothesize that the lung will play a central role in MCMV dissemination, and that ILCs will be heavily involved
in preventing systemic viral dissemination. My first aim will seek to investigate in vivo viral kinetics following
acute respiratory infection. I also aim to investigate the specific NK cell responses in the lung that control viral
dissemination. My initial data suggests an important role for NK cell activation in the lung, with limited survival
observed in animals deficient for Ly49H. To study the role of NK cells in response to respiratory MCMV
infection, I propose to employ a variety of genetic manipulations to selectively remove NK cells, B and T cells,
NK cell activating receptors, and cytokine receptors. Using these various models, I will assess animal survival,
viral prevalence, and immune activation following acute respiratory MCMV infection. These proposed studies
aim to elucidate the mechanisms of immune control of pulmonary CMV infection and may provide insights into
cellular therapies for the treatment of CMV pneumonitis. Additionally, by studying a more physiologically
relevant respiratory CMV infection model, I can gain further insights into the mechanisms of viral dissemination
in the human pathogenesis of CMV. To prepare me for the proposed work, my training has taken place in the
lab of the highly credentialed Laurent Brossay. My training will be greatly enhanced by careful mentoring by
my sponsor and opportunities to attend and present at national and international conferences. Completion of
this project will afford me the tools needed to have a successful career as an independent researcher."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is in the top tier of AMR threats as defined by
WHO. NG is responsible for the second most prevalent sexually transmitted infection worldwide, which can
cause long-term health consequences. Unfortunately, NG has rapidly developed resistance to all first-line
antimicrobials previously recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea, including the last viable antimicrobial,
ceftriaxone. As AMR continues to evolve, there is an urgent need for personalized treatment approaches that
can spare the use of ceftriaxone to reduce the chances of NG becoming resistant to this antimicrobial. However,
this requires clinicians to know drug resistance or susceptibility quickly enough to inform prescription decisions.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) periodically publishes STD treatment guidelines to help
clinicians, which are informed by susceptibility data generated by the national CDC Gonococcal Isolate
Surveillance Project (GISP). However, determining AMR requires prolonged (24-48 hours) microbiological
cultivation in sophisticated laboratory facilities, which has been supplanted by nucleic acid amplification tests
(NAAT) for diagnosis of NG infections. The widespread adoption of NAAT has created a critical void in AMR
testing, leading to a loss of capability to perform culture of NG in most testing clinics.
We propose to develop a rapid AST platform for NG, capable of testing against multiple antimicrobial conditions
at scale directly from clinical specimens. Our proposed method involves measuring the earliest transcriptional
responses to antimicrobials for rapid AST. We and others have shown that measuring mRNA expression levels
following a 10-minute antimicrobial exposure can predict susceptibility well before phenotypic changes in growth
are observable. This forms the basis of our proposed single-cell mRNA-enabled AST (sc-mRNA-AST) for NG.
To achieve sc-mRNA-AST for NG, our platform will use droplet microfluidics to isolate and analyze individual NG
cells from clinical specimens with heterogeneous bacterial flora. We will first identify the most susceptibility-
informative transcripts agnostic to mechanisms of resistance against each of 3 NG-relevant antimicrobials. We
will use ultrasensitive single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to quantify mRNA molecules from individual
cells without the need for amplification. Additionally, we will incorporate an assembly-line-like, cascaded
microfluidic design into our platform, allowing for numerous sc-mRNA-AST assays against clinically relevant
antimicrobial conditions. With an additional 2 minutes per condition, our platform can test 15 antimicrobial
conditions to determine susceptibility and minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) for 3 antimicrobials within 1
hour, directly from clinical urogenital samples. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we will use contrived
samples with NG isolates and prospectively collected clinical samples. Successful development of sc-mRNA-
AST for NG will lead to personalized treatment to spare ceftriaxone use, and improved AMR surveillance to
inform antimicrobial stewardship and public health policy."

Mitochondrial function declines during aging. The dysfunction is accelerated in age-associated diseases such
as Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. Thus, therapeutic approaches to maintain or recover
mitochondrial function may promote healthy aging or slow age-associated disease progression. Recently, we
have shown that the mitochondrial network expansion that occurs during development is an emergent property
of the synthesis of highly expressed mitochondrial proteins. Increased mitochondrial import of the highly
expressed mitochondrial proteins outcompete the transcription factor ATFS-1, preventing it from entering
mitochondria. This allows ATFS-1 to traffic to the nucleus and activate a mitochondrial network expansion
transcription program known as UPRmt. These findings suggest an interplay between protein synthesis,
mitochondria protein import capacity, and mitochondrial network expansion.
 The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a translation control pathway that reduces overall protein
synthesis while preferentially increases translation of ATF-4 in response to diverse stressors including amino
acid depletion, ER dysfunction and mitochondrial perturbations. The ISR is mediated by 4 kinases (3 in C.
elegans) that all phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which in turn modulates protein synthesis.
While considerable work has demonstrated that the ISR is active in response to mitochondrial perturbation, the
functional outputs of the ISR related to mitochondrial biology remain unknown. I have obtained or generated
several C. elegans strains in which the ISR is impaired. Quite surprisingly, these worms have increased
mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial genomes. Intriguingly, these animals also live significantly longer than
wildtype worms, suggesting that increased mitochondrial mass is sufficient to extend organismal lifespan. I
hypothesize that the ISR matches mitochondrial network expansion with the physiological and environmental
inputs that activate the ISR by antagonizing ATFS-1 function. Here, I focus on the role of ISR-dependent
translation attenuation or ATF-4 synthesis as direct or indirect regulators of ATFS-1-dependent transcription via
the following aims.
1. Determine the mechanisms by which the ISR regulates ATFS-1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis.
2. Elucidate the mechanisms by which the ISR modulates longevity and healthspan."

Fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of the cell biological mechanisms that drive mitochondrial decline
and associated age-related diseases. Organelles like the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are
physically and functionally linked, in part via sites of membrane contact. These lines of communication between
mitochondria and other organelles represent an understudied avenue by which to therapeutically target
mitochondrial function. Our long-term goal is to understand the physiological roles of inter-organelle
communication during aging and age-related disease. In pursuit of that goal, our objective in this application is
to determine how the ER regulates mitochondrial health during aging through its role as a platform for calcium
signaling. We have exploited the simple anatomy of C. elegans and experimental advantages in genetics and
microscopy to lay a foundation in this model for the study of ER-mitochondrial interactions. Similar to mammals,
the worm ER calcium efflux channel, inositol triphosphate receptor (InsP3R), exerts potent control over
mitochondrial bioenergetics, and we have extended the roles of InsP3R to regulation of mitochondrial gene
expression and dynamics in the worm as well. Furthermore, the InsP3R regulates lifespan in C. elegans through
mechanisms that depend upon mitochondrial function. Here we will test the hypothesis that ER remodeling in
aging animals acts to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and organismal decline by promoting aberrant subcellular
calcium signaling and dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine whether the InsP3R is a cell
autonomous regulator of mitochondrial function and lifespan. Secondly, we will identify the molecular
mechanisms linking InsP3R activity to the diverse changes observed in mitochondrial behavior. Finally, we will
determine how organellar remodeling of the calcium flux machineries initiates age-onset mitochondrial
dysfunction. By revealing the mechanisms by which ER signaling governs mitochondrial health at the organismal
level, these results will open new therapeutic avenues in treating mitochondrial pathologies."
10827988,"In type 2 diabetic patients, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)1-based therapies profoundly lower
hyperglycemia without hypoglycemic risk. However, adverse intestinal events with these
therapies limit dose escalations and decrease patient compliance. Studies show that
endogenous GLP1 do not cause such intestinal events and yield superior metabolic effects.
Despite such evidence, no GLP1 secretagogue targeting L-cells is available due to a gap in
understanding GLP1 secretory mechanisms. Our preliminary data show that intestinal hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF) signaling enhances GLP1 secretion in mice and improves glucose
tolerance in a GLP1-dependent manner. We found that intestinal HIF, particularly HIF-2α,
potentiates fatty acid-stimulated GLP1 secretion by inducing the expression of the lipid sensor
G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40, enriched in intestinal L-cells. Given that nutrients regulate
GLP1 secretion, our study investigates whether intestinal HIF-2α signaling links dietary cues
with GLP1 secretion via a nutrient-sensing mechanism and elucidates its metabolic implications.
In support, we show that disruption of intestinal HIF-2α in mice reduces GPR40 expression and
decreases GLP1 levels. Moreover, acute inhibition of HIF-2α during fasting attenuates GPR40
expression and abolishes lipid-stimulated GLP1 secretion, demonstrating a novel role of
intestinal HIF-2α in postprandial GLP1 secretion. We identified an altered flux of TCA metabolite
α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is associated with the induction of HIF-2α signaling in epithelial cells.
Thus, Aim 1 will elucidate whether epithelial metabolic flux dynamically regulates L-cell HIF-2α
signaling. And Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism by which HIF-2α regulates GLP1
secretion. Our data show that activation of intestinal HIF-2α attenuates diet-induced glucose
intolerance and hepatic steatosis, associated with elevated GLP1 levels. Given that elevated
postprandial GLP1 ameliorates glucose intolerance, Aim 3 will test our postulation that L-cell
HIF2α will protect against diet-induced metabolic perturbations by elevating GLP1 levels using
mice with gain or loss of HIF-2α in L-cells. Lastly, we will establish whether activating HIF-2α
will induce GLP1 in humans using the human intestinal organoid system. Given that potent HIF-
2 inducers are available understanding the role of intestinal HIF-2α in nutrient sensing and
metabolic homeostasis may lead to novel strategies to induce endogenous GLP1 secretion in
metabolic diseases."

 Primary cilia organize signaling pathways such as vision, olfaction and Hedgehog signaling and dysfunction
of cilia causes a host of symptoms in disease collectively known as ciliopathies. The movements of signaling
receptors into, inside and out of cilium are critical for the correct regulation of these pathways. Past work from
the lab identified two paths for the regulated exit of signaling receptors out of cilia. One route goes back into the
cell and has now been extensively characterized. Another route packages signaling receptors into extracellular
vesicles (EVs) and its mechanisms remain poorly understood.
 The major goal of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms for signaling receptor packaging
into ciliary EVs. A major goal of this proposal is the generate genetically encoded disrupters of ciliary EV
shedding. These tools will enable a rigorously test of the physiological importance of ectocytosis."

 Adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) are critically dependent on the proper function of mitochondria to supply the fuel
for contraction (ATP) and to regulate other essential cellular processes. Mitochondrial health is maintained by a
selective form of autophagy, termed mitophagy, which removes Ubiquitin (Ub)-labeled damaged mitochondria.
Our current understanding of mitophagy is based on the actions of two key proteins, the Ub ligase Parkin and
kinase PINK1, which mark dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation via a phosphorylated Ub chain.
Surprisingly, ablation of Parkin failed to impact homeostatic mitophagy or cardiac function in both young and
ageing mice, suggesting the existence of yet to be identified, Parkin-independent mechanisms control
mitochondrial turnover in CMs. Given robust mitophagic activity in adult hearts and the deleterious impact of
impaired mitophagy in various cardiac diseases, there is a growing need to identify novel, Parkin-independent
regulators of mitophagy in the heart. In preliminary data for this proposal, we document a new mechanism linking
Cullin-Ring Ub ligase 5 (CRL5) with mitochondrial quality control in the heart. CRL5 is a multi-protein complex
comprised of the RING box protein RBX2, scaffold protein Culllin 5 (Cul5), adaptor proteins Elongin B/C, and
various substrate receptor proteins. Activation of CRL5 requires the neddylation of Cul5, a process that
conjugates the small Ub-like protein, NEDD8 to target proteins. By controlling the turnover of its protein
substrates, CRL5 participates in several biological processes and human diseases, but a role in the heart is not
yet known. Inhibition of neddylation (upstream signaling that governs CRL5 activity), robustly suppressed
mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy, and mice deficient in neddylation develop heart failure due to
impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Proteomics analysis identifies RBX2 and Cul5 are associated
with mitochondria in homeostasis; and their recruitment to mitochondria is upregulated following mitochondria
damage. RBX2 is required for mitochondrial ubiquitination and turnover, and its actions in mitochondria are
independent of Parkin but are recapitulated by Cul5. Moreover, deletion of RBX2 in adult mice provokes
accumulation of damaged mitochondria and leads to heart failure. These findings support our central hypothesis
that RBX2-CRL5 Ub ligase mediates mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy to regulate cardiac myocyte
function and survival in homeostasis and under stress. Three aims are proposed. Aim 1 will define the role of
RBX2-CRL5 in mitochondrial turnover in the healthy normal heart using RBX2- and Cul5- deficient mice. Aim 2
will identify the molecular underpinnings of CRL5-mediated mitophagy by identifying its substrate receptors,
substrates and scaffold proteins in mitochondria and by investigating the interplay between CRL5 and PINK1.
Aim 3 will test the feasibility of modulation of RBX2 to improve mitophagy and cardiac injury in pressure-
overloaded hearts. This study is significant as it will identify CRL5 as a mitochondrial Ub ligase to maintain
mitochondrial integrity and thus provide potential therapeutic targets for treatment of heart failure."

Argonautes are the only known family of proteins that can be programmed with any RNA or DNA sequence to
make sequence-specific regulators of transcription, mRNA stability, or translation. Our goal is to understand
the biology and mechanism of paradigmatic examples of Argonaute proteins and pathways, and, ultimately, to
use these insights to design and improve small RNA-guided therapies for human diseases. Indeed, studying
how Argonautes work and how their small RNA guides are made has led to the development and FDA
approval of small RNA drugs. Nevertheless, fundamental questions about the specificity and function of
Argonaute protein-mediated pathways remain unanswered.
 Despite >20 years of study, for example, we still cannot predict how Dicer enzymes will cleave a pre-
miRNA based only on its sequence. We will use biochemical and structural approaches to identify the features
that determine where Dicer cleaves a pre-miRNA and how Dicer partner proteins alter this process.
 In animals, the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute proteins uses 23–30-nt “piRNA” guides to silence
transposons or regulate gene expression in germ cells. piRNAs are made from specific long, single-stranded
precursor RNAs. Our research seeks to explain why some genomic regions and transcripts are destined to
make piRNAs, while others are excluded. By studying piRNAs in flies, moths, and mice, we hope to identify
both evolutionarily ancient and newly evolved strategies that animals use to designate piRNA precursors and
to convert them into functional complexes with PIWI proteins. While experimental and computational studies
have dramatically improved our ability to predict miRNA targets, similar advances have not yet been made for
piRNAs. In the spermatocytes of placental mammals, pachytene piRNAs are nearly as abundant as ribosomes,
but we still do not know what or how they regulate. Mutations in the proteins that make pachytene piRNAs
cause male infertility, suggesting that pachytene piRNAs promote sperm development. We will use
biochemistry and mouse genetics to study the function and specificity of pachytene piRNAs.
 Finally, 30% of bacterial genomes encode Argonautes, yet we do not know what they do. Surprisingly,
we find that in Thermus thermophilus, the DNA-guided, DNA-cleaving Argonaute (TtAgo) acts together with
gyrase A to ensure successful replication. Our hypothesis is that TtAgo has acquired a role in disentangling the
circular chromosomes at the end of DNA replication, perhaps to compensate for the absence of
Topoisomerase IV in this organism. We will use genetics and biochemistry to understand how TtAgo acquires
its guides, and how and what it regulates in vivo.
 Together these studies will reveal diverse strategies that organisms use to make small RNAs and how
they use Argonautes to control development, differentiation, and reproductive health."
10861763,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a critical tool to treat heart or lung failure, in the form of
extracorporeal circulation through membrane oxygenation or through a ventricular assist device.
Thrombosis and bleeding remain major complications with MCS. As a result, patients receive systemic
anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis. However, this can increase the risk for bleeding, which is the
most common complication in MCS. To counter this issue, there has been a large effort to eliminate or
minimize the need for anticoagulation. Surprisingly, even if anticoagulation is eliminated, studies
demonstrate that bleeding remains highly prevalent, while thrombosis remains relatively unaffected.
Therefore, there is a need to focus on alternative pathways to bleeding. Almost all patients on MCS
experience the bleeding disorder acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Furthermore, patients, especially
pediatric patients, experience platelet dysfunction and can exhibit low platelet counts. We attribute
these events to the flow environment in MCS. While many groups have focused on the effect of shear
stress on blood, our group discovered an unprecedented role for turbulence in driving loss of high and
even intermediate molecular weight von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers, reducing the ability for
VWF to bind to platelets and to collagen. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that flow in MCS is
causing signals for platelet activation, but also clearance and cell death, with an unknown effect of
turbulence. The combination of signals in response to flow can lead to both thrombosis and hemorrhage,
depending on the balance of events. Our goal is identify what specific conditions lead to VWF or platelet
functional loss in response to flow by pursuing three aims. 1) We will quantify changes in thrombus
growth in response to turbulence relative to laminar shear conditions for various anticoagulants. 2) We
will quantify the increased cleavage occurring in turbulence relative to laminar flow for similar shear
stress conditions and how VWF function varies after flow exposure with and without flow-induced
extension. 3) We will assess platelet state after exposure to different flow regimes and how this changes
with the presence of VWF or with potential new therapeutic targets. Altogether, this work will distinguish
the impact of turbulence relative to shear stress on blood, which could lead to improved design criteria
for blood-contacting medical devices and potential therapeutics if we identify specific pathways leading
to dysfunctional hemostasis."

HIV-specific T cell responses or CAR-T cell treatments fail to provide sustained control of HIV infection because
of the eventual reduction or loss of their functional anti-HIV activity, even in the absence of mutational immune

functional and resilient CMV-specific CD8 T cell responses to provide improved immune control of HIV infection.
We propose to combine the capacity of synTacs to selectively activate and markedly expand CMV-specific CD8
T cells with potent and sustained anti-viral activity with three Specific Aims (SA) to redirect them to target HIV-
infected cells. We will either convert the expanded CMV CD8 T cells into HIV-specific CAR T cells (SA 1), or
anti-HIV T cells (SA 2), or modify the synTac structure to link CMV-c-pMHC, gp120-binders and costimulatory
ligands, to both fully activate and direct CMV CD8 T cells to target HIV-infected cells (SA 3), thereby mobilizing
an in vivo immune response that controls HIV infection, eliminates reactivated latently infected cells and provides
sustained ART-free remission of HIV infection to PWH. Furthermore, we will also utilize synTacs delivering

T cells with potent and sustained anti-viral activity with three Specific Aims (SA) to redirect them to target HIV-
infected cells. We will either convert the expanded CMV CD8 T cells into HIV-specific CAR T cells (SA 1), or
anti-HIV T cells (SA 2), or modify the synTac structure to link CMV-c-pMHC, gp120-binders and costimulatory
ligands, to both fully activate and direct CMV CD8 T cells to target HIV-infected cells (SA 3), thereby mobilizing
an in vivo immune response that controls HIV infection, eliminates reactivated latently infected cells and provides
sustained ART-free remission of HIV infection to PWH. Furthermore, we will also utilize synTacs delivering
defined costimulatory signals, to extend our knowledge regarding the capacity of different costimulatory signals
to generate the most potent CD8+ T cells and CAR-T cells for eliminating reactivated latently infected T cells."

Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common
neurodegenerative disease. Alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor for the development of AD and this
intersection of alcohol abuse and AD presents an enormous public health concern. Chronic, heavy alcohol use
is associated with a higher risk of developing AD and accelerated progression of the disease. The clinical
phase of AD is preceded by a decades long preclinical phase that is characterized by early deposition of
amyloid b (Ab) and neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus (LC), a norepinephrine nucleus in the brainstem. We
propose a novel mechanism by which chronic alcohol consumption renders LC neurons vulnerable to
degeneration. We recently discovered a novel cellular mechanism that selectively induces mitochondrial
oxidant stress in axons. Cytosolic monoamines, including norepinephrine, are metabolized by monoamine
oxidase (MAO) enzymes and the electrons generated from this process are directly shuttled into the
mitochondrial intermembrane space. This produces increased mitochondrial oxidant stress selectively in
axons. We propose that chronic alcohol consumption activates this novel mechanism of axonal mitochondrial
oxidant stress leading to a degenerative cascade in LC neurons. Our pilot studies suggest that chronic,
intermittent alcohol consumption decreased VMAT2 mRNA and increased axonal oxidant stress in the LC.
Importantly, we also showed that Ab pathology was increased in APP/PS1 mice that underwent chronic,
intermittent alcohol consumption compared to age-matched water drinking mice. Thus, we hypothesize that
chronic, intermittent alcohol consumption decreases VMAT2 expression in the LC leading to increased
metabolism of cytosolic norepinephrine by MAO, which then causes axonal mitochondrial oxidant stress. This
elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress would then accelerate LC degeneration and Ab deposition in mouse
models of AD. We will test this hypothesis using 2 genetic mouse models of AD, APP/PS1 and APP-NL knock-
in mice, which develop progressive Ab pathology. A combination of cutting-edge two-photon laser scanning
microscopy (2PLSM) in ex vivo brain slices, false fluorescent neurotransmitters (FFNs), genetically encoded
redox biosensors, immunohistochemistry, stereological, pharmacological, and genetic techniques will be used
to investigate the effects of chronic, intermittent alcohol consumption on VMAT2 expression, VMAT2
packaging of norepinephrine, LC axonal mitochondrial oxidant stress, LC degeneration, Ab pathology, and
MAO-dependence. In aim 1, we will determine the effect of chronic, intermittent alcohol consumption on LC
axonal mitochondrial oxidant stress. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on
LC degeneration and Ab pathology. Our proposed experiments will be the first to explore a novel axonal
mitochondrial oxidant stress-mediated neurodegenerative mechanism underlying the interaction between
chronic alcohol consumption and AD."

In the United States, >40% of systemic drugs ordered for children are off-label (used outside of an FDA-
approved age, indication, etc.). Furthermore, rates of off-label use in children are rising, particularly for
treatment indications unapproved at any age. Use, overuse, and combined use (polypharmacy) of off-label
medicines for unsupported indications may put millions of children at risk each year for serious drug-related
harms that outweigh uncertain benefits of treatment. This team’s long-term goal is to improve the judicious,
evidence-based use of medicines that will inform clinical decision-making and make children healthier and
safer. The specific objective of this project is to characterize the risks for serious drug-related harms in
children from some of the drugs used most commonly despite insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety:
psychotropic drugs. The central hypothesis is that use of certain psychotropic drugs in children is associated
with increased risks of serious harms. Psychotropic drugs are used as applied examples for many reasons: 1)
high and rising prevalence of unsupported off-label use in children; 2) insufficient evidence of efficacy in
children; 3) potential for serious or fatal harms; 4) potentially greater harms in children than in adults; 5) critical
therapeutic needs; 6) available therapeutic alternatives (e.g., safer drugs, non-pharmacologic interventions);
and 7) measurable outcomes. Based on these criteria, gaps in the literature, and preliminary data, this
proposal focuses on selected serious harms (namely, suicide, arrhythmias, and severe skin reactions) possibly
associated with antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine) and antiepileptic drugs/mood stabilizers (AEDs) (e.g.,
lamotrigine). Specifically, this proposal aims to evaluate the extent to which: 1) certain antidepressants and
AEDs increase or decrease the risk of death by suicide in children (Aim 1); 2) certain antidepressants and
AEDs increase or decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or sudden death in children (Aim
2); and 3) certain antiepileptic drugs/mood stabilizers or drug combinations increase or decrease the risk of
severe skin reactions in children (Aim 3). The project team will study distinct pediatric populations within two
national claims and electronic health records databases to accomplish these aims. This research will produce
generalizable, actionable, clinically relevant evidence now lacking on relative and absolute risks of serious
harms from drugs and drug combinations increasingly used off-label and with insufficient evidence in children.
These rare outcomes cannot be feasibly studied with clinical trials due to the need for prohibitively large
sample sizes. Comparisons across age groups, diagnoses, drug doses, and concomitant drugs will not only
quantify risks in key subgroups but will also shed light on underlying biology and mechanisms. This project also
begins an important new line of work that will inform improvements the overall quality of evidence for drugs that
children commonly use despite insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety."
