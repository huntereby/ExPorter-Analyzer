Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately affect Black Americans compared to
White Americans. Structural racism – the totality of ways by which society fosters racial discrimination and
White supremacy through mutually reinforcing, inequitable systems in housing, education, employment, health
care, criminal justice and other domains – may drive the constellation of social risk factors and comorbidities
that increase the risk of ADRD. The mechanisms and pathways by which structural racism contributes to
ADRD in Black Americans are as yet largely unexplored. We propose to assess the influence of structural
racism on incidence of ADRD in a high-risk group of Americans, Black women. Our study will be based on
participants and data from a 26-year follow-up study of 59,000 Black women from across the U.S., the Black
Women’s Health Study (BWHS). We will develop a measure of structural racism that is more comprehensive
than most currently in use and test characteristics of this measure against those of several published
measures, at the county and state level. Our new measure will use data on unemployment, poverty, level of
education, and incarceration; the data needed for its development will be obtained by linking participants’
geocoded addresses from 1995-2021 to appropriate public data sources. We will identify incident cases of
ADRD through an already developed and tested method of linkage of BWHS participants aged 65 and older to
Medicare data for the years 2008-2022; this will yield an estimated 1,500 incident cases of ADRD in 15,000 to
16,000 BWHS participants. Since enrollment in the BWHS in 1995, the participants have provided information
on a large number of health and other factors, which include potential risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes,
low level of education) and protective factors (e.g., exercise, social support) for ADRD. The study has collected
information at three different times on perceived experiences of interpersonal racism, and these reported
experiences have been associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes (e.g., weight gain) in the
BWHS, as expected. Thus, it will be possible to assess the effects of structural racism alone on incidence of
ADRD as well as the combined effects of structural and interpersonal racism. We will also study moderation or
mediation of effects by a large number of other factors on the association of structural racism with incidence of
ADRD. Since data have been collected over a period of 26 years in geographic areas across the U.S., it will be
possible to assess effects of structural racism on ADRD incidence over time and place at the county and state
level. Thus, the proposed study will provide new and important information on structural racism and ADRD in
Black women."
10910180,"The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) Regional Biocontainment
Laboratory (RBL) provides a vast array of services that support the discovery and development
of countermeasures for biodefense and emerging infectious agents with unmet medical needs.
Central to this mission is the support the RBL provides for basic and translational research that
require biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) or animal BSL-3 (ABSL-3) containment. The long-term goal for
the Facilities Management Maintenance and Operations Core (Facility core) is to provide the
appropriate management team, staff, engineering controls and equipment necessary to support
those research programs requiring ABSL-3 and BSL-3 containment without interruption and in
compliance with federal regulations. The Facilities core will integrate oversight for (1)
maintenance of the mechanical and vivarium infrastructure necessary for daily operation of the
BSL-3 and ABLS-3 labs, (2) annual certification, preventative maintenance and monitoring of
critical building systems (3) decontamination of equipment and materials leaving the facility, and
(4) maintenance of basic lab scientific and biosafety equipment needed by RBL users such as
Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs), freezers, CO2 incubators, etc. This will be achieved
through the following aims and goals. Aim 1. Maintenance and operation of the mechanical
infrastructure to support BSL-3 and ABLS3 labs including the replacement of critical components
of the mechanical infrastructure that are currently beyond their normal life expectancy and the
preventative maintenance contracts needed for periodic validation and certification of the labs of
the building systems. Aim 2. Maintenance of the vivarium infrastructure to support research in
ABSL-3 containment. This includes replacement of mouse caging systems that are at end-of-life
and annual preventative maintenance and certification processes. Aim 3. Maintenance and
certification of BSL-3 lab scientific and biosafety equipment used by researchers working in the
BS-3 and ABSl-3 containment. This includes replacement of biosafety cabinets that have reached
the end-of-life as well as basic scientific equipment that is heavily used by our researchers. The
outcomes will be to extend the operating lifespan for the RBL, protect RBL staff and users from
occupational exposures due to mechanical failures, prevent extended shutdown of the RBL due
to mechanical failures, and improve efficiency and research productivity by removing bottlenecks
and keeping the BSL-3 and ABSL-3 labs operating at full capacity."
10910182,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL)
mission is to maintain a facility for research that requires biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) or animal (ABSL-3)
containment. The UTHSC RBL has the appropriate management team, staff, engineering controls, equipment,
and facilities to support bacterial, viral, and fungal research programs necessitating BSL-2, BSL-3, ABSL-2 and
ABSL-3 containment; however, the mission of the RBL is to facilitate BSL-3 and ABSL-3 research. As an NIH
funded facility, the priority for use of the facility is for those with NIH funding requiring BSL-3 or ABSL-3
containment. Hence, the BSL-3 Practices Core is a cornerstone of all facility management, operations and
research-related activities that take place in the UTHSC RBL.
 The rationale for having a BSL-3 Practices Core is (1) that it will integrate the management of operations
and training for BSL-3 pathogens of which some are select agents, (2) promotes communication between
Research Safety Affairs, UTREC (UTHSC Regional Biocontainment Laboratory Executive Committee) and the
RBL Managers, and (3) harmonize compliance, security, individual competency, and practices across our RBL
Staff and our users. Hence this will increase efficiency of services provided for the BSL-3 practices. The major
aims and goals for the BSL-3 Practices Core in this UC7 application are as follows. This core is significant as
biosafety, biosecurity, and BSL-3 practices for BSL-3 research is integrated into every aspect of the
UTHSC RBL and is critical and essential for its function.
 The objectives of the BSL-3 Practices Core are to: Objective 1. To enhance the efficiency of the UTHSC
RBL in its support of research programs and enhance the research productivity of the investigators who may
use the RBL; Objective 2. Management and operation of the RBL BSL-3 Practices Core; and Objective 3. To
ensure a safe and secure work environment within the RBL through training, provision of SOPs, support in
development of SOPs, select agent inventory and accountability."
10792734,"The standard model for development assumes that areas develop sequentially, in a feedforward manner
starting with primary visual cortex (V1). However, there is a notable exception: Primate motion area MT, and its
homolog PSS in the ferret, develop as early as V1. Early phases of development should therefore not be seen
as being under the control of V1 only, but will be jointly influenced by V1 and MT/PSS. To appropriately
incorporate this idea into developmental models, however, a precise understanding of how the areas interact
during develop is required. Should MT/PSS largely be seen as a secondary stage that filters developmental
drive received from V1, or are the areas interacting in a more complex way, which ultimately would result in
more flexibility for how development could propagate through the visual hierarchy? Here, we will investigate
the interactions between ferret PSS and V1, during an early phase of visual development in which selectivity
for motion direction develops, to address this question. Our experiments will use retrograde tracers,
extracellular recordings, and manipulations of neural activity (inactivation and stimulation) to test two
questions: First, whether PSS can function in a V1-independent manner, almost like a primary area, during this
developmental phase. Second, whether feedback from PSS plays a role in V1 development, a reversal of the
standard assumptions that would also mean that V1-PSS interactions will impact even the most fundamental
level of visual processing. The overarching goal of this proposal is to expand developmental models from
focusing on a single area at a time, to a network-wide view, a necessary step to capture the complexity of a
process that ultimately occurs at the network level."
10800651,"ABSTRACT (Microbiome and Transcriptomics Core - MTC) 
Current studies in the area of microbial pathogenesis and immunity require knowledge of whole cell and 
system wide responses to infection of both the host and pathogen. Without proper expertise in state of the art 
technology and analysis tools necessary to gather this information, progress cannot be made at the pace 
required for remaining at the forefront of scientific discovery. The Microbiome and Transcriptomics Core 
(MTC) will serve an integral role in ensuring that our COBRE researchers can properly collect microbiome and 
gene expression data at the highest level of rigor using the most advanced technology and methods. The 
MTC will be an extension of the existing OUHSC Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research 
(LMBCR), an established and well-managed university Core laboratory. The MTC will employ personnel from 
within the LMBCR and INBRE Bioinformatics Core that have extensive experience in the focus areas (next gen 
sequencing methods, including microbiome and RNAseq, and bioinformatics) required for the Junior 
Investigator projects. The MTC will provide whole cell/system wide analysis of gene expression using 
established next generation sequencing and transcriptomics technology and appropriate bioinformatics 
approaches. Support for these applications by the MTC will include pre-project consultation, assistance with 
sample preparation and RNA isolation protocols, wet-bench sample processing, bioinformatics analysis and 
post project data deposition, manuscript preparation, and aid with details necessary for future grant 
applications."
10793116,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social cognitive deficits are prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and significantly contribute to
poor community functioning. Since most people living with SSD are in their mid- and late-life and social
cognitive deficits often persist or even worsen over the course of illness, there is a critical need to develop
effective interventions for mid-late life SSD. Characterizing social cognitive deficits and their changes across
age and identifying neural markers are prerequisites to developing efficient identification strategies and
targeted neurobiological treatments. In response to RFA-MH-22-270 “Schizophrenia and Related Disorders
during Mid- to Late-life,” this project aims to advance knowledge in social cognition—one of the identified
priority research areas. We will recruit a large sample (n = 192; 50% female) of SSD participants in their mid-
late life (age 35 to 75). Additionally, 48 early-psychosis (age 18-34) and 120 age-matched non-psychiatric
participants will serve as clinical and healthy comparisons, respectively. Participants will complete
assessments of psychiatric phenotypes, neurocognition, and community functioning. Social cognition will be
assessed using a comprehensive battery capturing low- to high-level processes. A subset (75%) of the
participants will additionally undergo EEG during social cognitive tasks to determine the theta-band neural
oscillatory features underlying social cognitive deficits. The specific aims of this project are threefold: 1)
Delineate the age trajectories of social cognitive deficits in mid-late life SSD; 2) Evaluate theta-band neural
oscillatory features as neural markers of social cognitive deficits in mid-late life SSD; and 3) Parse
heterogeneity based on neural oscillatory signatures in mid-late life SSD. Successfully completing these
specific aims will advance our understanding of the course and neural mechanisms of social cognition in mid-
late life SSD, advancing NIMH’s Strategic Objective Objectives 2.1 (characterize the trajectories of cognitive
and affective processes across the lifespan), 2.2 (identify behavioral and biological markers of mental
illnesses), and 1.3 (identify neural mechanisms contributing to mental illnesses). The findings will guide
identification and personalized treatment strategies, providing critical knowledge to determine who and how to
intervene."

 Approximately 1 million total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures are carried out in the U.S. annually to
address pathology underlying knee joint pain and functional limitations resulting from osteoarthritis. TKAs are
conducted primarily in older adults, and while effective for pain reduction in many, 15% or more of TKA
patients report unsatisfactory long-term pain outcomes despite a technically successful surgery. Post-TKA pain
at up to 4-year follow-up has been reported to be worse than the preoperative pain in 7% of TKA patients.
While mechanisms contributing to long-term pain post-TKA are not well-understood, our prior longitudinal
project (R01AG048915) found evidence that oxidative stress (OS) may be one contributor to post-TKA chronic
pain. Elevated intraoperative pre-incision levels of F2-isoprostanes and isofurans (the most sensitive in vivo
OS biomarkers) and increased expression of these biomarkers during tourniquet application in standard TKA
procedures predicted greater post-TKA pain intensity (past 24 hour and past week) at 6-months post-TKA. The
proposed project builds on this prior work and will answer a critical clinical question: does reducing OS in the
preoperative and perioperative period improve long-term post-TKA pain outcomes? We propose a prospective
randomized placebo-controlled trial that will examine preoperative, perioperative, and long-term OS; pain; and
functional outcomes and test for the first time the hypothesis that a potent antioxidant intervention (Glycine plus
N-acetylcysteine [GlyNAC]) reduces OS and chronic postsurgical pain in patients undergoing TKA. GlyNAC
has been shown to dramatically decrease F2-isoprostanes in initial trials, supporting its potential utility as an
antioxidant intervention for improving post-TKA pain outcomes. Given the large number of older adults
experiencing adverse post-TKA chronic pain outcomes each year (≈150,000 annually), the proposed project
could potentially have practice-changing clinical implications. We will enroll older adult osteoarthritis patients
undergoing primary unilateral TKA and randomize them to receive GlyNAC (n=74) or placebo (alanine; n = 74)
beginning 4 weeks prior to TKA with continuation until 6 weeks post-TKA. Baseline pain and psychosocial
phenotyping will be carried out and OS will be assessed in the patient’s home at 4 weeks pre-TKA (T0) and
again after 4 weeks of the intervention [3 days prior to TKA] (T1); perioperatively at pre-incision [T2], 45
minutes after tourniquet application [T3], and 15 minutes post-tourniquet removal [T4]; and at post-TKA follow-
ups. Pain, function, and opioid use outcomes will be assessed at 6-week, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up.
We will test the hypothesis that GlyNAC reduces OS and pain intensity, improves function, and reduces opioid
analgesic use at 6-week and 6-month (primary) follow-up compared to placebo. We will also test whether
GlyNAC-related reductions in pain intensity at 6-month follow-up are maintained at 12-month follow-up, and
whether pre-GlyNAC baseline OS levels moderate efficacy of GlyNAC for improving long-term pain outcomes."

Metabolic diseases are a pressing public health issue in the United States. With the meteoric rise of insulin
resistance, obesity, and atherosclerosis, mechanistic understanding of lipid metabolism could not be more
imperative. Many of these metabolic disorders involve improper storage of lipids into cellular lipid storage
organelles known as lipid droplets (LDs). These unique organelles, which contain a core of triacylglycerols and
cholesterol esters, accumulate when dietary free fatty acids are abundant, and conversely get consumed when
there is a high demand for energy. In this way, LDs are essential for both cellular and whole-body
homeostasis. Proteins that reside on the surface of LDs play critical roles in the dynamic turnover of LDs by
controlling the intake and release of the lipids stored within. Although the metabolic roles of LDs are well
known, the mechanisms employed to regulate the growth and catabolism of individual LDs are poorly
understood. We have identified two proteins, DFCP1 and WHAMM, which are poised to function as crucial
metabolic switches for LDs. In particular, we found that DFCP1 localizes to compartments that are involved in
both LD biogenesis and catabolism. Moreover, we discovered that DFCP1 has unique biochemical properties
that allow it to form an oligomeric coat on LDs, which suggests that it could play a role in the tethering of LDs to
the ER and other LDs. Forcing DFCP1 to disassemble from LDs leads to misregulated LD catabolism. Thus,
we postulate that DFCP1 functions as a molecular switch that releases growing LDs from the ER for
catabolism. Interestingly, LD release is coupled to the accumulation of the activator of the Arp2/3 complex,
WHAMM, and actin. We found that accumulation of WHAMM and actin to LDs occurs specifically in response
to starvation, where it drives actin-mediated mobilization and constriction of LDs. Consequently, the goals of
this proposal are to define the molecular mechanisms employed by DFCP1, WHAMM, and the actin
cytoskeleton to drive LD catabolism. To fully address these questions, we will use a bottom-up approach to
determine the mechanism and molecular properties that allow DFCP1 to switch LDs from growth to catabolism
(Aim 1). In parallel, we will examine how WHAMM and the Arp2/3 complex coordinate with DFCP1 to drive LD
dynamics and catabolism (Aim 2). The mechanistic insight obtained by these studies will provide new insights
into how LD metabolism helps to maintain cellular homeostasis, but also how misregulation of this process
contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases."
10794997,"Project Summary
Investigations of ventricular remodeling have focused almost exclusively on changes in collagen deposition
and matrix metalloproteinase activity. While such investigations have provided numerous insights into fibrillar
changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), little attention has been paid to the non-fibrillar components of the
ECM. Indeed, the ECM is composed of numerous soluble and bound factors. The roles of these various ECM
components are diverse, but largely unknown. Moreover, how these factors interact with existing parenchymal
cells, the changing and expanding populations of mesenchymal cells, and the transitory leukocytes, such as
macrophages, remains to be examined carefully. Despite the complexity of the ECM, our understanding of it
remains primitive. In fact, one of the most abundant components of the ECM, hyaluronan (HA), functions
through largely cryptic or presumed mechanisms. Ultimately derived from glucose, HA is synthesized by a
family of enzymes, known as hyaluronan synthases (HAS). The role of HA may differ dynamically throughout
remodeling. Our preliminary data indicate that HA accumulates in the heart early after a myocardial infarction
(MI) and its accumulation persists for weeks after MI. We also show that acutely activated fibroblasts contribute
to HA production. Given that HA accumulates quickly following MI and activated fibroblasts can increase HA
production, this suggests a potential role for a fibroblast-HA axis in acute scar formation. Yet, the persistent
accumulation of HA may provoke macrophage-dependent inflammation and contribute to adverse remodeling
after the scar has matured. Our preliminary data show that HA directly impairs macrophage function, which
may underlie non-resolving inflammation in the remodeling heart. We posit that the changing roles of HA in the
acute post-MI setting versus chronic heart failure comprise major, unappreciated events in ventricular
remodeling. This insinuates that HA is neither purely pathologic nor purely adaptive. Rather, the role of HA is
context dependent. For these reasons, we must understand the regulation of HA production in the failing heart.
We posit that acutely after MI, fibroblasts leverage metabolic changes to produce more HA and contribute to
scar formation; however, the inexorable accumulation of HA may transition into a contributor to pathology in
the chronic phases. Over the course of this project, we will use a battery of gain- and loss-of-function
approaches to test the central hypothesis that changes in fibroblast glucose metabolism drive hyaluronan
production, which acutely aids in scar formation but chronically prolongs inflammation and promotes adverse
remodeling. Regardless of specific outcomes, completion of this project will create fundamental, mechanistic
insights into the causes and consequences of changes in the extracellular matrix during ventricular remodeling."
10795104,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This application for a new Global Infectious Diseases Research Training program (GIDRTP) at the University of
Virginia (UVA) extends decades of training global leaders in diseases of poverty and infectious diseases through
cycles of support of International Training and Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Actions for Building
Capacity, Minority Health International Research Training, and Fogarty GIDRTPs. These prior experiences
provide lessons learned and tested mechanisms for developing trainees into independent public health
scientists. Despite the prior focus on early stage trainees such as undergraduate, Masters or doctoral students,
we have noted unique barriers in progression through postdoctoral training to research leadership in Tanzania.
We performed a needs assessment among Tanzanian postdoctoral scientists in 2021 which confirmed this
observation and outlined gaps and opportunities with which to structure a postdoctoral focused GIDRTP. UVA,
the Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, and the Center for Global Health Equity have been
at the forefront of research and training in malnutrition and its infectious consequences for decades. In non-
pandemic periods, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading killer from a curable infectious disease. COVID-19 has further
disrupted TB care and is projected to increase deaths from TB by 20% over the next five years. Malnutrition,
both undernutrition and poor nutrition leading to conditions such as diabetes mellitus, is the most important driver
of TB disease globally. Therefore, this GIDRTP aims to strengthen existing educational and research linkages
with the UVA and the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College/ Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute
(KCMUCo/KCRI) in Tanzania, to support Tanzanian postdoctoral trainees' growth to research leaders working
at the intersection of malnutrition and TB.
We aim to train 6 postdoctoral scientists with 3 years of support each through an individualized research
leadership plan based on the framework of the Path to Research Leadership in Africa Report (2020). In addition
to matching postdoctoral fellows to Tanzanian and UVA mentors, the individualized research leadership plan will
include assessment by Lead Educators and core programmatic faculty including a biostatistician to design
personalized coursework and skills building toward the metric categories of research team management,
communication, grant writing, professionalism and career trajectory. We will harness the current infrastructure
of funding from the National Institutes of Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, European and Developing
Countries Trials Partnership, World Health Organization and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for TB and
malnutrition research in Tanzania, and we expect to launch the careers of junior scientists and content leaders
that will compete for independent funding, set research agendas, make policy and benefit their communities in-
line with the World Health Organization's End TB Strategy."
10795106,"Mast cells (MCs) play important roles in allergic responses. Recent studies suggest that MCs are also
essential to other inflammatory diseases by releasing inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and the MC-
specific proteases chymase and tryptase after degranulation. Pharmacological inactivation of MCs prevents or
slows disease progression. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and disability in
the elderly. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., affecting more than 5 million Americans alone,
according to the Alzheimer’s Association. One definitive diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of
extracellular deposition of neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) into senile plaques. Human AD brains have elevated
protease expression, neuronal death and synapse loss, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and activation of
inflammatory cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and T cells. MCs also present in human AD brains, mainly in
the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, but studies have yet to test whether these cells participate
directly in the pathogenesis or serve merely as another inflammatory hallmark. Our preliminary data
demonstrated that the plasma levels of MC activator IgE and MC granular contents tryptase and histamine
were elevated in patients with early stage AD, indicating enhanced systemic MC activation. Anti-tryptase and
CD117 antibodies detected MC accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus from human and murine AD
brains. Using MC-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice and over-the-counter (OTC) MC inhibitor ketotifen, we
demonstrated that the absence or pharmacological inhibition of MCs reduced Aβ deposition and senile plaque
formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and reduced the numbers of total Iba-1-positive microglia
and CD68-positive phagocytic microglia in these regions in APPSWE-PS1∆e9+/– (APP-PS1) mice that develop
cerebral amyloidosis. Brain tissue extract ELISA showed that the absence of MCs reduced the production of
pathological Aβ species (Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42). Adoptive transfer of in vitro-prepared MCs into KitW-sh/W-shAPP-PS1-
recipient mice restored cortical and hippocampal Aβ deposition, microglia infiltration and activation, and AD
brain cortex Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 contents. A preliminary water T-maze behavior test suggested that MC depletion
improved cognitive decline in APP-PS1 mice. We hypothesize that MCs play a pathogenic role in AD by
releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases, and MC inhibition with the anti-allergy drugs may become
a novel therapy of human AD. We propose three aims to examine whether MC depletion or inhibition protects
mice from Alzheimer’s disease; to examine whether genetic deficiency of FcεR1 or anti-IgE antibody therapy
protects mice from Alzheimer’s disease and, to establish the mechanistic link between mast cell activation and
mouse Alzheimer’s disease."
10795107,"Chronic pain is a significant problem for at least half of all persons receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) for
opioid use disorder – i.e., buprenorphine/ naloxone (BUP) or methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).
Pharmacotherapeutic pain management is challenging in OAT patients, and other behavioral options for
managing chronic pain are needed. Hatha yoga may be a useful adjunctive approach for decreasing pain-
related disability and pain severity, and preventing opioid misuse during OAT. There is evidence supporting its
efficacy in other chronic pain populations, and yoga may target cravings and other risk factors for opioid
relapse. With NCCIH R34 funding, we conducted a pilot RCT of a 12-week hatha yoga class vs. a health
education class (HE; a control condition) for people with chronic pain receiving MMT (n=20) or BUP (n=20) for
opioid use disorder. The primary target of the yoga intervention was decreased life interference due to pain. In
this study, we measured multiple indices of feasibility and acceptability of the manualized interventions.
Although we met a priori benchmarks on many of these feasibility indices, we did find that, consistent with
literature on behavioral interventions in OAT patients, some participants attended only very few classes. Thus,
as a next step in this research, the purpose of the current project is to develop an optimized yoga intervention
package that includes key components that increase yoga dosage received, defined as time in class (a
function of number of classes attended) plus home yoga practice time. We plan to use the Multiphase
Optimization STrategy (MOST) to do this. We will evaluate four intervention components, all of which will be
added to our standard group yoga classes, to determine their impact on total yoga dosage received. These
components are: a) two added 1:1 meetings with the yoga teachers; b) provision of study teacher-led home
practice videos; c) monetary incentives for class attendance; and d) text messages designed to increase
intrinsic motivation for yoga practice. As a secondary goal, in keeping with the U01 program announcement,
we will also demonstrate that we can conduct this research in two sites distinct from each other and from our
previous site. In this study, after conducting pilot work (Phase 1), we plan to conduct a fully-powered factorial
experiment that will allow us to evaluate the impact of each of the 4 intervention components on yoga dosage
received. All participants will receive the core yoga intervention, with random assignment to receive or not
receive each of the four intervention components outlined above. Results from Phase 2 will allow us to choose
an efficient combination of intervention components that, together with standard yoga classes, maximizes yoga
dosage. We will also be able to examine mechanisms by which intervention components are hypothesized to
work. This project will prepare us for the next step in this research, i.e., a fully-powered, multi-site RCT testing
the optimized yoga intervention (vs. a control condition), with a primary outcome of reduced pain interference."

Immune  checkpoint  blockade  (ICB)  using  antibodies  that  disrupt  PD1  or  CTLA4  signaling  can  lead  to  durable

This application requests renewal of an interdisciplinary mentored research program that will be supported by
the linked U2R application (2/2: GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in Eastern Africa – Ethiopia). Building
on successes and lessons from the current program, the linked training and research programs of the Hub will
advance research and the translation of locally-relevant findings into action around pressing public health issues
related to air pollution exposure and health effects, and occupational exposure to extreme heat. The research
and training program will be implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the
Hub institution for the linked application. Spoke institutions are in Kenya (University of Nairobi) and Uganda
(Makerere University). The research approach is structured around five aims. In Aim 1, the Hub will continue
three activities that were successfully established during the first funding cycle, but that would be significantly

(fine particulate matter, or PM2.5) using infrastructure established in Cycle 1 in each city; to continue collecting
hospital mortality and morbidity records in each city to enable time series studies linking air pollution and health;
and to re-evaluate the respiratory health of the children included in the first cycle (the Eastern Africa Children’s
Health Study – EACH) to examine the effect of PM2.5 on lung development trajectories. In Aim 2 we will measure
personal air pollution exposure in 300 mother-child dyads in each city, supporting modeling of personal exposure
in our entire child cohort and to establish a foundation for modeling personal exposure in our entire child cohort
and for additional epidemiological studies of air pollution. Aim 3 will carry out a cross-sectional assessment of
mothers of a subset of children in the EACH study to examine the effects of air pollution exposure on the
respiratory and reproductive health of the woman/child dyad. In Aim 4, we seek to build on the enhanced
capabilities and independence of the Hub investigators developed in Cycle 1 to conduct studies designed by
each country based on local interest and relevance. In Ethiopia, we will implement a full version of a Cycle 1 pilot
study of renal function and chronic kidney disease risk resulting from occupational heat stress. In Uganda we
will assess ambulatory blood pressure in the subsample of EACH study children with personal exposure data.
In Kenya, we will assess neurocognitive function in EACH study children using both test scores (full cohort) and
psychometrics (personal exposure subsample). Aim 5 is to continue impacting policy and regulatory decisions
via dissemination of study findings to central stakeholders at the local, national and regional level. This proposal
brings together a transdisciplinary team of experts in environmental monitoring, epidemiology, and environmental
policy; builds on the partners’ well-established research collaborations; and, promises to generate the evidence
needed to support healthier environments and workplaces throughout Eastern Africa and beyond."

This application requests renewal of an interdisciplinary mentored research program that will be supported by
the linked U2R application (2/2: GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in Eastern Africa – Ethiopia). Building
on successes and lessons from the current program, the linked training and research programs of the Hub will
advance research and the translation of locally-relevant findings into action around pressing public health issues
related to air pollution exposure and health effects, and occupational exposure to extreme heat. The research
and training program will be implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the
Hub institution for the linked application. Spoke institutions are in Kenya (University of Nairobi) and Uganda
(Makerere University). The research approach is structured around five aims. In Aim 1, the Hub will continue
three activities that were successfully established during the first funding cycle, but that would be significantly
enhanced by longitudinal data collection. Specifically, we propose to continue central site monitoring of air quality

The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s NCI-funded Training Grant in Cancer Biology (T32 CA009135) has
supported cancer biology researchers to become successful, independent scientists in academic laboratories
or in research-related careers for over 41 years. It is the only NIH/NCI-funded training grant dedicated solely to
training in cancer biology research at UW-Madison. We have taken the opportunity to modernize our training
program by adding two postdoctoral Oncology Fellows to it. We are requesting 5 predoctoral trainees and 2
postdoctoral Oncology Fellow trainee slots to address current deficiencies in training the next generation of
cancer researchers: 1) the growing need for predoctoral trainees to work in translational research; and 2) the
demand for the physician-scientists who understand quantitative research. We have reorganized our program
administration to be a multi-generational team, added cutting-edge courses to our core curriculum
(Bioinformatics, Advanced Grant Writing, and Translational Oncology-Concepts and Study Design), added an
annual program retreat, and enhanced the overall training with new seminars, career development workshops,
and trainee program evaluations. This training program has four pillars of strength: 1) Trainers/Mentors: Our
program includes 31 well-funded faculty mentors and 7 affiliate trainers whose research spans the entire
breadth of cancer research from haploid or diploid genetics, viral and chemical carcinogenesis, eukaryotic cell
and molecular biology, virology, molecular toxicology, whole-animal carcinogenesis, and translational science.
This includes 25 PhDs, 8 MDs, 3 MD/PhDs, and 2 DVM/PhDs from 9 different departments. 2) Trainees: UW-
Madison’s nationally competitive biomedical PhD programs allow our trainers to recruit trainees with strong
research backgrounds. Our trainers also make it a priority to recruit trainees from under-represented groups.
3) Comprehensive Training Plan: Set in a highly collaborative environment, our training includes intensive one-
on-one research mentoring, thorough didactic training in cancer biology, and the commitment to build our
trainees’ skills in critical-reading, writing, and public speaking. 4) Strong Institutional Support: UW-Madison’s
robust predoctoral and postdoctoral training environment adds to our training program by providing newly
designed training and administrative support to foster professional development (for example, T32 Cancer
Biology Retreat with the University of Minnesota) and bring outstanding speakers to campus (for example,
through our Cancer Biology Seminar Series and the UWCCC’s Annual Retreat)."
10804642,"Abstract. There has been a substantial growth in nanotechnology research in cancer demonstrating that
nanotechnology could provide unique and otherwise unattainable solutions to cancer management including
very early cancer detection, accurate molecular specific diagnosis and treatment that diminishes side effects.
However, achieving this promise is extremely challenging because it requires overcoming multiple constraints
imposed by translational barriers in clinical applications of nanomaterials that is multiplied by complexity of
cancer biology. Currently, there is a growing gap between new discoveries coming at a fast pace from academic
labs and their translation into clinic. Therefore, there is an urgent need in addressing this gap in cancer
nanotechnology translational pipeline. To this end, we have designed a novel training program to educate future
leaders in the broad field of nanotechnology with specific interests in cancer-related applications, who are keenly
aware of the needs and demands of clinical environment as well as of major challenges of translational research.
We believe that the only way to train cancer translation minded Ph.D. researchers is to insert them into the
environment of an outstanding cancer center. Therefore, our program is based on a close collaboration between
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Rice University. As part of our program, we have
developed a comprehensive plan for recruiting trainees from diversity groups that are historically
underrepresented in health-related research, including women, individuals from racial and ethnic groups,
individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 Our training program includes multidisciplinary mentorship of translational research projects combined with
multidisciplinary, hands-on coursework and seminar experiences. All trainees will work with at least two program
faculty mentors (one from Rice and one from MD Anderson) to define and carry out an independent research
problem. Didactic coursework will prepare them to contribute to research projects that directly address barriers
to translation of nanotechnology-based approaches and to develop the skills needed to define and lead such
projects. Incoming trainees will participate in a unique one-week-long boot camp in “Cancer Management and
Nanotechnology” that provides an overview of current opportunities and barriers in the field. Trainees will develop
foundational background in the field from program specific seminar series and by taking courses related to
translational cancer or nanotechnology topics. Trainees will gain essential writing skills through scientific writing
seminars and by writing a NIH grant proposal that will be reviewed by a NIH-style Mock Study Section. Finally,
trainees will gain important lab management skills by participating in a short hands-on course providing an
introduction to laboratory and project management. At the end of the program, fellows will have a deep
understanding of translational research in cancer nanotechnology, with the most important component being the
demonstrated ability to carry out independent translational research in this challenging multidisciplinary field."
10804644,"PROJECT SUMMARY: As demonstrated by a growing number of studies, stress
experienced during pregnancy can lead to significant long-term health problems for
mothers and their infants. One biological mechanism that has been identified in
heightening a woman’s risk for developing stress-related health complications during
pregnancy is the stress hormone cortisol. Further, certain genetic factors, such as the
short allele of the (serotonin transporter) 5-HTTLPR gene, have been implicated in
increasing one’s cortisol response to stressors in the environment. The impact of these
two biomarkers of stress is highly significant in fetal development, as maternal cortisol
readily crosses the placenta, potentially causing the fetus to become overly sensitive to
environmental stressors after childbirth. Indeed, some studies have shown early life
stressors (e.g., socioeconomic adversity, harsh parenting) to accelerate the shortening of
telomeres (DNA segments that measure disease risk and biological aging) in children.
Yet, few studies have identified pre- and postnatal determinants of infant telomere length
among low-income, chronically stressed families. The objective of the proposed study is
to prospectively examine whether prenatal maternal and fetal cortisol levels and the 5-
HTTLPR genotype of low-income pregnant mothers are predictive of changes in infant
telomere length over the first six months postpartum and whether certain maternal and
infant characteristics (e.g., exposure to chronic stressors, maternal sensitivity towards
their infants) influence these outcomes. A total of 125 low-income mothers will be recruited
during pregnancy to provide saliva samples that assess their prenatal cortisol levels and
5-HTTLPR genotype. Mothers will also collect their infant’s hair (within one week after
birth) to assess fetal cortisol levels, as well as their infant’s saliva to assess for changes
in telomere length from birth to six months postpartum. It is hypothesized that heightened
prenatal maternal and fetal cortisol levels and the short allele 5-HTTLPR genotype in
mothers will be associated with accelerated shortening of infant telomere length from birth
to six months postpartum, and that telomere length will be moderated by certain maternal
and infant characteristics (e.g., greater maternal exposure to chronic stressors, less
maternal sensitivity towards their infant’s needs). This hypothesis has been formulated
from preliminary data collected by the principal investigator and study collaborators. The
results of the proposed work have substantial public health implications in advancing our
understanding of how prenatal biological mechanisms contribute to the intergenerational
transmission of stress outcomes among low-income pregnant mothers and their infants
that can have lifelong consequences for the offspring’s health and disease risk. Such
findings will also help to identify potential avenues for prevention and treatment, during
critical periods of development, to optimize health outcomes for mothers, their children,
and subsequent generations."
10800203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as stroke and heart attack, is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality globally, responsible for approximately 19 million deaths annually. Risk assessment is
the cornerstone for primary prevention of ASCVD. Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) are currently used to guide
risk assessment and tailor preventive therapies. However, these and other risk prediction tools remain imperfect
and have significant limitations including being static and based on a small number of simple clinical variables
as well as having poor performance across diverse populations. Moreover, they do not incorporate imaging that
may contain known prognostic biomarkers of future risk. For example, CT scans of the chest contain coronary
artery calcium (CAC), thoracic aortic calcium (TAC), intrathoracic (IF), and body composition (BC) metrics.
However, these biomarkers are not routinely reported in clinical practice nor accounted for in PCE. Finally, PCE
has also been shown to misestimate risk in certain ethnicities despite identical risk profiles. We will develop a
comprehensive graph-based fusion model, “ADMIRE” (AscvD Multimodal rIsk pREdiction), that incorporates
imaging and non-imaging data across two diverse sites – Mayo Clinic and Emory Health System. Our
multidisciplinary team of radiologists, informaticists, AI scientists, and preventive cardiologists will leverage our
prior experience with developing fusion models for risk prevention. We will validate our previously developed
biomarker segmentation models on a diverse cohort as well as develop a comprehensive semantic segmentation
model that incorporates multiple known prognostic biomarkers (AIM 1). We will then apply debiasing techniques
to develop ‘fair’ models and evaluate performance on cohorts stratified by demographic (e.g., race, gender,
social determinants of health surrogates) and imaging (e.g., scanner type) factors (AIM 2). Finally, we will use a
novel graph-based technique to create a fusion model to show performance against PCE and on stratified
cohorts based on demographics (AIM 3). We designed this study such that dependencies between experiments
are reduced. We hypothesize that multimodal fusion models incorporating imaging and non-imaging biomarkers
will have a greater prognostic performance than PCE. We further hypothesize that algorithmic model debiasing
can allow more effective at-risk prediction for minority patients in which PCE is known not to perform well. Our
proposal could potentially allow greater opportunistic screening of patients for primary prevention of ASCVD and
overcome limitations of current risk assessment tools such as PCE."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe clinical syndrome that develops in up to 15% of all
hospitalized patients and up to 50% intensive care unit patients. Severe AKI results in tubulointerstitial
fibrosis and progressive loss of kidney function, which are associated with increased long-term
morbidity and mortality. Productive kidney repair (also called kidney adaptive repair) can restore
nephron function and avoid tubulointerstitial fibrosis; therefore, promoting productive repair is an
attractive target in therapeutic treatment of AKI. Nitric oxide (NO) is an established mediator in repair
of skin, nerve, skeletal muscle, liver, heart, bone, and vessels, but its role in kidney repair remains
entirely unknown. NO-based signaling is conveyed in large part by protein S-nitrosylation. We have
discovered a novel protein S-nitrosylation system in kidney consisting of the novel nitrosylase SCAN
and its cognate denitrosylase SCoR, which add and remove SNO groups on target proteins,
respectively. Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) is a critical regulator of cell metabolism, and is a major S-
nitrosylation target of the SCAN/SCoR system during kidney injury. We now find that SCAN/SCoR and
PKM2 are also important during kidney repair. Deletion of SCoR in mice, which increases SCAN
mediated S-nitrosylation, promotes adaptive repair through multiple beneficial effects: 1) alleviating
oxidative stress; 2) increasing availability of biosynthetic macromolecules; 3) increasing cell cycle re-
entry; 4) reversal of G2/M arrest; 5) reducing AKI-associated kidney fibrosis. Reduced SCoR activity
and increased SCAN expression are observed in human AKI kidney compared with healthy kidney,
suggesting that S-nitrosylation regulated by the SCAN/SCoR system is important in human kidney
repair. We have developed a specific SCoR inhibitor as a tool to assess the therapeutic potential of
SCoR inhibition in productive kidney repair. To explore the role of PKM2 S-nitrosylation regulated by
the SCAN/SCoR system in kidney repair, and to assess the efficacy of SCoR inhibition in repair, we
will: 1) define the role of SCoR in productive kidney repair; 2) delineate the role of SCAN and S-
nitrosylation of PKM2 in kidney repair; 3) determine the clinical significance of SCoR and SCAN in
kidney repair. Successful completion of our studies not only will reveal the physiological function of
PKM2 S-nitrosylation catalyzed by SCAN and SCoR enzymes in productive repair, but also will define
and validate new drug targets to repair the kidneys after AKI."

Exposure to byproducts of industrial combustion, such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),
are one of the most important, and arguably best appreciated, environmental exposures. Their adverse impact
on health is clear, ranging from thymic atrophy to tumorigenesis. Dioxins and PAHs exert their toxic effects by
activating aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate gene
expression. AHR forms a complex with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator proteins (ARNT), and
similar to other transcription factors, binds transcriptional coregulators and recognizes a consensus DNA
sequence termed the xenobiotic response element (XRE). While this fundamental biology is well-explored,
important questions related to AHR signaling still remain. These include how the choice of ligand determines
AHR activity, and the possibility that AHRs also regulate gene expression via non-consensus DNA sequences.
Answering these questions is of importance, as they hold the potential to reveal new pathways by which known
and yet-to-be-identified AHR ligands may exert their toxic effects. The choice of ligand influences which
transcriptional cofactors interact with AHRs, and this transcriptional cofactor complex in turn determines which
genes respond to AHR signaling. While the field has assumed that a consensus XRE is necessary for AHR
regulation of gene expression, emerging evidence suggests AHRs recognize DNA sequences other than XREs.
What determines the activity of the AHR at XRE vs non-consensus regulatory elements is not well understood.
Our overarching hypothesis is that AHR binding to non-consensus DNA sequences directs AHR activity and
determines the choice of AHR interacting proteins. In cultured cells and mouse livers, AHR can bind a non-
consensus DNA sequence (NC-XRE) and recruit the transcription factor KLF6 following exposure to 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In contrast, when TCDD-AHR binds a consensus XRE DNA sequence, no
KLF6 is recruited. This suggests that the DNA sequence to which AHR binds influences which proteins bind
AHR. We will identify interactions between AHR, protein coregulators and DNA sequence in mouse liver following
exposure to multiple AHR ligands (Aim 1) and determine whether AHR binds NC-XRE DNA to regulate target
gene expression in vivo (Aim 2). While dogma holds that AHR must dimerize with ARNT1 to bind DNA and
regulate transcription, recent data suggests AHR can bind DNA in the absence of ARNT1. Whether this binding
occurs in vivo is not known, as global ARNT1 or ARNT2 mutant mice are not viable. We overcame this limitation
by developing ARNT1/2 mutant zebrafish, which we will use to explore the role of ARNT1 and ARNT2 in AHR
signaling at non-consensus DNA sequence (Aim 3). By combining genetic and biochemical approaches in
multiple model organisms, we will determine how ligands, DNA sequence and protein coregulators influence
AHR target gene expression in vivo. Our results will improve our understanding of how coregulators and DNA
sequence direct AHR signaling, opening new windows into understanding how AHR ligands exert their effects."

The composition of microorganisms that inhabit the gut, known as the gut microbiome, has been strongly
associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases including cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Notably,
several high-profile studies have reported that the composition of the gut microbiome is correlated with
responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in human cancer patients. While these studies have proposed
several mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon, a specific set of cellular and molecular interactions that
explains these responses remains to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is through the immunologic
recognition of the byproducts of microbial metabolism. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an
abundant, highly conserved subset of innate-like T cells that recognize products of microbial riboflavin synthesis
presented by the non-polymorphic HLA-like molecule, MR1. Mice grown in germfree conditions have a significant
reduction in MAIT cells and the introduction of bacteria with high production of riboflavin drastically increases
MAIT cell frequency and activation. Our preliminary data indicate that MAIT cells are found in human melanoma
tumors. Furthermore, we found that patients with stage III/IV melanoma have significantly decreased frequencies
of MAIT cells amongst their PBMCs, which can be reversed upon anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment in
responsive patients but not in non-responsive patients. Most strikingly, we observed that patients with high
frequencies of circulating MAIT cells had significantly improved overall survival compared to those with low
frequencies. Furthermore, we have found that the tumors of responding patients have increased expression of
MR1 mRNA compared to non-responders. Interestingly, responsive patients also show increased relative
abundance of riboflavin-synthesizing bacteria in their gut microbiome compared to non-responders. Additionally,
in our novel MAIT cell deficient mouse model, syngeneic melanoma tumors grow significantly faster and
antitumor immunity is significantly diminished compared to wild type mice. Key questions arise from these
observations. First, how are riboflavin biosynthesis and MAIT cell functions influenced by ICI treatment?
Additionally, what role do MAIT cells play in tumor immunity and what therapeutic benefit can MAIT cell-directed
therapies offer when combined with ICI treatment? We hypothesize that MAIT cells are required for anti-
melanoma immunity and that activated MAIT cells link the microbiome and tumor immunity through microbial
riboflavin synthesis. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the
mechanism underlying the association between MAIT cells and the dynamics of riboflavin-synthesizing microbes
in the gut microbiome during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; and (2) Define the contributions of MAIT cells
to ICI therapy responses. Should this study reveal a role for MAIT cells in anti-tumor immunity that is dependent
the microbiome, modalities aimed at expanding and/or activating MAIT cells during therapy may provide
substantial clinical benefit for melanoma patients."

This proposal seeks to understand the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of a new noncoding RNA (ncRNA) entity, TY4,
that is bioinspired by the cargo constituents of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our focus is on one class of small
ncRNA, not previously recognized as particularly relevant to muscular dystrophy. Y-RNAs, which were known to
influence DNA replication (but not gene expression), captured our attention because molecules encoded by the
YRNA4 gene are exceptionally plentiful in EVs secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). The predominant
such ncRNA, EV-YF1, has salutary properties when delivered on its own. Here, we present preliminary data on
TY4, a new chemical entity (NCE) bioinspired by EV-YF1. Importantly, TY4 exerts potent disease-modifying
bioactivity in mdx mice, a mouse correlate of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Remarkably, TY4, when
formulated with the breast milk protein, casein, works when administered orally to mdx mice. In terms of
mechanism, preliminary data show that TY4 targets macrophages, inducing robust transcriptomic changes that
underlie its bioactivity. As a small chemically-modified mutant NCE, TY4 has key features desirable of a synthetic
RNA drug. Other RNA drugs, whether FDA-approved or in development, all have known mechanisms of action:
they are antisense oligos, small interfering RNAs, aptamers, or miR-modifiers. TY4 does not fit into any of those
classes and, thus is the prototype for a new class of RNA drugs. The focus here is on understanding the
mechanisms whereby TY4 targets fibrosis in the hearts of mdx mice. We will test the following mechanistic
hypothesis: TY4 is anti-fibrotic in DMD hearts by reversing pathological chromatin remodeling (i.e., hyper-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene expression) in macrophage precursor cells of the bone marrow. We will
pursue the following Aims: 1) Investigate the mechanism(s) whereby TY4 alters gene expression. Sub-aims seek
to: a) characterize the effects of TY4 on chromatin remodeling in the bone marrow niche, b) evaluate the
contribution of Prdm2 and Smyd4 to pathological chromatin remodeling, c) characterize the transcriptomic
changes induced by TY4, and d) prioritize biological targets. 2) Examine the anti-fibrotic basis of TY4. Sub-aims
seek to: a) compare fibrogenic outcomes with or without Arg-1, b) characterize proteomic changes in cardiac
fibroblasts induced by macrophages with or without TY4, and c) investigate the mechanism of TY4-mediated
suppression of Arg-1. 3) Test whether manipulation of mdx macrophages confers anti-fibrotic actions in vivo.
Sub-aims seek to: a) determine if adoptive transfer of TY4-conditioned mdx macrophages attenuates myocardial
fibrosis using a novel transgenic macrophage-depletable mdx mouse model, b) characterize the effects of
adoptive transfer of arginase-1 silenced mdx macrophages in macrophage-depleted mdx mice, and c)
investigate whether long-term oral administration of TY4 prevents myocardial fibrosis. Discoveries made here
will also provide valuable insights to facilitate future development of anti-fibrotic agents for a variety of heart
diseases."

Despite a great deal of research, we have discovered surprisingly little about the genetic
basis of uniquely human traits—largely due to the ethical and practical considerations that
severely limit comparisons between humans and other primates. To advance this field, we
have integrated two effective approaches for studying evolution: induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells, and interspecific hybrids. iPS cells can be differentiated into a wide range of
cell types in vitro, circumventing many limitations of primate research, while measurement
of allele-specific gene expression in hybrids allows cis-regulatory divergence and gene
expression adaptations to be mapped genome-wide. To combine these approaches, we
have recently generated human/chimpanzee hybrid iPS cells. We propose to characterize
this powerful resource with RNA-seq and cellular phenotyping in diverse cell types,
including cardiomyocytes, motor neurons, hepatocytes, pancreatic progenitors, skeletal muscle,
retinal pigmented epithelium, and skin organoids that include dermis/epidermis, adipose,
cartilage, hair follicles, and more. Our goal is to discover and experimentally validate genes and
genetic variants that have contributed to the evolutionary origin of our species."

Transgender people experience economic and psychosocial inequities that make them
particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic-related financial and mental health harms.
Sustainable, multilevel interventions are needed to address these harms and promote COVID-
19 prevention behaviors. Transgender-led organizations have been galvanized to provide
emergency financial and peer support for transgender people negatively impacted by COVID-
19. However, the efficacy of these interventions have not been evaluated. Leveraging existing
community partnerships and ongoing cohorts, the study seeks to assess the efficacy of feasible,
acceptable, community-derived interventions to reduce economic and psychological harms
experienced by transgender people in the wake of COVID-19. The specific aims of the project
are to (1) compare the efficacy of microgrants with or without peer mentoring to reduce
psychological distress and increase COVID-19 prevention behaviors; (2) examine mechanisms
by which microgrants with or without peer mentoring may impact psychological distress; and (3)
explore transgender participants' intervention experiences and perceived efficacy. These aims
will be met by enrolling 360 transgender adults into an embedded, mixed methods, 3-arm, 12-
month randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to the following arms:
(a) a single microgrant plus monthly financial literacy education (usual care); (b) usual care plus
monthly microgrants; or (c) usual care plus monthly microgrants combined with peer mentoring.
All intervention arms will last for 6 months, and participants will complete semi-annual web-
based surveys at 0, 6, and 12 months as well as text-based process measures at 3 and 6
months to meet Aims 1 and 2. A subset of 36 participants, 12 per arm, will complete longitudinal
in depth interviews at 3 and 9 months to meet Aim 3. In addition to addressing the pressing
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a vulnerable health disparities population, this study will
advance the science of minority stress and mental health inequities by testing interventions that
operate on general stressors – i.e., material hardship and community connection – rather than
minority stressors such as enacted stigma. This national, online study will address multilevel –
structural and community – factors driving COVID-19 pandemic harms. Its equitable community
partnership will ensure that study findings are actionable and disseminated rapidly to inform
sustainable community-based responses to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future
emergencies."

PROJECT SUMMARY
 The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) proposes to establish the Patient-Oriented Research and
Training to Accelerate Learning, or Penn PORTAL, to build and diversify capacity in deploying patient-
centered outcomes research (PCOR) within LHSs. Penn PORTAL will integrate operations leaders,
mentors who are expert in all Learning Health System (LHS) competencies, community partners, and all
health systems in the City of Philadelphia with several leading LHS research centers at Penn. We will
develop and test interventions that are informed by our expertise in changing human behavior and using
the most rigorous and ethical comparative effectiveness and implementation science research methods.
Penn PORTAL will be led by 3 physician-scientists with diverse personal backgrounds, clinical disciplines,
career stages, and methodologic expertise: Scott Halpern, Meghan Lane-Fall, and Mucio (Kit) Delgado.
These MPIs will lead PORTAL’s Administrative Core and be joined on its Steering Committee by 7 senior
investigators and operations leaders in overseeing and synchronizing the work of a Research Education
Core (REC), Research & Data Analysis Core (RDAC), and Equity & Community Engagement (ECE) unit
that will ensure principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion pervade all PORTAL activities.
 The REC will be co-led by Jen Myers, Director of Penn’s Center for Healthcare Improvement and
Patient Safety, and Rachel Werner, Director of its Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. Drs. Myers
and Werner bring complementary expertise in training embedded scientists with system leadership roles
and independently-funded LHS investigators, enabling us to train both types of scientists in a 2-year
program blending didactic and experiential learning and intensive mentorship that we developed during
our current AHRQ/PCORI K12 award. The RDAC will be co-led by Kevin Johnson, an internationally
recognized leader in building and leading informatics-informed LHSs, and Michael Harhay, a statistical
epidemiologist and expert in developing methods for pragmatic clinical trials. The ECE will be led by Jaya
Aysola, Director of the Center for Health Equity Advancement – a first-of-its-kind health equity center
embedded within a large health system enterprise. Led by the ECE, PORTAL will partner with the
Philadelphia Department of Health, several community organizations, and all Philadelphia health systems,
the latter through an initiative funded by the region’s largest payer to combat racism and health inequities
across the City. These partnerships will diversify the pool of LHS scientists we train and amplify our
opportunities to implement effective interventions across all Philadelphia-area health systems. Finally,
guided by an Internal Advisory Board that includes the Deans of Penn’s Schools of Medicine, Nursing,
and Business (Wharton), and an External Advisory Board that includes 11 national LHS leaders, PORTAL
will realize the ideals of an LHS imbued with an equity-first focus."
10816583,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-10, impacts
multiple organ systems including the central nervous system. Neurological symptoms are seen in about
one third of COVID-19 patients and the virus has been found in brain tissue. SARS-CoV-2 uses
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on cell surfaces for entry into cells, and the spike
protein of the virus is the key recognition element for ACE2. ACE2 is expressed by endothelial cells of
the cerebral vasculature that comprise the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the main barrier to entry of
pathogens and toxins into the CNS. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to alter BBB
function using in vitro model systems. Many drugs of abuse, including psychostimulants, negatively
impact BBB function as well. Therefore, it is likely that SARS-CoV-e infection in the presence of
psychostimulants could result in greater damage ot the BBB, further increasing barrier permeability and
resulting in CNS injury. Thus, investigation of the mechanisms underlying the interactions of SARSCoV-
2 and stimulants on the BBB is needed."

Childhood herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a life-threatening complication of primary infection with herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which is typically innocuous. Acyclovir-treated survivors often suffer from severe
neurological sequelae. Most infections affect the forebrain, with only a minority affecting the brainstem. HSE is
the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in Western countries. Its pathogenesis remained unclear until we
showed that it results, in some children, from single-gene inborn errors of immunity to HSV-1 in the central
nervous system (CNS). Using a candidate gene approach, we and others discovered the first six genetic
etiologies of forebrain HSE: mutations of TLR3, UNC93B1, TRIF, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3. These disorders
impair TLR3-dependent, IFN-α/β- and IFN-l-mediated, cell-intrinsic immunity in iPSC-derived cortical neurons.
With NIH R01AI088364 funding, we initiated a genome-wide approach to search for novel HSE-causing genes
by a combination of genome-wide linkage (GWL) analysis and whole-exome sequencing (WES). This led to the
discovery of 1) a novel genetic etiology of forebrain HSE, SNORA31 mutations, and 2) the first genetic etiology
of brainstem HSE, DBR1 mutations. Both disorders impair cell-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 by novel mechanisms,
independent of TLR3. No genetic etiology has yet been identified for 258 of the 280 HSE patients studied. We
now hypothesize that 1) other single-gene inborn errors of CNS-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 can underlie HSE,
and 2) mutations affecting different pathways are responsible for forebrain and brainstem HSE. In the work
proposed in this renewal application, we will use next-generation sequencing (NGS), including WES, whole-
genome sequencing (WGS), and RNA-seq, to search for novel genetic etiologies of HSE. We will analyze the
NGS data at both the population and patient levels, following both a candidate gene approach and an unbiased
hypothesis-generating approach. We will consider models based on both genetic homogeneity and genetic
heterogeneity, while also testing both physiological homogeneity (HSE-causing genes being physiologically
related) and heterogeneity (different pathways involved), making use of novel computational approaches. We
will analyze the function of mutant alleles of candidate genes. We will also use the patients’ fibroblasts to
investigate the impact of the candidate genotypes on anti-HSV-1 immunity. This application is innovative but
supported by exciting preliminary data. We have established a unique international cohort of 450 HSE children
and intend to enroll at least 600 patients. From the WES data for the first 280 patients, we have already identified
biallelic mutations of MEX3B and IFNAR1 (in the TLR3-IFN-a/b circuit), RIPK1 and RIPK3 (in the TLR3-
necroptosis pathway), and TMEFF1 (defining a novel pathway). Our research will decipher the pathogenesis of
a devastating pediatric illness, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches. The genetic analysis of HSE will
also provide proof-of-principle that sporadic, life-threatening infectious diseases striking an isolated organ in
otherwise healthy children can result from single-gene inborn errors of non-hematopoietic cell-intrinsic immunity."
10823670,"RP1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Enteric diseases caused by Salmonella (typhoidal and non-typhoidal -NTS-) and Shigella (multiple
serotypes) remain a major health problem worldwide especially in developing nations. Invasive NTS (iNTS) has
emerged in sub-Saharan Africa where it is causing devastating morbidity and mortality among young adults and
children. While the development of effective vaccines with durable and broad-spectrum protection against these
pathogens has become a priority, their development is limited by the lack of knowledge of systemic and local gut
immunity including immunological correlates of protection (CoP), particularly in children. No vaccines are
available for iNTS and Shigella. Despite considerable progress in our understanding of Salmonella and Shigella
T cell mediated immunity (T-CMI), crucial gaps exist in our knowledge of the mechanisms associated with the
induction and persistence of local and systemic antigen-specific T cells following vaccination and/or challenge
in adults and children. Thus, we propose to address these gaps in knowledge and to uncover the mechanisms
(e.g., epigenetics) of induction and persistence of Salmonella specific T-CMI responses to further our
understanding of mechanisms of protective immunity using unique specimens from clinical studies (Core 1). Our
overarching goal is to evaluate the mechanisms of induction and persistence of S. Typhi, iNTS and Shigella
specific T-CMI responses in key T cell subsets, including effector/memory (TEM), stem cell like memory (TSCM),
follicular helper (TFH) and regulatory cells (TREG) observed at baseline and soon and long-term after immunization
and/or challenge with wt S. Typhi or Shigella and determine their association with protection.
 Importantly, we will study the mechanisms of induction and persistence in children (the primary population
affected by S. Typhi and iNTS) vaccinated with the live oral attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a. We will also
determine the mechanistic differences between adults challenged with wt S. Typhi or immunized with oral
(Ty21a) or a parenteral Trivalent Salmonella conjugate Vaccine (TSCV). Additional studies will involve adults
challenged with wt Shigella or following immunization with the candidate attenuated Shigella CVD1208S-122
strain. Finally, we will evaluate the mechanisms of induction and persistence of S. Typhi responsive T cells
operating in the local mucosa by using terminal ileum and duodenal biopsies obtained from Ty21a immunized
adult volunteers. Throughout these studies, we make use of advanced technologies (e.g., mass-cytometry,
EpiTOF, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and imaging mass cytometry (Core 3). All the data will be analyzed
by using a sophisticated system biology approach (Core 2) in concert with data provided by other projects (RP2
and RP3). These studies will uncover critical information on the induction and durability of local and systemic
antigen specific T-CMI revealing epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures that might lead to the identification of
molecular correlates of protection that may inform future vaccine design for adults and children."
10823671,"CCHI Research Project 2 – Abstract
Shigellosis and salmonellosis continue to be serious public health problems affecting primarily young children in
developing countries; however, adults are also susceptible to these pathogens. The emergence of multi-drug
and extensively drug-resistant Shigella and Salmonella strains has created a sense of urgency for the
development of effective vaccines. However, the lack of information on the development of mucosal immunity
has hindered novel vaccine design. To date, it is unclear to what extend the immunity measured in peripheral
blood is representative of the gut mucosal immunity. Recent studies have shown that immunity in local tissues
is critical for protection from disease. The recently described resident memory B cells are likely the first line of
defense against re-infection at the tissue level. The overall goal of Research Project (RP2) is to characterize and
compare the mechanisms that drive the development of systemic and mucosal B cell immunity to human-
restricted enteric pathogens using state-of-the-art immunological and genomics methods. To this end, unique
human specimens (Core 1) will be used including a) PBMC from volunteers immunized parenterally with
conjugate vaccines against Salmonella (TSCV) and Shigella (SF2s-TT15); b) PBMC from volunteers immunized
with oral vaccines against Salmonella (Ty21a) and Shigella (CVD 1208S-122); c) PBMC from S. flexneri 2a
challenge studies; d) PBMC and terminal ileum biopsies from adult Ty21a vaccinees; and e) PBMC from children
immunized with Ty21a. Our overall hypothesis is that antigen-specific mucosal B cell responses differ in
magnitude and characteristics to those in peripheral blood and that oral immunization favors responses
associated with protection and these responses are also age dependent. In Aim 1, we will characterize Shigella-
and Salmonella-specific B cells in PBMC after parenteral and oral immunizations. Aim 2 will characterize B cell
immunity (PBMC) after a wt Shigella challenge. Aim 3 will characterize Salmonella-specific B cell responses
after oral vaccination at the systemic (PBMC) and local (gut mucosa) levels. Aim 4 will explore Salmonella-
specific B cell responses (PBMC) in children (<18 yo). In all aims, the mechanisms involved will be studied by
evaluating changes in phenotype, gene expression (transcriptome), epigenome (EpiTOF), and/or BCR-
sequence profiles (LIBRA-seq) in bacteria-specific B cells after vaccination/challenge. Additionally, Aim 3 will
incorporate imaging mass cytometry (Core 3) to study Salmonella-specific B cells and their interaction(s) with
other immune cells at the tissue level. Bacteria-specific B cells will be identified using a unique set of reagents
developed to study enteric pathogens (e.g., bacteria with fluorescent tags). The rich data sets will be analyzed,
compared and integrated in collaboration with the Systems Biology and Biostatistics Core (Core 2). Data
integration will include results from RP1-3, so we will provide unprecedented information on the development of
immunity to human-restricted enteric pathogens to aid vaccine design and determine correlates of protection."
10823672,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The intestinal immune system has evolved to tolerate most antigens while mounting an effective immune
response to combat infections by pathogens. Epigenetics, defined as heritable changes in the genome without
alteration of the DNA sequence, has been shown to play a critical role in regulating intestinal immunity.
However, a better understanding of epigenetic modifications and how their pharmacological modulators affect
these modifications is still lacking. In addition, the current approach to developing vaccines containing novel
adjuvants is slow and needs improvement. Epigenetics offers an exciting opportunity towards the development
of novel adjuvants by targeting small molecules as pharmacological modulators to reprogram the epigenetic
landscape of innate immune memory, or trained immunity, which could confer enhanced resistance against a
broad array of bacteria in humans. In Research Project 3, our overall goal is to investigate the role of
epigenetic marks and their pharmacological modulators in intestinal immunity, specifically focusing on the
function of epithelial cells, natural killer (NK), and innate T cells, such as Mucosal-associated invariant T
(MAIT) cells, T-cell receptor gamma delta (TCR- ) cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells, in response to two
important enteric pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Shigella flexneri 2a (S. flexneri).
This study will build on our previous findings that MAIT subsets exhibiting specific cytokine pattern signatures
were associated with protection against typhoid fever and that S. Typhi infection regulates changes in
chromatin marks that depend on individual cell subsets. Additionally, compared to the placebo group,
vaccination with the oral Ty21a typhoid vaccine resulted in increased levels of NK cells upon a second antigen
encounter after experimental human challenge with wild-type S. Typhi, which is consistent with the presence of
trained immunity driven by epigenetic control. We have assembled a unique set of human specimens and tools
to test our hypotheses, including (i) cells obtained from peripheral blood of healthy individuals immunized with
oral vaccines, (ii) cells isolated from the duodenum, terminal ileum, and colon, and (iii) their counterparts as in
vitro culture models [explants and organoids] from adults and children."
10824102,"PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL
The main objective of our U19 proposal is to define the contribution of airway epithelial cells to age-related
dysfunction of the tissue-resident immune system, particularly in the context of lung responses to viral infections.
Indeed, age is a major risk factor for increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, including severe seasonal
influenza virus infection. Recently, this risk was brought into even greater focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, with
poor outcomes disproportionately affecting individuals over 65 years of age. While it is well documented that
aging impacts both innate and adaptive immunity, the mechanisms underlying these effects, especially in lung
tissue, are not well understood. In addition, little is known about how the aged airway epithelium contributes to
functional immune alterations during respiratory virus infections. Based on our preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that age-related epithelial changes contribute to chronic inflammation and altered tissue-
resident lung immunity. This hypothesis directly builds upon our current U19 lung immunity research program
that is advancing the concept that the lung epithelium, as the first site of respiratory virus infection and replication,
acts as a critical pathogen barrier both as a modulator and an effector of the immune system. The workhorses
of our program are primary human ex vivo air-liquid-interface (ALI) cultures, derived from airway epithelial
progenitors, which closely resemble in vivo airway epithelial cell composition and responses to viruses. ALI
cultures allow for 1) modelling, in time and space, of interactions between airway epithelium, pathogenic viruses
(influenza and SARS-CoV-2), and immune cells; 2) genetically altering ALI genomes to study specific
genes/pathways; 3) measuring the magnitude and kinetics of transcriptional responses to inflammatory insults
that are difficult to measure in vivo; and 4) studying epigenetic regulation, RNA splicing, and impact of the
microbiome in immune responses. Our findings will be validated using precision tissue slice assays from
uninvolved lung tissue. We will also continue increasing the complexity of our 3D lung models, by incorporating
alveolar space, integrating immune cells, and leveraging 3D bioprinting. To achieve our objective, we structured
our Center around: two integrated research Projects focused on epigenetic, transcriptional, and alternative
splicing mechanisms that we propose lead to a skewed isoform repertoire in aging lung epithelial cells and
dysfunctional tissue-resident immunity; a Technology Development Project that will create sophisticated cellular
models and gene editing tools to support research Project objectives; a Sample Core for storage and distribution
of human tissues; and a Data Science Core for integrative analysis and data dissemination. The Center brings
together clinicians and experts in lung immunology, bioengineering, genomics, and computational biology to
maximize our scientific impact. An Administrative Core will provide coordination, communication, and oversight
for the program. The proposed studies will enable us to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying immune
dysfunction in the lung of older adults, potentially identifying new targets for preventive intervention."

10824105,"PROJECT SUMMARY DATA SCIENCE CORE
The Jackson Laboratory-Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Cooperative Center on Human Immunology (JAX-
ISMMS CCHI) aims to study lung tissue-resident immunity and its decline in older individuals. To manage and
analyze the large volumes of multimodal data generated across the different Projects and the Sample Core, a
dedicated Data Science Core (DSC) will be established with three Specific Aims. First, we will capture, integrate,
and disseminate JAX-ISMMS CCHI data (Aim 1). To this end, we will establish a central data repository following
FAIR principles and coordinate with U19 investigators to ensure data interoperability and reusability. Data will
be shared in compliance with NIH policies and our Data Management and Sharing Plan. Web applications will
be developed for data access and visualization, and figure generation for presentations and publications. Critical
for meeting the goal of the JAX-ISMMS through supporting hypothesis-driven Projects 1 and 2, we will identify
multimodal molecular signatures and phenotypes associated with impaired airway epithelium response to viral
infection as a function of age (Aim 2). We will develop and employ fixed module repertoires and perform
integrative data analyses to identify age-related immune pathways in response to viral infection. Finally, we will
collectively interpret signatures associated with age-related alteration in airway immune responsiveness and
select candidates for downstream validation experiments (Aim 3). Workshops will be organized to facilitate
collaborative interpretation of datasets generated by our U19 Center and to select candidates for targeted
profiling and functional validation experiments. Dr. Damien Chaussabel, Principal Computational Scientist at
JAX, will lead the DSC, supported by a team of Computational Scientists, a Bioinformatics Analyst, and a Data
Wrangler. The DSC will work with the other Cores, research Projects, and the Technology Development Project
to mine harmonized data across the eight JAX-ISMMS U19 geographical sites. In sum, the DSC's activities are
crucial for achieving the U19's objective of identifying age-related epithelial cell pathways driving immune

10824107,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 1
The main objective of our U19 proposal is to define the contribution of airway epithelial cells to age-related
dysfunction of the tissue-resident immune system, particularly in the context of lung responses to viral infections.
Indeed, age is a risk factor for increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, and was most recently brought to
focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, with poor outcomes disproportionately affecting individuals 65 years and older.
Recently, we found that differentiated airway epithelial cells from older individuals have a baseline transcriptional
program that is characterized by enhanced inflammation and is very distinct from young adult airway epithelium.
Moreover, in response to influenza virus infection, young tissues induced a more potent interferon antiviral
signature compared to old epithelium. Thus, we hypothesize that age-related epithelial changes contribute to
chronic inflammation and altered tissue-resident lung immunity. We will leverage ex vivo air-liquid-interface (ALI)
cultures, derived from airway epithelial progenitors, to study the effects of aging on airway epithelial viral
responses and ensuing anti-viral immunity. We will determine how age impacts the response of broncho-
epithelial cells (BECs) to virus, the fate of viral antigen, and how CD8+ T-cell immunity is modulated in aging
tissues (Aim 1). Through mechanistic studies of antigen presentation and immune responses, coupled with deep
analysis of epithelial-cell intrinsic mRNA isoform repertoire (Aim 2), our goal is to understand the molecular
mechanisms that shape immunological status and early response to virus in epithelial cells and how their
alterations in older individuals predispose to excessive inflammation and disease during viral infection. We will
apply innovative technologies including 3D human lung tissues, functional studies based on precision-cut lung
slices, spatial transcriptomics, as well as long-read RNA-sequencing (LR-seq) to address our hypothesis.
Isoforms and functional endpoints will be analyzed in the context of the epigenetic status of ALI cultures
influenced by the microbiome (Project 2) to identify genes and pathways dysregulated with aging. Integrative,
multimodal data analyses will be carried out by the Data Science Core. Genes and isoforms selected during
studies herein will be edited in Tech Dev Aim 3 in progenitor cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
thereby enabling functional validation in subsequent ALI cultures. Ultimately, our results will guide functional
validation of a fully developed breathing lung model in Tech Dev Aim 1 for future studies of human lung
immunology. The proposed studies will enable us to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying immune
dysfunction in the lung of older adults, potentially identifying new targets for preventive intervention."

10818581,"Project Summary
Non-invasive imaging of brain anatomy and function is essential for the study of the development and
operation of the human brain. It provides clinicians with invaluable information on neurological conditions, both
in terms of understanding mechanisms of neurological diseases in general as well as providing guidance for
diagnostics and treatment planning of individual patients. Among all functional imaging modalities,
magnetoencephalography (MEG) has the best combined spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it an
excellent tool for neuroscience and neurology. To exploit the potentially good spatial resolution of MEG, one
must solve the inverse problem, i.e., estimate the underlying neural currents from the spatially discretized
measurement of the magnetic field. This task, which is non-unique in principle, is accomplished by fitting
specific parametrized mathematical models to the acquired multi-channel data and determining a set of
parameters that provides the best fit according to a particular optimization criterion. Consequently, these
parameters translate to an estimate of the spatial structure of the neural current, which is used in the
interpretation of brain function under various tasks and conditions. The spatial precision of MEG can be
determined by considering the following question: What is the minimum distance between two nearby spatial
concentrations of neural current that can be distinguished as two separate sources instead of one, perhaps
extended, source? In principle, this task appears increasingly more difficult as the distance between the
sources and the measurement sensors increases. The reason for the difficulty is two-fold: 1) the amplitude of
the magnetic field decreases with distance and 2) the spatially complex features of the magnetic field decay
with distance faster than the spatially smoother, less informative, features. In conventional inverse modeling,
the second type of difficulty may cause distinct sources to become merged as one estimated source even in
the hypothetical situation that the sensors have no noise at all. To improve fundamental resolution of MEG, we
will utilize our extensive expertise in hierarchical decompositions of magnetic signals by which we can separate
signal features corresponding to different levels of spatial complexity, represented as spatial frequencies. In
Aim 1, we develop new frequency-dependent hierarchical basis functions applicable to on-scalp
measurements as well, optimize the numerical stability of the decomposition of the corresponding frequency
components, and develop methodology for frequency-specific inverse modeling that aims at improving spatial
resolution with the help of high-frequency components. In Aim 2, we develop methodology for new sensor
array design in order to maximize the detectability of a wider frequency spectrum than what is achievable with
conventional MEG systems. We exploit the fact that new sensor technologies allow for flexible designs and
suggest subject-specific sensor placement optimization as well. In Aim 3, we design simulations, phantom
measurements, and human measurements to validate our methods."

The United States (US) biomedical science (BMS) enterprise critically lacks diversity at the Ph.D. level. This
problem is due to the lack of underrepresented minority (URM) students at the undergraduate level majoring in

improve health equity by eradicating health disparities. This is of the utmost importance since the COVID-19
pandemic is disproportionately affecting underrepresented populations in the US. Given the proper academic
and research training along with encouragement, a substantial number of academically talented URM students
would seek research career in the BMS workforce. The Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student
Enhancement (U-RISE) at Howard University Program will tap into this reservoir of students that would contribute
to the diversification of our BMS workforce. Hence, the U-RISE at HU Program leadership mission is to recruit
talented and passionate undergraduate students who envision themselves as innovative BMS scientists and
global leaders in their fields. Our program mission is to engage them in an enhanced academic curriculum and
hands-on research activities during the junior and senior years. This will produce a cadre highly educated,
motivated, and well-trained URM students. To implement and sustain U-RISE at HU Program, the objective of
the project needs to be integrated into our science community and culture. Our specific aims are the following:
1) To recruit academically talented and highly motivated URMs students to participate as trainees who aspire to
a career as a Ph.D. level scientist in BMS discipline. 2) To provide our trainees with an enhanced and structured
research training through an interdisciplinary hands-on intramural research experience, extramural summer
research experience (SRE) as well as a classroom based didactic research. 3) To have at least 75% our program
trainees accepted into a research intensive (R1) university Ph.D. programs in a BMS discipline within two years
of graduation from Howard University, and 4) To design, implement, and institutionalize a STEM professional
development course to stimulate our trainees’ interest. Finally, we envision our program will create a strong
foundation for Howard University in the recruitment, enrollment, retention, and advancement of enthusiastic
undergraduate students majoring in the BMS disciplines."
10817422,"ABSTRACT
 CAR T cell immunotherapy has proven to be a real tour de force in treating refractory hematologic
malignancies, and is being explored for treatment of solid tumors. However, solid tumors pose some obvious
and unique challenges. One of the key differences between leukemia and solid tumors is that, leukemias are
systemic, whereas solid tumors are highly localized. Hence, in the case of leukemia, access of intravenously
infused CAR T cells to their cancerous targets is never an issue with both the killers and the targets being present
by-default in the same location. However, the scenario is quite different in the case of solid tumors. Data from
our and others’ labs show that the majority (80%-90%) of the adoptively transferred therapeutic CAR T cells sit
on the sidelines in a resting state, and do not localize to the solid tumor to participate in the anti-tumor battle.
Our studies further show that the CAR T cells that sit unengaged in the periphery – by virtue of default rest from
antigenic encounter – exhibit phenotypic properties (TCF1Hi, CD127Hi, CD62LHi, PD-1Lo) and functional potential
(IFN-gHi, TNF-aHi, IL-2Hi, GzmBHi) of classical memory T cells when benchmarked against the gold-standard acute
viral infection-induced memory T cells. Hence, we propose that mobilization of this reservoir of highly functional
resting memory-like CAR T cells from the periphery into the solid tumors would provide fresh reinforcements for
enhanced tumor control, and increased synergy with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.
To address this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will engineer tumor-inducible production of chemokines by intratumoral
CAR T cells to serve as a localized beacon for relocating functionally potent CAR-Ts from periphery and thereby
enhancing tumor control. Intratumoral injection or ectopic expression of chemokines by genetic modification of
tumor cells has been shown to increase T cell infiltration, tumor control, and overall survival rates in preclinical
studies. However, intratumoral injection is not feasible for inaccessible tumors, and the short half-life of
chemokines necessitates impractically frequent injections. Overcoming these challenges, we propose a unique
CAR bioengineering strategy. In solid tumors, where antigen is restricted to the tumor microenvironment (TME),
utilization of NR4A response element (NRE) cassettes – activated by CAR-T cell signaling – will promote a
localized, highly specific mechanism for increasing chemokine levels specifically in solid tumors. In Aim 2, we
will query the impact of localized intratumoral chemokine expression by CAR T cells on the responsiveness to
PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. The working hypothesis in this aim is that chemokine-mediated
continued recruitment of functional memory-like CAR T cells from the periphery into the tumors will build the
intratumoral pool of less exhausted CAR T cells that are readily responsive to checkpoint blockade, and also
provide a more conducive immune environment. Successful completion of these preclinical proof-of-concept
studies will pave way for easy adaptation of inducible chemokine expression casettes into existing CAR-T
therapies to transform clinical outcomes for a variety of solid tumors."
10818359,"Background. Poor diet quality is a significant and critical problem for Southeast Asian (SEA) children whose
families came to the US as refugees [e.g., Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian, Vietnamese]. SEA children are
disproportionately burdened by higher rates of obesity and increased risk of other diet-related chronic diseases
like type 2 diabetes relative to other Asian subgroups, Whites and “Other” races. Although dietary interventions
have been shown to prevent/delay onset of diet-related chronic diseases, to our knowledge, there are no
dietary interventions developed specifically for SEA children. Thus, there is an urgent need for dietary
interventions that leverage state-of-the-art methods to address existing health disparities affecting SEA
children and to advance scientific understanding of gaps in intervention research. Overview of Proposal. This
proposal reflects our eight year (ongoing) academic-community research partnership with the Center for SEA
in Rhode Island, formative work with SEA families, and our extensive experience conducting successful dietary
interventions with underserved health disparity groups. The current study is a pilot feasibility study that tests an
innovative multilevel, multicomponent, multigenerational dietary intervention to improve diet quality among SEA
children. Conceptual Model. The Community Energy Balance and Family-Centered Action Model of
Intervention Layout and Implementation frameworks provide the intervention rationale and structure. These
frameworks propose that for disparity ethnic minority groups like SEA, multilevel, multicomponent,
intergenerational interventions are the most effective intervention approach for changing and sustaining
individual-level behavior change. Social cognitive theory and popular education philosophy inform the
intervention content. Overview of Research Plan. 75 SEA families with children ages 6 to 11 years will be
recruited from Providence County, Rhode Island. Adult-child pairs will be randomized to: (1) financial incentive
only arm that will receive weekly $15 financial incentive coupons to subsidize purchase of healthy foods at a
local SEA grocery store; or (2) financial incentive plus twice-monthly, family-based group nutrition education at
the Center for SEA led by SEA community health workers; three motivational interviewing (MI) calls by trained
community health workers; dietary norms messaging for adults (via weekly text messages) and for children (via
Infographics at nutrition education sessions); and weekly $15 financial incentive coupons to subsidize
purchase of healthy foods at SEA grocery stores; or (3) an Academic Engagement attention control arm that
will follow the structure of the financial incentive plus nutrition education, MI and text messages and
infographics arm. The primary outcomes are study feasibility and clinically meaningful improvement in child’s
diet quality (measured by healthy eating index). Secondary outcomes are clinically meaningful changes in
children’s body mass (~ 2kg weight loss or no weight gain), HbA1c (0.5%) and parent’s diet quality, HbA1c and
the home food environment. These study findings will be used to inform a future, larger clinical trial."

Summary
Integral membrane proteins known as multidrug transporters extrude therapeutic drugs of diverse
chemical structures across cell membranes, impeding the treatment of human cancers, infectious
diseases, and neurological disorders. Currently we lack a deep and mechanistic understanding of how
these proteins export drugs or how they can be thwarted. We will study the structure and mechanism
of a model multidrug transporter, MdfA from Escherichia coli, which couples the influx of H+ to the
efflux of various antimicrobials and belongs to the ubiquitous Drug/H+ Antiporter 1 (DHA1) family.
MdfA orthologues are present in many pathogenic microorganisms, and the overexpression of E. coli
MdfA can lead to antimicrobial resistance in clinical patients. Thus, MdfA represents an important
target for therapeutic exploitation to overcome multidrug resistance. Furthermore, the SLC18
antiporters, which are the human counterparts of MdfA in the DHA1 family, conduct the H+-dependent
vesicular transport of monoamine neurotransmitters, polyamine neuromodulators, and neurotoxins.
The human SLC18 antiporters are essential for brain function and promising therapeutic targets for
battling alcoholism, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, Huntington disease, major depressive
disorder, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Our long-term objective is to
understand how the DHA1 multidrug transporters and human SLC18 antiporters translocate their
substrates and how their function can be modulated for potential therapeutic benefit. Notably, prior
biochemical studies have suggested that MdfA translocates certain substrates via a non-canonical
mechanism. Drawing upon these data and our experience in membrane protein structural biology, we
will accomplish two aims: (1) to elucidate the molecular basis for simultaneous translocation of two
mono-cationic substrates by a DHA1; (2) to reveal the structural mechanism for non-canonical, DHA1-
mediated extrusion of di-cationic therapeutics. By combining crystallographic and biochemical studies,
we will acquire new insights into how a DHA1 translocates two substrates concurrently, how a DHA1
inhibitor differs from the substrate, and how a DHA1 exports a therapeutic drug in two consecutive and
yet different deprotonation/protonation cycles. The new conceptual framework and DHA1 structures
obtained from this study will serve as a stepping-stone toward devising novel strategies to evade or
inhibit the clinically relevant multidrug transporters, which may rescue therapeutic efficacy against
multidrug-resistant cells and halt the spread of untreatable infections. Furthermore, our work will offer
a springboard for the mechanistic studies of human SLC18 antiporters, which will shed new light on
how they utilize the electrochemical H+ gradient to translocate monoamine neurotransmitters,
neurotoxins, or polyamine neuromodulators, across vesicular membranes."
10932965,"The endometrium -- the innermost mucosal lining of the uterus that provides the site of embryo
implantation- is crucial for our species preservation and alterations on its function underlay infertility and
disease. Developments in single-cell and spatial technologies have illuminated previously unknown subtypes
of cells and their spatial arrangements in the endometrium, providing valuable insights into the signalling
pathways involved in the different endometrial compartments and hinting at their roles in determining cell
specification in the luminal or basal zones. While inferences can be made from these static pictures about
physiological functions ranging from blastocyst implantation and invasion to heavy menstrual bleeding, without
tractable in vitro models that capture the endometrium's dynamic spatial interactions, mechanistic hypotheses
about endometrial function remain challenging to test. Here, we develop in vitro models of the endometrium
by combining tissue-level spatial mapping approaches with in vitro tissue engineering and microfluidic
approaches. We will refine existing approaches and develop/test new models, prioritizing robustness and
reproducibility, and allowing dissemination and implementation by the broader community, as follows
Aim 1: Design a robust and scalable microphysiological systems (MPS) model that replicates the spatial
niches of the human endometrium in the early-to-mid secretory phase. We we will use a co-culture of epithelia
and stroma in a microfluidic device, in which organoids undergo morphogenesis in a special hydrogel. We will
inform the media composition and other metrics by querying the in vivo cellular atlases.
Aim 2: Quantify the interplay between cell origin (“nature”) and spatial environment (“nurture”) in defining
epithelial cell identity in the in vitro models built in Aim 1. We will use single-cell and spatial transcriptomics
technologies to profile the devices, and we will use clonal tracing to map the origin of a cell type. By integrating
vivo/in vitro datasets, we will conduct a systematic investigation into the various parameters that characterize
the cell source (such as luminal / basalis), as well as the magnitudes of gradients in diffusible signaling
molecules and nutrients.
Aim 3: Investigate the functional consequences of introducing endothelial cells into the in vitro model from
Aim 1, using a simple “monolayer” protocol. We will focus on the cell state transitions that are modulated by
endothelial-stromal-epithelial crosstalk during decidualization, and use the model to investigate immune cell
trafficking. Our ultimate goal is to obtain a systems biology view of the tissue, which will allow us to inform the
development of new treatments for endometrial-related disorders.
 Our tools and knowledge have potential to bring preclinical models of the endometrium more firmly into
the realm of humanised research. This work has significant implications for both academic and industrial
research, leading towards a personalised medicine approach for gynaecology."
10934600,"Project Abstract/Summary
In the U.S., about 2.1 million people experience a fragility fracture each year. This number is expected to double
or triple by 2040 as the population ages. Injuries in the upper and lower extremities equate to more than 40% of
fragility fractures, and experiencing a prior fracture is associated with an 86% increased risk of recurrence. Falls
from standing height and other low-energy trauma account for 87% of all orthopedic fractures among the elderly.
External fixation, percutaneous pinning, and open reduction internal fixation with locking plates are interventions
that are currently being used to treat extremity fractures. Despite advances in surgical technique and implant
design, nonunion, malunion, and hardware failure continue to remain a significant cause of revision surgery in
the elderly. Complication rates as high as 36% have been reported and involve onset of carpal tunnel syndrome,
complex regional pain syndrome, tendon irritation and rupture, and deep infection.
To address this problem, RevBio developed Tetranite® (TN), a novel bone adhesive that can fill gaps in bone,
fixate bone fragments, and accelerate healing through its osteoconductive effects. TN can be used as an adjunct
to traditional hardware fixation to provide immediate load sharing between the metal plate and screw systems,
and bone. It provides additional stability by enhancing fracture stabilization to achieve better healing and
prevents hardware failure. It can also be injected percutaneously a standalone method of fixation providing an
option to surgically treat fractures without the need for open reduction, metal hardware, or anesthesia.
Proposed work to treat extremity fractures in the elderly will bridge off existing late-stage development of TN
supported by a SBIR Phase II award from the National Institutes of Aging entitled, “Improved Treatment of Distal
Radius Fractures Using an Image-Guided, Percutaneous Delivery of a Novel Bone Adhesive” (R44 AG060881-
02). This grant enabled formulation optimization and conduction of user validation studies with surgeons (Aim 1)
and a pivotal animal study in sheep (Aim 2) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of TN. This project is focused on
a specific indication to treat distal radius fractures; however, based on discussions with FDA and surgeons, the
impact and value of the material could be expanded to a wider set of indications across all metaphyseal fractures
in the upper and lower extremities for this same patient population. Therefore, this grant would provide additional
funding to conduct market research and supplemental pre-clinical development costs to expand its use to these
additional anatomic regions. This funding would also enable completion of biocompatibility, sterilization,
packaging, and shelf-life validations to finish late-stage development, enabling RevBio to file an IDE, and execute
a clinical study with TN as an adjunct to hardware. The overarching goal of this program is to build off successful
Phase II research and to execute Aim 1 and Aim 2 to lead to product regulatory approval for commercialization.
Long term, RevBio’s mission is to commercialize TN in order to provide surgeons with a novel product that will
enhance fixation, accelerate healing, and reduce complications associated with extremity fractures in the elderly."
10822066,"Novel therapy to prevent alveolar bone loss in severe periodontitis
Abstract
 Periodontal disease affects almost half of US adults 30 years and older. More advanced disease,
periodontitis, leads to retraction of the gums from the teeth, with loss of alveolar bone, and ultimately loss of
teeth. A key step in progression of periodontitis involves the loss of alveolar bone that provides the underlying
support for the tooth. This process is mediated by bone-degrading osteoclasts (OC). Osteoclast activation by
inflammatory mediators disrupts bone homeostasis, leading to loss of bone mass. OC differentiation from OC
progenitor cells (OCP) is modulated by a cascade of integrated signaling culminating in stimulation by RANKL
that ultimately leads to fusion of OCP to form the active, multinucleated OC. While multiple fusogens, including
the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) and CD9, are recognized, recent data suggest a
pivotal role for OC-stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP). OC-STAMP knock-out mice exhibit
diminished alveolar bone loss in a standard ligature-induced model of periodontitis. Unlike anti-DC-STAMP, anti-
OC-STAMP down-regulates expression of CD9. These studies of osteoclastogenesis involving OC-STAMP
suggest a potential therapeutic intervention for periodontitis using an anti-OC-STAMP monoclonal antibody.
Proof-of-concept work utilized a murine-specific anti-OC-STAMP murine monoclonal antibody. During this Phase
1 project, we will identify and evaluate a panel of human anti-human OC-STAMP monoclonal antibodies. A lead
antibody will be identified using a ligature-induced periodontitis model in a human OC-STAMP knock-in mouse
model. This work will produce a novel therapeutic to slow or even potentially halt loss of alveolar bone and teeth
in severe periodontitis."
10818150,"Project Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration of the
central nervous system (CNS). Human genetic studies and adoptive transfer experiments in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS point to CD4+ T helper cells as important actors
in the development and progression of CNS specific autoimmunity. IL-2 is a cytokine critical for maintaining T
cell homeostasis, growth, and proliferation. IL-2 is predominantly produced by activated CD4+ T cells in lymphoid
organs. However, this production is lost in most cells and only sustained in a unique fraction of CD4+ T cells.
We have developed a novel tool which allow us to track, eliminate and study IL-2+ T cells during the development
and progression of EAE. Here, we will determine the identity, characteristics and means to modulate IL-2+ T
cells in the context of EAE development and progression and establish whether STAT1 limits IL-2+ T cells and
their pathogenic functions. The completion of these studies will provide new insights on the function of IL-2+
cells during prolonged disease progression, establish whether the enhance STAT1 signaling can limit the
pathogenic function of these cells, and identify markers of pathogenic IL-2+ T cells and pathways that can be
further studied and targeted to limit the activity of these cells in the context of CNS autoimmunity."

This project is the development of a non-invasively extending distal femur replacement
(DFR) for children and adolescents subsequent to bone tumor resection. Each year in
the US there are 200-250 malignant bone tumor diagnoses in the distal femurs of
patients 15 years and younger. With advances in chemotherapy, limb salvage surgery
utilizing a megaprosthesis has increasingly become the treatment of choice. For
growing patients these megaprostheses are required to extend so they can “grow” as
the contralateral limb grows. Only one non-invasively lengthened DFR is FDA approved
to treat these patients. The implant is actuated with a large electromagnetic appliance in
a clinical setting. It is exceedingly complex and the average revision rate has been
reported at 48%, including revisions for: insufficient lengthening capacity, lengthening
mechanism failure, implant fracture, aseptic loosening and infection. MRI is
contraindicated and the implant is extremely expensive. Our device is non-invasively,
manually extended by pressing on the patient's skin. It's designed for a significantly
reduced complication rate, the mechanism is simple and robust, it's MRI compatible and
can be lengthened at home for a more gradual growth and constant leg length equality.
It is capable of up to 240% of the extension that its sole US competitor offers and is
easier and less expensive to manufacture so it can be offered at a reduced price to a
greater population. The specific aims of the project are to (1) complete the implant
design, (2) design specialized surgical instruments for implantation and (3) conduct non-
clinical bench testing in preparation for FDA submission."
10814747,"Project Summary
 The median survival for metastatic melanoma is approximately 8–16 months, and few therapies offer a
significant improvement in overall survival. However, immunotherapeutic strategies that abrogate immunologic
checkpoints or improve immunosurveillance have shown promise, especially in melanoma.
 We have found that both genetic abrogation and pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC6 leads to a
decreased infiltration of pro-tumoral tumor-associated macrophages and downregulation of
immunosuppressive mediators. These effects translated into a pronounced delay of in vivo melanoma tumor
growth, which is, at least in part, dependent on intact immunity, as evidenced by the restoration of tumor
growth after CD4+ and CD8+ depletion. Our findings demonstrate a significant immunoregulatory role of
HDAC6 in melanoma, providing a rationale for the use of selective HDAC6is to improve antitumor immunity.
We are most interested in identifying HDAC6is that are best able to reduce the pro-tumoral phenotype of
tumor-associated macrophages and decrease the expression of immunosuppressive surface molecules such
as PD-L1 and PD-L2 while showing little cytotoxicity on their own.
 Our goal is thus to design, synthesize, and test new HDAC6i both in vitro and in vivo for use in the
treatment of melanoma and other malignancies. The aims to be accomplished under this grant are as follows:
1. Using molecular modeling, design, and synthesize ~50 new HDAC6is per year, for the first three years and
test these for HDAC isozyme selectivity; the last two years of the grant will focus on compound scale-up,
preclinical translational studies, and advanced ADMET testing.
2. Evaluate compounds that have IC50 values of <50nM and at least 400-fold HDAC6 selectivity using in vitro
melanoma models to measure acetylated tubulin, pSTAT3, PD-L1 levels, and cytotoxicity. For compounds
found to decrease levels of pSTAT3 and PD-L1, while increasing acetylated tubulin, conduct early-stage
ADMET studies (2 – 3/year) using a CRO, and if needed, modify the compounds using principles of medicinal
chemistry and molecular modeling based methods to increase the compound’s drug-like character.
3. Lastly, test the best compounds for their ability to delay tumor growth in syngeneic murine melanoma
models, both as stand-alone and in combination with PD-1 blocking antibodies. Additionally, we will evaluate
our best candidates using humanized PDX models and as a cell therapy pre-treating macrophages to avoid
their switch to M2-like protumoral phenotype. Those candidates showing the best in vivo efficacy will be sent
for advanced ADMET, including chronic toxicity studies, cardiac activity, and pulmonary activity in rats.
 Our proposed work is significant as it helps to fill this critical knowledge gap and thus moves epigenetic-
based combination immunotherapies to a new level. The concept to be validated is novel as it significantly
deviates from the classical cytotoxic role of HDAC inhibitors as anti-cancer agents."
10814906,"Many populations in rural settings, especially racial and ethnic minority groups, may suffer disproportionate
environmental health burdens, such as from air pollution or extreme temperatures. Yet the vast majority of
research on environmental health disparities (i.e., “environmental justice”) for air pollution, as well as research
on air pollution and health more generally, is conducted for cities. The people, communities, and air pollution
sources and mixtures are quite distinct in rural versus urban settings, such that national strategies (i.e., federal
regulations) may not be sufficiently protective of health for rural populations. Similarly, research on the health
consequences of high and low temperatures, especially for prolonged periods of heat (i.e., “heat waves”), has
almost exclusively focused on urban areas. Therefore, current research has major scientific gaps on how the
health of rural populations, including rural racial and ethnic minority groups, is impacted by air pollution and
extreme temperature. The rural south, particularly the Appalachian region, has higher rates of adverse health
outcomes in both older populations (>65y) and infants, compared to national averages. Within the south, rural
populations suffer higher rates of multiple morbidities than urban populations, including health outcomes that
are linked to air pollution and extreme heat and cold in urban environments. Rural residents also have lower
overall income, lower educational attainment, less access to health care, and three years lower life expectancy
than their urban counterparts. Evidence suggest that health disparities by race are larger for rural minorities
than their urban counterparts. Given the differences in populations, behaviors, environmental hazards, and
socioeconomic status (SES), the associations between air pollution, extreme temperature, and health could
differ substantially for rural and urban settings. These relationships may also differ across types of rural areas,
given the heterogeneity of rural environments. Scientific evidence is urgently needed on the disproportionate
impacts of air pollution and extreme temperature in rural environments, with an understanding of the range of
rural settings. Our long-term goal is to generate the methods, databases, and scientific estimates that enable
knowledge to protect health in rural populations. We propose to: 1) generate a data architecture for air
pollution, heat, cold, health, SES, rural form, and other factors in Virginia and West Virginia; 2) estimate
disparities in exposure to air pollution and weather (cold, heat, and heat waves) by race/ethnicity, SES, and
rurality, accounting for variations in rural form; and 3) estimate disparities in the associations between
exposure to air pollution or weather and health for the very young (adverse birth outcomes) and older
populations (hospital admissions for those <65 years) for rural populations, considering differences by various
vulnerability factors (low SES, race/ethnicity) and rural form. These aims will provide some of the first
comprehensive evidence of how air pollution, heat, and cold impact health in rural communities, including
differences by rural form and intersectionality of vulnerability factors, such as race, ethnicity, and SES."

The lack of validated molecular profiles clearly distinguishing aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer, and
the absence of suitable intermediate endpoints make this tumor difficult to manage rationally. We have
pioneered and developed an in vivo screening system in which peptide-targeted particles capable of homing
to tumors are recovered from a phage display random library following intravenous administration. In an
unbiased screening of an established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) with several biological attributes
reminiscent of human metastatic prostate cancer, we first isolated and validated tumor-homing peptides
targeting the cell surface-associated glucose-regulated protein-78 kD (GRP78); we also screened a patient
directly to isolate and validate ligands targeting the interleukin-11 receptor (IL11R). We next inserted cis-
genetic elements from adeno-associated virus (AAV) within the phage genome and established that hybrid
ligand-directed AAV/phage (AAVP) particles enable systemic tumor targeted delivery and molecular-genetic
imaging of reporter transgene in preclinical models of prostate cancer. We hypothesize that promoters of
upregulated transgenes in prostate cancer should enable transcription-driven suicide gene expression for
tumor imaging with in tandem growth suppression. Work from our group (among others) shows that
overexpression of GRP78 and IL11R is related to disease progression. As such, promoters for these genes
will be evaluated in new AAVP constructs. In Aim 1, we will validate GRP78 and IL11R, in addition to
promoters of other genes identified by transcriptome analysis of prostate cancer patient-derived samples.
These promoters will be cloned into reporter plasmids to initially assess their properties relative to a standard
CMV promoter in prostate cancer cells and 3-dimensional patient-derived osteogenic prostate cancer cultures
in vitro. In Aim 2, the constructs will be evaluated in animal models. Our strategy relies on intravenously
injected GRP78-targeting AAVP engineered to deliver a Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk)
transgene. Promoter-driven TK expression will be imaged with [18F]-FEAU by PET/CT and quantified by
qPCR. Tumor growth inhibition after ganciclovir treatment will be assessed in vivo by imaging, and tumor
sections will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The integration of transcriptional profiling, prostate
cancer cell targeting and molecular-genetic imaging within a single platform will potentially allow for the
monitoring of progression and response to therapy in pathologically indistinguishable, yet biologically diverse
patient cohorts with different disease outcomes. Given that the previous body of work has established GRP78
and IL11R as bona fide molecular targets in human prostate cancer, our methodological approach and
findings bear mechanistic and translational significance."

K23 Abstract
Project Summary
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a leading cause of emergency medical
treatment. Yet there is a paucity of evidence and guidelines for emergency medical services (EMS) treatment
of pediatric asthma prior to emergency department (ED) arrival. ED guidelines recommend early systemic
corticosteroid (CS) administration within one hour of ED arrival, since studies have shown associated
decreases in hospital admissions and ED length-of-stay (LOS). For patients treated by EMS, there exists an
opportunity for even earlier administration of CS. The goal of this project is to determine whether EMS
administration of CS improves patient outcomes. Our preliminary data demonstrate that currently less than
10% of EMS pediatric asthma patients receive CS prior to ED arrival.
Given the time-sensitivity of CS' effects on patient outcomes in the ED, our hypothesis is that EMS
administration of CS will decrease hospital admissions, ED LOS, and intensive care unit admissions. By
performing a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial, this study will fill a significant prehospital knowledge gap
in the continuum of emergent pediatric asthma care. This study analyzes cost and transport times, two factors
relevant to EMS operations and future guideline implementation. Through our partnership with Nassau County,
Alachua County and Lake County EMS agencies, we plan to enroll 330 patients over a three-year period to
analyze clinical outcomes and costs of EMS CS administration, and how both vary with EMS transport time.
During the five-year K23 career development award period, Dr. Jennifer Fishe will progress from a mentored
investigator to an independent investigator positioned to achieve R01 funding. That transition will occur due to
strong mentorship and a structured training plan which includes: 1) Development of knowledge and experience
with clinical trials, including protection of human subjects, 2) Attaining a Master of Science in Biostatistics, and
3) Grantsmanship and Leadership training necessary to become an independent investigator. Dr. Fishe's
mentor and scientific advisor team contains subject matter experts on clinical trials and pediatric asthma /
emergency medical services, experience with R01 grants and clinical trials, as well as career development.

Targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic kinases such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1 (TKIs) have significantly improved
the survival of lung cancer patients whose tumors harbor activating genomic alterations in these genes.
Unfortunately, these therapies are not curative and patients eventually develop drug resistance leading to
disease progression. Recent work by our group and others has demonstrated that genomic mechanisms of
acquired drug resistance can evolve from residual drug-tolerant cells that that initial survive drug treatment and
then subsequently acquire the genomic alteration during therapy. This suggests that treatment strategies that
can alter the survival and evolution of residual tumor cells may pre-empt the emergence of resistant clones. In
preliminary studies using preclinical models of EGFR mutant and ALK fusion lung cancer, we have observed
that cancer cells surviving initial TKI treatment exhibit increased expression and activity of the APOBEC3A
cytidine deaminase. Additionally, analysis of clinical tumor samples from EGFR and ALK lung cancer patients
revealed accumulation of APOBEC mutations during sequential TKI therapy. We hypothesize that APOBEC3A-
mediated DNA and RNA editing induced by TKI treatment facilitates the emergence of drug tolerant clones in
lung tumors during treatment and facilitates the evolution of acquired drug resistance. In this project, we will
develop novel biochemical and computational tools to study APOBEC3A mutagenesis in EGFR mutant and ALK
fusion non-small cell lung cancer experimental models and clinical tumor specimens. These studies will establish
a causal link between TKI treatment and induction of APOBEC mutagenesis. Next, we will investigate whether
activation of innate immune signaling pathways in response to genomic instability and/or expression of RNA
repeat elements is necessary and sufficient for TKI-induced APOBEC3A mutagenesis. Finally, we will determine
whether induction of APOBEC3A promotes the survival of drug tolerant clones and subsequent development of
acquired drug resistance. These studies will yield fundamental biological insights into how TKI resistance evolves
in oncogene-addicted cancers and identify new vulnerabilities that can be targeted to delay or prevent resistance
from developing."

The rise of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) demands new approaches to
combating this infectious agent. The survival of Mtb depends on the cell envelope, which is both
durable and dynamic. Mycobacteria modulate their cell envelope composition to subsist in the
harsh environments they encounter in the host. The proposed aims focus on developing new
tools to probe, perturb, and observe changes in the mycobacterial cell envelope. The focus of
Aim 1 is on visualizing arabinofuranose and mannose residues within the cell wall and the
immunomodulatory lipoarabinomannan (LAM). In Aim 2, we shall develop a complementary
probe that identifies methylthioxylofuranose (MTX)-capped LAM, a glycan that has been
detected in pathogenic mycobacteria. The probes generated in Aims 1 and 2 can reveal how cell
envelope composition varies under different conditions and between strains. In Aim 3, we shall
deploy a fluorogenic probe to visualize the changing mycobacterial cell envelope in real time.
This probe provides a means to explore phenotypic changes in the mycobacterial cell envelope
upon antibiotic treatment or uptake into macrophages. By pursuing the three aims, we expect to
uncover vulnerabilities in mycobacterial defenses that will lead to new antibiotic strategies.
Significance:
The overall objective of this application is to develop new chemical probes to understand how
the mycobacteria modify and maintain their cell envelope to survive under the extreme and
varied conditions they encounter in human hosts. We anticipate that this knowledge will
ultimately lead to the identification of new strategies to treat tuberculosis (TB)."
10811689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microarray patches (MAPs), also known as microneedle patches, are a novel, needle-free delivery
technology in development for drugs and vaccines. MAPs contain an array of dissolving micron-scale
projections and are applied like a bandage, painlessly piercing the stratum corneum to facilitate
intradermal delivery. Due to their ease of use and acceptability, MAPs can potentially improve adherence
to treatment, particularly for children.
We propose to develop a MAP containing long-acting antiretrovirals as an age-appropriate, long-acting
drug delivery system to treat pediatric HIV infection, with a particular focus on suitability for use in young
children. The MAP would be designed to require a short wear time (less than 1 hour) and deliver enough
drug to provide a monthly (or less frequent) dosing regimen. In contrast to other long-acting dosage
forms, such as injectables and implants, the MAP would be painless and could be administered at home
by parents or caregivers.
The first phase of the project will focus on defining pediatric MAP requirements and optimizing
antiretroviral MAP formulations. In the first two years, the project team plans to:
1. Define target product profile targets and preferred user characteristics, identify stakeholder needs,
 and evaluate potential acceptability to inform product development.
2. Determine MAP parameters through physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling.
3. Design, manufacture, and characterize nanosuspension-loaded dissolving MAPs.
Assuming promising results from the first phase, during the second phase of the project we will focus on
verifying MAP performance in preclinical and end user studies. In the last three years, the project team
plans to:
4. Assess in vivo drug delivery and pharmacokinetic extrapolation.
5. Assess pharmacokinetics and antiviral efficacy in non-human primates.
6. Conduct user-centered design development of MAP prototypes, conduct a risk analysis, and assess
 end user acceptability."
10801410,"SUMMARY
Male factor infertility is responsible in as much as 50% of cases of couple infertility; moreover, male infertility has
been observed to represent an early-life predictor of later-life disease risk. Conventional semen parameter
analysis remains the most prevalent diagnostic tool for assessing semen quality, but has well documented limited
ability to explain male factor infertility and poor reproductive success. Limitations are likely due to reliance on
measures that do not identify the underlying biological influences of sperm function, and incomplete use of
information from semen parameters. Development of novel biomarkers of biological determinants of male
reproductive health is a critical step toward developing interventions to improve clinical care and public health.
Our research to date suggests that sperm mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and deletions
(mtDNAdel) may fill this gap, and directly measure the physiological processes that determine male reproductive
health. Mitochondria play key roles in sperm function and harbor their own genome, which is highly susceptible
to damage. Our published data suggest that mtDNA biomarkers are related to male infertility, fertilization
probability, clinical infertility treatment outcomes, and time-to-pregnancy (TTP). As a next step in this line of
research, it is important to evaluate these potential relations in large study samples. Moreover, while
conventional semen parameters remain controversial in predicting male factor infertility and reproductive
success, little is known on how best to leverage the combination of semen parameter and novel mtDNA
biomarker data to advance clinical care to understand the male contribution to reproductive success. We propose
to evaluate these relationships using data and biospecimens from the NIH funded Folic Acid and Zinc
Supplementation Trial (FAZST) and the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics and Development Study (SEEDS).
Using these resources, we can evaluate hypotheses in large (n=2,570) preconception cohort that includes
couples using a range of fertility treatments and provide opportunity to test mechanistic pathways. The proposed
research represents an efficient approach to evaluate our hypothesis that mtDNA biomarkers are direct
measures of the underlying biology of male reproductive health, and thus represent a biomarker of overall sperm
fitness. For this proposed research, we will analyse associations of sperm mtDNA biomarkers with semen
parameters, determine associations of sperm mtDNA biomarkers with clinical reproductive outcomes, and
develop clinical prediction models integrating sperm mtDNA biomarkers and semen parameters using machine
learning to optimize use of these measures to inform clinical care. The impact of the proposed research is
expected to improve our understanding of the etiology of male reproductive health by evaluating sperm mtDNA
as novel biomarkers of sperm function and overall fitness. This innovative proposal holds promise to positively
impact clinical reproductive care and is a critical step toward developing interventions for male sub- and infertility."
10801333,"The tooth is a complex organ comprised of molecularly and structurally diverse soft and mineralized tissues.
Challenges in regenerating the tooth root lie in simultaneously rebuilding these unique tissues in a spatially-
organized manner. Furthermore, sensory innervation and proper attachment to surrounding healthy alveolar
bone is critical for regenerated dental tissue function. Carefully orchestrated spatial and temporal cues regulate
tissue patterning of the tooth during development and ensure that the tooth and its supporting tissues are
integrated into the jaw. Understanding these processes during repair will advance the field of regenerative
dentistry. Using scaffold-free tissue engineering approaches, we have generated tooth root organoids using
dental pulp stem/progenitor cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament (PDL) stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs).
These organoids comprise a striated structure of mineralized and unmineralized tissues, with a central pulp-
like tissue enclosed within a mineralized dentino/cementogenic tissue surrounded by a soft periodontal
ligament (PDL)-like tissue. Building this type of complex construct containing multiple, anatomically organized
tissues with hugely varying structural, biochemical, and mechanical properties is a significant challenge in field
of tissue engineering. Here, we propose utilizing tooth root organoids as novel 3D experimental models to
define stages of DPSC and PDLSC fate that are critical for reparative tissue assembly and integration. In Aim
1, first, a time course evaluation will be performed to histologically map stages of cell fate and the progression
of tissue assembly in tooth root organoids. Then, single cell transcriptomic analysis will be conducted to track
the trajectories of cell differentiation and comprehensively define the cell populations comprising the organoids.
The goal of Aim 2 is to uncover mechanisms regulating innervation of dental organoids. During natural tooth
development, innervation is a tightly regulated spatiotemporal process. Here, we will investigate if dental
stem/progenitor cells recapitulate these developmental phenomena while assembling dental organoids. In Aim
3, the ability of tooth root organoids to form physiological attachments to bone will be evaluated. Proper
attachment of repaired or regenerated dental tissues to the alveolar bone remains a major clinical challenge.
Tooth root organoids will be orthotopically implanted into healed tooth extraction sites in rats. Histological and
microcomputed tomography analyses will be used to determine if the tooth root organoids are able to maintain
their patterning and form Sharpey’s fibers to attach to the bone. In addition, the ability of these engineered
dental tissues to become vascular and innervated in vivo will be assessed. The completion of this proposal will
result in new knowledge on mechanisms governing tissue patterning in engineered tissues. This study will also
provide important information on factors driving functional integration of regenerated tissue with the body. The
outcomes of this work can be translated into developing new effective dental therapies and applied to
regenerating organs throughout the body."
10790402,"Understanding protein turnover alterations in physiological brain aging
ABSTRACT
In mammals, physiological aging is associated with multiple molecular changes that lead to loss of cellular
homeostasis and progressive tissue deterioration. A primary and conserved feature of cellular aging is reduced
proteome integrity. Disruption of protein homeostasis machinery leads to accelerated aging in several animal
models and is implicated in human pathology. In the brain, changes in proteome integrity due to extremely slow
cell turnover promote the accumulation of damaged and potentially toxic proteins with devastating effects on
brain physiology such as cognitive impairment and synapse loss. Interestingly, age is also the strongest risk
factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, raising the question of how age-related proteostasis alterations
could become dangerous for the brain and possibly initiate the development of neurodegeneration. While
imbalances in protein homeostasis are thought to be a major cause of aging, changes in protein levels in the
aged brain are extremely small. As a result, it has been difficult to study the molecular mechanisms underlying
the age-dependent disruption of proteostasis and loss of proteome integrity. Overall, this suggests that we need
new analytical paradigms and the development of novel experimental workflows to study loss of proteome
integrity. Along this research line, by using metabolic labeling and quantitative pulsed-SILAC proteomics our
team has recently shown that in the brain, aging primarily alters the turnover of a subset of proteins associated
with neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that specific aspects of the protein production/degradation
machinery or the complex assembly state of these proteins are predominantly affected by aging. In other words,
there are parts of the proteome that are more susceptible to age-related changes. To understand in detail these
protein turnover changes in physiological brain aging and to obtain a quantitative definition of the proteome
imbalance during aging, our proposal will: (I) study the stoichiometry of the ribosome and proteasome; (II)
measure changes in protein complex composition at the whole proteome level; (III) reveal for which protein
interaction state turnover is more specifically affected by aging; and (IV) address the effects of age-dependent
brain protein aggregation and the extent to which this extends protein lifetimes. Overall, by integrating this wealth
of information, we will greatly advance our understanding of the link between brain aging, proteostasis
impairment, and the preferential alteration of protein turnover associated with neurodegeneration. Our basic work
will provide new fundamental insights for the entire field of proteostasis impairment in aging and may ultimately
lead to new interventions to counteract the decline of the proteome during aging."

Caring for hospitalized infants requires a comprehensive pain control program aimed at reducing and preventing
pain. While opioids are commonly used when an infant undergoes a painful procedure, opioids can increase the
risk of short- and long-term morbidity. The duration and type of opioids used for hospitalized infants varies widely
between institutions and such wide variations could impact early childhood development and overall healthcare
utilization. In this study, we will create a novel clinical and developmental dataset by merging the Pediatric Health
Information System (PHIS) and the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC). This merged
dataset will be the first large retrospective, multi-center cohort representing diverse populations of critically ill,
hospitalized infants linking their in-hospital data with long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Using this novel
dataset, we will (1) identify variations in opioid use associated with neurodevelopmental disability and long-term
resource utilization for high-risk infants, (2) quantify cumulative opioid dosing received associated with
neurodevelopmental disability for high-risk infants, and (3) quantify differences in healthcare utilization and costs
associated with high vs. low opioid use among high-risk infants. The expected outcome is a comprehensive
understanding of the variations in opioid use for high-risk infants and its impact on neurodevelopment and
healthcare utilization. Results will lead to interventions for hospitalized infants aimed at minimizing variation in
pain control and will also inform policymakers of a previously unrecognized infant population in need of increased
resources to improve clinical and developmental outcomes."

The high mortality and morbidity of tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), calls for development of novel adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) to improve treatment
outcome and restrict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Mtb strains. Knowledge of immunometabolism offers
new opportunities for controlling this deadly disease. We and others have characterized immunometabolic
changes in multiple animal models of TB and found that metabolic remodeling to the HIF-1-mediated Warburg
effect is a general response of host immune cells to Mtb infection. Through detailed analysis of immunometabolic
dynamics of the macrophage response to Mtb infection, we discovered that M1-like polarization at initial stages
of infection is accompanied by upregulation of ARG2, a type II arginase located in mitochondria. Given the critical
roles that mitochondria play in mediating the signaling and metabolic pathways during macrophage activation,
the upregulation of mitochondrial ARG2 suggests a little-studied role of this enzyme in M1-like polarization.
Indeed, macrophages from Arg2 KO mice showed a diminished proinflammatory response and dysregulated
mitochondrial dynamics. The identification of arginine metabolism-associated pathways, as well as upregulation
of a related set of genes that include Arg2, using metabolomics and transcriptomics studies of Mtb-infected
mouse lungs, also indicate that ARG2-mediated arginine and/or ornithine metabolism is an important regulator
of host immunity to control Mtb infection in vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that mitochondrial
ARG2 activity contributes to M1-like polarization by regulating mitochondria dynamics and functions, including
generation of signaling molecules, activation of signaling networks, and changes in mitochondrial metabolism to
meet the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of activating macrophages. We will test the hypothesis 1) by
delineating ex vivo effects of ARG2-mediated arginine metabolism on mitochondrial biology and macrophage
polarization, using multiple approaches/assays that include stable isotope tracing metabolomics; and 2) by
characterizing the role of ARG2-mediated arginine/ornithine metabolism in regulating the expression of innate
and adaptive immunity during Mtb infection in vivo. We will also test an adjunct HDT through arginine or ornithine
supplementation to improve infection outcome. We expect to aid the development of urgently needed adjunct
HDTs with dietary supplementation of arginine/ornithine that should help clear the pathogen at an early stage of
infection, prevent reactivation from a latent infection, and/or shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy."
10793538,"Patients who present to Podiatry with a diabetic foot ulcer are prescribed orthoses to offload and protect the
foot from further damage. However, the available anecdotal and scholarly data suggests that patients do not wear
orthoses as prescribed. There are often negative health consequences when these orthoses are not worn and
added costs to the healthcare system associated with the negative health outcomes.
 The goal of this work is to encourage the use of orthoses by diabetic foot ulcer patients. The diabetic foot ulcer
patient’s participating in this study will have their orthosis wear-time measured between clinic visits. The use of
the orthosis will be encouraged in one group using education and motivational interviewing. Measured wear time
will also be discussed with this group of patients. The second group of patients will not be actively encouraged to
wear the orthosis. Routine clinical data will be collected in tandem with wear-time data in both groups.
 These data will be used to objectively determine how often patients wear their orthosis, whether active
intervention can modulate orthosis wear time, and provide an objective measure of the effectiveness of orthosis
use. The goal of the study is to improve outcomes for Veterans treated in the VA for diabetic foot ulcers, reduce
complication rates from non-use of orthoses and to, thereby, reduce healthcare costs."

10794236,"Project Summary: The objective of this “Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists”
proposal is to determine the contributions of the CRF (corticotropin releasing factor) system to encoding and
responding to salient stimuli in the environment in individuals with different life histories of stressor exposure.
CRF is a neuropeptide neuromodulator that is expressed in several brain regions and is released in response to
both positive and negative arousing environmental stimuli. It is unclear how CRF as a brain wide neural system
differentially responds to stimuli with different valences to motivate appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors.
In addition, there is evidence that the CRF system is highly plastic and can undergo allostatic adaptations in
response to stressor exposure. Moreover, it is thought that in pathological states of allostatic overload, these
adaptations in the CRF system persist in suboptimal ways. Yet, it is unclear how the activity patterns of CRF
enriched nuclei across the brain are altered in a stress-induced state of allostatic overload, nor is it understood
how changes at different CRF loci combine to promote maladaptive behavioral responses. This proposal seeks
to resolve these unanswered questions by testing the hypothesis that positive or negative salient environmental
stimuli stimulate the activity of unique ensembles of CRF-containing nuclei to drive the appropriate affective
behavioral responses. Furthermore, that chronic stress shifts CRF network responsivity toward greater activation
to negative stimuli and depressed activation toward positive stimuli which leads to enhanced avoidance of these
salient environment stimuli. To test this hypothesis, I propose two specific aims.
Aim 1. Generate a whole brain functional map of activity patterns of CRF-containing neurons in response
to acute environmental stimuli in control and chronically stressed male and female mice. This aim uses
three-dimensional functional neuroanatomy and in vivo calcium imaging techniques to determine the activity
patterns of CRF expressing nuclei in response to salient environmental stimuli that carry different valences. We
will assess this in control and chronically stressed male and female mice. Collectively, these experiments will
offer a holistic perspective on the response(s) of CRF to salient stimuli by viewing it as a whole-brain neural
system rather than focusing on a single region or pathway.
Aim 2. Determine the effects of site-specific suppression of CRF-containing neurons or deletion of CRF
peptide on behavioral responses to acute salient stimuli presented to control and stress-exposed mice.
This aim assesses the relative contributions of CRF localized to different brain nuclei in modulating approach
and avoidance behavior by utilizing cutting-edge transgenic and optogenetic techniques.
The purpose of the BRAINS program is to nurture innovative new investigators by promoting investigation of
ambitious and important questions. This proposal answers that call and is poised to transform the way we think
about CRF in the brain."
10794237,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with
neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical
impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to
accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk
prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator
for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve
necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling
multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically-
enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms
(N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost
effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input
from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in
risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost
effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to
optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by
establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental
health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of
intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk
prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia,
modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of
neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to
optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby
Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to
accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned.
The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has
transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders."
10794238,"The global burden of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is ~3.7 billion, while HSV2 afflicts ~400 million. In adults, these lifelong infections typically cause epithelial lesions, which recur whenever the virus reactivates from its lifelong latent reservoir in neurons. In newborns the outcomes are more dire, with approximately half of all HSV infections leading to invasive viral spread into the central nervous system (CNS), or viral dissemination into organs such as the lungs or liver. Rates of mortality and lifelong morbidity are significantly higher for the invasive CNS and disseminated forms of neonatal infection, than for infections that remain limited to the body surface. The contribution of HSV genetic variation to these different clinical outcomes is as yet unknown. In a recent pilot analysis of neonatal HSV samples, we found patterns of viral genetic variation that correlated with invasive spread phenotypes. We now propose to extend our genomic and phenotypic analyses of viral variation to a larger neonatal dataset and to incorporate in vivo models of virulence. The combination of viral comparative genomics, cell-based phenotyping, in vivo models of pathogenesis, and de-identified clinical data will lay the foundation for a future genome-wide association study (GWAS) for neonatal HSV. Using these data, we will probe connections between viral genetic variation and clinical outcomes such as invasive CNS vs. skin disease, severity of neurologic impairment, and response to antivirals. In Aim 1, we will use high-throughput sequencing (HTSeq) and comparative genomics to dissect viral genetic variation between and within individuals with HSV1 or HSV2 neonatal HSV disease. We will quantify differences between-hosts at the level of the overall consensus genomes, and within-host by examining minor variants in samples from distinct niches in the body. In Aim 2 we will determine the in vitro phenotypic profile of each cultured HSV isolate, by examining rates of viral replication, cell-to-cell spread, plaque morphology, and viral protein expression and localization in a panel of cell types, including neurons. In Aim 3 we will determine the rate of spread and neuroinvasion in vivo for neonatal HSV1 and HSV2 isolates, using murine models of either disseminated or CNS infection. These data will allow us to link differences in viral genetics (from Aim 1) and cell-based phenotypes (from Aim 2) with levels of neuroinvasion and virulence observed in vivo (Aim 3) or via de-identified clinical data for these neonatal isolates. Our ultimate goal is to find measures than can predict the risk of highly-invasive disease for newly infected newborns, so that individuals at highest risk can be identified and targeted for intervention(s) to limit viral invasion and improve clinical outcomes."

Social justice is the primary ethical value underlying health equity. The public health
literature, due to its disciplinary limitations, does not “secure” conceptions of health
equity to an in-depth theory of social justice. Political philosophy offers several theories
of social justice. Which of these are best suited to health equity? The objective of this
solo-authored book project is to answer this question.
 The book has three specific aims: To identify and critically assess (1) the implicit
ethical goals that underlie much public health research, education, and policy on health
equity; (2) the dominant theories of social justice that are frequently applied to public
health and healthcare ethics; and (3) alternative theories of social justice that could be
applied to health and healthcare.
 As the book will be a work in normative bioethics and its primary methodology is
philosophical analysis and critical assessment of concepts and arguments, it does not
have a hypothesis per se but rather a central claim to be explained and defended. The
central claim is that we need to develop and apply the political philosophical theory of
“relational egalitarianism” to health equity. Relational egalitarianism is a theory
committed to elucidating and defending relational equality. According to this form of
equality, foremost, social justice means that people must be able to stand in front of
each other as equals. Health inequity, according to this theory, occurs primarily when
health disparities are caused by or lead to relational inequalities, or both. The innovation
of the project is that it will (1) develop relational egalitarianism to apply to health equity
as an alternative to dominant analytic theories of social justice, and (2) it will engage in
literature from analytic political philosophy along with theories of structural and
interactional racism, sexism, transoppression and ableism from the critical theory
literature. Its significance is that it will demonstrate how relational egalitarianism can
help guide choices about how health equity should be understood, measured, and
represented in the health sciences, policy, and education. As the reduction of health
inequities, which will improve the health of marginalized groups, is frequently cited as a
primary goal of public health, the book is of clear"

The goal of the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource (NRGR) is to further the understanding of the
genetic and environmental etiologies of mental disorders. The NRGR receives raw biosamples, such as blood,
from NIMH-supported research projects. The NRGR processes these samples to DNA, RNA, cDNA, or cell
lines, which can then be used for genomic analyses. The NRGR also receives, curates, and harmonizes
clinical/phenotypic data for each subject. Results of genomic analyses on samples in the NRGR are either
directly deposited in the NRGR or are linked to a deposit in another public repository. After a proprietary
period, the clinical data, genomic data, DNA, RNA, cDNA, and cell lines are made available to all NIMH-
approved researchers through a secure web portal. This sharing of uniformly processed biological samples
and curated clinical and genomic data from many cohorts leverages the NIMH investment in genetic studies. It
provides critical research power by making a very large body of data available for study of the genetic bases
for individual mental disorders. Since October 1998, >250K subject samples have been submitted to NRGR
and >615K DNA and >15K cell lines have been distributed. There have been >1,700 distributions of clinical
and genomic data to >1,000 investigators, resulting in >1,000 publications using NRGR samples and data.
Starting in 2011, the NRGR has provided in-depth characterization services for induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) and their progenitor somatic cells, as well as limited iPSC production. As its guiding aim, the NRGR will
continue to innovate in order to serve the scientific needs of NIMH PIs in a flexible and highly accessible

10801427,"ABSTRACT
Lipids exert a profound influence on immune status providing bulk energy sources and mediating immune sig-
naling. Indeed, host responses to microbiota and infection have immune and metabolic facets. But, mecha-
nisms that govern immunometabolic remodeling are poorly understood and have been studied mostly in the
context of transcriptional regulation. The role of post-transcriptional mechanisms such as Pre-mRNA splicing in
host-bacteria conflict remains largely unknown. We have uncovered a novel, evolutionarily conserved and
physiologically relevant mechanism by which alternative splicing (Alt-Spl) of lipases alters endocannabinoid
(eCB) production and shapes the host response to intestinal bacterial infection. Here, we propose to study how
infection-associated splicing links lipase activity, eCB biogenesis and immune response in vivo.
In preliminary, unpublished studies, we discovered that Alt-Spl of DAGL-2, the sole C. elegans homolog of
DAGLa & DAGLb enzymes that catalyze biogenesis of 2-Arachidonyl Glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant eCB
in mammals, alters 2-AG production and influences host response to bacterial infection. We have identified
analogous exons in DAGLB, the gene encoding DAGLb,
cells. DAGL-2 Alt-Spl is regulated by TCER-1, a splicing
and found them to undergo Alt-Spl in human immune
factor that we previously discovered represses patho-
gen resistance; we found this regulatory relationship to be maintained in mammals. Our data has identified ad-
ditional lipid-catabolizing genes that undergo Alt-Spl upon infection and revealed broad infection-induced splic-
ing alterations suggesting that Pre-mRNA splicing is a key regulatory step at the host-bacteria interface. We
also found that TCER-1 modulates infection-induced fat loss and, in a partly independent pathway, regulates
overall gene expression of a family of ‘LIPL’ triglyceride lipases, homologs of human lysosomal acid lipase A
(LIPA), to shape host response. Hence, we hypothesize that infection-induced Alt-Spl and differential
expression of conserved lipases dictates fat mobilization and shapes host response. To test this, we will
conduct in vivo mechanistic studies to elucidate how DAGL-2/DAGLB splicing alters 2-AG biogenesis and how
2-AG/its derivatives shape immune outcomes (Aim 1). We will define the spatiotemporal expression and func-
tion dynamics of the ‘LIPL’ enzymes, identify their downstream metabolites and the mechanism(s) by which
they shape immunometabolism (Aim 2).
These studies combine in vivo molecular genetic approaches with advanced lipidomics, protein modeling and
mammalian cell studies. They address topics of broad significance in host-bacteria interactions: (a) Pre-mRNA
splicing, (b) eCB pathway, (c) immune-activating host lipases. This work will potentially establish splicing as a
conserved regulatory feature of host-bacteria conflict and fulfill a fundamental knowledge gap in immunome-
tabolism to establish splicing as a target for non-antibiotic therapies for infections and inflammatory diseases."

The ability to identify common objects in our environment (forks, pens, mugs) and grasp and manipulate them
according to their function in support of behavioral goals is a tacit skill woven into everyday activities. Those
abilities are supported by an integrated network of occipital and temporal lobe regions (supporting visual object
processing and conceptual knowledge) and parietal and frontal areas (supporting active maintenance of object
representations and object-directed actions). This object-processing network can be reliably mapped at the single
participant and the group level using functional MRI when participants view images of manipulable objects.
The key theoretical gap addressed by this research program concerns how neural representations of objects and
actions in one region of the object processing network causally depend on processing in other regions within the
network. This program tackles this issue via a new analytic approach, `Voxel-based Lesion Representational
Similarity Analyses (VL-RSA). VL-RSA tests how lesions in one part of the brain affect fMRI-measured neural
representational spaces in anatomically distant areas. VL-RSA capitalizes on the complementary strengths of
neuropsychology (causal inference) and fMRI (high-sensitivity to information decoding). Hypothesis testing
across Aims compare representational similarity spaces for a common set of objects and actions in functionally
defined ROIs distal to the location of a brain tumor—before and after resective surgery. This approach offers a
powerful model to derive causal inferences about processing dependencies across a network of brain regions.
 Aim 1 studies patients with brain tumors (and surgeries) that spare occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). Aim
1 tests the predictions that lesions to parietal regions of the object processing network will reduce neural
responses and within-category multi-voxel pattern similarity specifically for objects (and not for faces, animals,
places), and specifically in object-preferring subregions of OTC (as opposed to face/animal preferring regions).
Aim 2 studies patients with brain tumors that spare parietal cortex. Aim 2 tests the predictions that occipito-
temporal lesions will disrupt representational similarity spaces for object-associated manipulation (praxis) in
the supramarginal gyrus, while frontal motor lesions will disrupt grasp representations in aIPS. Clinically
oriented Aim 3 tests if representational spaces for objects and actions shift to the right hemisphere regions
homologous to the site of the tumor, and the surgery to remove the tumor, and how such reorganization relates
behavioral ability. Extensional analyses evaluate the roles of monocular vs binocular cues to depth and
`tangibility' of the visual stimuli, and the relation between structural integrity of white matter pathways and
core functional outcomes. Fulfilment of the Aims of this program will advance understanding of how brain
lesions affect processing distal to the injury with causal evidence. A deeper understanding of how brain lesions
affect network function is important for understanding variability across patients in recovery after brain injury."

Sensorimotor learning and maintaining calibration of the motor system is essential for activities of daily living.
While the motor control literature has traditionally focused on a slow-learning, implicit process, recent work
highlights that rapid learning and readjustment of sensorimotor skills is supported by higher-order cognitive
strategies. The proposed research focuses on these cognitive strategies, and aims to understand their operation
during health and neurological disease. Based on our prior work, we propose that strategies may reflect two
broadly-classed mechanisms: an algorithm-like strategy that seeks to simulate the outcome of an intended action
before its execution and a retrieval-like mechanism that caches previously successful strategies in a short-term
memory store. We will ask whether these strategies can be improved over time, if people are sensitive to their
relative costs and constraints, and if they have differential impacts on the learning of an implicit system. All
studies will be conducted with neurologically-intact participants and individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA),
allowing us to assess the extent to which the cerebellum, which is known to play a critical role in sensorimotor
learning, supports strategy use. Importantly, we will determine if different kinds of strategies may form the basis
for viable, novel rehabilitation approaches for individuals with cerebellar damage or degeneration. These
strategies may represent an untapped or underappreciated resource for improving sensorimotor skill learning in
general, as well as a potential avenue for overcoming impairments associated with damage to the cerebellum
by exploiting extracerebellar circuits and resources not recruited by protocols that emphasize only implicit
sensorimotor learning. Alternatively, it may be that cerebellar damage also has a deleterious effect on an
individual’s ability to use cognitive strategies for sensorimotor control and learning, in line with recent findings
suggesting a prominent role for the cerebellum in cognition. In order to get to the heart of these issues, we will
systematically create conditions that require learners to adopt either an algorithmic or a retrieval-based strategy
to improve performance in a sensorimotor learning task. In addition to providing a more comprehensive account
of the nature of sensorimotor learning, the findings from the proposed work could also provide useful insights for
motor rehabilitation practices following cerebellar damage and degeneration."

Hyperlipidemia and thromboinflammation are among the unifying drivers of cardiovascular disease—the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vascular inflammation results in part from lipid
accumulation within the blood vessel lumen, prompting endothelial cell dysfunction and localized loss of
endothelial barrier function. Concomitant activation of the coagulation cascade culminates in thrombin
generation, inciting platelet activation and pathological clot formation. Our work has defined the role of
coagulation factor (F)XI in propagating thrombin generation by way of both activating downstream
coagulation factors as well as proteolyzing inhibitors of thrombin generation. Yet, the crosstalk between the
coagulation cascade, FXI, and the pathways mediating inflammation and endothelial cell barrier function
remain ill-defined. We made the novel observations that the endothelium selectively inhibits activated FXI
by binding, inactivating, and internalizing FXIa. Moreover, we found that pharmacological targeting of FXI
protected endothelial barrier function in a mouse model of hyperlipidemia. In a non-human primate model
of diet-induced hyperlipidemia, our preliminary studies show that pharmacological targeting of FXI reduced
platelet sensitization and markers of inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP). This reduction in CRP
is akin to our observations in prospective clinical trials of FXI therapeutics where we found that FXI inhibition
reduced levels of CRP in patients on dialysis or following placement of an indwelling catheter. Herein we
will define the mechanistic link between FXI activation and activity, inflammation, and endothelial cell barrier
function. This program will build on our ability to develop tools for molecular imaging of cellular functions
coupled with the creation and use of novel inhibitors of FXI and the contact pathway coagulation factors,
with a focus on translation from in silico models, in vitro studies to in vivo mouse and nonhuman primate
models. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that inactivation of FXIa by endothelial cells signals to reduce
vascular endothelial barrier function. Aim 2 will focus on defining the role of FXI activation and FXIa activity
in platelet activation and thromboinflammation associated with hyperlipidemia. We will employ three
complementary mouse models and a non-human primate model of hyperlipidemia to improve rigor and
translational relevance of our results. This work will provide rationale for use of FXI inhibitors for the
treatment and prevention of thromboinflammation."

significant intra- and inter-tumor molecular heterogeneity; and 2) limitations in current imaging
techniques for distinguishing true tumor recurrence (TTR), pseudo-progression (PP), or radiation
necrosis (RN) following surgical resection and adjuvant therapy. Direct tissue sampling is invasive
and may not capture the entire molecular landscape of the tumor. Non-invasive imaging (e.g.
MRI) fails to detect small recurrences, is limited in resolving differential diagnoses during imaging
follow-up, and does not capture tumor molecular evolution. Recently, liquid biopsy of proximal
fluids has gained popularity for systemic tumors. In gliomas, both blood and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) are viable sources of proximal fluids. While acquisition of blood is less invasive, the CSF
is physiologically expected to be a superior enriched reservoir for tumor-specific biomarkers.
Thus, CSF can be leveraged for more direct target identification, which can be subsequently
extended to blood assays. Most molecular analyses of glioblastoma have focused on the genome,
epigenome and transcriptome, but proteomic analyses are also required to understand tumor
functional phenotypes like response to therapy. We have conducted shotgun proteomics on as
little as 30 µL of CSF from patients with glioblastoma and primary central nervous system
lymphoma, detecting a substantial concentration of distinct and identifying differentially enriched
pathways for each tumor class. We hypothesize that integration of CSF-based
proteogenomic analyses can improve our diagnosis of DGs, refine our management during
tumor surveillance and offer insight into potential novel drug targets. We propose to conduct
a multi-center study focused on CSF, with the largest prospective cohort established to-date. This
project will validate our preliminary findings while establishing novel diagnostic proteomic
signatures based on CSF. We will also establish the first ever CSF glycoproteome in DGs, which
will be of great value for drug target development. Success in this proposal will have a significant
impact on diffuse glioma management through improving preoperative diagnostic precision and
subsequent surgical planning, enable early intervention for TTR while eliminating potentially
unnecessary surgery for RN, and establish a template for drug target discovery in future studies."
10801786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The objective of this proposed research is to provide one of the first in-depth, mixed-method analysis of
women's reproductive trajectories in the context of successive novel infectious disease crises – Zika in 2015-
17 and Covid-19 since 2020 – in a country hard-hit by both these epidemics/pandemics. These analyses will
center on how contextual and individual-level experiences with these shocks have influenced women's
reproductive lives both in the short-term and long-term. Understanding women's reproductive responses to
successive novel infectious disease crises is key to developing a nuanced understanding of how the impact of
these shocks extend beyond mortality to fertility and reproductive wellbeing. With scientists predicting an “era
of pandemics” characterized by increased risk of novel infectious disease crises, it is pertinent to consider how
the successive nature of such population health shocks have lasting, interconnected implications for the course
of women's reproductive lives. This is especially important in the context of a developing country where vast
inequalities in economic security, healthcare access, unintended pregnancy, and morbidity and mortality
persist. Currently, little population-based data or research is available on how women's reproductive
trajectories have evolved through different stages of the Covid-19 pandemic anywhere, and in the wake of the
Zika epidemic. To address this, the proposed study will expand upon an existing three-year longitudinal study
(DZC-1), the first-ever panel study on women's reproductive lives in Brazil of any kind, for an additional three
years to generate one of the longest empirical records of reproductive trajectories of a multi-age cohort (ages
18-34 in 2020) of women (DZC-1-2). This data will be collected twice each year for the next three years and
include information on individual and municipality Zika and Covid experiences, reproductive intentions,
behaviors, and outcomes (with questions on monthly contraceptive use history and relationship history), and a
range of potential mediators such as risk perceptions, knowledge about disease transmission, economic
vulnerability, healthcare access, and contraceptive self-efficacy. We will link new waves of data with DZC-1
waves to understand if, and how, the experience of living through successive health shocks produces
immediate, lagged, and compounded effects. We will also merge DZC 1-2 data with municipality and census
tract data (e.g., vaccine availability, Covid-19 case rates and death rates) to address the implications of
contextual Covid-19 conditions on reproductive processes. In addition to creating a 6-year panel, the aims of
this study are to examine how varied individual and contextual Covid-19 experiences across space and time
have influenced women's reproductive lives, including their child's health. We will use panel data methods and
difference-in-difference models for our proposed analyses. We will add nuance to these analyses with in-depth
interviews to understand how women classified as outliers (e.g., unvaccinated (vaccinated) women in low
(high) municipalities) navigated pregnancy during the Covid-19 pandemic."
10801877,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 A role for SWI/SNF complexes in cancer was first suggested when SMARCB1 was identified as
inactivated in virtually all malignant rhabdoid tumor (RT) cases, a highly aggressive pediatric cancer. It is now
clear that mutations in genes encoding subunits of SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes are
frequent, collectively occurring in over 20% of all cancers. Our group established SMARCB1 as a bona fide
and potent tumor suppressor. We later made high-impact discoveries that helped define mechanisms by which
SWI/SNF mutations lead to dysregulated cell proliferation. Our findings suggest a model whereby SWI/SNF-
facilitated control of transcription underlies cellular fate specification, with disruption of this control being the
basis for cancer formation. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the function of SWI/SNF complexes, to
determine how their loss leads to oncogenesis, and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies.
 Based on our findings, we hypothesized that loss of SMARCB1, while driving cancer growth, also
creates unique vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we collaborated with the Pediatric Dependencies
Project to perform a rigorous genome-wide CRISPR deletion screen involving 21 RT cell lines compared to
over 800 other cancer cell lines. Notably, rhabdoid tumors are typically diploid and contain few other mutations,
making them a powerful model with which to study the effects of gene deletions. We have now identified and
validated a novel gene that is specifically essential for rhabdoid cell survival from this screen. Our preliminary
data reveal that this gene's product, previously only linked to gene repression, has unanticipated connections
with SWI/SNF and transcriptional activity. We localize this protein to enhancers and promoters of genes bound
by SWI/SNF and hypothesize that this protein performs a key regulatory role in determining whether activating
SWI/SNF complexes or repressive complexes are recruited, thus serving a pivotal role in dictating cell fate.
 We previously demonstrated that SWI/SNF and another repressive protein, EZH2, serve antagonistic roles
in chromatin regulation, a discovery that ultimately led to FDA approval of an EZH2 inhibitor (EZH2i) for
SMARCB1-mutant cancers. Despite this success, the mechanisms that control the interplay between these
complexes are poorly understood, as are the mechanisms that underlie resistance to EZH2i in SWI/SNF-mutant
cancers. To establish mechanisms driving drug resistance, we have performed a near genome-wide CRISPR
screen in EZH2 inhibitor-treated RTs. We previously identified NSD1 as a gene that, when inactivated, causes
resistance to EZH2i. Here, we plan to investigate the mechanism of resistance conferred by mutations in a
second chromatin regulatory gene not previously associated with SWI/SNF functions. Together, these
experiments have the potential for broad impact including understanding the roles of these critical chromatin
remodeling complexes in transcriptional control, in transformation, and as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities."
10802933,"Optimization of therapeutic mAbs to carbapenem resistant Klebsiella clones
Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) bacteria continue to be the most common gram-
negative multidrug-resistant bacteria in US hospitals. CR-Kp cause predominantly pneumonia, sepsis, and
urinary tract infections and, in military personnel, complicated invasive wound infections as well. Most
patients acquire this pathogen in health care-associated settings. Soldiers are at risk because they
commonly have prolonged stays in hospitals and rehabilitation centers when they recover from injuries they
sustained in combat. The mortality of invasive CR-Kp infections is high despite the introduction of novel
antibiotics. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to the capsule of CR-Kp are protective. One problem is that
most CR-Kp infections are diagnosed late and in patients with multiple comorbidities. One barrier to
generating monoclonal antibodies to the polysaccharide capsule is the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide
capsule. The goal of this application is to continue to optimize lead monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind
to the diverse polysaccharide capsule (CPS) of CR-Kp. We now have a cross-protective monoclonal
antibody that binds to both clade 1 and clade 2 CR-Kp strains. Although the majority of CR-Kp strains belong
to the clonal group CG258 group, there is also another GC307 clone emerging, which expresses a
unique wzi173 capsule type. Based on others and our published experience we propose several strategies
to optimize mAb therapy to combat CR-Kp infections. Three aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we propose to
characterize in vitro and in vivo efficacy of humanized 24D11 (HU-24D11) which will be generated. In Aim
2 we will generate new mAbs that bind to the capsule (wzi173) of ST307. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore
aerosilization as a novel delivery method to use CR-Kp-specific mAbs.

Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SSADHD) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder caused by
ALDH5A1 mutations. ALDH5A1 encodes SSADH essential for the catabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In SSADHD, pathologic accumulation of GABA and metabolite γ-hydroxybutyrate
(GHB) leads to broad spectrum encephalopathy. Paradoxically, despite heightened ambient GABA, patients
with SSADHD are susceptible to seizures and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), highlighting the
significance of compensatory down-regulation of GABA receptors over pathologic GABA build-up. A major
unmet medical need for SSADHD is treatment directly addressing the underlying enzyme deficiency such as
gene restoration therapy. Proof-of-concept aldh5a1 restoration via adeno-associated virus (AAV) increased
survival of SSADH-deficient aldh5a1lox-STOP mice and reversed SSADHD-relevant phenotypes. Furthermore,
restoration of ~15% SSADH in relevant cell types is sufficient for enhanced survival. An AAV encompassing a
human ALDH5A1 full-length native promoter (FLnP) driving a functional recombinant ALDH5A1 gene is a
potential cure for patients with SSADHD. However, it is unclear whether AAV-FLnP-ALDH5A1 drives sufficient
functional SSADH expressions in patient cells, and whether systemic AAV delivery (requiring high AAV dose)
might lead to therapeutically meaningful brain target engagement. We propose to use patient induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons and the SSADH-deficient aldh5a1lox-STOP mouse model to study
efficacy and safety of this novel AAV-FLnP-ALDH5A1 construct. R61 Aim 1: Measure SSADH restoration,
cultured medium GHB content, and functional properties of patient iPSC-derived neurons. Go-no-go: At least
50% SSADH restored, functional phenotype returned to control. R61 Aim 2: Measure SSADH restoration in
brain tissues, GABA receptors, GHB content in blood, electrographic seizures, and survival in SSADH-deficient
aldh5a1lox-STOP mice. Go-no-go: GHB reduced to <15µM, reduced seizures and two-fold lifespan extension.
R33 Aim 3: Utilize dose de-escalation to determine minimal AAV-FLnP-ALDH5A1 (in AAV9 serotype)
threshold for therapeutic effects, and long-term toxicity in SSADH-deficient mice. The project goal is two-fold:
1) Provision of molecular insights into whether AAV-FLnP-ALDH5A1 is a viable clinical candidate for
 SSADH gene therapy. The proposed study provides necessary insights into whether this novel AAV
 construct is sufficient for phenotypic reversal in patient-derived iPSC, and whether this gene expression
 cassette FLnP-ALDH5A1 is effective in various cell types including excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
2) Establishment of practical AAV dosage for therapeutic SSADH gene restoration therapy. The
 proposed study provides necessary insights into minimal threshold for systemic delivery of translatable AAV
 serotype leading to brain-wide coverage and associated phenotypic reversal in SSADH-deficient mice,
 advancing future translational and clinical development of SSADH gene therapy."

Taste-transducing cells detect chemicals in our food and communicate this information to peripheral taste
ganglion neurons (taste neurons), which carry this information to the brain. The axons of taste neurons vary in
branching characteristics, some branching little and others branching a great deal. However, it is unclear how
these differing morphologies underly plasticity and/or function. Our goal here is to clarify the relationship between
taste neuron morphology, plasticity, genetic type, and function in order to gain insight into the peripheral
organization of the taste system. Taste neuron morphology may underlie differences in connectivity, but is also
likely regulated by plasticity. Even in adults, taste receptor cells undergo continuous renewal and must constantly
attract and connect to nerve fibers, and some variation in neuron morphology likely occurs as part of this process.
Additionally, differences between neurons in their branching likely have functional importance. For example,
simply branched neurons can only connect with a few taste-transducing cells, while heavily branched neurons
likely connect to many more taste-transducing cells. Currently, the significance of these differences in
convergence are unclear. In this project, we propose to investigate factors that regulate differences in taste
neuron morphology and branching characteristics between neurons and relate these factors to neuron function.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine which aspects of the axon morphologies of taste neurons are stable and
which change over time. In Aim 2, we will determine which aspects of neuron morphologies are determined by
an intrinsic factor (i.e., cell type) and how this factor correlates with function. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine
which aspects of neuron morphologies are determined by extrinsic (i.e., neurotrophins) developmental factors
and how these features relate to neuron function. We hypothesize that branching inside the taste bud is regulated
by plasticity, while branching outside the taste bud is regulated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
features, which influence taste neuron sensitivity and breadth of tuning."

10808101,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This research program is focused on developing new strategies for the discovery of metalloenzyme
inhibitors. Metalloenzymes are essential to numerous biological processes and are relevant to treating
diseases, including cancer, bacterial/viral infections, hypertension, and others. Despite the prevalence of
metalloenzymes (>40% of all enzymes are metalloenzymes) and their critical role in disease proliferation,
the development of new metalloenzyme inhibitors is extremely underexplored. The PI (Cohen) has
developed a research program that combines the principles of bioinorganic with medicinal chemistry and is
widely recognized as one of the few efforts focused on the challenges of metalloenzyme inhibition.
 Small molecules that inhibit metalloenzymes utilize a metal-binding pharmacophore (MBP) functional
group to bind to the active site metal ion(s) in the target. In the last project period, a focused MBP fragment
library for use in fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) against metalloenzymes was assembled. In this
renewal application, the drug-like features of these MBP fragments will be improved by the application of
isostere replacement. This is expected to yield new chemical matter for identifying metalloenzyme
inhibitors, while accessing a wider range of physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, lipophilicity) in these
scaffolds. These metal-binding isosteres (MBIs) will then be used to improve a class of highly active
inhibitors developed during the last project period against the influenza N-terminal endonuclease domain of
the polymerase acidic protein (PAN). Although active against PAN endonuclease, the poor uptake properties
of these inhibitors have led to suboptimal activity against the virus in cells. MBIs will be used to improve
physicochemical properties, while retaining enzyme-based activity, to produce highly active inhibitors
against the virus in live cells. Finally, to examine the on-target activity and selectivity of metalloenzyme
inhibitors, our MBPs, MBIs, and PAN inhibitors will be examined by Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA)
and affinity chromatography. These experiments will verify target engagement and evaluate how selectivity
improves as the MBP is developed into a full-length PAN endonuclease inhibitor. Detailed cellular target
engagement data using these methods for metalloenzyme inhibitors is scarce; therefore, these studies will
be valuable for clarifying the selectivity, and hence the clinical prospects, of these therapeutic compounds.
 The previous project period generated many collaborations, patent disclosures, conference
proceedings, and ~13 publications. In addition, skilled trainees for the biotechnology workforce were
mentored, and translation of our results into startup companies was achieved. We will continue to nurture
collaborations to discover best- and first-in-class metalloenzyme inhibitors that have the potential to improve
human health. Overall, this research program will continue to play a leading role in identifying small
molecule inhibitors for a challenging target class that has great merit for improving human health."

Chronic exposure to stressful experiences can result in maladaptive affective states that yield behavioral
disturbances in rodents and stress-related mood disorders in humans. Over the last decade, the neural circuits
underlying these maladaptive effects of stress have become better defined. One region of importance is the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which is a major output pathway connecting the central amygdala to the
ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus that also receives direct projections from other limbic areas.
Therefore, BNST may be an integrative center for limbic information and valence monitoring. Psychological and
physiological stressors affect males and females differently. The BNST is a sexually dimorphic structure that
may contribute to distinct chronic stress responses in males and females because expression of aromatase and
both estrogen receptors (ER)  differs in male and female BNST. Direct activation of neurons within the oval
nucleus of the BNST (ovBNST) increases anxiety-associated negative valence behaviors in male rodents, and
our preliminary data demonstrates that exposure of C57BL/6J male mice to chronic variable mild stress (CVMS)
results in increased corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH/CRF) signaling, increased mEPSC amplitude, altered
resting membrane potential, and diminished M-currents in ovBNST neurons. While these data suggest that
ovBNST may be a nexus for the effects of chronic stress on affective states, many questions remain unanswered.
Our overall hypothesis is that CRH-expressing ovBNST neurons are critical mediators of the chronic stress
response and that sexual dimorphism in the BNST underlies the distinct chronic stress responses found in males
and females. The proposed specific aims will directly answer these questions and increase our understanding
of how ovBNST mediates the maladaptive effects of chronic stress. In Aim 1, we will identify the cell populations
that are impacted by chronic stressors (CVMS, chronic nondiscriminatory social defeat stress [CNSDS]) and the
neurophysiological consequences in male and female mice. In Aim 2, we will assess how chronic stress affects
ER signaling in BNST and whether optogenetic modulation of ER-positive BNST neurons mimics and/or
reverses the effects of chronic stress on behavior. In Aim 3, we will determine the necessity and sufficiency of
CRH-signaling in ovBNST neurons in mediating the behavioral effects of CVMS and CNSDS."

Most chronic infections are due to the presence of biofilm, which makes microbes exceptionally recalcitrant to
treatment. In soft tissue infections, such as chronic wounds, even a combination of repeated debridement and
antimicrobial/antibiotic treatment frequently fails to remove the biofilm. Consequently, chronic wound infections
are considered a major global health problem with over 6.5 million people suffering from them each year just in
the U.S. To combat this healthcare challenge, researchers are pursuing the therapeutic use of biofilm dispersal
agents, which if effective can induce microbes to leave the safety of the biofilm, increasing their susceptibility to
conventional antibiotics, antimicrobials and the immune response. However, little is known about the effects of
dispersal on bacteria or the host. In this project we will investigate the risk versus reward of using biofilm dispersal
to treat wound infections. Using a mouse wound model, we will determine the effects of
four
types of dispersal
strategies on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is common cause of wound infections and a model organism for
biofilm studies. We will determine if either active or passive in vivo dispersal strategies induce phenotypic or
transcriptomic changes in P. aeruginosa that could make it more threatening to the host. We will also characterize
the host response after active and passive dispersal of P. aeruginosa from mouse wounds by performing a
temporal analysis of clinical biomarkers, including blood physiological and biochemical indices, cytokines, and
assessing whether dispersed P. aeruginosa enters the bloodstream by inducing vascular damage that leads to
increased vascular permeability. We expect these experiments to reveal the pathophysiological mechanisms of
dispersal-mediated sepsis and shed new light on how P. aeruginosa responds to different types of dispersal
agents. On a basic science level, we will learn more about how biofilm and dispersal relate to infection and how
P. aeruginosa causes bacteremia. This investigation will also provide medically translational information for
therapeutic development, including potential hazards to be expected or overcome by dispersing bacteria in vivo."
10807224,"Women are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than men, making up 2/3 of all AD cases.
Growing evidence suggests that this difference is related to the decline in ovarian hormone levels experienced
by women at midlife through menopause. Women who experience menopause later in life, and thus have a
longer lifespan exposure to ovarian hormones, are less likely to develop AD, suggesting that ovarian hormones
provide some protection against the development of AD pathology.
 Reduced brain metabolism and disruption of intrinsic network connectivity are two early indicators of
the development of AD pathology observable at midlife. As ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen, are
potent regulators of both glucose metabolism and synaptic plasticity, they might provide protection against
hypometabolism and network disruption, which would be removed by menopause. Recent studies provide
support for this view, indicating that postmenopausal women show reduced neural metabolic activity compared
to premenopausal women. Notably, the brain regions showing hypometabolism following menopause,
including multiple central nodes of the default mode network, match the pattern of hypometabolism and
amyloid deposition seen in AD. Similarly, studies from our laboratory and others have indicated that changing
ovarian hormone levels can influence the connectivity of the brain’s intrinsic networks, notably the default
mode network, whose connectivity is compromised in AD and has been previously shown to predict memory
function. However, studies relating menopause to these mechanisms of AD pathology are few, and many rely
on small sample sizes. Additionally, few studies have simultaneously examined the effects of menopause on
metabolism and connectivity, so the combined influence of these factors on AD risk is not well understood.
 While these findings point to a possible mechanism for increased AD risk following menopause, they do
not explain the protective effect observed from prolonged developmental ovarian exposure. Here we propose
that reductions in ovarian hormones over the menopausal transition lead to hypometabolism, promoting AD
pathology and disrupted network connectivity, but greater lifetime exposure to ovarian hormones moderates
these effects. To test this hypothesis, we will longitudinally follow perimenopausal women through the
menopausal transition over a 5 year period, using resting state fMRI and PET to measure changes in intrinsic
network connectivity, brain glucose metabolism, amyloid pathology, and cognitive function. Additionally, we
will collect these same measures in samples of premenopausal and postmenopausal women for comparison.
Each measure will be tested for their relationship to lifetime ovarian exposure to assess how developmental
ovarian hormone exposure influences menopause-related changes in each domain. The results of this
research provide a comprehensive model of the neural effects of menopause on AD and cognition, as well as
shedding light on a developmental factor conferring potential resilience to menopause-related neural changes."
10809391,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
B cells require somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) to develop high affinity,
isotype switched immunoglobulins (Igs). Human patients deficient in these processes suffer from hyper IgM
syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent and severe infections. They have low IgG
levels and are often unable to develop high-affinity antibodies. Both CSR and SHM are initiated by activation-
induced cytidine deaminase (AID) which deaminates cytidines, creating uracils in Ig genes. Uracil is removed
by Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) and repaired in an error-prone fashion to complete SHM and CSR. UNG is
normally associated with high-fidelity base excision repair. The mechanism that directs uracil removal to error-
prone repair during SHM is not understood. However, mis regulation could threaten genome integrity through
inappropriate mutation or suppress SHM and the generation of high-affinity antibodies. To determine if UNG
directly influences repair outcome, we analyzed various mutants of UNG in cell-line, AID induced mutation
reporter assay. We found that UNG with point mutations in the Replication Protein (RPA) binding domain
efficiently supported high-fidelity repair, while suppressing the frequency of mutation. Furthermore ,RPA
mutants unable to interact with UNG also suppressed mutation frequency. Our hypothesis is that UNG-RPA
interaction governs error-prone repair during SHM in B cells. The cell line models available do not completely
recapitulate B cell SHM in terms of frequency and mutational spectrum. Therefore, our objective is to create a
mouse model with a UNG mutant deficient in RPA binding to investigate error-prone repair. We will accomplish
this in Aim 1 by using CRISPR gene editing technology to create a mouse with mutant UNG. In Aim2 this
mouse will be used to define how UNG-RPA interaction in B cells results in SHM. We expect with the
completion of these goals to have a mouse model deficient in normal SHM and a system to mechanistically
investigate how UNG and RPA regulate error-free or mutation repair outcome during base excision repair of
uracils."

ultimate aim of providing the candidate with a multidisciplinary toolkit to study alcohol use disorder and
enhanced mentoring/training skills to relay her expertise to the next generation of mentees interested in alcohol
research. Under the mentorship of Dr. Weiner, the candidate will explore the role of posterior basolateral
amygdala (BLA) inputs to the ventral subiculum (vSub) of the ventral hippocampus in alcohol dependent male
and female rats. Specific Aim 1 of this project will focus on the circuitry and neuroadaptations of pBLA-vSub
circuits using the well-validated chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE) paradigm. Based on preliminary
findings and growing evidence that the pBLA plays a central role in mediating affective behavior and alcohol
drinking-related behaviors, we advance the working hypothesis that CIE initially increases pBLA-vSub
excitability in males but that a disproportionate strengthening of inhibitory elements of this circuitry
initially protects females from this maladaptive change. However, we predict that this protective effect
is either lost or overcome after a longer CIE exposure, leading to similar levels of network excitability
and anxiety-like behavior in both sexes. These experiments will focus on two novel inhibitory pBLA-vSub
projections that we have begun to characterize, including a monosynaptic GABAergic projection from the pBLA
onto vSub glutamatergic neurons. Experiments, using ex vivo optogenetics, and fiber photometry will examine
the integrated functional plasticity of glutamatergic and GABAeregic synapses within these pBLA-vSub circuits.
To further establish the cellular identity and distribution pattern within the BLA of a novel monosynaptic
GABAergic projection neuron population of male and female rats, we will use FISH RNAScope. Additional
chemogenetic experiments will then test whether CIE-dependent pBLA-vSub adaptations of synaptic
communication (hypoexcitability or hyperexcitability) play a causal role in the anxiety-like phenotypes that
emerge during withdrawal from CIE. Together, these findings will significantly advance our understanding of
the neural mechanisms responsible for the negative affective symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal
and potentially shed light on novel neural substrates for the development of better treatments for alcohol use
disorder."

ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
 The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Patient-Oriented Research and Training to Accelerate
Learning, or Penn PORTAL, aims to (1) train Learning Health System (LHS) Scientists with personal,
disciplinary, and institutional diversity; (2) catalyze LHS research by building and connecting data assets
and supporting scientists to complete stakeholder-prioritized projects; and (3) test interventions among
representative patient populations in several priority areas and ensure their equity before implementation
across health systems. The Administrative Core (AC) will deploy specific tactics and structures in support
of each of these aims. First, the AC will be housed within the Palliative and Advanced Illness Research
(PAIR) Center led by MPI Halpern, thus reducing administrative costs by leveraging PAIR’s established
business office and senior staff to provide central administrative support to implement, monitor, and
financially support all PORTAL activities. Second, the AC will build synergies among our Research
Education Core (REC) and Research and Data Analysis Core (RDAC), partnering centers and institutes,
and other entities that bring complementary expertise in all domains relevant to LHS science. Third, the
AC will foster inclusion, diversity, equity, and engagement in all aspects of PORTAL by establishing an
Equity and Community Engagement (ECE) unit within the AC.
 Central to the AC’s effort will be an 11-person Steering Committee comprising the three MPIs (Drs.
Halpern, Lane-Fall, and Delgado), the ECE lead (Dr. Aysola), PORTAL’s program manager, and six other
senior faculty who hold key leadership positions in the medical school and health system. The Steering
Committee will be responsible for executing the first AC aim by setting the overall direction for PORTAL,
issuing requests for proposals from LHS Scientists, and making decisions, with input from the REC Co-
leads and the LHS Design Studio and Operations & Implementation Committee in the RDAC, on which
Scientists and research projects to prioritize. The Steering Committee will also coordinate and set agendas
for our twice-annual meetings with our Internal Advisory Board and External Advisory Board, and oversee
the dissemination of our Scientists’ progress and learnings. The MPIs will leverage their longstanding
tenures and broad connections at Penn to execute the AC’s second aim of building synergies among
Penn’s centers and institutes with complementary expertise relevant to LHS science. Finally, the ECE will
be primarily responsible for executing the AC’s third aim by building on its many years of experience
partnering with local and regional government officials and other Philadelphia health systems and
engaging community representatives from across the City so as to ensure that Penn PORTAL’s work
produces equitable improvements in patient-centered outcomes, is responsive to community needs, and
is scalable across our partnering health systems."
10815361,"ABSTRACT: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The Research Education Core (REC) will facilitate skills development and mentored training experiences for
scientists embedded with one of our nine LHS Innovation Hub health system partners. The REC will be
responsible for preliminary application review for LeaHD scientist positions, conducting candidate interviews,
and administering the LHS Research Core Competency Needs Assessment. The REC will rate applications
and make final selection and recommendations for LeaHD scientist appointments. The REC will match
scientists with academic mentors, health systems partners, and on-site mentors for experiential training. The
REC will use LHS research competency results to identify training gaps and goals, and to suggest training
activities. The REC will oversee development of individualized training plans (IDPs) that clearly define goals,
training activities, and deliverables, and mentoring agreements which define the parameters for the academic
mentor-mentee relationship. It will review IDPs and mentoring plans at the outset of the program and
biannually thereafter. The LeaHD training program will implement a structured training plan with required
elements (e.g., PCORI Methodology Standards curriculum), individualized components, health system
engagement, and evaluation. Over the course of five years, the REC will train 13 embedded scientists (12
supported by AHRQ, one by Brown University). The REC will provide structured and individualized didactic
training opportunities, dedicated professional development funds, travel support, information resources, and
technical support. The scientist stipend will support ~40% time and effort for a junior faculty member or full-
time effort for a postdoctoral fellow for 18 months. Additional funding will be provided to cover research
expenses or extended training as needed. Eligible applicants must have doctoral level or equivalent training
and prior research experience focused on rehabilitation or long term services and support for persons with
disability and/or chronic conditions. Finally, the REC will identify and collaborate with health system partners to
secure additional funding to support and sustain LHS research efforts.
IMPACT: The REC will ensure that LeaHD’s embedded scientist program provides mentored training and
health system engagement to foster long-term, successful careers in LHS research for scientists whose work
focuses on improving care for persons with disability and chronic conditions."

and qualification sections to accelerate the translational application of our liver MPS for specific CoUs. We will
qualify our externally validated, structured, biomimetic liver MPS that recapitulates critical liver structures and
functions with 4 liver cell types mimicking the liver acinus as DDTs. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
liver cells from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center Fatty Liver, Obesity, and Wellness Clinic (UPMC FLOW Clinic) that exhibit heterogeneity based on
genetics, environment, and lifestyle will be used to define the role of patient heterogeneity in drug discovery,
development, and clinical trials. NAFLD patient-derived liver MPS will serve as the disease background for
developing the DDTs since this heterogeneous and progressive disease impacts >25% of the world population.
This is a critical platform to define mechanisms of action (MOA) in the liver MPS in medium throughput to
complement other high throughput, but simpler liver MPS for other CoU applications. We will qualify 4 CoU liver
MPS that can be applied as DDTs including 1) quantifying hepatic clearance and identifying major metabolites;
2) quantifying liver toxicity; 3) drug testing for safety and efficacy; and 4) selecting clinical trial cohorts.
Collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will yield materials including cells, media, and
reagents critical for the qualification of the DDTs. Through a collaborative effort with Nortis Inc. and BioSystics,
Inc., we will implement a medium throughput, high content and automated platform called the Automated
Biomimetic Analytic MPS (ABAMPS) platform. The ABAMPS platform will deliver a more efficient and accurate
use of structured, biomimetic MPS for MOA studies that will result in commercially available, FDA qualified DDTs."

Dr. Anand Rohatgi is a Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Cardiology at UT
Southwestern Medical Center. He has established a successful and independent research program focused
on elucidating the role of HDL metabolism in cardiovascular disease. His experiences as an active clinical
cardiologist, translational researcher, and mentor have positioned him to be an ideal candidate for renewal of
the K24 Mentoring Career Development Award. His clinical focus on preventive cardiology, especially in the
South Asian population, have paved the way for a synergistic translational research program focused on HDL
metabolism and atherosclerotic CV disease and a passion for mentoring trainees and faculty. Dr. Rohatgi has
applied both epidemiologic and translational POR to this objective, resulting in a number of published
observations that have moved the field forward with respect to insights into pathophysiology and refinement of
HDL-related markers for risk prediction and as targets of therapy. This work has been supported by continuous
funding from the NIH/NHLBI (K08>R01>R01), the AHA, and industry. During the K24 funding period, he has
mentored 25 trainees (some ongoing), resulting in 8 first-author papers, multiple meeting presentations, two
AHA Post-Doctoral Fellowship Awards, a tenure-track faculty position, and several K and R submissions.
Overall, sixteen of Dr. Rohatgi's total mentees are women. In addition, during the K24 funding period, Dr.
Rohatgi launched a new South Asian Heart Clinic, began a pilot prospective POR study in this population, and

and cardiometabolic phenotypes in South Asians."
11141960,"ABSTRACT - Overall
The overall goal of the University of Washington Translational center for kidney microphysiological
systems to improve drug safety and efficacy is to expand upon kidney tissue chip developmental work
our team has accomplished over the past decade, in order to qualify these microphysiological systems as
drug development tools for specific Contexts of Use. Despite marked recent advances in our understanding
of the physiology and pathophysiology of the human kidney in health and in disease, there are relatively few
drugs that are proven to be safe and effective therapies for kidney diseases. Historically, the structural,
functional and physiological complexity of the kidney has contributed significantly to the high rate of failures
in therapeutic drug development. The complex multicellular architecture and unusual triad of physiological
processes characterized by glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption, have limited the
ability of animal models to recapitulate the diversity of etiologies, mechanisms, and heterogeneous clinical
manifestations of most human kidney diseases. The limitations resulting from extrapolating animal model
data to human kidney diseases constitutes a major barrier to developing new therapies. Until recently there
has been a lack of human in vitro models that recapitulate critical aspects of kidney function or assess
reparative mechanisms in response to injury. This is in part because microfluidic flow is so essential to kidney
structure and cellular function. In response to this critical unmet need, our group has pioneered the
development of ‘human kidney-on-a-chip’ microphysiological systems. Our in vitro on chip models
recapitulate critical aspects of kidney physiology, assess the mechanisms and response to injury, and can
test reparative mechanisms, all of which can substantially enhance successful drug development that is
needed to improve the lives of people living with kidney diseases"

The overarching objective of the Administrative Section is to facilitate and manage the successful
interdisciplinary team science required to move kidney MPS platforms through to regulatory
qualification as drug development tools (DDT). This will be accomplished by fostering communication,
collaboration, integration and coordination among the components of the Translational Center including
Project Staff, the Internal Executive Committee, the External Advisory Committee, and the MPS Resources
and MPS Qualification Sections. The Administrative Section will also manage communication with NIH, FDA,
and industry partners to achieve these goals. This will require a high level of scientific expertise, and a
corresponding focus on scientific rigor and data reproducibility in order to allow DDTs to support specific
kidney disease related context of use cases. As a key component of this translational center, the
Administrative Section will have primary responsibility for coordinating the operations, establishing necessary
working groups and relationships with external partnerships. The Administrative Section will additionally
provide project management, budgeting, and fiscal management for all Translational Center activities. The
Administrative Section will be responsible for overall day-to-day center operations, research, and community
outreach activities, including information dissemination and data sharing with the Microphysiological Systems
Database (BioSystics). The Administrative Section, in conjunction with the Center’s directors and

10816295,"ABSTRACT - MPS Resources Section
Predicting the safety and efficacy of candidate therapeutics, including their mechanisms of action and likelihood
of success in patients, requires fundamentally new strategies, assays, and models of the kidney that better
replicate human pathophysiology. Recently, human cellular models in vitro have emerged that can recapitulate
critical aspects of kidney physiology, mimic the unique complexities of specific nephron segments, model disease
heterogeneity, and assess injury-repair mechanisms, with great potential to accelerate and enable therapy
development. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a powerful source for such models, as they are self-
renewing (immortal), can change into diverse cell types, and are amenable to gene editing.
Human models endogenously express species-specific target genes and have unique advantages for
mechanistic analysis and throughput. The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 “allows an applicant for market approval
for a new drug to use methods other than animal testing to establish the drug's safety and effectiveness.”
However, the complexity and limited availability of human microphysiological models, their lack of
standardization, and questions regarding their appropriateness and clinically-relevant interpretation, need to be
addressed in order for these to be brought into widespread use. Qualification of these systems as drug
development tools will be helpful for achieving this and enabling use to provide clinical guidance.
To bridge this gap, the overarching goal of the Kidney MPS Resources Section is, in collaboration with
commercial partners to manufacture and share qualification-grade kidney-on-chip platforms for two innovative
human cellular models: the proximal tubule kidney chip microphysiological system (PTEC-MPS), and the human
kidney organoid-on-chip. These two systems are complementary, enabling (respectively) apical and basolateral
tubular perfusion and heterocellular modeling of genetic disease. Each model will be improved to produce more
biomimetic qualities. We will further cross-translate these two cellular models by constructing PTEC-MPS using
organoid-derived tubular epithelial cells for the first time.
We will achieve these goals with two complementary Specific Aims: (1) Establish reference standard kidney
MPS by detailing operating procedures, quality controls, validation datasets, and longevity characteristics. (2)
Iteratively optimize kidney MPS to incorporate features relevant for qualification. These Aims will establish
rigorous kidney chips appropriate for qualification by regulatory agencies and advance their transfer from
academic laboratories to commercial industry. Each Aim will be accompanied by specific Milestones that track
the major steps necessary to accomplish this bench-to-business effort."
10816296,"ABSTRACT – MPS Qualification Section
The failure rate for drugs entering clinical study between phase I/II and FDA submission approaches 90% with
40-50% of those failures attributed to lack of efficacy, 30% to unmanageable toxicity, and 10-15% to poor drug-
like properties (unfavorable pharmacokinetics). With an estimated expenditure of $1.3 billion (USD) to move a
therapeutic candidate from early drug discovery through Phase I trials, development of rigorous and
reproducible tools that can better predict compound liabilities and clinical characteristics are critical to improve
drug safety and efficacy.
In response to the critical unmet need for better preclinical models, our interdisciplinary team has pioneered
the development of the proximal tubule epithelial cell microphysiological system (PTEC-MPS) and the kidney
organoid. Once qualified these platforms can, with specific biomarkers as drug development tools, address the
three major causes of drug attrition during drug development. We believe that these technologies are robust
and reproducible, and within specific contexts of use, can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and
application during drug development and regulatory review. We have proposed the following contexts of use
(COUs) for our technologies:
1. To demonstrate the utility of a PTEC-MPS device to reliably identify proximal tubule toxicity, as exhibited by
toxicity biomarkers KIM-1, HO-1, microRNA, and RNAseq, from drugs cleared by filtration (polymyxin B,
cisplatin) with reproducibility between freshly isolated PTECs and cryopreserved cells after 3 and 6 months of
storage.
2. To demonstrate the utility of a PTEC-MPS device to reliably identify proximal tubule toxicity, as exhibited by
toxicity biomarkers KIM-1, HO-1, microRNA, and RNAseq, from drugs cleared by tubular secretion (tenofovir,
drisapersen) with reproducibility between freshly isolated PTECs and cryopreserved cells after 3 and 6 months
of storage.
3. To demonstrate the ability of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model populated with PTEC-
MPS derived renal clearance parameters to predict maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and total drug
exposure (AUC) of filtered and secreted drugs (e.g., tenofovir, furosemide) in healthy subjects and subjects
with impaired kidney function.
4. To measure therapeutic efficacy for hereditary disorders in MPS by quantifying the effect of pharmacological
interventions on kidney disease phenotypes in genetic organoid models using biomarkers for two distinct
disease states: polycystic kidney disease and nephropathic cystinosis. The models will be rigorously quantified
to demonstrate reproducibility and batch-to-batch consistency in isogenic human kidney organoids with
disease-causative mutations, compared to isogenic control organoids. Correspondence between datasets of
organoid biomarkers vs. clinical biomarkers will be calculated to establish a correlative formula. Using
therapeutics with known clinical effects, dose-dependent rescue of organoid biomarker phenotypes will be
quantified and compared to human clinical data.
Successful completion of these aims will enable qualification of these technologies as drug development tools
and integrate PTEC-MPS/organoids and derived biomarkers/pharmacokinetic parameters to increase
translation, efficacy, and safety of candidate therapeutics."

This is a multi-PI, multi-institutional grant to develop physiomimetic systems that mimic human testis
development and spermatogenic lineage development, ex vivo. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for
cancer or gender affirming treatments for transgender patients can cause infertility. Adult patients have the
option to cryopreserve eggs or sperm prior to treatment that can be thawed in the future and used to achieve
pregnancy with standard assisted reproductive technologies, including IVF. Those options are not available to
all adult patients or to prepubertal patients who are not able to produce mature eggs or sperm. Although
prepubertal boys or transgender girls who are on gender affirming treatments are not producing sperm, they do
have spermatogonial stem cells SSCs in their testes that have the potential to produce sperm. The MPIs in
Chicago and Pittsburgh have been cryopreserving immature testicular tissues for young patients for more than
a decade with anticipation that those tissues can be thawed in the future and matured to produce sperm. Each
patient donates a portion of their tissue to research to develop next generation technologies that will allow
them to use their tissues for reproduction. We will use those tissues to gain fundamental insights into human
testis development from newborn to adult stages of life. This will establish benchmarks to evaluate our
progress engineering three novel testis physiomimetic systems that support spermatogenesis, ex vivo. Aim 1
will replicate mouse testicular tissue organotypic culture at the air/liquid interface using a microfluidics device
and a static PDMS roof-transwell system before translating the approach to human testis tissues. Aim 2 will
establish mouse and human testicular organoids, which will then be induced to fuse into elongated
seminiferous tubule-like structures. Aim 3 will print seminiferous tubule like scaffolds using human testis
extracellular matrix (htECM) and pig testis ECM (ptECM) hydrogels as bioink and then seed the scaffolds with
mouse and human testicular somatic cells and germ cells. These testicular physiomimetic systems will provide
fundamental insights into human testicular somatic cell and germ cell development and establish experimental
platforms to test toxicologic or pharmaceutical compounds or drugs that promote or prevent sperm production.
The overarching objective is to mature human testicular tissues in one or more of these physiomimetic systems
to produce fertilization competent sperm, ex vivo."

Innovation, 2) the diversification of leadership with actionable plans to promote diversity, equity and inclusion
(DEI) in device development, and 3) the expansion of real-world evidence (RWE) consulting and education
through a collaborative PDC Service Center as well as a new partnership with a leading RWE firm, Aetion.
Two seasoned device innovators, Hanmin Lee, MD (Pediatric Surgeon and Surgeon in Chief at UCSF Benioff
Children’s Hospitals) and James Wall, MD (Pediatric Surgeon and Biodesign Lead, Stanford University) will lead
the PDC team consisting of device experts with clinical, technical, regulatory, and other relevant expertise. They
will be supported by senior medtech industry professionals, multidisciplinary advisory committees, and multiple
institutional stakeholders (UCSF-Stanford Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation, clinical
trials offices, and DEI Council),to catalyze promising pediatric device innovations to viable commercial products.
Through committed leadership, collective efforts, great resources, and the unique expertise gained from previous
grant cycles, the UCSF-Stanford PDC will be able to achieve the objectives detailed in the proposal to accelerate
many high-impact, value-based pediatric device solutions to commercialization and patient impact. The UCSF-
Stanford PDC will continue to play a leadership role, along with other PDCs, in creating a national network and
ecosystem to foster pediatric device innovations."

ESKAPE pathogens are a leading cause of drug resistant infections and the need to identify new antibacterial
strategies is critical. Iron is an essential micronutrient for survival and virulence that microbial pathogens which
actively sequesters iron away from microorganisms. Pathogens overcome this iron limitation through a variety
of mechanisms, including the synthesis and secretion of siderophores that scavenge ferric (Fe3+) iron, the
uptake of ferrous (Fe2+) iron via Feo or NRAMP-like systems, and acquisition of iron from host heme. iron
acquisition and homeostasis by microbial pathogens is multifactorial and dependent on sophisticated
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks. We have recently shown the PhuS cytoplasmic
heme binding protein has a dual function in regulating heme flux through HemO, and in the transcriptional
regulation of the iron and heme regulated sRNA’s PrrF and PrrH. The PrrF sRNAs bind to complementary
sequences of their target RNAs causing the RNAseE and Hfq-dependent mRNA degradation of genes involved
in iron-storage and oxidative stress, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, including iron containing proteins of
the TCA cycle, as well as several virulence factors. Therefore, regulation of the heme flux through HemO is a
critical link between heme metabolism and the iron-dependent sRNA regulatory network required for
adaptation and virulence within the host. The goal of the proposal is to understand at a molecular level how
heme acquisition is integrated into these regulatory networks. Specifically, we will; i) determine the PhuS
structural motifs required for heme transfer and binding to the prrF1 promoter (PprrF1), ii) define the in vivo
effects of PhuS variants on PrrF/H sRNAs and the downstream regulon. and iii) determine evolutionary
conservation and function of PhuS homologs across enteric pathogens. On completion of the studies we will
have determined the role of extracellular heme metabolism in the iron-dependent regulatory networks of three
significant human pathogens, providing a platform for the identification of antibacterial strategies at the
interface between of iron homeostasis and virulence."

 Non-melanoma skin cancer, the most common US tumor, encompasses basal cell (BCC) and
squamous cell (SCC) carcinomas, and leads to extensive morbidity and mortality. ARO46786 now in
its 20th year, has focused on BCC-to-SCC transition (BST) a common but understudied resistance
mechanism that represents a significant challenge to therapy and poorer outcomes. We propose five
major BST Keratocarcinoma (KC) cell states and show that combinatorial AP-1 and SRF co-factor
interactions provide the transcriptional switch from HH sensitivity to RAS-MAPK dependence and that
c-FOS-driven BST appears reversible. By contrast, interrogation of stromal heterogeneity identified a
skin cancer-associated macrophage (SCAM) required for BCC growth in allografts and organoids.
SCAMs are self-propagating, transplantable, and long-lived in the BCC tumor environment. Tumor-
associated macrophages have been shown to have proliferative and anti-immune checkpoint activity
highlighting the gap in knowledge about the skin microenvironment. These preliminary studies support
our overarching hypothesis that BST and SCAMs mediate BCC tumor evolution and resistance. To
further test this hypothesis, ARO46786 will: Elucidate the drivers and sensitivities of BST by refining
the KC chromatin and tumor dependency map and elucidating the mechanism of the reversible BST
transcription factor switch; and elucidate the origin and function of SCAMs in BCC growth by

P-glycoprotein pumps drugs, xenobiotics and nutrients out of cells via a partially characterized
ATP-dependent mechanism. Due to the extreme substrate promiscuity of P-gp, it contributes to
the disposition of nearly all small molecule drugs and to drug-drug interactions. P-gp may be
particularly important in cancer cell drug resistance due to its over expression in several
cancers. The aims of this proposal are to fill knowledge gaps in three distinct aspects of P-gp
mechanism. Each aim shares the common mechanistic element of conformational dynamics.
The first aim is to define the P-gp conformations at low ATP occupancy in order to understand
how they control downstream conformational changes that are essential for substrate efflux, and
how they are different in the presence vs. the absence of substrates. These conformational
differences are hypothesized to be essential for minimizing wasteful expenditure of ATP in the
absence of transportable substrate and to control proper conformational access in downstream
steps. These differences will be identified by rapid, pre-equilibrium, kinetic methods with state-
of-the-art kinetic modeling and Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (H/DX) with
P-gp in lipid nanodiscs.
The second aim is to understand the extreme sensitivity of P-gp to its lipid environment. The
lipid nanodisc platform provides fine control of the lipid bilayer in which P-gp resides. P-gp will
be incorporated in nanodiscs with varying ratios of lipids with different head groups or acyl
chains that provide different surface charge of bilayer fluidity. The basal- and substrate
dependent ATPase activity in the different lipid environments will be correlated with changes in
conformation determined by H/DX.
The third aim is to determine the mechanism by which P-gp is able to interact with such a wide
range of substrates and inhibitors. Substrate promiscuity is an increasingly appreciated behavior
for many proteins throughout biology but the molecular basis is poorly defined. Here, pre
equilibrium binding kinetics and single molecule fluorescence methods will be used to compare
the distribution of binding parameters in P- gp ensembles vs. single P-gp nanodiscs in order to
determine whether P-gp exploits interconverting conformations or persistent distinct
conformations to recruit and retain drugs of varying structure."

The KEEP: Kentucky Environmental Education Pipeline will create a paid immersive undergraduate
environmental health focused summer research experience that targets enrollment by URM and economically
disadvantaged students. Nearly 60% of students who enter college with the goal of majoring in a STEM field end
up graduating in a non-STEM field or leaving without a degree. This attrition is especially severe in students from
underrepresented and historically marginalized communities. Among the major reasons for such a high dropout
from STEM programs are limited career counseling, limited institutional support, and an academic culture that is
unwelcoming or outright hostile to unique circumstances and lived experiences. The KEEP program will facilitate
the development of student identity as scientists, create lasting support structures, and connect student research
to local communities. The KEEP program will focus on the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: Create and administer a 10-week on-site summer undergraduate research program for UofL
students in the broad field of environmental health sciences. The KEEP program includes mentored research as
well as a community led environmental sampling bootcamp (all mentors also invited), weekly instruction in
biostatistics concepts and methodologies, and dissemination via undergraduate research day participation as
well as Posters-At-The-Capital and regional Ohio Valley Society of Toxicology meeting participation.
 Aim 2: Enrich undergraduate student development through continuing academic and career
mentoring, professional development activities (ex: resume building and personal statement construction),
exposure to a broad variety of environmental health research seminars, and weekly cohort building activities.
 Aim 3: Evaluation of student outcomes including recruitment, participation, satisfaction, and tracking
of academic progress toward matriculation. We will utilize existing infrastructure associated with the UofL CIEHS
and Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities as well as the UofL Cards Analytics office."

 Influenza B viruses (IBV) cause annual epidemics with appreciable morbidity and mortality, but have been
understudied compared to influenza A viruses (IAV). Currently available vaccines for IBV and IAV are sub-
optimal and must be updated frequently due to the emergence of novel antigenic variants. To date, efforts to
develop broadly protective, potentially ‘universal’ vaccines have almost exclusively focused on IAV. RFA-AI-20-
003 therefore calls for the “development and/or characterization of IBV vaccine components that
complement existing lead IAV vaccine candidates”. In Aim 1 (R21 phase), we plan to develop broadly reactive
influenza B candidate vaccine viruses. Using mutagenesis approaches, we have already generated mutant
IBV hemagglutinins (HA, the major viral antigen) whose antigenic properties are in-between those of the two
major lineages of IBV. Thus, these antigens may elicit immune responses that confer protection against viruses
of both IBV lineages. Here, we plan to develop additional IBV HA mutants with potentially higher cross-reactivity
than that of our current candidates. In addition, we will establish an antigenic map for IBV HA to analyze the
antigenic properties of IBV HAs (antigenic maps are now widely used for IAV HAs, but have not been developed
for IBV HA). In Aim 2 (R33 phase), we will assess the immunogenicity of influenza B candidate vaccine
viruses. Briefly, the top 5 candidates from Aim 1 will be used to immunize ferrets. Immunization will be carried
out with adjuvanted, secreted IBV HA (sHA) mutants (thus eliminating the contribution of other IBV proteins to
immune responses), or with adjuvanted IBV HA presented on nanoparticles composed of a self-assembling
phage protein (generated by Dr. R. Kane, Georgia Tech). The sera from vaccinated ferrets will be tested for
reactivity with IBV HA antigens, and these data will be integrated into the antigenic map. Using an established
phage display approach, Dr. S. Khurana (Federal Drug Administration) will identify the epitopes targeted by the
antibodies elicited by our HA mutants. This analysis will allow us to identify antigens that elicit broadly reactive
antibodies that target conserved epitopes. Immunology studies will be carried out by Dr. P. Thomas, St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital. On the basis of the data obtained in Aim 2, the top 2 IBV HA immunogens will be
used to assess the protective efficacy of influenza B candidate vaccine viruses (Aim 3, R33 phase). Ferrets
will be immunized as established in Aim 2 and challenged with IBVs representing both current lineages and an
ancestral virus (isolated before the separation of the lineages). Virus titers and immune responses will be
compared with those of control animals. We expect that a single immunization with the IBV HA mutants will elicit
more broadly protective immunity than a single immunization with wild-type IBV HA. In summary, upon
completion of both phases, we expect to have developed a novel strategy for the design of broadly protective
IBV vaccines, and to have demonstrated their broadly protective efficacy in ferrets."
10818862,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Wolbachia pipientis is an obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacterium that infects 40-60% of insect species on
the planet. Wolbachia infection inhibits RNA virus replication in insects, a phenomenon known as pathogen
blocking. Therefore, Wolbachia infected mosquitos are being released in many parts of the world to control the
spread of human diseases. Importantly, although the mechanism behind Wolbachia’s virus inhibition is not
known, Wolbachia must colonize the host and be efficiently maternally transmitted in order for pathogen
blocking to work. Our long-term goals are to identify the mechanisms used by Wolbachia to establish infection.
To that end, we focus on the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a molecular nanomachine used by Wolbachia to
inject proteins, termed effectors, into the host cellular environment. Via these secreted effectors, the host cell is
modified, allowing Wolbachia to invade and persist.
Our previous work identified and characterized the first secreted effector in Wolbachia (WalE1) and established
that this effector disrupts host endocytosis. We developed a live assay for visualizing Wolbachia infection and
showed that the actin cytoskeleton must be intact for this to occur. We identified important Wolbachia effectors
upregulated during infection using proteomics and show that the T4SS is upregulated upon host internalization.
In this proposed renewal, we will continue or work to identify the Wolbachia secretome across strains, within
both Drosophila and Aedes, and identify pathways important for Wolbachia infection of both host species. We
will also further identify how the important effector WalE1 functions across strains and determine the
conservation and function of important domains for this protein. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose
to pursue three Specific Aims to identify and characterize Wolbachia effectors, host pathways important for
infection by the microbe, and WalE1 function. We will (1) Determine and characterize the Wolbachia
secretome, across strains, (2) Identify host pathways important for colonization of hosts by different
Wolbachia strains, and (3) Characterize the molecular biology and evolution of Wolbachia’s WalE1.
Studies of Wolbachia - host interactions are still in their infancy despite the recognized contributions of
endosymbiotic associations to insect reproduction and evolution, and the ability to alter vector competence.
These proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of how Wolbachia employs its effectors to
establish infection, a necessary prerequisite to pathogen blocking."

Brain tuberculosis (TB), the most severe form of tuberculosis, is associated with a complex inflammatory
response, tissue damage and cerebral edema. Typically, management of fluid, waste, and immune-
surveillance in the periphery is performed by tissue infiltrating lymphoid vessels. While the brain parenchyma
does not have lymphoid vessels, recent research has identified that brain fluids (cerebrospinal fluid and
interstitial fluid) are collected by meningeal and cribriform lymphoid vessels surrounding the brain, which are
crucial for waste clearance and tissue homeostasis in the CNS. It has been shown that inhibition of lymphatic
transport accelerates disease pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury,
and Parkinson’s disease, but little is known about the potential modulatory role of lymphoid vessels in CNS
tuberculosis. Recently we reported that autoimmune inflammation induces lymphangiogenesis at the cribriform
plate through the production of VEGFC from inflammatory dendritic cells. Functionally, the induction of new
lymphoid vessels upregulates immunoregulatory molecules, and blocking new lymphoid vessel formation has
consequences in regulating the severity of the autoimmune disease. In this proposal, we will test how CNS
tuberculosis affects meningeal and cribriform lymphoid vessels formation and consequently, their fluid and cell
draining function (Aim 1) To understand the impacts on immune-surveillance, we will study how
CNS mycobacterial tuberculosis (Mtb) infection alters the expression of immune regulatory molecules on
draining lymphoid vessels and how these lymphoid vessels modify brain-derived dendritic cells and their ability
to influence downstream T cell priming in the lymph node (Aim 2). Lastly, we will use agents that block or
promote lymphangiogenesis to test how brain inflammation, bacterial load, dissemination, and anti-bacterial
immunity are affected by alterations of brain drainage with the hope of decreasing CNSTB associated
pathologies (Aim 3). CNS tuberculosis is one of the most common bacterial infections of the brain with high
mortality with a pressing need for new therapies, and these studies will lead to novel therapeutic strategies in
CNSTB.
The objectives of this proposal are (1) to test whether infiltrating or resident immune cells produce VEGFC
that contributes to cribriform plate-associated, dorsal meningeal, or basal meningeal lymphangiogenesis during
central nervous system tuberculosis (CNSTB) (Aim 1); to define cellular and bacterial interaction between Mtb-
infected dendritic cells, Mtb, and lymphoid endothelial cells (LECs) (Aim 2); and to understand the translational
value of lymphangiogenesis regulators on CNSTB pathogenesis, bacterial control, anti-bacterial responses,
and bacterial dissemination (Aim 3).
These studies will lead to a new aspect of brain TB pathology and reveal novel information comparing
lymphatic vessel responses and brain drainage in different brain inflammations. These studies' long-
term objective is to define how the lymphatic system represents a novel target in combating CNSTB."

Loss of neuromuscular function and regenerative capacity is a hallmark of aging; however, the cause of this age-
related decline and the molecular pathways underlying this process remain unknown and no clinical intervention
successfully arrests age-related neuromuscular dysfunction.
 The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop an effective stem cell-mediated therapy to ameliorate
age-related deterioration of neuromuscular function. Our previously published findings show that transplantation
of our unique adult multipotent muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (MDSPCs) from young mice promotes
functional peripheral nerve regeneration in mice with a sciatic nerve defect, delays the onset of aging-related
diseases, and triples the lifespan in mouse models of progeria. In addition, induced neovascularization in the
muscles and brain—where no transplanted cells were detected—strongly suggests a therapeutic
paracrine/endocrine mechanism. Most importantly, our recent preliminary results indicate that systemic
transplantation of young MDSPCs into naturally aged mice restores peripheral nerve histology and myelination,
increases skeletal muscle weight and fiber cross-sectional area, decreases muscle fibrosis, and improves
functional mobility and gait. These novel findings strongly suggest that young MDSPCs can modulate the
systemic environment of aged animals through secreted rejuvenating factors that activate or inhibit key molecular
signaling pathways critical for tissue regeneration. Thus, we hypothesize that young stem cells—or the
therapeutic factors they secrete—can be used to treat chronic aging-related neuromuscular impairments.
 In Aim 1, we will determine to what extent systemic treatment with young MDSPCs can rejuvenate
neuromuscular tissue structure and motor function in naturally aged mice by using clinically relevant techniques
such as real-time Resonant Reflection Spectroscopy (RRS), muscle contractile force measurement, nerve
conduction testing, and longitudinal motor function testing of mobility, gait, and muscle fatigue. In Aim 2, we will
identify the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of neuromuscular functional improvements resulting from
transplantation of young MDSPCs, using multiplexing-tandem mass spectrometry and [phosphoproteomics], as
well as identify proteins circulating in the blood serum involved in this systemic rejuvenation. Aim 3 will uncover
key factors secreted by young MDSPCs that drive neuromuscular tissue rejuvenation and improve function using
a quantitative multiplex antibody array system.
 Together, these aims will uncover the mechanisms of young MDSPC-mediated neuromuscular tissue
rejuvenation and functional improvements, identify circulating biomarkers that predict neuromuscular health in
aged mammals, and facilitate the discovery of novel stem cell–based therapeutic targets for clinical use."
10821405,"TITLE: Cellular mechanisms of Mac-1 mediated atheroprotection
ABSTRACT
Introduction: This proposal outlines a five-year training program to support my transition into an independent
pharmacist-scientist, while studying the role of the Mac-1 integrin (CD11b/CD18) in atherosclerosis
development and complications. Candidate: I completed a Doctor of Pharmacy degree with honors at
Creighton University prior to beginning a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Miami in May of 2016.
During my postdoctoral training, I expanded my expertise to basic and clinical vascular research, publishing 14
manuscripts and three more under review during this period. I was recently promoted to Research Assistant
Professor in the Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. Career
development plan: My mentors and I have put together a plan that builds upon my previous training to acquire
a diverse set of technical and leadership skills that will enhance my trajectory toward becoming an independent
investigator. These include microsurgery, mass cytometry, bone marrow transplantation, and grantsmanship
courses. Mentoring committee: I will work with a multidisciplinary team of experts (vascular surgery, vascular
biology, immunology, and integrin biology) who will provide mentorship and advice during my transition to
independence. My mentors and advisors are recognized investigators in their respective fields with an
excellent record of funding, publications, and mentorship. We have agreed that I will publish as senior author
since the beginning of my K08 training to speed up my transition to independence. Environment/Institutional
support: I have the full commitment of my department, which will ensure laboratory and office space, 95%
protected time for research, support personnel, and full access to equipment and shared resources. Research
plan: My overall scientific goal is to find better therapies for atherosclerosis and to potentially help regress
established plaques. My central hypothesis is that Mac-1 activation decreases atherosclerotic burden by
reducing monocyte infiltration and promoting a pro-resolving macrophage phenotype through inhibition of the
IL-13 receptor. This hypothesis is built upon strong preliminary data using a pharmacological Mac-1 agonist
and a novel knock-in model of Mac-1 activation, with both approaches supporting an atheroprotective role for
the Mac-1 receptor. I will test my hypothesis in three specific aims that will determine if Mac-1: 1) controls
atherogenesis and monocyte recruitment in early disease, 2) modulates macrophage differentiation in plaques,
and 3) promotes inflammation resolution and efflux of macrophages in existing lesions. Expected outcomes: I
have the necessary research tools and resources to complete my research plan as outlined in the proposal. I
expect to publish at least three top-quality manuscripts during the first three years of my training. I plan to apply
for my first R01 in year four and to become a fully funded investigator by the end of the K08’s five-year training
period."

Type 3 lymphocytes include group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3),
IL-17-producing γδ T cells (Tγδ17), and
T
helper 17
(
TH17) cells and are crucial for maintaining mucosal barrier defenses against extracellular bacteria
and fungi. Nonetheless, dysregulated type 3 lymphocyte responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of several autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
ILC3,
Tγδ17, and
TH17 cells are defined by their shared expression of the lineage-defining transcription factor
RORγt (Rorc(t)), which facilitates key inductive events during the development and differentiation of these cell
types towards the type 3 lymphocyte lineage. The trans-acting factor networks that cooperatively regulate the
formation of the type 3 lymphocyte cell types have been well characterized, however, the cis-regulatory
elements (CREs) that control the development and differentiation of type 3 lymphocytes remain less defined
Therefore, we are proposing a comprehensive assessment of the CREs controlling the expression of the
Rorc(t) locus across the type 3 lymphocyte lineage
cell types. To this end, we will
(i) identify the CREs
governing Rorc(t) expression using a high-throughput CRISPRi knockdown screen; (ii)
evaluate the activity of
Rorc(t) CREs using a retroviral massively parallel STARR-seq reporter assay; (iii) and determine the functional
role of putative CREs for the expression of Rorc(t)
in the
ILC3,
Tγδ17, and
TH17
cell types.
Altogether, the
experiments outlined in this proposal will expand our understanding of the cis-regulatory mechanisms
governing type 3 lymphocyte development and identity."
10814770,"Patients living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer as a result of treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART),
either single agent or combined therapy (cART). Though the general outcomes of suppressing HIV is a plus, the
prevalence of oral and systemic health problems in this population cannot be overemphasized nor ignored. The
goal of this research is to address gaps in our knowledge of the oral health status of patients living with HIV
(PLWH) who also have non communicable diseases (NCDs) in order to explore the combined effects of HIV,
ART, and aging-related NCDs on the extent and progression of oral/dental conditions (e.g. caries, periodontal
diseases, salivary gland dysfunction, and oral cavity coinfections). We will be employing an interdisciplinary
approach to leverage expertise from both dental and medical professionals, representing a valuable opportunity
to bridge the gap between oral-systemic diseases amongst PLWH. Our preliminary data showed a high caries
and periodontal disease prevalence among PLWH on ART (both > 80%), as well as findings of “metabolic
complications” such as cardiovascular disease (48.5%), hyperlipidemia (33.2%) and diabetes (14.9%) in this
population, which makes our population an ideal cohort for a prospective and well-designed study.
 The central hypothesis is that the extent and progression of key oral diseases (e.g. caries, periodontal
diseases and oral cavity coinfections), is associated with ART induced salivary changes (e.g. xerostomia, change
in saliva composition); and are exacerbated in PLWH (>1 year ART) with NCDs, compared to PLWH without
NCDs. We will also prospectively investigate the range of metabolic abnormalities observed in PLWH on ART
and explore the hypothesis that poor oral health and salivary dysfunction, concurrent with these metabolic
abnormalities, play a critical role in both supporting and driving chronic immune activation and inflammation in
HIV infection.
 By 2020, it is expected that >30 million people living with HIV will have access to ART. Progress towards
improving outcomes for these individuals will depend on the identification of novel strategies for the prevention
and treatment of these non-AIDS- associated comorbidities. This is important in order to better understand if
infection with HIV or the exposure and extended use of ART affects the prevalence and severity of these oral
diseases. In addition, there is an unmet need to investigate strategies to control host-immune cART response
associated with oral and systemic co-infections, and comorbidities or mediators among PLWH. These efforts
could help to generate evidence for oral health treatment guidelines tailored to the needs of dental patients with
HIV."

Obesity and its metabolic sequelae are rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, leading to high
morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancer. Under the current
pandemic, obesity has been recognized as a key risk factor for severe COVID-19. Central to these pathologies
is adipose tissue. There are functionally distinct types of adipose tissue. White adipose tissue is the primary
site of the triglyceride storehouse. In contrast, thermogenic fat, which consists of classical brown adipose
tissue (BAT) and inducible beige/brite adipocytes, concentrates on thermogenic energy expenditure. It has
been recently reported that people with BAT have a significantly lower prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases,
highlighting the metabolic benefits and therapeutic potential of BAT in humans. To make the therapeutics
possible, improved knowledge of the regulation of thermogenic adipocytes is urgently needed. The
thermogenic function of brown and beige adipocytes are coordinately regulated by specific transcriptional and
epigenetic regulators. While transcription of the thermogenic gene uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) in response to
beta-adrenergic stimulation has been broadly studied, little is known about how histone positioning and
chromatin folding influences the expression of Ucp1 and other thermogenic genes. Using an unbiased
CRISPR-based screen, we identified the histone variant H2A.Z and the LIM domaining-containing zinc-finger
protein Crip2 as trans-acting factors recruited to the Ucp1 promoter/enhancer region by beta3-adrenergic
receptor stimulation. Importantly, deletion of H2A.Z or Crip2 in mature brown adipocytes not only impeded
Ucp1 transcription, but also reduced the expression of multiple thermogenic genes and led to impaired cellular
thermogenesis. This proposal will determine the signaling events mediating the activation of Crip2 and H2A.Z
deposition and the impact of Crip2 or H2A.Z deficiency in the cellular thermogenesis and bioenergetic profiles
of thermogenic adipocytes murine and human origins. Since histone variants play an important role in
determining chromatin remodeling, we will examine how Crip2-H2A.Z interaction influences chromatin
architecture, thereby regulating thermogenic transcription and cellular respiration. To establish the
physiological significance of Crip2 and H2A.Z in metabolic regulation, we will generate brown fat-specific Crip2
or H2A.Z knockout mice and thoroughly characterize their metabolic phenotypes. Completing the proposed
studies will increase fundamental knowledge on the role of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of
thermogenic program and pave ways to establish new therapeutic approaches for combating metabolic
diseases."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common and fatal forms of hematological malignancies
caused by gene mutations and genomic rearrangements. The cure rates for AML patients have not
significantly improved for decades. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML are not
fully understood. By analysis of publicly available genomic data using a new machine learning approach, RNA
Binding Motif Protein 33 (RBM33), an RNA binding protein, is identified as an essential gene in AML.
However, the biological function of RBM33 is unknown yet. Our preliminary studies provide the first compelling
evidence suggesting a novel function of RBM33 in regulating m6A RNA demethylation. More importantly, we
showed that RBM33 knockdown significantly inhibited growth and survival of human and mouse leukemia
cells. At a molecular level, we have identified a potential downstream target of RBM33 in leukemia cells.
ALKBH5 is known as an m6A mRNA demethylase (Eraser), which removes m6A methylated groups from RNA.
To date, it remains unknown whether another member of RNA binding proteins is required for ensuring
recruitment of ALKBH5 to its mRNA targets. We have recently demonstrated that ALKBH5 has a critical role in
AML development and maintenance. We hypothesize that RBM33 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of
AML by regulating ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific
aims. In Aim1, we will determine a novel role of RBM33 in regulation of dynamic m6A RNA methylation in
leukemia cells. In Aim2, we will investigate the role of Rbm33 in AML development and maintenance. In Aim 3,
we will determine the downstream pathway that mediates the function of RBM33 in leukemogenesis in AML.
We will employ both mouse genetic models as well as human patient-derived mouse models to elucidate the
role of RBM33 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis in vivo, and will combine transcriptome and
epitranscriptome analysis to identify the key downstream targets and associated downstream pathways that
mediate the role of RBM33 in leukemogenesis. Our studies will uncover a novel role of RBM33 in m6A RNA
modification, and define the importance and underlying mechanisms of RBM33 in AML development and
maintenance as well as LSC/LIC self-renewal. Thus, the success of our project will significantly advance our
understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the m6A modification-mediated gene regulation in
leukemia cells and the critical role of m6A RNA demethylation in leukemogenesis."
10814915,"Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have provided promising treatment options for patients with triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Despite overall success in treating these malignancies, immunotherapeutic approaches
face a number of unique challenges: (1) dose limitation due to off-target side effects, (2) additive toxicity
of combination therapies, (3) and relatively low immunogenicity of breast cancer. To overcome these limitations,
this proposal seeks to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize breast cancer and locally
release immunotherapeutics. The ultimate goal is to elicit more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity
and promote the clearance of colonized primary and metastatic breast cancer lesions and systemically growing
breast cancer-derived foci. The accompanying project will first focus on deciphering mechanisms that define the
intratumoral tropism of the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) by using antibody-mediated depletion approaches
and targeted genetic knockouts to pinpoint host immunological pathways that regulate tumor-specific
growth. Using synthetic biology approaches, EcN will then be engineered to stably express and release checkpoint
inhibitor nanobodies targeting CD47, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 locally inside of tumors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines
will additionally be expressed to promote antigen presentation and enhance cytotoxic T cell responses.
The primary innovations of this proposal are in the combined approach of both developing a better understanding
of probiotic colonization of tumors, along with engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector.
Specifically, this approach has several advantages over current therapeutic strategies, including: (1) identification
of novel EcN host strains and mechanistic understanding of their tumor colonization for further improvements
in engineered therapies, (2) tumor-specific production of immunotherapeutics, (3) bacteria lysis that leads to
effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) adjuvant, and (4) local delivery of
novel immunotherapeutic combinations that are toxic to deliver systemically. This work seeks to overcome current
limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a targeted vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that stimulate
antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating immune-related adverse effects."
10814919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ketogenic diet has been proposed as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a disease marked by the
aggregation and inter-neuronal spreading of the protein tau. Although preclinical studies and early stage
clinical trials have shown promising results on improved memory in individuals with early AD, the
mechanism(s) by which the ketogenic diet slows AD progression is not well understood. Such gap of
knowledge prevents the development of more precise ketone-based therapies with higher efficacy and reduce
side effects. The ketogenic diet might act through multiple mechanisms: for example, the main ketone body, β-
hydroxybutyrate (BHB), provides an energy source and also acts as a signaling molecule. Parsing the
contribution of these mechanisms will help define which components of ketogenic diet are most relevant to
tauopathies. We have found that a ketone-supplemented diet significantly reduced tau spread in mice.
Additionally, treatment with BHB markedly reduced tau secretion in cultured cortical neurons. The overall
objectives in this application are to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which BHB reduces
tau spread and neurodegeneration. The central hypothesis is that BHB acts to inhibit tau spread primarily via
its signaling activity, and specifically, BHB represses tau secretion from neurons and promotes its degradation
through the autophagic-endolysosomal flux. The rationale for this project is that a determination of the
preclinical therapeutic efficacy and mechanism(s) of BHB on tau spread will likely lead to better targeted and
more effective ketone-based pharmacological therapies for AD and other tauopathies. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the contribution of signaling verses bioenergetic
activity of BHB in reducing tau spread and improving neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice; 2) Determine the
effects of BHB on the autophagy-endolysosomal pathway (ALP) in regulation of tau degradation, secretion and
propagation, and 3) Determine the impact of BHB on the tau interactome in response to BHB’s signaling and
bioenergetic activity, respectively. The proposed research is innovative because it tackles the unknown
mechanisms underlying the effects of the ketogenic diet on tau, using a combination of pharmacology,
genetics, cell biology and system biology approaches in primary and iPSC-induced neuronal culture, fly and
mouse models. Results from the proposed studies will bridge the knowledge gap of how the ketone body
affects tau pathogenesis and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, thus enable future development of novel
treatment strategies for AD and other tauopathies."

Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) represents a significant unmet need, posing a tremendous health and economic
challenge for patients and society. Pain is a common complaint among people affected by SCI, and its
persistence negatively impacts their quality of life (QOL). Approximately 65–85% of patients with SCI suffer
from pain, and one-third of these characterize the pain as severe. While some treatments reduce the severity
of pain in some individuals, no treatments that are currently available consistently relieve pain in the SCI
chronic pain population. Persistent pain is one of the consequences of SCI that has consistently been shown to
significantly decrease perceived quality of life (QOL). Pain interferes with sleep, cognitive, emotional, and
physical health and functioning. Pain relief has been identified as one of the highest areas of unmet needs in a
recent study of 1,000 individuals with SCI. Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES), also known as Spinal Cord
Stimulation in (SCS), is a common FDA-approved therapy for chronic neuropathic pain of trunk and limb.
Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of EES to augment motor recovery in SCI rehabilitation. EES of
spinal elements distal to a lesion has demonstrated previously untapped rehabilitative potential in patients with
‘complete’ SCIs. We propose a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial where patients with
subacute, traumatic, complete thoracic SCIs with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale
A are randomized to receive either “EES on” (treatment) or “EES off” (control) of the target regions for pain
control (lead overlying the spinal cord anatomy corresponding with their pain distribution) and neurorestoration
(lead overlying the conus medullaris) as an adjunct to physical therapy (PT). The objective of this study is to
examine the feasibility of EES on improving pain and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with SCI. We
hypothesize that patients who receive EES will outperform their counterparts in the control group in pain and
exploratory endpoints including motor, sensory, bladder and QOL outcomes. We also hypothesize that when
the control group crosses over to late stimulation, they will show improvement on a lesser scale than the early
intervention group, but that these patients will also show significant improvement compared to their own control
period. We propose the following Aims: Aim 1 will compare the impact of EES on pain and QOL in patients
with SCI between control and placebo groups, using the SCI version of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory
(MPI-SCI); Aim 2 will compare motor recovery as assessed by EMG and dynamometry between intervention
and control groups at up to 9-months, followed by a second comparison of unblinded early versus late
stimulation for another 9-month period; Aim 3 will compare the impact of EES on sensory, bladder and quality-
of-life in patients with SCI between intervention and control groups, outcomes. Impact: If successful, this
HEAL project would help determine whether this well-established clinical intervention can help patients with
SCI neuropathic pain and have more widespread clinical applicability."

tissue disorder. Patients typically develop aortic root aneurysms with ensuing aortic dissection and rupture
remaining the leading cause of death. Without prophylactic surgery, life-expectancy is reduced to age 40 years.
Novel targeted drug therapies have been absent, likely due to limitations in mechanistic understanding. Thus,
there is an urgent need to dissect the pathway(s) involved in MFS aortic wall extracellular matrix (ECM)
breakdown resulting in aneurysm formation. We hypothesize that distinct embryonic origins of SMCs populating
the aortic root contribute to aortic root-specific aneurysm pathophysiology. In the recent funding period, we
created and characterized induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from MFS patients and differentiated them into
SMCs from each embryologic origin. We learned that the microRNA, miR-29b and related downstream genes
were dependent on SMC embryologic origin. After applying high-throughput proteomics, we also discovered that
iPSC-derived SMCs from MFS patients express distinct, lineage-specific proteomic profiles affecting critical
biologic processes including ECM synthesis/degeneration and SMC contraction/motility. Utilizing single-cell RNA
sequencing, we identified a distinct, disease-specific SMC cluster that develops transcriptomic alterations
regionally in both murine models and human aortic root aneurysms. In complimentary MFS Fbn1C1041G/+ mouse
in vivo studies, we discovered several regional upstream TGF-β-dependent triggers that ultimately increase
matrix metalloproteinase-mediated ECM remodeling, including: (a) Ras (GTPase) signaling; (b) NADPH
activation leading to reactive oxygen species production; and (c) androgen potentiation of TGF-β signaling in
male mice. Drug blockade of each discovered pathway reduced aneurysm formation.
In this renewal application, we rigorously expand our research progress by proposing several innovative
experiments to study the relative contributions of SMC lineages to regional ECM remodeling, investigate the
upstream triggers and pathologic role of modulated SMCs during aneurysm formation, and advance the
translation of disease-specific iPSC modeling for novel pathway discovery. Specific Aim 1 seeks whether
interactions between MFS SHF- and neural crest-SMCs induce synthetic SMC phenotype and ECM remodeling.
We investigate the novel role of reduced SHF-SMC mannose receptor 2 (MRC2) on ECM composition,
proteolysis and SMC contractile function. We will also elucidate the effect of ECM biomechanical properties on
lineage-specific SMC responses, including SMC transcriptomic modulation and single cell mechanical
properties. Specific Aim 2 strives to determine the effects of modulated SMC populations on ECM remodeling in
vitro using our innovative MFS decellularized matrix scaffolds. Novel lineage-tracing transgenic mouse models
will be utilized to identify modulated SMC embryologic origin and role in aneurysm progression in vivo."

on vascular inflammation and associated disease or injury in the heart, brain, lung, kidney, gut, and placenta. As
all tissues are connected via blood vessels and lymphatics, inflammatory responses in the circulation play a
central role in the onset and progression of multiple organ dysfunction and pathologies, including hypertension,
atherosclerosis, arrythmia, myocardium infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, preeclampsia,
neurodegenerative disorder, traumatic brain injury, and sepsis. The recent discovery of vasculitis as a leading
cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19 further accentuates the need for future research to
decipher molecular/cellular mechanisms and identify diagnostic/therapeutic targets for vascular inflammation.
The goal of this program is to provide comprehensive training in research focusing on the molecular and cellular
basis of inflammation and related organ injury, taking advantage of our faculty's nationally recognized expertise
in inflammation research and vascular biology. The mentoring faculty consist of 20 mentors from 7 departments
across 6 inter-departmental programs or research centers, 7 of whom hold MD/PhD degrees and 4 are practicing
physicians; all have been funded by the NIH and have extensive experience in mentoring at both pre- and
postdoctoral levels. The group has already established a close collaborative relationship in research and training,
evidenced by co-mentorship for graduate students, co-authorship in numerous publications and presentations,
and joint effort in grant applications. The proximity of their laboratories, along with the centralized administrative
support provided by the department chaired by the program director, further enables close mentor-mentee
interactions. Trainees will be selected from a large pool of PhD candidates and postgraduates in basic science
programs, as well as 14 medical residency/fellowship programs related to cardiovascular sciences. A significant
portion (up to 27%) of trainees come from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups or with socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds. The program design includes a comprehensive set of training modalities, featuring
a rigorous curriculum composed of didactic courses and workshops to build knowledge and competency, an
intensive research project emphasizing hands-on experience and critical/innovative thinking, and a personalized
development plan to equip the trainees with not only workplace survival skills but also the vision and capability
to lead independent research. Trainees will be immersed in a highly collaborative environment supported by
substantial institutional resources committed to the Heart Institute, Neuroscience Institute, full-spectrum core
services, bridge funding for faculty mentors, and tuition waiver and stipend supplement for trainees. In addition,
the program offers several unique opportunities for trainees to learn techniques and experimental approaches
that are not commonly available elsewhere, including 3/4D intravital microscopic/molecular imaging in the blood
and lymph microvasculature, and translational studies using intact, functionally viable human organs."
10815700,"Abstract:
The function of the lens requires the maintenance of its transparency and refractive properties throughout its lifespan but
those mechanisms responsible are not well understood. While important cellular functions and pathways such as cell
adhesion or GTPase signaling have long been hypothesized to play a role in preserving these functions the removal of genes
associated with these cellular functions often severely disrupt the lens making the contribution of them challenging to
interpret. We have overcome this barrier with the discovery that mice lacking the Arvcf gene develop bilateral, age-
dependent cortical cataracts. Arvcf is a member of the p120-catenin subfamily of catenins that bind to a specific intracellular
domain of cadherins and regulate Rho-GTPases and junctional protein dynamics and stability. We have additionally found
that Arvcf is highly enriched within lens fiber cell junctional structures and is required for the recruitment of several proteins
to the cadherin complex, normal lens refraction, preservation of fiber cell morphology, organization of the F-actin
architecture, and the normal biomechanical properties of the lens. We propose three aims to address the central question:
What molecular functions lie downstream of Arvcf to maintain lens transparency, refraction, cell morphology, and
biomechanical properties? In the first aim we will determine which of these properties, precede, follow, or are simultaneous
with cadherin complex and adherens junction instability in Arvcf deficient lenses. We will test the hypothesis that the
initiating event is the reduction of cadherin complex proteins in fiber cell membranes through a combination of biophysical
property measurements of whole lenses and fluorescent/electron microscopy of lens fiber cells. Our early investigations
also found that Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) depends on Arvcf to associate with the cadherin complex and novel quantitative
analysis of super-resolution microscopy images of interlocking protrusions demonstrated a significant reduction of AQP0
from the distal tips of these structures. Therefore, in the second Aim of this proposal we plan to test the hypothesis that
Arvcf recruits AQP0 to the tips of interlocking protrusions to facilitate cell adhesion and water transport by determining
whether AQP0 and the Arvcf/N-cadherin protein complex function together in adhesion and water transport. In the third
aim we will test the hypothesis that altered GTPase signaling downstream of Arvcf contributes to lens function. The GTPase
regulation domain of Arvcf and candidate GTPase regulatory proteins will be genetically altered to determine their
contribution to Arvcf function, lens fiber cell biology, and lens transparency. Together, these project aims will identify
functional mechanisms of a previously untested and important protein required for lens transparency and lens fiber cell
function. Furthermore, they will elucidate mechanisms underlying the etiology of age-dependent cortical cataracts. Because
of the association of murine Arvcf with cortical cataracts and the human ARVCF gene with genetic disorders, neurological
diseases, and cancer, the advances made on this proposal will also have a broad impact."

10810017,"Project Summary (Abstract):
This project will employ a recent innovation that we made in peptide:MHCII (pMHCII)
tetramer design. Fluorescently labeled pMHCII tetramers have been used to detect
CD4+ T cells of known specificity, aiding the study of these populations. However,
pMHCII tetramers do not detect CD4+ T cells with TCRs at the low end of the
biologically relevant affinity spectrum. The affinity of CD4 for MHCII is below the limit of
detection. We used directed evolution to strengthen the interaction between MHCII and
CD4, thereby stabilizing TCR-pMHCII interactions while still retaining the cognate
specificity. pMHCII tetramers engineered for enhanced CD4 binding outperformed
conventional tetramers in detecting cognate T cells, including the ones with low affinity
TCRs. The overall goal of this project is to exploit this enhanced binding by high
affinity 4E reagents in immunotherapies. The premise underlying this project is that
recruitment of all antigen-specific CD4 T cells including the ones with low affinity TCRs
will improve responses generated by vaccines, whereas deletion of these T cells could
treat autoimmunity. The goal here is to use the high affinity 4E reagents to activate or
inactivate T cells based on the clinical need. In Aim 1 we will assess the efficacy of
pMHCII-4E reagents to specifically deplete auto-reactive CD4 T cells in a murine
model of multiple sclerosis, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Both
in-vitro and in-vivo depletion followed by EAE induction will be attempted. In Aim 2 we
will assess the efficacy of pMHCII-4E reagents to induce better immune responses and
aid in bacterial clearance in acute or chronic / persistent bacterial infections."
10810327,"Project Summary:
Millions of antibody sequences from both healthy individuals and patients with a variety of immune-mediated
disorders are now freely available to the research community. This has been made possible by support primarily
provided by NIAID for the research projects themselves and for the databases that curate the data. To maximize
the benefits of this financial support, the Institute now funds efforts to use the curated data to explore new
initiatives which are beyond the scope of the original research projects. We propose to use approximately one
million of these antibody sequences to test a hypothesis concerning rare antibody sequences that was first
proposed over 35 years ago but which now can be examined on a large scale by means of these NIAID supported
databases. The expansion of the antibody repertoire by V(D)J gene rearrangement, N-nucleotide addition, and
somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces non-germline encoded sequence changes throughout the antibody
variable domain. Many of these sequences are either totally absent from, or very rare in, the human proteome.
It is already clear that these “foreign” sequences are common in V regions of antibodies even from healthy human
controls, so it is unlikely that the majority are immuno-pathogenic. However, there is reason to test the
hypothesis that a small subset of these forbidden/rare pentapeptides will be clinically immunogenic, i.e., will
be able to induce immune responses that should be absent from normal antibodies. If this can be confirmed, it
will help us address at least two major challenges now facing medical immunology. First is the persistent problem
of immunogenicity in new therapeutic antibodies which substantially raises the cost of development of these
agents and limits their efficacy in patients. If the proposed work is successful and the immunogenic
pentapeptides are identified, it could lead to the development of new algorithms that more accurately predict the
immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies prior to expensive clinical trials. Second is the need for more specific
and effective therapies for autoimmune diseases such as SLE, MS, and type 1 diabetes. A large body of evidence
indicates that many of the self-reactive, pathogenic autoantibodies contain idiotopes in their structures which
are recognized by anti-idiotypic antibodies. Further, it appears that the presence or absence of these anti-
idiotypic antibodies may in part be responsible for periods of remission or active disease. Few idiotope structures
are known, but it seems reasonable that these immunogenic segments in antibody variable regions may also
contain the foreign pentapeptides; this could serve as a tool for identifying idiotopes in the sequences of
pathogenic self-reactive antibodies. A major outcome of the proposed studies is a bioinformatics research tool,
the Penta-Scope, which will take as input the sequences of large numbers of antibodies and return the frequencies
of their component pentapeptides in human and murine proteomes. This tool will be made freely available online
for other investigators to use in studies of antibody structure and/or immunogenicity."

Preserving cognitive ability and brain health is a salient concern of older adults. Alzheimer’s disease and
Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) and stroke disproportionately affect late-onset epilepsy
(LOE), defined as LOE diagnosed at ages ≥65. Persons with LOE are 2 to 3 times more likely to subsequently
experience AD/ADRD and stroke compared to those without LOE. However, current clinical practice in LOE
focuses primarily on seizure control, without any practice guidelines specifying how to mitigate risks for
subsequent AD/ADRD and stroke. Preserving the best possible brain health will require integrating accurate
risk assessment and effective prevention strategies into epilepsy management. Our main hypothesis is that
LOE is an early clinical manifestation—a marker—of an excess burden of pre-epilepsy vascular risk factors
(VRFs) and subclinical or covert vascular brain injury (VBI). In some patients, LOE may be the first
manifestation of vascular disease. Our hypothesis is supported by our prior work, as well as those of others,
that show that (a) VRFs are significant contributors to cognitive decline, AD/ADRD, and stroke, (b) VRFs are
associated with LOE, and (c) the effects of VRFs on cognitive decline and stroke are stronger in the presence
of epilepsy. Consequently, existing risk prediction algorithms for AD/ADRD and stroke/cardiovascular disease
(CVD) may underestimate risk in individuals with LOE, failing to identify those who would benefit from
aggressive vascular risk reduction. We propose an unprecedented effort to leverage and pool individual
participant data from six NIH-funded US-based prospective cohort studies, because no single cohort study will
be large enough to test our main hypothesis. Our objectives in this application are to rigorously investigate
relationships of LOE and pre-epilepsy VRFs with cognitive decline and characterize potential biological
mechanisms, develop risk prediction algorithms for AD/ADRD and stroke/CVD that accurately estimate risk in
the setting of LOE, and integrate LOE into a microsimulation modeling paradigm for testing the effects of VRF
interventions in clinical trials. We will pursue three Specific Aims: (1) Quantify the association of LOE with
cognitive decline, identify the roles of pre-epilepsy VRFs and MRI-defined covert VBI in this association, and
explore differences by sex and race/ethnicity. (2) Assess whether LOE, as a novel risk marker of covert VBI,
changes predicted risks for AD/ADRD and stroke/CVD when incorporated into established risk prediction
algorithms. (3) Using microsimulation, quantify the incremental value of risk/benefit-based tailored treatment, in
which treatment decisions are guided by individual predicted event risk, over a traditional treat-to-target
approach, in which the treatment goal is to reduce VRF measures to specific levels, on rates of AD/ADRD and
stroke/CVD after LOE. Successful completion of this proposal will propel clinical care models for LOE to
consider accurate vascular risk assessment/treatment."
10811699,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genetic screens in Drosophila have identified mutations that significantly reduce both night-
time and daytime sleep. Genes affected by these mutations are expressed in the blood-brain-
barrier-forming subperineurial glia of the fly and alter the morphological and biophysical
properties of the barrier. We have discovered novel genetic interactions among some of these
mutations: surprisingly, certain mutant combinations restore both sleep and blood-brain-barrier
function. We propose further studies that could reveal molecular pathways connecting their
gene products and clarify their contributions to sleep and barrier function. We discovered that
in wild type Drosophila the blood-brain barrier opens and closes with a rhythm that requires a
circadian clock. We have also found that barrier permeability is closely connected to sleep
need: sleep deprivation opens the barrier, but rebound sleep closes it. What is being
exchanged across the barrier in such a dynamic fashion? Nervous system function is protected
by a steep concentration gradient of K+ separating the haemolymph and brain. In our proposed
studies we will develop tools to quantify K+ flux across the blood brain barrier with high temporal
resolution in living flies. Are episodes of sleep and wakefulness correlated with these ion
exchanges? Do such measurements reveal features of wake/sleep behavior that are not
evident using standard locomotor activity monitoring? Our studies have also shown that sleep
mutants reduce lifespan, but in a fashion that can be reversed by time-controlled access to
food. These effects require a circadian clock and we will determine which tissues are
responsible for this response and whether lifespan restoration depends on sleep recovery.
Chronic exposure to psychogenic stressors can have profound, long-lasting effects on both
physical and mental health and is often accompanied by a profound loss of sleep. Chronic
social isolation provides a means by which a psychogenic stressor can be easily applied for
an extended period, and we observe significant reductions in total sleep, day-time sleep, and
night-time sleep in isolated flies when compared to sleep in siblings that are group reared. To
search for genetic pathways that might respond to isolation-induced stress and depress sleep,
comparative RNAseq assays were performed using Drosophila heads collected from group-
reared flies, or from flies stressed through chronic isolation. Among the most highly responding
genes are those thought to regulate appetite. These map to a small neuronal circuit which we
will further characterize to determine its possible role in isolation-induced stress responses
affecting sleep and hunger."

The objective of this project is to induce localized immune tolerance to transplanted human beta
cells derived from renewable stem cell sources as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. We will test
our approach to prevent immune rejection of grafted human stem cell derived beta cells in diabetic
mice with elements of human immune systems. In addition, we seek to explain the detailed
biological mechanisms by which the therapy works by conducting in vitro studies using islet-
reactive human T cells. Recent advances in the generation of stem cell derived beta-like cells
(sBCs) have raised the possibility of providing a renewable source of functional beta cells for
transplantation, effectively overcoming the severe shortage of human donor islets. We have
generated simplified culture conditions that accurately and efficiently generate unlimited
quantities of glucose-responsive insulin-expressing beta cells in vitro. The stem cell derived beta
cells generated have already been used successfully for beta cell replacement therapy in animal
models. By combining cell engineering with biomaterials engineering to display negative
regulators of immunity (e.g. programmed death-ligand 1, PD-L1; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
related apoptosis-inducing ligand, TRAIL), we will functionalize stem cell derived beta cells (sBCs)
to counter autoimmunity upon transplantation. A major strength of our approach is that the
immunotherapy is strongly localized to grafted beta cells, which increases specificity and avoids
the negative side effects of systemic immunotherapy. We hypothesize that stem cell derived
human pseudo islets transplanted with PD-L1 and/or TRAIL will be resistant to autoimmune
destruction and exhibit enhanced engraftment / survival in an in vivo model of beta cell graft
rejection using humanized mice. Our strategy will induce localized tolerance to beta cell antigens
while simultaneously promoting sBC graft vascularization."

Acute brain injuries (e.g., stroke and trauma) are among the leading causes of death and disability in the US.
Patients with acute brain injuries are at high risk for seizures and seizure-like activity as detected by
electroencephalography (EEG). This pathologic epileptiform activity further increases the risk of death and
disability in patients with brain injuries. Anti-seizure medications are frequently used to suppress this activity,
which while potentially efficacious in suppressing the activity also have significant side effects e.g., cognitive and
functional impairment. Despite the significance (i.e., frequency and severity of the injuries and the difficulty
balancing adverse effects of seizures and seizure-like activity with those from the treatment), there is limited
evidence to guide clinical care. The reasons for the gap in knowledge are multifactorial including the complex
and heterogeneous nature of both acute brain injury and seizure-like activity, the labor-intensive task of reviewing
EEG data, and the potential difficulty recruiting and following up with this critically ill patient population which has
historically had limited involvement in clinical trials. To address these questions and overcome these barriers,
we have developed a large multi-center EEG registry and tools for processing and analyzing the EEG data and
have completed preliminary studies to pave the way for the proposed work. Specifically, we will link our EEG
registry data with electronic records, a stroke registry, administrative data and state death records, to achieve
two aims: 1) Aim 1: Describe the natural history of epileptiform activity and its response to anti-seizure
medications using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics modeling, and characterize how this response
varies with injury type and severity; and Aim 2: Examine the impact of EEG-guided anti-seizure treatment on
neurologic outcome (death and disability) using both target trial emulation and reinforcement learning. Our
dataset will be one of the largest linked EEG datasets extant. This comparative effectiveness study will directly
inform and improve the care of acute brain injury patients with seizure-like activity detected on EEG, future
experimental and observational studies, and neurocritical care management practices."
10801419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The process by which RNA molecules are assembled from DNA templates, called transcription, is
fundamental to all life and dysregulated in many human diseases. Over the past 15 years, studies of the
mechanisms and dynamics of transcription have increasingly relied on a family of techniques for isolating and
sequencing newly transcribed, or “nascent” RNAs. In contrast to standard RNA-seq, these nascent RNA
sequencing (NRS) methods enable transcription to be measured separately from RNA degradation, respond
rapidly to changes in transcription, and reveal the positions of RNA polymerases along a DNA template.
However, NRS data require sophisticated computational and statistical methods for analysis, which are only
beginning to emerge.
Here, we propose to develop a powerful and flexible probabilistic modeling framework for the analysis of NRS
data. Our framework is based on a highly general “unified model” that mathematically describes both the
kinetics of transcription initiation, elongation, and promoter-proximal pause release, and the generation of
sequencing read counts. It can be used to estimate transcriptional rates directly from NRS data, in either a
steady-state or nonequilibrium setting. Our proposal includes three specific aims, focused on the
development of (1) a series of statistical tests and machine-learning methods for differential analysis of
transcription-associated rates; (2) a statistical and machine-learning framework and new experimental
methods for characterizing variation in elongation rate and its dependency on genomic and epigenomic
covariates; and (3) an open-source software package implementing these new methods in the R programming
environment (STADyUM), integrated with the Bioconductor, AnVIL, and PyTorch environments. Successful
completion of these aims will result in powerful, versatile, and highly accessible new computational tools that
will accelerate progress in transcriptional research."

Salmonellosis continues to be one of the most important causes of food-borne illness in
the U.S. Furthermore, multiple-antibiotic resistant Salmonella strains are becoming
untreatable infectious diseases. Poultry meat and eggs are major sources of Salmonella
food-borne illness, due to carriage of these bacterial pathogens in the intestinal
microbiome. The NIH goal to reduce Salmonella human infections is directly linked to the
USDA goal of reducing carriage of Salmonella in poultry. While these goals have been
high priorities for many years, current control efforts have been uniformly unsuccessful.
Accordingly, new approaches are needed to address this infectious disease problem in
the United States. The long-term goal of our work is to reduce or eliminate carriage of
Salmonella in poultry flocks. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that an
engineered probiotic strain that expresses a key Salmonella adherence factor, type 1
fimbriae, can outcompete pathogenic Salmonella strains for position in the intestinal
microbiome of poultry. Significant reduction of Salmonella carriage in poultry will
significantly improve the food safety of poultry and will decrease the incidence of
salmonellosis. There are two specific aims in this proposal: 1) To optimize the binding
activity of the type 1 FimH gene expressed in E. coli Nissle 1917, 2) Demonstrate that
the hyper adherent E. coli strain can competitively exclude Salmonella strains from
colonizing the intestinal epithelium of the poultry host. At the completion of this project,
we expect to have demonstrate that an engineered E. coli probiotic strain can
significantly reduce intestinal carriage of Salmonella in chickens. The focus of this
project is to provide an avenue to reduce cases of human salmonellosis and reduce the
human infection risks posed by multiple-antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria."

Every year, breast cancer kills more than a half-million women worldwide. Monumental efforts have made an
impact toward understanding primary disease and the development of targeted therapies. Yet, these therapies
still fail many women initially, and others relapse with therapy-resistant disease. Thus, we must focus on
developing better tools to predict disease susceptibility in those at higher risk, while augmenting the search for
molecularly based strategies to prevent breast cancer.
More specifically, mutations in the BRCA1 genes, and their consequent loss of function, are the most clinically
relevant genomic alterations that increase the susceptibility of individuals to breast cancer. Still, not all women
with BRCA1 mutations will develop breast cancer. Thus, we need a clear picture of the mechanisms that
govern cancer susceptibility. Our main goal is to define how the epigenome alters the development of
Brca-1 deficient mammary tumors.
We previously demonstrated that the mammary epithelium epigenome and specific chromatin remodeling
factors play a role in oncogenesis progression. Now, we hypothesize that the epigenome similarly contributes
to the development of BRCA1 mutant breast tumors. We will use innovative models of mammary oncogenesis
to specifically dissect epigenetic mechanisms that influence the development of Brca1-deficient mammary
tumors.
By investigating the effects of a specific epigenetic regulator (BPTF) and a global epigenomic program
(pregnancy) on mammary tumor progression, we may also identify prognostic biomarkers that will enable us to
identify women who will benefit from therapy. Ultimately, we hope to validate our hypotheses pre-clinically
using normal and malignant human breast organoid cultures, to aid the development of strategies that will be
useful as primary prevention in humans."
10804729,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite recent advances in the targeting of immune checkpoints across malignancies, many patients fail to
respond to treatment, suggesting alternative mechanisms of immunosuppression. Metabolic dysfunction within
tumor-infiltrating T-cells has emerged as a potential mechanism by which long-term anti-tumor immunity is
impaired. The mechanism by which altered metabolism suppresses intratumoral T-cell function, however,
remains to be fully characterized. Cellular metabolites not only supply the bioenergetics needs of proliferating
immune cells, but also regulate gene expression by serving as the substrates for chromatin modifications.
Preliminary data presented in this proposal utilize a combination of in vitro and in vivo systems to explore the
metabolic liabilities of T-cells during chronic exposure to tumor antigens. Under these conditions, T-cells
experience high levels of oxidative stress. This compromises the ability of T-cells to oxidize glucose and
glutamine within the TCA cycle, leading to bioenergetic compromise that impairs nucleotide biosynthesis and
alters the availability of substrates for DNA and histone demethylation reactions. Enhancing redox
homeostasis has beneficial effects on anti-tumor T-cell immunity in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, the efficacy
of T-cells within the tumor microenvironment may be primarily limited by metabolic alterations that generate
redox stress. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested by (1) using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models
of T-cell exhaustion in both mice and primary patient tumors to define the impact of chronic antigen-driven
metabolic alterations on T-cell proliferation, chromatin modifications, and effector function, (2) determining how
cysteine limitation exacerbates T-cell dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment, and (3) determining
whether enhancing redox homeostasis, either by increasing intracellular cysteine availability or limiting the
generation of oxidative stress can reverse metabolic T-cell dysfunction and enhance anti-tumor immunity. The
proposed investigations will expand the armamentarium of strategies to enhance immune responses in cancer,
particularly for the patients who are unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy. The applicant, Dr. Santosha Vardhana,
an Assistant Attending with the Lymphoma Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, has outlined a
5-year career plan that builds on his scientific background in immunology and cellular metabolism as well as
his clinical training in medical oncology and immunotherapy. Dr. Vardhana will conduct the proposed research
under the mentorship of Dr. Craig Thompson, an internationally recognized expert in immunology and
metabolism with a strong track record of training successful physician scientists, with co-mentorship by Dr.
Jedd Wolchok, a highly recognized expert in cancer immunotherapy with significant experience interrogating T-
cell function in both mouse models and primary patient samples. MSKCC provides the ideal institutional

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) are a common problem in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), especially

Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are usually implicated. Antibiotics are associated with adverse
events, increased multi-drug resistance; and they do not prevent a future recurrent UTI (rUTI) due to microbiome
persistence of the uropathogen. New strategies to combat rUTI are critically needed. Bacteriophage (phage)
therapy consists of administration of viruses that specifically bind to target bacteria leading to an intracellular
replicative lytic cell cycle causing bacterial cell death; phage therapy is currently in clinical trials for a variety of
indications. Phages are highly specific to their target bacteria; this relatively narrow host range is a significant
advantage that has the potential to precisely target the causative pathogen in the gut and urinary microbiome
and thus remove the reservoir of rUTI.
We hypothesize that phage therapy directed against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in female KTR will be safe and
lead to a reduction in UTI event rate via a targeted impact on the gut and urinary microbiome. We plan to conduct
a randomized phase I/II pilot clinical trial to compare the safety, tolerability, and feasibility in addition to efficacy
and microbiome effects of phage therapy vs. placebo administration in asymptomatic female KTR with a history
of rUTI due to E. coli or K. pnuemoniae. Participants will be randomized to receive a 7-day course of twice daily
intravenous phage therapy (16 participants) or normal saline placebo (16 participants) and will be followed for
180 days for assessment of study outcomes. Primary outcome of safety and tolerability will be measured by the
incidence of adverse events, abnormal vital signs and clinical laboratory tests; feasibility will be assessed with
specific goals for enrollment, phage match, study drug administration, and follow-up. The main efficacy endpoint
is number of UTI events due to the original infecting pathogen (E. coli, K. pneumoniae) over the 180-day study
observation period (event rate), calculated for the intent to treat population. Participants will also undergo
sampling (urine, stool) at baseline and during various timepoints to determine microbiome characteristics before,
during, and after phage, and to establish a biospecimen repository for further hypothesis-driven research.
We will use our significant expertise in kidney transplantation and UTI, unique experience with the microbiome
and virome, and visionary phage therapy infrastructure to evaluate the feasibility of moving rUTI therapy in KTR
towards a successful individualized approach. This research has major potential to reduce allograft injury and
improve bladder health in KTR, while reducing morbidity and mortality. The results of this pilot clinical study will
directly inform the design of a larger, phase III randomized trial."
10802000,"Project Abstract:
The recent FDA approvals (Lutathera, Azedra, Pluvicto) and the swell of promising experimental agents in clinical
trials underscore the surging enthusiasm to investigate molecularly targeted radiotherapy (TRT) as a treatment
modality for cancers. However, tumor responses to TRTs are often transient and/or variable among patients.
Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to develop new strategies to maximize the therapeutic benefit of TRT for
cancer patients. For the past several years, the nuclear medicine field has prioritized developing low MW small
molecule or peptide radioligands (RLTs) that rapidly exit the bloodstream to minimize host toxicity. However,
tumoral responses to RLTs are limited by several factors, including heterogeneous target expression among
tumors, dissociation or degradation of ligand/receptor complexes, and incomplete target saturation due to low
mass doses and infrequent repeat dosing. Thus, exploring new strategies beyond RLTs for the tumoral delivery
of radioisotopes is a worthwhile goal.
 We have approached this challenge by developing a new class of radiopharmaceuticals termed
“restricted interaction peptides” (RIPs) which are linear and unstructured low MW peptides that are internally
cleaved by a tumor endoprotease of interest to unmask a radiolabeled, helical membrane binding peptide. Once
liberated, the radiolabeled helical peptide immediately and irreversibly attaches to a nearby phospholipid
membrane in the tumor. Using PET, we have found that RIPs may have several properties advantageous for
TRT, including catalytic amplification of tumor uptake and long persistence of the radioisotope in tumors due to
the stability of the peptide/lipid membrane interaction. Thus, RIPs offer an unusual combination of the desirable
safety profile characteristic of a low MW RLT with a high tumoral uptake more typical of a large MW TRT.
Collectively, these findings provide a strong scientific rationale to test for the first time if radiolabeled RIPs can
be effectively leveraged to treat tumors. Over three specific aims, we will evaluate the antitumor effects of a
novel RIP termed “FRIP2” by coupling it to a representative β- (Lu-177) or alpha (Ac-225) emitter. Furthermore,
we will translate 64Cu-FRIP2 into patients to test the safety, dosimetry, and pharmacokinetics of the platform
while also evaluating the feasibility of tumor targeting. In summary, this project represents the first use of a
conditionally activated membrane binding probe for TRT, which may overcome the well documented
shortcomings of conventional RLT."
10802218,"Aging-associated diseases are an increasing socio-economic burden despite efforts to improve
healthspan. Pathologies that cause degeneration of the nervous system are particularly
devastating, and in many cases are associated with decline in proteostasis and lysosomal
malfunction. Prime examples are Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease that are characterized by
accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates that lead to neuronal decay. Lysosomal degradation
of cytoplasmic components depends on proper transport of hydrolases from the Golgi to
lysosomes where they encounter the acidic environment necessary for their activation.
Lysosomes are also important regulatory hubs that integrate nutritional signals and participate in
lipid metabolism, and these diseases are associated with alterations in lysosomal pH and
accumulation of lipids, particularly cholesterol in the lysosome.
 We have recently characterized Drosophila Lamp1, a bona fide homolog of the mammalian
LAMP1/2 proteins with partially redundant roles in autophagy and cholesterol assimilation.
Drosophila Lamp1 localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and is, in contrast to Lamp1/2, not
required for development, autophagy, or viability; however, males have a reduced mean lifespan.
Critically, Lamp1 deficiency results in an increase in the number of acidic organelles in the fat
body, strongly suggesting defects in the regulation of the pH of the endolysosomal system.
Furthermore, Lamp1 mutant larvae have elevated levels of sterols and diacylglycerols, indicating
functions of Lamp1 in lipid transport beyond sterols, that we are in the unique possibility to assess
in the absence of confounding autophagy defects.
 This proposal will identify the connection between Lamp1 function, endolysosomal
acidification, and lipid metabolism, and investigate how these processes are connected to
neurological disorders. Because altered endolysosomal regulation contributes to many aging-
related diseases, our research will significantly advance our understanding of how dysfunction of
endolysosomal system underlies disease, ultimately leading to the development of novel
treatment strategies to improve healthspan."

Notice number: NOT-MD-19-001. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations have among the highest
rates of alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and use disorders in the United States. A large body of literature
suggests that stigma and minority stress are primary factors driving SGM inequities. SGM stigma is the social
process of labeling, stereotyping, and rejecting human difference as a form of social control and it operates at
three levels: (1) Structural stigma (e.g., societal norms and institutional laws and practices that limit the
resources of stigmatized people); (2) Interpersonal stigma (e.g., verbal harassment and physical violence); and
(3) Individual stigma (e.g., the feelings people hold about themselves or the beliefs they perceive others hold
about them that may shape anticipation and avoidance of discrimination). Crucial gaps remain in the literature
of SGM stigma and alcohol use. First, structural stigma has largely been measured and examined at the
national or state level. Yet, structural stigma experienced at the local level (e.g., city policies) may be crucial in
understanding the mechanisms by which stigma influences SGM health. To date, research on the associations
between local structural stigma and alcohol use is limited. Second, studies have yet to examine how structural
stigma is associated with interpersonal and individual stigmas. Third, scant research has examined how the
intersections of these stigmas impact SGM alcohol inequities. We therefore propose to investigate the
relationships of local structural stigma and experiences of discrimination with SGM young adults' alcohol use
and related problems. The study will be conducted in 33 midsized cities in California that contain significant
variation in participants' exposure to local structural sigma. To assess local structural stigma, including its
specific components (e.g., law enforcement, municipal benefits and protections to LGBTQ employees), we will
use information and ratings assessed by the Human Rights Campaign. Fourteen consecutive daily surveys
with 792 SGM young adults (ages 18-29, 24 per city, for a total of 7,084 estimated data points) will be used to
assess participants' day-to-day experiences with stigmas and alcohol use outcomes. A baseline survey will
assess demographics, alcohol use, experiences with discrimination, and constructs of minority stress. Since
gender minorities (GM), cisgender sexual minorities (SM) women, and young people of different racial/ethnic
groups may experience higher levels of stigma than other SGM groups, it is necessary to consider differences
within SGM populations. The specific aims are to: (1) Assess associations of local structural SGM stigma and
experiences of interpersonal discrimination with alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and alcohol-related problems
(e.g., alcohol use disorder symptoms), (2) Examine the mechanisms through which local structural,
interpersonal, and individual stigmas are associated with alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and alcohol-related
problems, and (3) Explore whether the results for Aim 1 differ by cisgender SM men, cisgender SM women,
GM populations, and Latinxs. We focus on Latinx SGMs as the largest racial/ethnic group in California (~40%)."
10804451,"Clonal evolution is cancer is a critical part of disease progression, but it is difficult to understand which clonal
populations are present with bulk sequencing techniques. Myeloid malignancies are increasing among our aging
veteran population and are a group of blood cancers where clonal evolution even prior to inception is apparent.
This proposal uses cutting-edge single-cell DNA sequencing, in addition to other single cell modalities, to better
characterize clonal evolution in signaling mutant MDS and secondary AML. Our preliminary data has identified
patterns of clonal architecture change that are typical of transformation of MDS to sAML. These patterns, defined
as either dynamic or static clonal change, blast increase and are enriched for signaling mutations. We propose
to profile signaling mutant sAML and MDS deeply to trace clonal histories with single cell DNA sequencing
combined with surface marker characterization. We will also sequence mitochondrial DNA from scDNAseq and
scRNAseq data to connect genotype to transcriptome. This represents a powerful tool to better probe cell
ontogeny and clonality in myeloid malignancy. Further we will characterize how mutation status effects cell type
output. Next, we will use single cell RNA sequencing combined with antibody detection of surface markers (CITE-
seq) to identify transcriptional properties of clonal populations, with the focus of distinguishing between signaling
mutant cells and non-mutant cells in the same sample. We will test the hypothesis here that there are common
gene regulatory networks within clonal evolution patterns with both methylation gene mutations (e.g., TET2) and
signaling gene mutations (e.g., FLT3) in MDS and sAML that arises out of MDS. In addition to CITE-seq, we will
perform phospho-specific mass cytometry to find aberrant signaling responses to inflammatory perturbations.
We have used this modality to probe extracellular and intracellular proteins simultaneously in AML and MDS in
the past. Here, we will probe signaling responses by subjecting samples to multiple perturbations. This technique
enables cell type assignment via a large panel of >24 surface markers combined with 10 intracellular signaling
readouts. Ultimately, we propose to computationally align data from the common surface markers in each of the
three single cell modalities to discover correlations between signaling, transcriptional, and clonal identity. In order
to dissect the emergence of signaling mutations more accurately, we will use ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells
that model this clonal change. We will investigate the underlying epigenetic alterations that can give rise to
signaling mutant clonal evolution and investigate signaling changes associated with a new signaling mutation.
This proposal will identify molecular mechanisms involved in clonal advantage and potential therapeutic targets."
10802518,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with most deaths occurring in
individuals infected with highly treatable, drug sensitive stains. Individual pharmacokinetic variability is an
important driver of TB treatment failure particularly among undernourished populations, and sub-target serum
drug concentrations are associated with delayed response to treatment, death, and acquired bacterial drug
resistance. We have demonstrated that measuring an individual’s serum pharmacokinetics and personalizing a
dose adjustment can improve TB treatment outcomes. In TB endemic settings, medicines are typically only
available in fixed-dosed combination tablets as lack of cold chain preservation of serum and specialized
laboratory equipment hinder the timely measurement of drug concentrations. With the current 5R01 AI137080
we developed a process to quantify TB drug concentrations from urine analyzed with a benchtop
spectrophotometer bypassing the cold chain (Point-of-care Evaluation of Exposure to TB drugs- PEE-TB).
Focusing on rifampin for drug-susceptible TB, we found urinary rifampin excretion as measured by
spectrophotometry at feasible collection intervals predicted clinically significant targets of serum exposure of a
full dosing interval in children and adults with active TB. We also discovered that stool enteropathogen burden
at TB treatment initiation was associated with reduced rifampin serum exposures among children with
undernourishment and stool biomarkers suggested a malabsorption mechanism. Therefore, our central
hypothesis for this renewal is that in undernutrition related TB, pharmacokinetic variability is driven by the
burden of enteric pathogens via malabsorption, yet a clinically significant proportion of sub-target drug
concentrations can be corrected by measurement of urinary drug excretion. We propose a randomized and
controlled study of the PEE-TB based dose adjustment intervention for rifampin to test the efficacy of the
platform in increasing rifampin serum concentrations to target, and the overall safety of the dose
personalization strategy in children and adults. In this setting of high TB and undernutrition burden, the trial
design will also facilitate study of the mechanisms for pharmacokinetic variability including the presence of total
or species-specific enteropathogens, or enteropathy related to intestinal inflammation, functional intestinal
mass and intestinal permeability, and whether enteropathogens and/or enteropathy blunt the pharmacokinetic
response to PEE-TB based rifampin dose personalization."
10805223,"Abstract: A substantial number of infants and children with congenital heart defects (CHD), inherited arrhythmia
syndromes, and/or congenital disorders of cardiac conduction require a cardiac implantable electronic device
(CIED). The current approach to affixing a CIED lead to the heart of a young patient is to open the chest and
sew the lead directly to the epicardium (“epicardial leads”), whereas the approach in older adolescents and adults
is passing it through veins and affixing to the endocardium (“endocardial leads”). Once epicardial leads are
implanted, however, the patient is no longer eligible for routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the
increased risk of radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating of myocardial tissue. The problem is exacerbated by the
fact that there is no straightforward method to extract leads, so children who receive such leads are excluded
from the benefits of MRI even if a subsequent FDA-approved endocardial CIED system replaces an epicardial
system when they are older. Such patients are often referred for alternative imaging modalities with ionizing
radiation, which may result in suboptimal care and a significant radiation risk for children. Our strong, preliminary
data show that CHD patients with a CIED have four-fold higher cumulative effective doses of radiation from
computed tomography and X-ray than matched pediatric CHD patients with no CIED, thereby highlighting an
urgent need to increase access to MRI for pediatric CIED patients. The 2017 HRS consensus statement is blunt
in emphasizing the need for more research: “Given the paucity of data related to the safety of MRI [with epicardial
leads], recommendations cannot be made [and] many questions remain unanswered.” Even if MRI safety issues
are resolved through engineering, the diagnostic yield of cardiac MRI remains low due to severe image artifact
caused by the Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG). Existing “wideband” pulse sequences developed for adults
are unsuitable for pediatric CIED patients due to two main reasons: (a) the proximity of IPG to the heart is closer
in pediatric patients than adults, necessitating a wider bandwidth RF pulse design; (b) pediatric patients have
smaller hearts and faster heart rates than adults, necessitating higher data acquisition acceleration. In direct
response to this unmet clinical need, this study seeks to develop innovative technologies to achieve the following
three objectives: (1) determine imaging conditions under which MRI can be performed safely in children,
regardless of CIED types and abandoned leads; (2) develop, implement, and validate physics-based epicardial
lead implantation strategies that minimize the variation and magnitude of RF heating in pediatric patients with a
CIED; (3) develop and validate age-specific, free-breathing, wideband cardiovascular MRI pulse sequences that
produce diagnostically acceptable image quality in pediatric CIED patients. If successful, our work will extend
MRI access to a growing number of pediatric patients with a CIED and deliver age-specific free-breathing
wideband pulse sequences that produce diagnostically acceptable image quality."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects approximately 537 million people worldwide. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the
most common complication of diabetes, affecting 60% of individuals with T2D. Glycemic control is the only PN
treatment, but it often fails to restore nerve function in T2D. Dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for PN,
but there is a gap in our understanding of how it leads to nerve damage. Thus, there is a critical need to
understand mechanisms by which dyslipidemia promotes nerve injury in T2D to develop targeted, mechanism-
based therapies. The American Diabetes Association recommends diet and exercise to correct lipid profiles
and prevent PN in T2D. In addition to clinical data on exercise benefits in PN, we discovered that a dietary
reversal (DR) paradigm restores the nerve lipidome and nerve function in an established nongenetic model of
T2D and PN. These animals are fed a high fat diet (HFD) and treated with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) to
mirror the human condition. What remains unknown is the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
restoration of nerve function. One mechanism by which diet and/or exercise mediate their beneficial effects in
metabolically active tissues is through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs mediate intercellular
communication by transferring cargo containing proteins, lipids, and miRNA that support ATP production in
recipient tissues during bioenergetic stress. With respect to the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells
(SCs) maintain nerve health through orchestrated metabolic communication via homeostatic EV transfer from
SCs to axons. We recently discovered that SC dysfunction promotes secretion of pathologic EVs carrying miR-
15b, a regulator of lipid metabolism, ATP levels, and neurodegeneration, leading to axonal damage and PN.
Our objective is to uncover the mechanisms underlying DR- and exercise- mediated improvements in PN,
focusing on SC-derived EVs, SC single-cell transcriptomics, and the overall effect on nerve lipid metabolism,
bioenergetics, and function. We hypothesize that following diet and/or exercise, SCs transfer homeostatic EVs
to axons and improve PN by normalizing nerve lipid metabolism and bioenergetics. To test this hypothesis, we
will 1) assess the effects of DR, voluntary exercise in a running wheel (Ex), and DR/Ex on T2D-induced SC
injury and nerve function to determine how T2D and/or the intervention(s) impact the SC-specific
transcriptome, SC EV cargo, and SC-axon crosstalk; 2) interrogate the effect of SC-derived EVs on neuronal
health in an in vitro PN model to identify mechanisms of EV-mediated SC-axon crosstalk through miRNA
changes, uncovering the contribution of SC-axon coupling to nerve damage and PN, and 3) determine how
SC-derived EVs contribute to PN in T2D mice to determine the roles of EVs and miR-15b in SC-axon crosstalk
and PN and confirm whether EVs and miR-15b are suitable for therapeutic targeting in PN. These studies will
have a significant impact by advancing our understanding of nerve injury mechanisms in T2D and identifying
SC-specific therapies for PN."

The Fogarty International Center is at the forefront of advancing National Institutes of Health (NIH) support for
international research to promote health and reduce disease burden globally. A large part of this mission is
linked to the successful creation and maintenance of international partnerships between institutions and
research groups in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). Equity
between LMIC and HIC research partners - defined as the prioritization of mutually beneficial inputs,
processes, outputs, outcomes, and impact - is an ethical and practical imperative needed to achieve
meaningful scientific aims and outputs within these partnerships that function in an inherently inequitable world.
Despite the importance of establishing formal equitable practices and several recommendations and guidelines
available to do so, tools for systematically acknowledging existing partnership inequities and methods to
overcome them are not well-described.
The goal of this proposal is to develop and pilot a pragmatic equity planning tool using experienced HIV-
focused research partnerships between Uganda, an LMIC, and the United States (US), a HIC, as a case series
given the dominance of the HIV epidemic on global health research paradigms over the past 40 years and the
continued focus as a priority for many research partnerships in Uganda and the US. This will be accomplished
through an explanatory quantitative to qualitative evaluation of these partnerships that generates a holistic
understanding of best practices and barriers to equitable research practices (Aim 1). These results will inform
the creation of an equity planning tool that consists of structured survey and focus group materials to
systematically evaluate an international research partnership and create a summative report that highlights
exemplar practices, identifies feasible areas for improvement, generates attainable program-level equity goals,
and creates an action plan to achieve those goals (Aim 2). The equity planning tool will then be prospectively
piloted and assessed for efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability within a research partnership (Aim 3).
Collectively, this proposal seeks to elucidate a tool to recognize and, importantly, rectify equity-related issues
and instigate change at a program level within international research partnerships. This K01 will provide Dr.
Chelsea Modlin with the training she requires in advanced qualitative and ethnographic methods including
reflexivity, empiric and applied methods in international research ethics, and developing global health program
assessment tools. This award will also support preliminary research findings needed to pursue R01 funding to
scale up the equity planning tool to other geographic areas and fields of global health research. This tool has
the potential to assist with ensuring that the ongoing research practices, outputs, and legacies of international
research collaborations benefit both research partners and ultimately, the global communities they serve."
10807320,"Summary
We have recently identified a small subset of CD11c+ microglia as the sole producer of OPN (Osteopontin; Spp1)
and major disease driver in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our analysis of OPN-
producing CD11c+ microglia has divided Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) that surround Aβ plaques into two
opposing subsets that together regulate AD pathology. A pathogenic CD11c+OPN+ microglial subset promotes
proinflammatory responses and drives AD development, and a protective CD11c+OPN− microglial subset
degrades Aβ fibrils and inhibits disease pathology. We find that genetic deletion of OPN (a) inhibits microglial
proinflammatory responses, (b) enhances TREM2/TAM-dependent uptake and lysosomal breakdown of Aβ
plaques and (c) markedly improves cognitive function. Analyses of clinically and neuropathologically
characterized brain tissue from AD patients and controls (Mt. Sinai Brain Bank and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease
Study) confirm these murine findings. In addition, administration of α-OPN mAb markedly ameliorates the
microglial proinflammatory responses and reduces Aβ plaques in 5XFAD mice.
Here we propose Osteopontin (OPN) as a novel and tractable target based on preclinical studies of the 5XFAD
model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (performed at DFCI) and analysis of well-characterized human brain tissue
(performed at Mt. Sinai and Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center) (Aims 1 and 2). We also test the therapeutic
impact of mAb-based approaches that target OPN in the 5XFAD mouse model in Aim 3. The overarching goal
of our therapeutic approaches is conversion of proinflammatory microglia into a non-inflammatory phenotype
with enhanced ability to engulf and digest Aβ fibrils. Identification of a pathogenic (CD11c+OPN+) microglial
subset in both murine and human brain tissue provides new insight into the pathogenic pathway that may drive
clinical AD and a foundation for the development of therapeutics that target this pathology and halt or reverse
disease progression."
10809393,"Although older adults account for 40% of inpatient surgical procedures and for two-thirds of all patients
undergoing the 10 most common operations, their numbers are on the rise, and they suffer significantly worse
outcomes than younger counterparts, critical knowledge gaps exist in how to best care for them and improve
their outcomes. Surgeon-scientists are an important bridge between investigation and bedside patient care.
Unfortunately, the surgeon-scientist workforce is threatened by increasing pressures to generate clinical
revenue, the declining numbers of surgeons with federally funded research programs, and lack of mentorship
for future generations. Research training during surgical residency has been suggested as a solution for
reversing this trend and some have predicted that surgeon-scientists will become “extinct” without such
opportunities. There is a critical need to train surgeons in aging research who will be able to tackle important
research and clinical challenges to meet the growing need for surgery among older adults. We propose the
Mentored Research Training in Aging and Surgery (MERITAS) Program at the Center for Surgery and
Public Health (CSPH) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) to train surgical residents in health
services research at the intersection of surgery and aging with a particular focus on frailty, Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias, Multimorbidity, and Serious Illness. The overall goal of this training
program is to create a diverse community of n=8 superbly trained surgeon-scientists to conduct studies to take
on the mounting research, clinical, and policy challenges to improving care for older surgical patients. The
MERITAS program has three aims: 1) To leverage existing rigorous post-doctoral training infrastructure at
CSPH, BWH, the Longwood Medical Area (Harvard Medical School and the TH Chan Harvard School of Public
Health) and the Boston Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center to generate resident-led,
hypothesis-driven research from concept to dissemination intersecting surgery and aging under the mentorship
of a multidisciplinary cadre of health services researchers in aging and surgery. 2) To increase access to
rigorous training in health services research in surgery and aging for surgical residents from groups URiM and
clinical training programs lacking resources to support such research training through targeted recruitment and
mentorship. And 3) To launch a community of next-generation health services researchers in surgery and
aging prepared for independent research careers through networking, longitudinal sponsorship and alumni
activities. The program will be co-led by surgeon-scientists Drs. Zara Cooper and Louis Nguyen, and
supported by 14 experienced mentors, with critical input from an Executive Committee and External Advisory
Board comprised of researchers and leaders in surgery, geriatrics, epidemiology, health policy and other key
disciplines. This program will yield a diverse cohort of future surgeon-scientists dedicated to improving the
health and well-being of older surgical patients."
10814650,"Project Summary
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous condition that occurs most frequently as complicating
comorbidity of very common disease in the western world, including COPD, heart failure, and blood clots in the
lung. In patients with PH secondary to COPD (Group III) mortality risk is about twice as high than in patients with
COPD and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Medications developed successfully for Group I disease have not
shown much utility in Group III PH. Additionally, non-invasive screening and early detection remain challenging.
For this reason, etiology and evolution of PH are still poorly understood and the response to potential
interventions is very difficult to measure.
In recent years, radiologists have been making observation of the loss of distal vasculature (pruning), increased
vascular “tortuosity”, and proximal vascular dilation in patients with PH. In this career development proposal, we
hypothesize that the great power and recent advances in artificial intelligence can be leveraged to identify new
functional and structural markers that define the presence of PH in smokers from non-contrast CT images. These
CT-based features will significantly improve our ability to define the main structural and functional effects of PH
in COPD patients and assess pathological conditions, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and
biological underpinnings of the disease.
Aim 1 of this application involves refining our algorithm for vascular morphology assessment and applying it to
investigate how the pulmonary vasculature is affected in presence of PH Group III. Five markers of presence of
disease will be explored. The goal of Aim 2 is to develop an innovative approach to assess the level of pulmonary
perfusion from non-contrast non cardiac gated CT images and to apply it to explore new functional markers of
disease. Both in Aims 1 and 2 association with biological outcomes will be performed. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
validate the biological relevance of the endpoints determined in Aims 1 and 2 by performing common and rare
variant association studies.
Preliminary data obtained with our published methods show promising results. We show that using artificial
intelligence we can effectively segment pulmonary vessels, separate arteries and veins, and measure small
vessels with an accuracy which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we developed an innovative
technique that synthesized perfusion maps from non-contrast CT to assess perfusion defects in PH patients.
Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive dataset
available through the COPDGene study. The execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through
active collaboration with Dr. Raul San Jose Estepar, Ph.D. as the mentor and an outstanding Advisory Committee
including renowned leaders in the fields of medical image analysis, translational research, quantitative imaging
in pulmonary vascular disease, and the genetic epidemiology of COPD."
10931630,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ever since Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty in the 1960s, developmental scientists have been
assessing the effects of poverty on child development, especially language acquisition. Ample evidence shows
that some of the negative effect can be explained by social determinants: how parents talk to their children,
parental stress, and parents’ knowledge of child development. But these factors fail to account for all, or even
most of the language deficit seen in children of poverty. The goal of this project is to explore the hypothesis that
poverty-driven biological determinants can explain previously unaccounted for variance in those deficits.
Two novel mechanisms are proposed to account for additional variance in the language deficits of children of
poverty: (1) Mothers and children in poverty face healthcare inequities that put these children at enhanced risk
of delays in the development of auditory functions, beyond raised thresholds; (2) Deficits in suprathreshold
auditory functions negatively impact language acquisition for children in poverty more than for children from
middle-class backgrounds because optimal social factors buffer effects for the latter group. With these
possibilities in mind, the overall goal of this current project is to explore the comprehensive hypothesis that being
born into poverty imposes myriad risk factors for delayed development of language skills, arising from both social
and biological determinants. The social determinants to be studied include: (1) impoverished parental language
input; (2) enhanced parental stress; and (3) poorer parental knowledge of child development. The biological
determinants include: (1) premature birth and (2) chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). The most innovative
aspect of this work is that it will explore the hypothesis that prematurity and OME are responsible for delays in
development of suprathreshold auditory processes critical to language acquisition. Children born into poverty
are both more likely to experience these health problems and less likely to benefit from the mitigating effects of
a highly supportive environment. This project seeks: (1) to measure the contributions of each of these sources
of deficit by examining auditory (spectral and temporal processing) and language (lexical, morphosyntactic, and
phonological) functioning in young children born with varying SES; (2) to expand our understanding of the
connections from perinatal/postnatal health conditions to development of auditory functions to language learning;
and (3) disentangle the effects of poverty and systemic racism on these barriers to language acquisition. These
goals will be addressed with three Specific Aims. Aim #1 will quantify the direct effects of the social and biological
determinants described above on language skills. Aims #2 and #3 will focus on the proposed biological
determinants, assessing the effects of premature birth and OME on the emergence of spectral and temporal
processing (Aim #2) and assessing the contributions of spectral and temporal processing to language acquisition
across the socioeconomic continuum (Aim #3). Results will enhance our understanding of the root sources of
language deficit for children in poverty, as well as for all children born too soon or experiencing OME."

 Hypertension affects one-third of US adults (68-88 million cases), contributing to >500,000 deaths per year
and healthcare expenses of $51-131 billion annually. Despite the availability of myriad FDA-approved drugs to
lower blood pressure, 15-20% of patients are resistant to treatment, and many more patients are unresponsive
because of non-adherence to their medication schedule. With an aging population and the increasing prevalence
of hypertension, effective treatment for hypertension is likely to become progressively more critical.
 Human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) potently lowers blood pressure. hBNP is produced by the heart in
response to high blood pressure, leading to vasodilation, excretion of salt and water in the urine, and inhibition
of certain enzymes that raise blood pressure. The safety and effectiveness of hBNP as a therapeutic (aka
nesiritide, Natrecor®) were proven for short-term use, but it must be given by constant intravenous infusion or
multiple suboptimal daily injections, because it is rapidly removed from the blood. Sale of Natrecor® was
discontinued by the manufacturer in 2018 due to decreasing sales after it was shown that a short-term infusion
of the acute-acting endogenous peptide had no beneficial effect on reducing long-term rehospitalization or death.
Antlia Bioscience has resolved the issue that previously impeded the long-term effectiveness of Natrecor®
 Antlia Bioscience has discovered an innovative method to extend the lifespan of hBNP in the blood, while
keeping its ability to lower blood pressure without increasing heart rate. Antlia has added a block of 200 units of
the three amino acids—Proline-Alanine-Serine, PAS(200)—to the hBNP peptide, creating a large molecule that
resists degradation and elimination from the blood. Importantly, dogs treated with PAS(200)-hBNP demonstrated
significant and sustained blood pressure lowering after a single injection, with minimal adverse side effects.
Subsequently three additional hBNP compounds have been made with 400, 600, and 800 PAS units, which were
shown to produce progressively longer and higher plasma exposure in a rat pharmacokinetic study. The
PAS(400)-hBNP analog is anticipated to be suitable for up to 2x monthly dosing in humans, while the PAS(600)
and PAS(800) analogs could provide once monthly or longer dosing intervals. For first proof-of-concept studies
designed to establish safety and efficacy in patients, we will use the PAS(400)-hBNP product with an anticipated
>72-hour half-life in humans. In preparation for human studies, this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal will pursue bulk
manufacture of clinical-grade PAS(400)-hBNP with formulation and stability studies (Aim 1). The first non-clinical
batch of the compound made during manufacturing process development will be used for dose-range-finding
PK/PD studies in rats and dogs with the goal of defining the therapeutic range of doses with associated plasma
concentrations over time (Aim 2). From the results of Aim 2, the doses and frequency of dosing will be selected
for the testing of safety of the clinical grade material in rat and dog GLP-toxicity studies (Aim 3) and in a
cardiovascular safety study in dogs (Aim 4)."

 Delayed or impaired wound healing is a serious complication of diabetes, often leading to lower limb
amputations. By 2050, 1 in 3 Americans will develop diabetes, and up to 34% of diabetic patients will develop a
diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime. Current treatments for DFUs include debridement, infection control,
maintaining a moist wound environment, and pressure offloading. Despite these interventions, a large number
of DFUs fail to heal and are associated with a cost that exceeds $31 billion annually. Chronic inflammation and
increased oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the diabetic wound healing impairment.
We have designed and tested a new therapeutic that synergistically targets both inflammation and oxidative
stress using novel cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP), which possess reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging
properties, conjugated with an anti-inflammatory microRNA mimic (miR146a) that is deficient in diabetic wounds
and inhibits the activation of NFκB-induced pro-inflammatory response. Importantly, our novel patented
conjugate CNP-miR146a efficiently delivers miR146a into the wound to reduce inflammation and ROS, and
accelerate wound healing.
 We have developed a CNP-miR146a specifically formulated for intradermal injection (CTX-001) for the
treatment of DFUs. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that a one-time intradermal administration of CTX-001
to full-thickness wounds fully corrects the wound healing impairment in diabetic mice and elicits a significant 25%
improvement in wounds in diabetic pigs, essentially by normalization of inflammation and oxidative stress.
Repeated weekly administration can correct the diabetic wound healing impairment, similar to healing in non-
diabetic wounds. Following a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA and having completed a pilot bulk drug substance
cGMP manufacturing of CTX-001, the objective of this Direct to Phase II application by Ceria Therapeutics
(Ceria) is to complete cGMP-grade manufacturing and analysis of CTX-001 drug product (Specific Aim 1) to fulfill
IND-enabling studies. Specific Aim 2 will confirm the preclinical efficacy of CTX-001 in diabetic (Db/Db) mice and
a porcine model of diabetic wound healing; we will assess the role of infection on the efficacy of CTX-001 in
mice, and optimize the dose and frequency of administration of CTX-001 to enhance efficacy in the correction of
the impaired healing in diabetic pigs. In Specific Aim 3, we will carry out a dose-range finding acute toxicity study
of CTX-001 in both rats and minipigs, followed by IND-enabling repeat dose toxicology studies. In vitro
genotoxicity studies and an irritation/sensitization study in guinea pigs will complete safety studies in preparation
for First-in-Human clinical trials with our lead product."

Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of noncoding genetic variants associated with
common vascular diseases and traits. Each of these associations could point to a gene and vascular cell type to
teach us about mechanisms of disease. Yet, it has been difficult to connect these noncoding variants to their
molecular functions, in large part because they can act via long-range 3D contacts to regulate distant genes. To
connect these variants to target genes, we will need to answer: How do cell-type and disease-specific features
of the 3D genome impact gene expression in vascular cells?
Our recent work suggests a new strategy to systematically map and computationally predict how the 3D genome
connects vascular disease variants to their target genes. By collecting data on thousands of CRISPR
perturbations of regulatory elements, we developed the Activity-by-Contact Model to describe how 3D features
of the genome control enhancer-promoter regulation. By analyzing 3D contacts in human vascular cells in vitro,
we connected one vascular disease variant to a target gene, endothelin-1, located >600 Kb away. These results
provide a predictive framework to understand how 3D contacts impact gene expression, and reveal a strategy
to systematically connect variants to function by mapping the 3D genome in vivo.
We propose to map, model, and manipulate 3D enhancer-promoter contacts in vascular cells to connect risk
variants for vascular diseases to target genes and cell types. We will: (1) generate a resource of genome-wide
3D contact maps in primary human vascular cells; (2) dissect how 3D contacts guide enhancers to target genes
using combinatorial CRISPR perturbations; and (3) computationally and experimentally link vascular disease
GWAS variants to effects on 3D contacts and gene expression.
Our team includes experts in human genetics, vascular biology, genome engineering, 3D genome mapping, and
computational genomics to map 3D contacts to identify targets for atherosclerosis. The environments at Stanford
University, the Broad Institute, and Baylor College of Medicine are ideal for supporting these innovative and
cross-collaborative studies. This study will provide a resource for studying genetic variants that influence
vascular biology, illuminate a mechanism by the 3D genome regulates gene expression, and demonstrate a
general strategy to identify biological mechanisms that influence risk for common vascular diseases and traits."

Prostate cancer is a significant public health burden with substantial heterogeneity in clinical outcomes and
large racial disparities: Black men in the United States are 1.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate
cancer and two times more likely to die from prostate cancer compared to white men. Patients with advanced
prostate cancer (APC) experience the highest risk of death and the most severely impacted quality of life due
to the disease itself as well as its associated therapies. Despite this, advanced prostate cancer is
understudied. The treatment landscape for APC has changed rapidly over the past 10 years with the FDA
approval of 11 new therapies in the US, yet the real-world uptake of these therapies and experience of men
using these therapies is unknown. Additionally, though disparities in access to treatment and quality of life
have been shown in patients with localized prostate cancer, these outcomes have not been studied in patients
with APC; this is concerning as limited access to treatment and poorer quality of life have been linked to higher
mortality in cancer broadly. Little is known about the treatment patterns for or experience of patients with APC,
and most studies to date in this population have enrolled primarily non-Hispanic white men. There is an urgent
need to expand the investigation of prostate cancer racial disparities into patients with APC, and with a specific
focus on patient-centric outcomes, to highlight potential areas for intervention to decrease mortality from APC.
The overarching goal of the proposed work is to quantify racial differences in the treatment patterns,
experience with the health care system, and quality of life for patients with APC in the United States
and United Kingdom. I will investigate these domains of the patient experience using data from approximately
1500 patients enrolled in the International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer (IRONMAN), a
global prospective cohort of men newly diagnosed with APC. Specifically, I will compare the self-identified
races of Black and white men in the US and UK. In Aim 1, I will use medical record and physician
questionnaire data to characterize differences in observed treatment patterns and reasons for discontinuing
treatments. In Aim 2, I will use Australia’s National Cancer Control Indicators to assess differences in baseline
patient experience with the health care system, emphasizing communication and integration into care. In Aim
3, I will use patient-reported outcome measures data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Survey to
assess racial differences in baseline and longitudinal domains of quality of life, including overall quality of life,
functional status, and symptom status. This project will provide real-world information that can be directly
translated by identifying and quantifying racial disparities across the spectrum of care received by patients with
APC, suggesting potential areas for intervention by healthcare providers to ensure equitable care for all
patients with APC."

Initiation and evolution of most solid tumors involve complex genomic rearrangements in addition to point
mutations – all of which can contribute to cancer progression and to the evolution of resistance to therapeutics.
Single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) has proven invaluable for the identification of tumor
subpopulations and in advancing our understanding of clonal dynamics and tumor evolution. Despite the value
of scWGS, there is a dearth of commercially-available options that provide enough cell throughput (i.e. power)
and/or genomic coverage to fully catalogue and characterize clonal populations within a tumor sample. This
can be particularly problematic when rare, possible therapy-resistant, subpopulations are present within a
tumor that may elude detection using existing methodologies.
Here we will solve the accessibility problem by developing technologies that leverage widely-available
instrumentation and off-the-shelf reagents. We previously described proof-of-principle technologies to construct
scWGS libraries contained within the nucleus (in situ) of each cell that are then carried through cell barcoding
using our custom workflow. We will extend, develop, and adapt these technologies to provide three workflows
that will meet the needs of the cancer research community by providing readily-accessible order-of-magnitude
improvements to cell throughput, cell coverage and cost savings for scWGS analysis over current options. The
first is focused on high cell throughput using widely available instrumentation; the second leverages our high-
content chemistry to produce high-coverage single cell genomic profiles with reduced reagents and improved
throughput; and finally, the third approach implements target capture to target exonic sequence or other
regions of interest to reduce sequencing costs. Each of these is targeted to meet the needs of specific areas of
cancer research, from basic science to clinical, and share the theme of accessibility."
10818358,"Despite having mastered basic word reading skills, large numbers of readers struggle to
understand what they read. More worrisome still is the over-representation of minority and low-income
populations in the ranks of struggling readers, which is linked to poor health outcomes. At the same
time, there is very little agreement among psycholinguists and education researchers as to what factors
drive variability in language understanding. This research program tests two factors that have been
argued to explain variability in grammatical processing and language comprehension abilities. The first
are differences in cognitive abilities (i.e. working memory, processing speed, and phonological
ability). The second are differences in experience with language. We test these two possibilities in a
series of experiments examining individual differences in language comprehension in young readers
and adults. We have 2 specific aims: 1) To determine whether syntactic processing is guided by
cognitive constraints or language experience; 2) to determine whether correlations between language
experience and comprehension skills that were discovered in pilot work are the result of previous
experience with diverse grammatical structures or the result of improved parsing efficiency derived from
practice. The outcomes of the proposed experiments have implications for core questions in language
research. Evidence that working memory or other cognitive factors predict language skill is most
consistent with theories that domain general aspects of cognition are engaged in understanding
language. Evidence that language experience predicts variability in reading skill is more consistent with
theories that posit that statistical representations drive language processing."
10818529,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder caused by bi-allelic mutations in the Ataxia-
telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) gene. A-T leads to numerous clinical symptoms, including radiosensitivity, sterility,
immunodeficiency, insulin resistance, neurodegeneration, and progressive pulmonary dysfunction. Many of
these symptoms are attributed to dysfunction in DNA damage signaling, ATM’s canonical function. However,
several of the hallmark symptoms of A-T align with the clinical presentation of mitochondrial dysfunction.
Mitochondria regulate a variety of cellular functions, including cellular respiration and calcium signaling. Due to
their role in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated
damage. The specific autophagic degradation of mitochondria, mitophagy, is essential for the degradation of
damaged mitochondria. Impaired mitophagy causes increased cellular ROS, leading to cellular dysfunction that
eventually results in aging, cancer development, and neurodegeneration. The Kastan lab has previously
characterized mitochondrial dysfunction in primary ATM-/- murine cells, indicating that ATM regulates
mitochondrial, metabolic, and redox homeostasis. Additionally, the Kastan lab has reported that mono-allelic
deletion of the autophagy regulating protein Beclin-1 rescues many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in ATM-
/- cells, although the relationship between ATM and Beclin-1 remains undefined. Preliminary data outlined in this
proposal indicates that CRISPR/Cas9 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of ATM causes mitochondrial
dysfunction in immortalized cells, including increased mitochondrial mass and ROS. I have also demonstrated
that mitochondrial stress leads to activation of ATM and its downstream effector kinase Chk2. In order to further
elucidate the molecular pathways by which ATM regulates mitochondrial function, we have performed unbiased
proteomic screens to identify interactors of both ATM and Beclin-1. These screens identified GRP94 and
LRPPRC as putative ATM and Beclin-1 interactors. Specifically, the endoplasmic reticulum protein GRP94 is
reported to regulate autophagy, calcium flux, and cellular response to ROS; overexpression of GRP94 is
implicated in tumor development and neurodegenerative disease. LRPPRC is a mitochondrial protein involved
in the regulation of mitochondrial ROS and electron transport chain (ETC) activity. Mutations in LRPPRC lead to
ataxia and neurodegeneration, similar to A-T. The experiments proposed herein will validate the interactions
between ATM and its putative interactors, GRP94 and LRPPRC, and determine whether these proteins are direct
substrates of ATM. Then, I will determine the functional impact of these relationships on mitochondrial/metabolic
function and redox homeostasis, including mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial ROS, ETC activity, and oxygen
consumption rate will be further characterized. Additionally, the manner by which ATM affects binding within the
Beclin-1 interactome, including the putative interactors GRP94 and LRPPRC, to modulate Beclin-1-mediated
autophagosome formation, autophagosome maturation, and mitophagy flux will be thoroughly assessed."

 Use of all tobacco products by youth and young adults up to age 25 poses a serious public health
concern because this group is at risk of long-term health effects and neurological damage from nicotine
exposure. Interventions targeted at them to discourage tobacco use can help lower the trajectory of nicotine
addiction and use of other addictive substances over the life cycle. Reducing their access to e-cigarettes and
altering appealing attributes of e-cigarettes are among the cornerstones of a strategic prevention policy
framework. The proposed research will provide the first plausibly causal evidence on the effectiveness of two
key policies in affecting tobacco use by youth, young adults and adults. These regulations are: 1) a ban on
internet sales of all e-cigarette products; and 2) a comprehensive ban on all added flavors in all e-cigarette
products – including those exempt from the current federal ban. Internet sales bans have just been enacted at
the federal level although there is no empirical evidence speaking to its causal effect on e-cigarette use.
These new bans are intended to target youth and young adults, but they apply to all sales. As a result,
spillovers of the policy effects to adults are possible. Because e-cigarettes are potentially beneficial to adult
smokers who are trying to quit smoking, it is important to ascertain whether these bans mainly affect youth and
young adults or also have any spillover effects on adults and in particular adult smokers. We will assess such
potential spillovers of internet sales bans, and comprehensive flavor bans on tobacco use outcomes among
adults. Beyond descriptive comparisons, there exists virtually no empirical evidence on how effective these
regulations would be in curtailing tobacco use at different age levels. This project will capitalize on natural
experiments exploiting variation in the timing of the adoption of bans on online e-cigarette sales and on added
flavors in all e-cigarette products, to address this critical knowledge gap and provide the first causal estimates
in the literature of these regulations. Analyses will be based on a difference-in-differences framework applied
to micro-level data from six large-scale national surveys of youth, and young adults and adults. As part of our
main aims, the proposed research will also provide some of the first evidence on how state penalties imposed
on retailers for selling e-cigarettes to underage youth and young adults are impacting e-cigarette use by these
groups and how they are obtaining their e-cigarettes. Despite the age restrictions, the considerable level of e-
cigarette use by youth indicates that the minimum purchase age laws by themselves have had limited
effectiveness. Thus, it is important to understand whether stricter penalties can reduce the overall use of e-
cigarettes."

The ability to generate immature neurons from neural stem cells is blunted in the brains of
people with schizophrenia compared to controls. In this grant, we will determine, at the
resolution of single cells, how the transcriptional profile of neurogenic cells is altered in
schizophrenia in order to identify at which stage neurogenesis is blocked. Bulk RNA
sequencing has identified that the most significantly changed transcript within the
neurogenic niche in people with schizophrenia is the general macrophage marker, CD163.
We will determine if macrophages in the neurogenic niche have the characteristics of
helpful or harmful immune cells, and if the type of macrophage varies either with diagnosis
(schizophrenia compared to controls) or based on the extent of local inflammation (high
compared to low cytokines). We aim to gather evidence to support or negate possible
monocyte migration routes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will determine if brain
macrophages have morphological features and molecular signatures consistent with
differentiation into microglial-like cells, and if this varies with diagnosis. Lastly, we will
determine if markers of adult neurogenesis are changed by inflammation and how glia
cells may be changed by inflammation and/or by the presence of increased macrophages.
By exploring the nature and transcriptomic state of different cell populations in the human
neurogenic niche, we can better develop strategies to restore neurogenesis in
schizophrenia and other neurological conditions, possibly through targeting macrophages."
10818770,"In this High Risk High Reward DP2 application I wish to investigate the nuclear functions of mitochondrial
metabolic enzymes. It is quite evident from current literature that many of the mitochondrial enzymes are
localized to the nucleus, more so in diseased conditions such as cancer. However, there is a significant gap in
knowledge about their spatial distribution in the nucleus and biological function. We believe nuclear localization
of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes is not random, and there is specific necessity coupled to critical biological
functions that regulate this process. In this study we wish to perform a comprehensive functional
characterization deciphering the spatial and temporal role of mitochondrial enzymes in the nucleus. Our
preliminary findings identified Kreb’s cycle enzymes such as aconitase (ACO2), α-keto glutarate (AKG), and
citrate synthase (CS); and glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP-citrate lyase
are enriched in the nucleus of cancer cells. We hypothesize these mitochondrial enzymes form complex in the
nucleus based which is yet to be characterized. We hypothesize that they function as a large-multi enzyme
complex which is recruited to chromatin by transcription factors and coregulators to sustain metabolic stress
encountered during gene transcription. Using metabolomics, proteomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation and
gene expression analysis, we envision detailing the sequential events driving their recruitment by nuclear
factors on chromatin, and their role in reprogramming transcription machinery to drive aggressive cancer. This
is a novel concept supported by isolated reports from various groups, yet remains relatively unexplored and a
comprehensive mechanistic study is lacking. We envision findings from our study will have a major impact on
broad important problems in biomedical research including metabolic disorders and cancer."

Beyond ATP, mitochondria supply a variety of metabolites to the cytosolic compartment. Given the impermeable
nature of the mitochondrial inner-membrane, mitochondrial carrier proteins play a central role in metabolite
transport between the matrix and the cytosolic compartment. However, a large number of mitochondrial
metabolite carriers remain uncharacterized, particularly in the context of metabolic diseases.
Recently, our lab identified a liver-specific mitochondrial metabolite carrier, SLC25A47, that is required for energy
homeostasis. This is an exceptionally unique carrier among the SLC25A mitochondrial carrier family (53
members known) because it is expressed selectively in hepatocytes. Our recent study found that blockade of
SLC25A47 blunted pyruvate-derived hepatic gluconeogenesis under a fasted state, whereas the inhibition led to
elevated whole-body energy expenditure even at thermoneutrality. This suggests an exciting opportunity to limit
hepatic gluconeogenesis and elevate energy expenditure by targeting this liver-specific mitochondrial carrier.
Accordingly, this application aims to determine the following emerging questions: 1) What are the underlying
mechanisms of SLC25A47 action? 2) Does inducible SLC25A47 inhibition have a therapeutic effect on reversing
hyperglycemia and obesity? 3) How is SLC25A47 expression regulated? Together, the successful completion of
this work will offer a liver-specific target through which we can restrict hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is often
in excess under hyperglycemic and diabetic conditions, while elevating energy expenditure. Broadly speaking,
this work will establish a framework to understand the principle of tissue-specific mitochondrial metabolite
transport in physiology and disease."

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing in youth with current management strategies ineffective
at maintaining durability of glycemic control. Metformin is the cornerstone of treatment of T2D in youth, yet
youth with T2D have high treatment failure rates on metformin therapy. The reasons for treatment failure
remain unknown, and need to be comprehensively understood in order to optimize dosing strategies for this
safe and cost-effective therapy. To address this unmet medical need, Shylaja Srinivasan MD proposes to build
on her successful patient-oriented genetic research through this career development award with the overall
objective to use an integrated approach to understand the determinants of metformin response in youth with
T2D. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, she will evaluate the pharmacological, clinical
and physiological determinants of metformin response in youth with T2D. Dr. Srinivasan proposes the following
aims: (1) develop a population PK model to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of metformin in youth with
T2D; (2) characterize the variance in long-term response to metformin, integrating comprehensive clinical,
pharmacological and genetic data with disease progression in youth with T2D and develop a clinically usable
precision dosing tool; and (3) evaluate the precision dosing tool for metformin in a pilot study of youth with T2D
in a real clinical setting. To advance these studies, she has access to large datasets and samples from
pediatric patients with T2D. In Aim 1, Dr. Srinivasan will develop a population PK model using PK data from 60
youth with T2D recruited from UCSF. In Aim 2, she will develop a longitudinal model to characterize the
association between dose, predicted metformin PK (Aim 1), clinical factors, genetic factors if any and
metformin response using samples already collected from 699 youth with T2D from the Treatment Options for
Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study. She will then utilize these results to develop a
clinically usable precision dosing tool. In Aim 3, she will evaluate the precision dosing tool in a pilot study of 20
youth from UCSF, comparing precision dosing with conventional dosing for metformin in a real clinical setting.
Results from this proposal will inform an R01 in which precision dosing algorithms for metformin will be tested
in a large randomized control trial and will be expanded to include other drug classes. Dr. Srinivasan's long-
term career goal is to become an independent clinical researcher and to leverage pharmacological and genetic
methods to improve therapeutic strategies for youth with T2D. In this career development award, her training
goals are to gain experience in clinical pharmacology and quantitative pharmacokinetics; become proficient in
advanced biostatistical methods; gain experience in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials; and engage in
career development activities in preparation for R01 funding. She will accomplish these goals with the advice
and mentoring from a world-class multi-disciplinary mentoring team, participation in relevant didactic
coursework and hands-on research experience, all necessary for future independent research success."

 Cell-specific drug delivery represents one of the most important research areas in the field of drug delivery.
Particularly, there are formidable challenges for in vivo mRNA delivery. For example, therapeutic window for
current delivery systems is relatively narrow. A large number of cell types cannot be efficiently delivered in vivo.
Biodegradability of the delivery materials remains a concern. In order to address the challenges, the goals of our
research program are: 1) to develop diverse lipid derivatives; 2) to construct mRNA delivery systems; 3) to
examine the delivery efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of these systems in animal models. In our
preliminary studies, we developed functionalized lipid-like nanoparticles for in vivo mRNA delivery and base
editing. The lead material was able to produce human factor VIII at a normal physiological level in hemophilia A
mice. The effective base editing was also achieved at low doses in mice. Meanwhile, we constructed vitamin
derived lipid nanoparticles, which enabled adoptive macrophage transfer for eliminating multidrug resistant (MDR)
bacteria in mouse models. Moreover, we showed promising mRNA delivery in other cell types, such as stem
cells and reproductive cells. Additionally, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of
mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene
expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified an optimal combination of 5’ and 3’ UTR, termed as
NASAR, which was significantly more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. These preliminary data
provide the scientific foundation to address the delivery challenges of mRNA-based therapeutics. In this proposal,
we propose four directions for mRNA delivery in vivo: (1) to optimize N1,N3,N5-tris(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,3,5-
tricarboxamide (TT) lipid derivatives for hepatocytes delivery; (2) to investigate vitamin lipid derivatives for
macrophages delivery; (3) to develop glycolipid derivatives for stem cells delivery; (4) to conceive novel lipid
derivatives for reproductive cells delivery. We will prove the concept of cell-specific delivery systems in animal
models. Our research goal is to translate the innovations of this research strategy to develop better mRNA
delivery tools to treat diverse diseases."

Arthritis affects almost 60M adult Americans and is increasing in incidence, with osteoarthritis (OA) being the
most common form of arthritis. OA occurs due to degeneration of tissues comprising joints, and is associated
with pain. OA pain is a major contributor to the burden of chronic pain in society. About 80% of persons with OA
suffer movement limitations, and 25% cannot perform major activities of daily living. Current treatment options
are limited to steroid injections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids and non-
pharmacological approaches (exercise, weight loss). Unfortunately, each of these therapeutic approaches are
problematic. Exercise, which helps weight management, is difficult for patients due to ongoing pain. NSAIDS can
cause gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding and increase risk of heart attack or stroke, and opioids are
associated with addiction and abuse (and can actually worsen chronic pain). Clearly, there is a critical need
to identify new therapeutic targets and/or treatments for individuals suffering from OA pain. Here, we
propose that a heretofore unrecognized neural pathway is a critical component of OA pain. This pathway involves
ARTN, its receptor GFRα3, and ‘pain’ channels on nerves (transient receptor potential [TRP] channels).
Activation of this pathway initiates and maintains OA pain. The central hypothesis (based on preliminary data in
multiple species [mouse, dog, cat, human]) is that ARTN, released from synovium of the OA joint in response to
injury, results in de novo increase in its receptor, GFRα3, in local and distant sensory nerves, producing local
and widespread pain and hypersensitivity via Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (RET)-mediated
upregulation of multiple downstream TRP receptors. In this proposal, we will use multiple OA models and
clinically relevant outcome measures, and leverage our unique access to dogs with naturally occurring OA, to
achieve the following aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ARTN expression is increased in OA and is
responsible for pain. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that ARTN/GFRα3 signaling is responsible for behaviorally
manifested OA pain both in early and late stage disease. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that RET-dependent
ARTN/GFRα3 signaling results in changes in multiple TRP channel expression and activation. Aim 4: To
test/validate involvement of the above-described key molecules in a naturally occurring large animal model of
OA (dog). Overall, this will be the first work investigating the role and mechanisms of ARTN/GFRα3/TRP channel
in OA pain and sensitivity. Based on solid, clinically relevant preliminary data, and leveraging PI expertise from
two different and complementary disciplines, successful completion of this proposed work has the potential to
identify clinically relevant neural mechanisms leading to the development of novel, effective therapeutics for the
treatment of OA-pain in humans."
10821371,"Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious first-line intervention for individuals with affective
disorders, non-responder rates remain high. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT; i.e., mental rituals, worries,
depressive ruminations) predicts poor treatment outcome and is a common residual symptom following CBT.
Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to identify the mechanistic targets underlying RNT to optimize treatment
response and reduce the psychiatric burden and healthcare costs for patients with affective disorders. Given
that a hallmark feature of RNT is the difficulty controlling and disengaging from perseverative thought, recent
theoretical models propose that deficits in attentional and cognitive control underlie RNT as fundamental
biobehavioral targets. Yet studies validating these targets are lacking. This five-year Mentored Patient-Oriented
Research Career Development Award will address this need. Specifically, this project will test the hypothesis
that enhancing attention regulation skills in a transdiagnostic intervention streamlined and adapted for RNT –
Emotion Regulation Therapy-Attention Regulation (ERT-AR) – will significantly improve the proposed target of
attentional/cognitive control relative to a supportive psychotherapy (SPT) control group as measured by multi-
method target indices: (a) behavioral (i.e., disengagement and sustained attention in the presence of emotional
stimuli measured by eye tracking fixations and reaction time), (b) electrophysiological (i.e., proactive and
reactive cue- and target-locked N2, N450, and P300 event related potentials in a cued conflict monitoring task),
and (c) self-report (i.e., perceived ability to shift and focus attention). We also will examine early signs of
treatment efficacy, predicting that ERT-AR will improve RNT and psychiatric functioning outcomes (symptom
severity, functional impairment) relative to SPT, and target validation (i.e., changes in attentional/cognitive
control will correlate with changes in RNT and associated symptoms). Study aims correspond to specific
training goals for the candidate (Dr. Ryan Jacoby) in four key areas that will launch her as an independent
translational clinical scientist: (1) affective neuroscience and measurement of biobehavioral targets, (2) clinical
trials and experimental therapeutics methodology, (4) advanced longitudinal statistics, and (5) career
development. Training goals will be implemented with the expert guidance of Dr. Sabine Wilhelm (primary
mentor), co-mentors Drs. Diego Pizzagalli and Douglas Mennin, and advisors Drs. Dan Dillon, Rudi De Raedt,
and David Schoenfeld. At baseline, we will assess clinical symptoms and administer well-validated attentional
and cognitive control paradigms. Patients with RNT will then be provided 8 sessions of ERT-AR or SPT and
will be re-administered assessments at weeks 4 and 8. We will examine changes in our target indices during
treatment, as well as changes in outcomes over treatment and 3-month follow-up. If our hypotheses are
supported, we will identify a cross-cutting target that can be engaged to optimize treatment response for
individuals with elevated RNT, enhancing the generalizability of our findings for maximum public health impact."

 Besides the production of sebum, which is essential for epidermal barrier function, skin elasticity,
thermoregulation and microbiome management, the sebaceous gland (SG) also exerts important
immunological, metabolic and (neuro)endocrine functions. Since dysregulated SG differentiation and sebum
production are seen in many skin diseases such as acne vulgaris, scarring alopecia, seborrheic dermatitis and
sebaceous tumors, the identification of central new molecular controls of SG differentiation and sebum
production will help to pinpoint new targets for therapeutic intervention for these skin diseases. The current
translational research project aims to identify myelin protein zero-like 3 (MPZL3) as a novel, therapeutically
targetable key regulator of SG homeostasis and sebum production via the control of sebocyte (SB)
proliferation and lipogenesis, in both murine and human skin. This project is based on our observation that
global knockout (GKO) mice for MPZL3, an essential mitochondrial regulator of epidermal differentiation, show
excessive sebum production, persistent SG hyperplasia and SB hyperproliferation. It will be the first to
interrogate the regulatory function of MPZL3 in a SG/SB biology context. Based on phenotype similarities
between Mpzl3 GKO mice and KO mice for PPARg, a key transcriptional regulator of SG differentiation, the
presence of putative PPARg responsive elements in MPZL3 regulatory sequence, and preliminary data
showing up-regulated Mpzl3 expression upon PPARg agonist treatment, we hypothesize that MPZL3 functions
immediately downstream of PPARg to regulate SB proliferation and differentiation. Aim 1 will identify changes
in SG homeostasis and sebum production upon global Mpzl3 deletion. Quantitative (immuno-)histomorpho-
metry and qRT-PCR, along with LCM-based RNAseq and pathway analysis will identify critical pathways
altered in Mpzl3 GKO skin. These results will be correlated with advanced lipidomics and proteomics analyses
by mass spectrometry to identify MPZL3-dependent changes in lipid pathways during SB differentiation. Aim 2
will distinguish epithelia-derived from extra-epithelial, MPZL3-dependent signals that regulate SG function by
comparing the SG phenotype in K14-Cre mediated, skin epithelia-specific Mpzl3 epiKO mice with GKO mice.
Aim 3 will determine the function of MPZL3 in human SBs and the regulation of MPZL3 function by PPARg
using in vitro (human SZ95 SBs), ex vivo (human skin organ culture) and novel human SG 3D organoids, as
well as in vivo models (Mpzl3 GKO and epiKO mice). Our studies will provide critical insights into the control of
murine and human SG physiology as being, at least in part, mitochondrially regulated via MPZL3. We expect to
identify MPZL3 as an innovative, drugable target for skin diseases associated with SG pathology and greatly
advance our understanding of the evolutionarily conserved functions of MPZL3 in mammalian skin biology."

 In osteoarthritis (OA), intra-articular inflammation is a key mediator of joint destruction and chronic joint pain.
Unfortunately, current strategies to control joint inflammation have largely failed. To address this challenge, our
team is developing an innovative metabolic reprogramming strategy for the treatment of knee OA. In our strategy,
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an immunosupressive enzyme, will be intra-articularly delivered to
catabolize tryptophan into kynurenines. Based on IDO’s effect in other tissues, this redirection of tryptophan
metabolism will likely drive the polarization of joint-level immune cells toward an anti-inflammatory state.
Importantly, our strategy differs from other intra-articular delivery strategies for protein and synthetic drugs, as
our enzyme will continuously produce anti-inflammatory metabolites in the OA-affected joint and thereby create
prolonged anti-inflammatory effects that potentially reset immune homeostasis in the joint. However, while IDO
can continuously produce anti-inflammatory metabolites, free IDO is subject to joint clearance. To address this
challenge, we will also fuse IDO to a carbohydrate-binding protein, thereby extending IDO’s joint residence time
via a novel tissue anchoring approach. Morever, because tissue-anchored IDO does not need to release to
generate anti-inflammatory signals, the anchored IDO will continue to produce anti-inflammatory kyneurenines
without the need for our ‘drug’ (IDO) to release and bind a specific target. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
tryptophan metabolism is altered in both human OA and rodent models, our tissue anchoring strategy can extend
the residence time of an enzyme from a few days to over 4 weeks, and that intra-articular delivery of an IDO
fusion protein can shift tryptophan metabolism, reduce inflammation, and reverse pain-related behaviors in a rat
knee OA model. As such, this R01 proposal seeks to evaluate intra-articular delivery of an IDO fusion protein as
a therapeutic strategy to control joint inflammation and reduce OA-related pathological remodeling after trauma
(Aim 1) and after the onset of chronic OA symptoms (Aim 2). To achieve these aims, our team will integrate
expertise in metabolic profiling, immune engineering, joint histology, and rodent behavioral analyses.
Specifically, this R01 will address the following scientific questions: 1) How is joint metabolism altered by intra-
articular delivery of an IDO fusion protein? 2) How is the local regulation of the immune system within the joint
altered by an intra-articular injection of an IDO fusion protein? 3) Do IDO-induced metabolic shifts affect other
joint tissues as well? 4) Can intra-articular injection of an IDO fusion protein stall the onset of post-traumatic OA
after medial meniscus injury? and, 5) Can intra-articular delivery of an IDO fusion protein reverse OA-related
pain and disability, even in the context of irreparable joint damage? Answering these questions will be important
for understanding the translational risks of our IDO fusion protein, as well as for refining metabolic reprogramming
strategies for OA treatment in the future."

Almost half of adults have either diabetes mellitus (DM) or prediabetes (preDM), but many of those have
undiagnosed conditions. Current DM diagnosis and risk prediction are based on single “snapshot”
measurements, including fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c. However,
some individuals that do not fall into high-risk categories by traditional DM biomarkers have occasional
glycemic excursions similar to individuals with preDM or even DM. Understanding the determinants of these
glycemic patterns and whether they confer risk in developing DM will elucidate the pathophysiology
responsible for the progression toward DM and could improve DM risk prediction. We will use continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) to measure glycemic patterns in 2700 adults (mean age 58 years) from the
community-based Framingham Heart Study Third Generation cohort and Omni 2, a multi-ethnic cohort. We
aim to describe normative glycemic patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (most of whom do not
have DM), exploring how standard clinical measures (body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c), blood
metabolites, gut microbiome, dietary patterns, physical activity, family history of DM, and polygenic risk score
for DM relate to CGM-derived glycemic variables. The CGM-derived variables we will explore include time
spent in glycemic ranges (e.g. 70-140 mg/dL), hyper/hypoglycemic episodes, mean glucose and glucose
variability. Furthermore, we will examine whether CGM-derived glycemic variables predict development of DM
over 2-3 years follow-up (through an annual self-reported health history) and relate to prevalence of
cardiovascular disease (cross-sectionally). Our study will provide information that could improve the prediction
of developing DM and DM complications. Our findings may also lead to new discoveries that will tailor and
target prevention of DM."

Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI uses selective radio-frequency (RF) pulses to saturate the
magnetization of exchangeable protons on a variety of molecules and macromolecules, including proteins,
which, due to fast chemical exchange with bulk water, results in a decreased water MRI signal. The CEST
contrast depends on the chemical exchange rate (kex), which is pH sensitive, and the volume fraction of the
exchangeable proton pool (fs) that is sensitive to protein and metabolite concentrations. The sensitivity of CEST
MRI to pH and protein/metabolite concentrations has proven to be a powerful tool for imaging a wide range of
disease pathologies. For example, the amide proton CEST contrast from endogenous proteins has been used
to distinguish pseudo-progression from true progression in malignant gliomas, differentiate between radiation
necrosis and tumor progression, and image the tumor's extracellular pH. However, clinical translation of these
CEST-MRI methods has been hindered by the qualitative nature of the image contrast, long image acquisition
times, and the complex data processing required. Efficient methods for quantification of kex and fs are needed to
produce high-quality pH and volume fraction maps required to move many of these studies forward into the clinic.
In this proposal a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method that enables accurate quantification
of both proton exchange rates and volume fractions in a fraction of the time required by conventional pulse
sequences will be developed and optimized. These novel techniques exploit deep learning methods to enable
the simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue maps from a single measurement. The improved CEST-MRF
method will enable the acquisition of accurate pH, water T1 and T2, and protein/metabolite concentration maps
in acquisition times of less than 5 minutes. The sequence will be adapted to a clinical scanner, and a novel multi-
slice method will be implemented to obtain whole brain coverage (Aim 1). Next the CEST-MRF acquisition
schedule will be optimized to maximize the parameter map discrimination and accuracy using a deep learning
approach for the parameter map reconstruction. The parameter map reconstructions in normal human subjects
will be validated with conventional CEST and test-retest studies (Aim 2). Lastly, the optimized CEST-MRF
method will be used to evaluate the change in the quantitative parameter maps before and after radiation therapy
to assess the potential role of CEST-MRF maps as predictive imaging biomarkers for brain metastases (Aim 3)."

Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (abbreviated TAM receptors) are a family of homologous type I Receptor
Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) that have homeostatic functions under physiological conditions to
dampen inflammation and maintain tissue tolerance in multi-cellular organisms. The ligands for
TAMs are two vitamin K- modified proteins, Growth arrest specific factor 6 (Gas6) and Protein S
(Pros1) that bind phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells, and in doing so, act as bridging
molecules to facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis). While PS-mediated
efferocytosis, most emblematically via Mertk expressed on macrophages, have important
homeostatic functions to prevent chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, the constitutively
externalized PS that occurs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of solid cancers, in combination
with the expression of Mertk on infiltrating macrophages, patho-physiologically subvert PS-
mediated tolerogenic functions to suppress host anti- tumor immune responses. The central
hypothesis in this application is that constitutively dys- regulated PS externalization
observed in the TME, in combination with the infiltration of Mertk-expressing
macrophages, act as an important immune inhibitory axis to suppress host anti- tumor
immunity. This axis is likely to be activated in a wide range of solid cancers for immune escape,
but also may represent vulnerability in cancer if effectively targeted by therapeutics. In this
application, we outline mechanistic experiments to identify how externalized PS is dysregulated
in the TME (aim #1) as well as determine the mechanisms by which Mertk acts as an inhibitory
receptor on macrophages to suppress host anti-tumor immunity and tolerance (aim #2). In aim
#3, we propose a series of pre-clinical therapeutic mouse studies to test combinations of a first-
in-class anti-Mertk neutralizing mAb in combination with anti-PD1 mAb, as well as explore and
validate the biology of Mertk as an inhibitory receptor using human models. Collectively, our
studies aim to open up new avenues to interrogate a novel type of checkpoint inhibitory network
in immuno-oncology."
10810105,"A pathogenic immune response targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) causes neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder
(AQP4 NMOSD), a disabling neurological illness that leads to blindness and paralysis. Recent advances in
treatment for AQP4 NMOSD have improved its prognosis but are associated with increased risk of serious
infections. As an autoimmune neurological illness with a well-defined autoantigen, AQP4 NMOSD should be
amenable to a cure by antigen-specific ablation or tolerization. However, preclinical testing of antigen-specific
tolerizing therapy for AQP4 NMOSD remains hampered by the lack of an animal model that recapitulates the
autoimmunity and the pathology in the same animal. Current animal models of AQP4 NMOSD require adoptive
transfer which introduces confounding variables that are difficult to resolve. The objective of this proposal is to
develop a model that recapitulates the autoimmunity and the pathology of AQP4 NMOSD in the same animal
and thereby develop an animal model suitable for preclinical testing of antigen-specific tolerization therapies.
Aim 1.1 will establish anti-AQP4 autoimmunity in the AQP4 null (AQP4.lacZ) mouse. Aim 1.2 will test two
methods to restore AQP4 expression in the AQP4.lacZ mouse: 1) AAV-mediated AQP4 transduction and 2)
inducible (tamoxifen) and conditional (GFAP promoter) Cre recombinase system to restore AQP4 expression in
the AQP4.lacZ mouse. Aim 1.3 will test the hypothesis that restoring AQP4 expression following immunization
against AQP4 in the AQP4 null mouse will result in AQP4-directed autoimmunity and pathology in the same
animal. The successful completion of the proposed research is expected to deliver a new animal model that
more fully recapitulates the autoimmunity and the pathology of AQP4 NMOSD, and thereby overcome the
shortcomings of the current models. Once this model is developed, it will make a positive impact by facilitating
preclinical studies aimed at developing antigen-specific ablation/tolerization therapies as cure for AQP4

The Columbia University Irving Medical Center NHLBI Health Equity StARR Program will
identify, train, and provide longitudinal support to expand the next generation of diverse,
interdisciplinary physician scientists to advance outcomes and reduce disparities for patients
with heart, lung, blood, and sleep-related diseases across the lifespan. We recognize the
declining fraction of the scientific workforce represented by physician-scientists. We recognize
the particular dearth of women, under-represented minorities, and those from other traditionally
marginalized backgrounds, both in the physician-scientist pipeline and as mentors. We also
recognize that there is robust science that underlies our understanding of equity, disparities, and
the transformation of both. The goal of this program is to identify, train, and retain a next
generation of diverse physician scientists to advance science related to heart, lung, blood and
sleep diseases, with focus on working across disciplines to advance health equity. This will be
accomplished through the following Aims: 1) Identify promising, resident physicians across
Surgery, Cardiovascular Surgery, Pediatrics, and Internal Medicine, with a particular focus on
inclusion of women, under-represented minorities, and physicians scientists from other
traditionally disadvantaged and backgrounds; 2) Implement rigorous didactic and applied
learning with a focus on working across disciplines to advancing health equity; and 3) Pair these
resident scientists with interdisciplinary, diverse mentors, committed to rigorous research
methodology and mentorship, before, during, and at least 2 years beyond the CUIMC NHLBI
Health Equity StARR Program, to ensure retention of well-trained, diverse, and fulfilled
physician scientists. To support this training, we bring together not only three different clinical
departments focused on heart lung, blood and sleep diseases and Columbia University’s Center
for Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA; the Irving Institute), but also Columbia
University’s School of Medicine, School of Nursing, Mailman School of Public Health,and the
Columbia University Center for Research on People of Color. This Program will consist of three
tracks: 1) Health Services & Learning Health Systems, 2) Basic & Translational, and 3) Clinical
Science. Completion of these aims will recruit, train, and provide longitudinal support for
diverse, interdisciplinary resident investigators, prepared to apply for early career and career
development research awards and to embark on methodologically rigorous careers to advance

Kidney stones can cause severe pain and are associated with kidney injury, infections, and reduced quality of
life. The prevalence of kidney stone disease has risen across all demographic groups, especially among women,
children, and minorities. All kidney stone patients are at risk for future symptomatic events. Therefore,
determining the appropriate preventative strategies to prevent future symptomatic events will improve health and
reduce the care-related costs for urinary stone disease.
Diet and pharmacologic interventions for preventing future kidney stone episodes are effective, and these
interventions are made over a lifetime due to kidney stone disease as a chronic condition. The interventions can
be burdensome, have side effects, and have associated costs. Clinical guideline panels disagree on whether
clinicians should perform selective therapy: performing 24-hour urine testing to guide choosing interventions to
correct abnormal urinary parameters. The alternative strategy is empiric therapy: applying interventions without
24-hour urine testing. No trials have compared selective versus empiric pharmacologic intervention strategies to
reduce kidney stone recurrence risk. In contrast, diet studies to date comparing these two strategies have had
methodologic flaws limiting their interpretation.
Our overall goal is to compare the effectiveness and safety of selective and empiric strategies for kidney stone
prevention. The primary outcomes will be mean calculated supersaturations of calcium oxalate and calcium
phosphate. Aim 1 will perform a randomized clinical trial of selective versus empiric diet and pharmacologic on
therapy patients with presumed idiopathic calcium stones The empiric group will have pre-assigned diet
recommendations and daily thiazide with potassium citrate, whereas the selective group will be prescribed an
individualized diet and medication regimen as guided by 24-hour urine testing. Secondary outcomes will
evaluate other urinary parameters and adverse events related to the interventions. Aim 2 will evaluate adverse
effects from selective and empiric strategies and assess patient adherence. The contribution of the proposed
research is expected to be identifying what preventative strategies work best among kidney stone patients, who
are all at risk for kidney stone recurrence."

It is known that patients with type 1 autoimmune diabetes (T1D) have altered gut microbiota, and potentially
pathogenic bacteria, which are increased, have been much studied. However, less is known of the impact
on the host immune system, and in particular on immune regulation, of the bacterial species, which are
significantly reduced. We hypothesized that the reduced bacterial species are associated with the lack of
immune tolerance in T1D, especially the bacterial species that are commonly present in both the gut and
oral cavity. Taking advantage of availability of germ free animals and a pure V dispar strain from human
oral cavity, we tested this hypothesis by using V. dispar to colonize germ-free (GF) mice and assessed the
effect of V. dispar on immune cells. It is intriguing that we found that V. dispar promoted Treg cells in most
of the peripheral lymphoid tissues examined and the majority of the Treg cells expressed neuropilin-1 and a
higher frequency of the Tregs were IL-10 producers. These in vivo effects of V. dispar could also be
mirrored in vitro with direct contact of immune cells to V. dispar. V. dispar induced Tregs are ready to
suppress naturally primed diabetogenic T cells in vitro. More importantly, V. dispar ameliorated the severity
of insulitis in NOD mice. Further, V. dispar produce high level of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate
and propionate. In addition, V. dispar markedly improved gut permeability. Moreover, the induction of
Tregs and IL-10 producers, as well as improvement of gut permeability by V. dispar were found when tested
in both GF-NOD and GF-B6 mouse strains, suggesting that V. dispar has a general immune regulatory
effect.. Our preliminary data are compelling, and lead us to hypothesize that V. dispar are important in
maintaining immune regulation, and hence immune tolerance. We propose the 3 specific aims to test our
hypothesis using GF NOD and GF B6 mice, as well as the mouse strains in which dendritic cells or Tregs or
short chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor are specifically targeted (commercially available). Our approach
using V. dispar as a model system will also signpost the study of other bacteria species that were markedly
reduced in the gut of patients with T1D. If our hypothesis is proved to be correct, our study will help with the
design of future novel therapy for T1D and other autoimmune disorders, for which, we will “return“ to human
studies."

Poxviruses are a large group of human pathogens that include the causative agent of smallpox, Monkeypox, and
Cowpox. As poxvirus immunity around the world wanes there has been a concomitant increase in poxviral
disease, leading to a growing need for small molecule therapeutics that protect against poxviral disease. There
are several investigational drugs that have been used to treat cases of orthopoxvirus infection and one has been
recently approved by the FDA for limited use, but viral resistance to this compound has been noted. The WHO,
CDC and other agencies have stated a strong desire for at least two small molecule therapeutics that broadly
target poxviruses due to the high perceived risk of poxviral disease both from endemic exposure as well as the
potential purposeful release of smallpox as a bioterror agent. This goal has not yet been met.
We have identified a family of non-nucleoside small molecules (“PDPMs”) that show broad spectrum antipoxviral
activity and low/no toxicity to cells and suppress viral mRNA production. Our current data suggests is that the
drug is targeting the poxvirus RNA polymerase (RNAP), which would be an ideal target that is highly conserved
across all poxviruses.
Through this proposal we will probe the potential of PDPMs to become effective antivirals, using medicinal
chemistry approaches to identify compounds with high potency and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. To aid
and complement the therapeutic development of these molecules, we will use genetic, biochemical and chemical
approaches to determine the target of the compound and the mechanism by which it blocks viral replication.
Following the identification of high potency, pharmacologically favorable compounds, we will test their efficacy
in animal models of poxvirus disease. These experiments will be carried out through an ongoing collaboration at
the CDC. The CDC will oversee testing of PDPMs against smallpox and in efficacy determination in animal
models of poxviral disease.
When these efforts are completed they will enable advanced (towards first-in-human) testing of a new class of
poxvirus inhibitor – an inhibitor that has a mechanism of action complementary to the existing FDA approved
compound and a broad protection profile, fulfilling the need for multi-compound protection from these significant
human pathogens."

Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are stressful places fraught with grief and potentially traumatic exposures for those
witnessing a critically ill family member in pain, struggling to breathe, maintain consciousness, and stay alive.
Compounding their distress, family caregivers are often thrust into the position of patient “surrogate,” needing
to make life-and-death decisions on the patient's behalf. We have shown that end-of-life (EoL) decision-making
is compromised by elevated symptoms of distressing and disabling grief, resulting in family surrogates making
suboptimal EoL choices that often prolong patient suffering, further exacerbating surrogates' grief, trauma, and
regrets. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made this bad situation worse, particularly among Black,
Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Prior efforts to address the plight of these family surrogates have
proved disappointing, with some significantly worsening surrogates' psychological trauma. Yet these were not
psychological interventions, much less ones using psychological techniques with proven efficacy. To address
these shortcomings, we developed a brief, flexibly administered intervention applying empirically supported
cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-based techniques. In an R21 pilot, this intervention, EMPOWER
(Enhancing & Mobilizing the POtential for Wellness & Emotional Resilience), dramatically reduced experiential
avoidance, grief, and traumatic stress, and was associated with higher rates of advance care planning,
including among BIPOC. The proposed multisite, mixed-methods trial will randomize 172 family surrogates to
receive EMPOWER (N=86) or a standardized supportive conversation (SC; N=86) delivered via
videoconferencing. Surrogate symptoms will be assessed pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and
3- and 12-months post-intervention. The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of EMPOWER to
SC. We hypothesize that, compared to SC, EMPOWER will yield significantly greater declines in H1a.
surrogate grief and posttraumatic stress (primary outcomes) and H1b. experiential avoidance, depression,
regrets, and increase patients' receipt of value concordant care (secondary outcomes). The secondary aim of
this study is to contextualize quantitative RCT results. H2. Qualitative interviews will provide complementary
data on perceived barriers to and facilitators of symptom improvement, dissemination, and implementation, as
well as insights into the impact of medical mistrust, perceived discrimination and COVID-19 on outcomes. The
third aim will explore experiential avoidance as a mediator of intervention effects: H3. Reductions in experien-
tial avoidance will mediate reductions in grief and posttraumatic stress. This study is expected to confirm
EMPOWER's efficacy and enhance understanding of ways to improve telehealth delivery to psychologically
vulnerable and historically underserved surrogates. If successful, EMPOWER will address the urgent need for
effective, culturally competent interventions for distressed surrogates, which may improve critically ill patients'
EoL experience in the context of extreme challenges that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic."

10812223,"Project Summary
Tissue regeneration and repair is essential for maintaining physiological homeostasis and relies on the precise
control of molecular networks that regulate, or are regulated by, the vasculature. Endothelial cells (ECs) present
in the blood and lymphatic vessels (i.e., BECs and LECs, respectively) are crucial participants in the vascular-
dependent processes that restore damaged tissue, because they control the secretion of paracrine factors from
both the vessels themselves and nearby cells. However, the mechanisms by which ECs govern the activity of
other cellular components that participate in the recovery of injured tissues have yet to be adequately
characterized. The long-term goal of our lab is to elucidate the fundamental processes that regulate blood- and
lymphatic-vessel function and to understand how disruption of these mechanisms leads to pathological vascular
defects. We have previously shown that in mice, global homozygous knockout mutations of Foxc1 and/or Foxc2
are associated with vascular anomalies; however, the mutations also lead to embryonic or perinatal lethality, so
attempts to determine how the two Foxc genes function in adult animals have generally been inconclusive. To
overcome this limitation, we generated a line of mice carrying tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell (EC)-specific,
compound Foxc1;Foxc2 mutations (i.e., EC-Foxc-DKO mice), and the results from preliminary investigations
with these animals indicate that the mutations impair regeneration of the small intestine after ischemia-
reperfusion (I/R) injury by causing defects in (1) the regrowth of intestinal blood and lymphatic vessels, (2) the
formation of subepithelial stromal cells (e.g., telocytes), (3) the expression of CXCL12 and R-spondin3 in
intestinal BECs and LECs, respectively and (4) activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in intestinal stem cells
(ISCs). CXCL12 is known to regulate angiogenesis, while R-spondin3 protects mice from vascular leakage, and
the two factors cooperatively stimulate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which subsequently regulates the
proliferation of ISCs. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the transcriptional activity of Foxc1/c2 in BECs and
LECs contributes to vascular repair and intestinal regeneration by regulating CXCL12 and R-spondin3 signaling.
We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the two Specific Aims: (1) To determine whether Foxc1 and Foxc2
are required for repair of the intestinal vasculature during recovery from intestinal injury, (2) To determine the
mechanisms by which Foxc1 and Foxc2 regulate blood vessel recovery and intestinal regeneration, and (3) To
determine whether Foxc1 and Foxc2 regulate lymphatic vessel recovery and intestinal regeneration. In summary,
the experiments described in this proposal will provide crucial information about how Foxc1/c2 expression in
vascular ECs contributes to intestinal repair and regeneration. Furthermore, since vascular deficiencies
contribute to a variety of ischemic disorders, our findings may have important implications for other ischemic
conditions that are associated with impairments in tissue regeneration, such as cardiovascular disease."

The Michigan Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring (MI PRAMS) project is an ongoing, annual,
population-based survey of Michigan mothers who had a pregnancy that ended with a live birth. The
goals of MI PRAMS are to ask these mothers about their knowledge, attitudes, and health behaviors
before, during, and after pregnancy. Special attention is devoted to social determinants of health and
health disparities. The project aims are to conduct the survey using sound methodology, provide high
quality population-level data to the survey stakeholders, and help improve the health of Michigan's
mothers and babies.
Mothers are selected for MI PRAMS in a stratified manner from all birth certificates filed during a
calendar year and are contacted by mail and by telephone. MI PRAMS over-samples from mothers
who had a low birth weight infant, from African American mothers, and from mothers in the Southeast
region of the State that contains Detroit and other socioeconomically diverse areas. Our intent with
this sampling strategy is to learn as much as possible from mothers who have already had a
pregnancy that resulted in a poor outcome for the infant (e.g., low birth weight). We also have greater
representation from mothers more likely to have negative complications during and after their
pregnancy, and from those whose infants are more likely to have poor health outcomes.
MI PRAMS data are used by many departments within the State for tracking trends over time,
evaluating the effect of public health interventions, and for allocating resources and attention. The
data will also be utilized by researchers who wish to understand how factors from pregnancy and
infancy affect health throughout the lifespan. In addition to asking about long standing issues such as
pregnancy intention, breastfeeding duration, safe sleep habits, and prenatal care, the next phase of
MI PRAMS will cover emerging topics of public health interest. Mothers will be asked about:
 • How the coronavirus pandemic affected their household during pregnancy
 • Use of prescription pain relievers and cannabis before, during, and after pregnancy
 • The degree of support provided by their partner or spouse
 • Adverse experiences from her own childhood
 • Plans and intention to vaccinate her new baby
 • The quantity and quality of sleep she has at the time of the interview (3-6 postnatal months)
The answers from these and other questions will help MI PRAMS to not only monitor the health of
mothers and babies in the State, but to equip public health professionals with the knowledge to make
positive changes in the health of future generations."

valve replacement (TAVR) in order to optimize the management of patients with aortic valve diseases. The
objective of this application is to determine how patient-specific hematological, physiological and procedural
factors promote platelet-driven procoagulant and inflammatory complications in TAVR. Our central hypothesis is
that patient-specific biochemical and blood flow features in TAVR support the activation of platelet signaling
responses, which promote procoagulant platelet generation and responses underlying transcatheter heart valve
(THV) complications and degeneration. This hypothesis is rooted in our preliminary data that: 1) activated
platelets adhere to THVs in vivo in a manner related to subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT); 2) GPVI-mediated
platelet procoagulant signaling responses and fibrin formation are upregulated in TAVR patients; 3) patient-
specific shear and stasis features of THV expansion and placement promote procoagulant platelet generation
ex vivo; and, 4) THV materials upregulate procoagulant platelet generation in vivo in non-human primates. Our
team of scientists, engineers and physicians has pioneered experimental approaches well-suited to define how
patient-specific biochemical and anatomic factors support procoagulant platelet generation and other blood cell
activities underlying complications in TAVR. We propose a set of hypothesis-driven studies to define how patient-
specific biochemical and anatomic factors support blood cell activities underlying thrombosis-related
complications in TAVR using blood samples from patients undergoing TAVR, as well as blood from in vitro and
ex vivo TAVR models, including: 1) quantitative proteomics methods to define platelet phenotypes at
unprecedented molecular depth and resolution; 2) in vitro flow loop systems to specify effects of individualized
THV configuration and blood biochemistry on THV failure; 3) ex vivo non-human primate models with
translational relevance to THV biocompatibility; and, 4) PET imaging methods to follow platelet:THV interactions
in TAVR patients in vivo. Building on these innovative experimental approaches, we will determine how patient-
specific platelet features contribute to SLT in TAVR (Aim 1); how patient-specific features of aorta anatomy, THV
placement and hemodynamics increase procoagulant platelet generation to drive leaflet thrombosis, leaflet
thickening and THV degeneration in TAVR (Aim 2); and how to target procoagulant platelet mechanisms in THV
thrombogenesis to prevent SLT (Aim 3). Successful completion of these Aims will elucidate patient-specific
mechanisms of THV failure and will have a significant positive impact on human health by advancing efforts to
manage a rapidly growing population of aortic stenosis and TAVR patients at risk of short- and long-term blood
cell-driven complications and mortality."

 The Rutgers University Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) serves as a central facility to perform
biosafety level three (BSL3) therapeutic, pathogenesis, and diagnostic research on high threat biological agents
with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2, as well as other category A, B, and C pathogens.
The RBL serves academic and commercial entities within Rutgers University, the Northeast United States and
nationally, while also engaging globally with companies and academic institutions through collaborations and
research contracts. This proposal will provide support that enhances the RBL’s ability to fulfill its research and
biothreat response/pandemic preparedness missions while also supporting an expanding faculty/staff. We
propose to accomplish these goals by improving the RBL facilities, support services, BSL3 practice development
and implementation and special services offerings though the execution of three aims: Aim 1. Establish a Facility
management, maintenance and operations (FMMO) core. Aim 2. Establish a BSL-3 Practices core (Practice
core). Aim 3. Establish a biocontainment research support service core devoted to developing animal models of
BSL3 pathogens and associated support services (Animal models and related services, or AMRS core). The
FMMO core will provide BSL3 and ABSL3 services, management and oversight, for routine animal husbandry,
microbiology and virology services in support of investigators grant funded research projects while ensuring
efficient operations and maintenance of the BSL3 facilities and providing trained staff to support the BSL3
building systems and equipment. The Practice core will develop and maintain standard operating procedures
and training for research in the RBL BSL3 laboratories including best practices, emergency response, waste
management, shipping, husbandry, select agent-specific practices and inventory. It will also develop and conduct
biosecurity and disaster drills and liaise with other BSL3 laboratories within the RBL network as well as local,
state and federal health agencies to coordinate operations and plan for joint responses to new infectious disease
threats. The AMRS core will develop critical animal models including those of SARS-CoV2 and highly pathogenic
influenza virus transmission, COVID-19 PASC, pulmonary impairment after TB (PIAT), and drug treatment
models, and then support grant funded investigators in the performance of these models along with the advanced
instrumentation needed to analyze these infected models and their tissues/cells in a BSL3 environment.
Together, these three cores will significantly enhance the near- and long-term abilities of the RBL to address
critical biothreats and emerging infectious diseases requiring study in a BSL3 laboratory setting, while also
increasing our capacity to respond to the next public health emergency or pandemic."

Down syndrome (DS), or Trisomy 21, is the most frequent chromosomal abnormality in humans, resulting from
a complete or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. Clinically, DS is identified after birth through the recognition
of specific physical characteristics such as flat nasal bridge and midface, decreased muscle tone, clinodactyly,
and short neck with excess skin at the back. Additionally, children and adults with DS have a higher likelihood of
gastrointestinal dysfunction that markedly affects quality of life. While our understanding of the underlying
cognitive and other central effects in DS have been studied for many years, our understanding of the
gastrointestinal effects in these patients in still quite rudimentary. Gut motility is controlled by the interdependent
actions of enteric neurons (ENS), interstitial cells of Cajal, and smooth muscle cells. Investigation of the enteric
nervous system in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS (a well-established mouse model of Trisomy 21)
demonstrates that these mice have ENS neurons throughout the bowel, including in distal colon, and that
longitudinal migration of enteric neural crest–derived cells during development is normal. However, adult Ts65Dn
mice demonstrate reduced colonic motility. Our overarching hypothesis is that downregulation of ionic
conductances, specifically, smooth muscle voltage-gated calcium channels by increased oxidative stress results
in reduced contractility. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in the adolescent (PND 25) and young adult
(PND65) Ts65Dn and their disomic littermates. In the first specific aim, we will conduct isometric tension
recordings of distal smooth muscle strips in response to neuronal stimulation, acetylcholine induced contractions
and calcium influx. In the second specific aim, we will test the hypothesis that trisomy 21 results in altered
voltage-gated calcium currents (VGCCs) in smooth muscle in the distal colon, leading to altered smooth muscle
motility. We propose to test all aspects of this hypothesis at levels spanning from in vitro gastrointestinal motility
assays, to VGCCs functional alterations on individual smooth muscle cells in adolescence and in adults. This
comprehensive approach will enhance validation and interpretation of findings through comparisons across
these systems, enhancing scientific rigor. Our closely integrated, multidisciplinary, research plan is intended to
establish for the first time a generalized framework to understand the mechanisms underlying karyotype-induced
changes of bowel smooth muscle function in adolescence and in adulthood using a well-established mouse
model of DS. Because these mechanisms are potentially shared across other gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g.
Hirschsprung’s disease), these studies may define a common thread spanning multiple diseases. These newly-
defined mechanisms could then be targeted for therapeutic intervention by, e.g., manipulating VGCCs directly
or through intervention of newly-defined downstream pathways altered by these interactions."
10791238,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although static neck braces are prescribed to patients with dropped head syndrome, a condition that results
from diverse causes (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), many patients do not use these neck braces because
they are static, uncomfortable, and ineffective. As a result, patients leave their head drop condition untreated,
which worsens their ability to breathe, swallow, speak, and perform other daily tasks. The long-term goal is to
treat dropped head syndrome by restoring head-neck motions through an at-home, personalized, and easy-to-
use wearable robotic solution (e.g., neck exoskeleton). The overall objective in this application is to determine
general models to predict head-neck movements in different gaze conditions (e.g., smooth pursuit, saccade)
and a personalization strategy for a gaze-controlled neck exoskeleton in people with dropped head syndrome.
The central hypothesis is that eye movements can reliably predict head movements in diverse situations and that
preferences of people with dropped head syndrome can be learned via minimal and accessible human-robot
interaction, leading to personalized control strategies for the neck exoskeleton. The rationale for this project is
that a determination of effectiveness of predictive models and associated personalization strategies using eye
gaze is likely to offer a powerful scientific platform for future development in neck exoskeletons and transla-
tional trials in people with dropped head syndrome. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) Identify predictive model(s) of head-neck motions using gaze; and 2) Determine a personaliza-
tion strategy for gaze control in people with dropped head syndrome. Under the first aim, head-eye behaviors
will be observed in virtual environments and the data will be used to create models that predict head-neck
motions using eye movements for diverse gaze behaviors (e.g., smooth pursuit, saccade). For the second aim,
three proposed personalization algorithms will be developed and evaluated in a user study to determine the
most effective strategy for personalizing gaze-control of a neck exoskeleton for patients with dropped head
syndrome. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it focuses
on achieving an easy-to-use control through user’s natural gaze behavior and a continued human-in-the-loop
personalization strategy. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific
justification for continued development of the gaze-controlled neck exoskeleton and future clinical trials that
are aimed to eventually translate the neck exoskeleton technology to use at patients’ homes. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for better treatment for dropped head syndrome."

The long-term objectives of this proposal are: 1) to evaluate a biobehavioral model of alcohol use disorder
(AUD) in young adults with recent high-risk drinking (≥ 4 drinks/day or ≥ 8/week for women, ≥ 5 drinks/day or ≥
15/week for men) and high lifetime exposure to stressors, and 2) to leverage sleep and circadian function to
promote mental health. These objectives are consistent with two key priorities of the National Institute of
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): 1) identify mechanisms of AUDs, and 2) improve prevention and
treatment for alcohol misuse. The proposed model of AUD posits that sleep duration and/or timing moderate
the effects of stressful life events on high-risk alcohol use by disrupting reward- and stress-related brain
function. The research approach uses two complementary study designs to evaluate the proposed model: 1)
an observational study (n=150) that will assess the degree to which short and late sleep predict later reward-
and stress-related brain function and alcohol use, and 2) an experimental study (n=100) that will evaluate the
extent to which sleep duration and timing affect reward- and stress-related brain function and alcohol use. The
sample includes young adults (18-24 years of age) with recent high-risk drinking and high lifetime exposure to
stressors (≥20 stressors on a lifetime stress and adversity inventory). Recruitment will be stratified to include
young adults with short and late sleep (weekday sleep duration ≤ 6 h & midpoint ≥ 4 am; n=100) versus long
and early sleep (weekday sleep duration ≥ 8h & midpoint ≤ 2:30 am; n=50). Both studies include measurement
of daily sleep and stressful events for 2 weeks; subsequent laboratory measures of reward- and stress-related
brain function and sleep and circadian characteristics; and self-report measures of alcohol use during daily
monitoring and 2-month follow-up. The experimental study includes random assignment of young adults with
short and late sleep from the observational study to 2 weeks of either: 1) 90 min extension and advance of
sleep opportunity and timing (n=50); or 2) typical sleep opportunity and timing (n=50). This research approach
will accomplish three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the extent to which sleep duration and/or timing predict reward-
and stress-related brain function, and moderate the effects of stressful life events; 2) Establish the extent to
which sleep duration and/or timing affect reward- and stress-related brain function, and moderate the effects of
stressful life events; and 3) Determine the extent to which changes in reward- or stress-related brain function
mediate the associations between sleep duration and/or timing and alcohol use. The investigative team has
expertise in the etiology and prevention of AUD in young adults, including specific expertise in the impact of
sleep and stressful life events on the stress and reward systems that contribute to AUD. All three investigators
are also licensed psychologists who are committed to translating research on the mechanisms of
psychopathology to preventative interventions."

This project is to elucidate the role of inflammation and perturbations of the brain glial-based
lymphatic (glymphatic) pathway in carbon monoxide (CO)-induced brain injuries. Based on
preliminary data we hypothesize that astrocyte-derived microparticles (MPs) expressing
thrombospindin-1 play a causal role in CO-induced neuropathology that includes glymphatic
dysfunction. Further, once these MPs are liberated to the bloodstream they activate circulating
neutrophils that sequester along the neurovasculature to exacerbate inflammation, leading to
functional neurological deficits. Specific aims are: (1) Assess glymphatic function in response to
CO in mice by MRI and fluorescence microscopy; (2) Identify the role of glymphatic outflow to
CO-neuropathology in mice; (3) Determine the relationship of neuroinflammation and glymphatic
dysfunction to functional deficits; (4) Evaluate associations of morbidity in CO poisoned patients
with MPs elevations and intra-particle pro-inflammatory agents."
10793516,"Project Summary
 Chronic pain and mood disorders are highly comorbid, particularly in patients with a history of early life
stress (ELS) or trauma. In patients with Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS), the severity of ELS
has been associated with a centralized pain phenotype with patients reporting greater widespread pain and
negative mood, and reduced likelihood of symptom improvement. Neuroimaging studies revealed functional
connectivity changes that may specifically predispose UCPPS patients with ELS to greater symptom burden
and comorbidity. ELS has also been correlated with reductions in hippocampal gray matter volume and
increased DNA methylation on stress-responsive genes, particularly in patients with major depressive disorder,
a common comorbidity of UCPPS. The hippocampus negatively regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis, which mediates the stress response and is often altered in patients with centralized pain disorders.
Voluntary exercise is an effective treatment for most mood and centralized pain disorders and significantly
increases hippocampal neurogenesis and has been shown to impact epigenetic modifications. Our mouse
model of ELS using neonatal maternal separation (NMS) demonstrates urogenital hypersensitivity, increased
bladder output, widespread allodynia, impaired reward behaviors, and evidence of altered hippocampal
regulation of the HPA axis. These outcomes can be exacerbated by acute exposure to water avoidance stress
(WAS) in adulthood and attenuated by voluntary wheel running. Here we provide preliminary evidence of
reduced hippocampal gray matter volume, DNA methylation, and blunted neurochemical signals following
WAS, suggesting that reduced hippocampal integrity may be driving the NMS-related outcomes, similar to
what has been observed in clinical populations. Our central hypothesis is that ELS-induced changes in the
hippocampus can be modified by increasing physical activity, thereby attenuating urogenital and widespread
hypersensitivity. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. Our first specific aim will determine whether
increasing physical activity can prevent structural and neurochemical changes in the hippocampus and
susceptibility to acute stress exposure in NMS mice. Our second specific aim will determine the impact of DNA
methylation in the hippocampus on NMS-related outcomes and whether this process can be attenuated by
increasing physical activity. At the completion of this project we will have gained novel and important
information on the impact of ELS on hippocampal integrity, which we have identified as a potential integrator of
centralized pain and comorbid mood disorders. Determining how increasing voluntary physical activity impacts
ELS-related hippocampal and sensitivity changes will provide further evidence for the use of exercise as a
powerful non-pharmacologic therapeutic intervention for treating UCPPS patients with a history of ELS and
possibly preventing the development of symptoms in at-risk populations."

Every 20 minutes in the United States, a newborn is born exposed to opioids. Approximately 50-80% of these
newborns will develop Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), characterized by autonomic instability,
hyperactivity, irritability, tremors, abnormal cry, and difficulty feeding and sleeping. Standard of care dictates
that these newborns should be placed on a 96-hour “hold” in the hospital for observation of NOWS. However,
this prolonged hospital stay can lead to both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment and even
longer hospitalization. For newborns that do develop NOWS, evidence suggests that non-pharmacological
interventions could reduce the symptoms of NOWS if intervention is implemented before symptoms of NOWS
are detected. The goal of this proposal is to test four novel, noninvasive clinical predictors of NOWS in
newborns and as markers of neurodevelopmental impairment at 6 and 18 months: Newborn neurobehavioral
assessments, newborn cry, prenatal substance exposure measured via maternal hair, and adverse
socioeconomic environments. We correctly identified 86.1% of newborns diagnosed with NOWS using our
NNNS and cry data in our pilot studies. If replicated, these findings could lead to personalized treatment
regimens and improved care for newborns. The identification of these factors could also provide insights into
the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of NOWS. We will conduct longitudinal neurodevelopmental
assessments at 6 and 18 months to determine whether these markers predict developmental impairment at
these ages. We will also examine whether a diagnosis of NOWS predicts neurodevelopmental impairment at 6
and 18 months. These data will provide clinicians and caregivers with valuable information about the extent to
which a NOWS diagnosis portends difficulties in cognitive, motor, or language development in infancy and
toddlerhood. We will enroll 312 newborns and their caregivers across two sites: Women and Infants Hospital of
Rhode Island and the University of Utah Hospital. Both sites have begun collecting pilot data and have
demonstrated success in recruiting 8 newborns/month. The MPIs have an almost 10-year history of
collaboration and have published over 20 articles together. In both sites they have established high recruitment
and retention rates. The scientific aims of this study are complimented and informed by a carefully designed
recruitment and retention plan, and protection of human subjects protocol intended to minimize risk to all
participants and provide appropriate resources to caregivers and newborns. When our aims are realized, we
will have generated novel and objective predictors of NOWS onset and severity, as well as
neurodevelopmental impairment at 6 and 18 months. This longitudinal study will establish a cohort of newborns
with prenatal opioid exposure that we plan to retain for long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up into childhood.
We also address one of the most pressing societal and health issues of our time, the opioid crisis, to generate
data that could lead to reductions in the severity of NOWS."
10794354,"The cell envelope lies at the interface of bacterial pathogens and their host. It contains unique polymers that are recognized by the innate immune system, and it is where key virulence factors are embedded. The cell envelope and the biogenesis pathways that build it are also targets of many of our most effective antibiotic and vaccine therapies. Because cell envelope biogenesis has been such a successful target, it has been an active area of research for over half a century. Most of the genes responsible for the synthesis and remodeling of the different surface polymers have been identified and their biochemical activities characterized. However, a major gap in our knowledge is how these different pathways are coordinated with each other and how the cell monitors the envelope for defects and directs their repair. This proposal focuses on investigating the coordination between the synthesis of the distinct surface polymers and the repair of the envelope using the model gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis.
The gram-positive cell envelope is composed of distinct layers of surface polymers. Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) are linked to the membrane. The multi-layered cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) is released from the membrane and the distinct anionic polymers called wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are attached to it. Cell growth requires that these envelope layers are synthesized coordinately, but the mechanisms underlying this coordination remain poorly understood. In preliminary work, I discovered that a conserved enzymes that transfers WTA onto PG contains an extracellular intrinsically disorder region (IDR). My data and previous studies in my host lab suggest that these regions direct the transferase to gaps or defects in the cell wall meshwork to fortify them with WTAs. The goals of this proposal are (1) to establish how gram-positive bacteria monitor and repair their cell envelope layers and (2) use directed and unbiased approaches to investigate the interplay between the assembly of the PG and the teichoic acids. 
This project will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. David Rudner in the Department of Microbiology at Harvard Medical School. I will be closely mentored by Dr. Rudner and will be embedded within a rich and collegial scientific community committed to scientific exchange and discovery. The formative training and connections that I make during my fellowship will be instrumental in launching my future career as an independent research investigator."
10793417,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of episodic memories. The current predominant
hypothesis is that memories are gradually established across distributed cortical networks under the influence
of hippocampal activity. Dopamine influences memory processing by signaling the motivational salience of
behaviorally relevant stimuli and by modulating the plasticity of cortical and hippocampal circuits. However, our
understanding of the impact of hippocampal inputs and dopaminergic modulation on cortical circuits during
memory processing remains incomplete. Here we propose to use two-photon imaging to characterize the
evolution of hippocampal inputs, dopamine dynamics, and neuronal responses in the auditory cortex
throughout the formation of associative auditory memories. In addition, we will measure the plasticity of
hippocampal inputs and their modulation by dopamine in vivo. Finally, we propose to use a combination of
optogenetic and pharmacological perturbations of the hippocampal inputs and dopamine levels in the auditory
cortex to determine their functional role in the learning and consolidation of auditory memories. Characterizing
hippocampal-cortical interactions and their neuromodulation is of fundamental importance for understanding
the circuit mechanisms underlying memory formation and can provide the foundation for elucidating how these
mechanisms are perturbed in memory disorders."
10793667,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer and usually fatal within a year after diagnosis. Current
treatment approaches provide only a modest, few months, life extension. Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells (TIM)
provide strong impact on tumor growth, dispersal and treatment resistance. The current unmet need in GBM
treatment is to address the TIM contribution on tumor growth and treatment resistance in treatment protocols.
The goal of the study is to identify molecular targets for the GBM treatment approaches aimed at modulation of
tumor immune microenvironment.
Our recent studies identified significant up-regulation of Proline-Rich Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Pyk2) in GBM tumors,
compared with healthy brain tissue, as well as, a positive correlation between Pyk2 activation in tumor cells and
cytokines expression profile of TIM. Additionally, both tumor resection and temozolomide treatment up-regulate
Pyk2 in GBM tumors and affect activation state of TIM. This identified Pyk2 as a candidate prognostic marker
for the immune state in GBM tumor microenvironment. Preliminary studies in GL261 glioma cells identified that
cells, knocked out for Pyk2, do not release the population of EVs with diameter bigger them 600nm and reduce
expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCL2), CCL12 and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF)
in EV fraction, compared with Pyk2WT cells. Correspondingly, increase of CD86+/CD206+ inflammatory myeloid
cell and CD8+ lymphocytes populations were found in TIMs, purified from Pyk2KO tumors, compared with Pyk2WT
tumors, in GL261/C57Bl/6 mouse glioma implantation model. Based on these findings we hypothesize that
Pyk2 is involved in signaling regulation of release of inflammatory cytokines CCL2, CCL12 and CCL5 through
the EVs mechanism, leading to modulation of TIM cells polarization. In this study we will utilize mouse glioma
implantation model and primary human GBM cell cultures, with high and low levels of Pyk2 expression, coupled
with cell biology approaches, to dissect the role of Pyk2 in regulation of biogenesis and cytokines content of
glioma cell derived EVs. We will also examine, in mouse and human in vitro models, the modulation of activation
state of microglial cells through the glioma-derived EV mechanism. The purpose of the project is to identify
mechanisms of interaction between glioma and TIM cells and the role of Pyk2 signaling in this communication.
To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. To investigate the role of Pyk2 in release of cytokines through the EV mechanism in GBM cells.
Specific Aim2. To investigate the role of Pyk2 in regulation of actin-related release of EVs populations.
Specific Aim3. To assess the role of vesicular Pyk2 in EV internalization by microglial cells."
10794991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Proper regulation of gene expression is required for determining and maintaining cellular identity and for
responding to the extracellular environment. In eukaryotes, this entails a multi-step pathway for mRNA from
transcription to translation and eventual degradation, and cellular responses to changing conditions often induce
highly coordinated changes in many of these steps. The response to adverse stress conditions, such as lack of
nutrients or oxidative stress, is often necessary in a wide diversity of organisms in order to ensure cell survival.
Given its large energy requirements, changes in protein translation play a particularly critical role in cellular stress
responses, resulting in altered translation of thousands of genes. This response also becomes misregulated in
the pathologies of a number of diseases. Notably, the ability to circumvent translation regulation during stress is
a hallmark of cancer progression that promotes continued cell growth, and alterations to stress responses and
the translation machinery also contribute to aging. Despite these disease links, how these massive changes to
translation are regulated is not well understood.
 Ded1 is a conserved RNA helicase that plays critical roles in translation initiation. Alterations in the human
homolog of Ded1, DDX3, have been found in a number of cancers, including the pediatric brain cancer
medulloblastoma and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Mutations of DDX3 are also linked to a cognitive
developmental disorder, and DDX3 is involved in replication of several viruses, including HIV. These findings
underscore the importance of understanding the normal functioning of Ded1/DDX3 since this can also shed light
on its disease-associated functioning. In steady-state conditions, Ded1 stimulates translation initiation; however,
recent research has revealed that Ded1 has a major role in the repression of translation during stress conditions,
specifically when the TOR pathway, the central nutrient-sensor of the cell, is inactivated. This proposal explores
this function of Ded1 and associated factors in controlling the translational response to cellular stress.
 Specifically, Aim I will characterize the stress function of Ded1 in response to TOR pathway inactivation.
The mechanism of this role, which involves remodeling and degradation of the critical translation scaffolding
factor eIF4G, will be defined, and the downstream consequences of this mechanism on translation of specific
mRNAs will be determined. Upstream regulators and accessory factors for Ded1 and eIF4G during stress will
also be identified and characterized. Aim II will then examine Ded1 involvement in another part of the stress
response, the formation of stress granules, cytoplasmic accumulations of mRNA and associated proteins. It will
also test whether the stress response is affected in cells containing Ded1/DDX3 mutations associated with
medulloblastoma. This work will greatly enhance our understanding of the translational response to cellular
stress and will inform future studies of its misregulation in cancer and other diseases."

Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able
to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with

and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose
to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations
with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational

than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A)
social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are

Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria produce pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that
stimulate innate immune responses in their eukaryotic hosts via pattern-recognition receptors such as toll-like
receptors. Virulence factors of pathogens provide additional signals that allow the innate immune system to
differentiate between harmless commensals and pathogens. These signals include virulence factors, such as
Type III and Type IV secretion systems that translocate effector proteins into the host cell. Collectively, these
processes are detected by the immune system as “patterns of pathogenesis” and can activate cytosolic signaling
pathways. Brucella abortus is a stealthy pathogen expressing modified PAMPs that no longer serve as agonists
for pattern recognition receptors. As a result, host responses generated during B. abortus infection are entirely
dependent on detecting the function of its T4SS, as a pathogen-induced process. Here we propose to use this
organism to interrogate novel innate immune signaling pathways linking perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum
function to inflammation. The objectives of this application are to determine how activation of the IRE1α pathway
of the host cell’s unfolded protein response influences the outcome of infection with intracellular bacteria, by
eliciting inflammatory responses and providing inputs that drive survival or death of the infected cell. The
proposed research will test the hypothesis is that in macrophages, a NOD1/NOD2-containing signaling complex
detects perturbation of ER function during B. abortus infection to induce inflammatory responses and promote
survival of infected macrophages, while in a secretory cell type infection-induced ER stress triggers immunogenic
cell death, resulting in placentitis and abortion. Successful completion of this work will move the field forward by
determining how cells detects pathogen-induced perturbation of ER function and how the resulting response
drives cell survival vs cell death outcomes in different cell types. This concept has important ramifications not
only for bacterial pathogenesis, but also for understanding host-virus interactions, innate immunity and the
pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders associated with ER stress, such as type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel
disease and neuroinflammatory disease."

merger of the New York and Long Island Nodes, which had been part of the CTN since 2000 and 2001,
respectively. This fourth competing renewal application builds on both a strong and successful infrastructure to
manage clinical trials, and a track record of innovation and successful implementation of trials in mainstream
healthcare settings where most SUD patients are seen. We contribute expertise in virtually all key CTN

support improved and expanded care; developing medications and behavioral therapies; co-occurring medical
and psychiatric disorders; women and minorities; digital and other technology-based interventions; data
science including novel data analytic approaches; and implementation science, health economics, advocacy,
and policy to sustain evidence-based interventions. In the new funding period, the NYN will lead or co-lead
seven ambitious projects, all scheduled to begin in 2019 or 2020: CTN-0079-A1 Ancillary Study of the Adoption
and Sustainability of ED-Initiated Buprenorphine; CTN-0082 Implementation Survey of PrEP and Opioid Use

10793059,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Michael W. Beck, Eastern Illinois University
Before an orally delivered drug can reach its target in the body it must first be absorbed by the digestive system
and pass through the liver via the hepatic portal system. During this process, the drug is metabolized by enzymes
in these tissues. This metabolism controls the bioavailability of oral drugs; thus the activity and expression levels
of these enzymes is important. Human carboxylesterases (CESs) are highly expressed in the intestines and the
liver and therefore play a key role in controlling the metabolism of many drugs. The overall activity of CESs,
however, can be drastically different from person to person. This interindividual variability has been shown to
influence the metabolism and, in some cases, clinical outcomes of patients treated with drugs that are substrates
for carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). The factors that contribute to CES1 activity variation have not been fully
uncovered, despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism. We believe this lack of knowledge
is due to the scarcity and limitations of currently available approaches to study CES1 activity in live samples. To
address these challenges, this proposal aims to develop and optimize fluorogenic probes that can specifically
report on CES1 activity in live samples. These probes will be deployed to generate chemical biology-based
approaches that can rapidly evaluate small molecules for their potential to interfere with CES1 activity and
determine the influence of CES1 genetic polymorphisms on CES1 activity. The probes and methods created in
this proposal will enable rapid analysis of CES1 activity under different conditions in live cells. The application of
these approaches to study factors that influence CES1-mediated drug metabolism will reveal new risk factors for
ineffective treatment with CES1-substrate drugs. Overall, the studies proposed here uncover factors that
modulate CES1 activity resulting in safer and more effective treatments with CES1-substrate drugs while
providing an excellent training platform for undergraduate students in modern biomedical research."
10799817,"With 6.6 billion episodes and 1.5 million deaths annually, diarrheal diseases remain one of the leading causes of death and disability in both children and adults worldwide. While the vast majority of diarrheal episodes follow a relatively benign course, approximately 35% of cases in younger children and 5% of cases in older children and adults lead to moderate or severe disease requiring advanced medical management. Appropriate rehydration with either oral or intravenous fluids remains the most important step for treating acute diarrhea. Accurate assessment of dehydration status has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality that results from inappropriate rehydration of patients and can also improve the cost-effectiveness of diarrhea management, especially in low resource settings. Yet no validated tools exist for estimating dehydration severity in patients with acute diarrhea across the lifespan. Our prior research derived and internally validated new clinical diagnostic models for dehydration severity both in children under five years of age (DHAKA models) and patients over five years of age (NIRUDAK models) and demonstrated that they were more accurate and reliable than the World Health Organization guidelines, currently the standard of care for managing acute diarrhea in most settings worldwide. We then incorporated our new clinical diagnostic models into a simple mobile health application (mHealth) clinical decision support tool (CDST) that can be used by frontline providers to guide management for patients with acute diarrhea. 
Building upon the success of our prior work, the proposed R01 renewal award research will externally validate the accuracy, reliability, and clinical utility of our novel mHealth CDST in a high diarrheal burden setting (Tanzania). In addition, we will use an implementation science-based approach to better understand the barriers and facilitators to uptake and usage of the mHealth CDST by a variety of different types of healthcare providers in Tanzania. Once validated, our new mHealth CDST has the potential to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. This can potentially improve treatment for the hundreds of millions of patients presenting to healthcare facilities worldwide with acute diarrhea each year."
10799877,"Abstract
Identifying sleep biomarkers that may reveal pathophysiological conditions or the effectiveness of therapeutics
will greatly advance our health care for psychiatric diseases including substance use disorders (SUDs). The
persistent sleep abnormalities following withdrawal from substance use may offer such opportunities. The
Huang lab has demonstrated a close relationship between rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and cocaine
seeking after withdrawal, using a rat model of cocaine self-administration and testing for withdrawal time-
dependent intensification of cue-induced cocaine seeking – so called “incubation of cocaine craving”.
Specifically, sleep interventions that selectively increase REMS after drug withdrawal lead to reduced
incubation, and REMS fragmentation does the opposite. For example, dark-phase REMS restriction that
results in a selective increase in recovery REMS time and bout durations reduces incubation of cocaine
craving, whereas sleep fragmentation does the opposite. Moreover, environmental warming that selectively
increases REMS time and bout durations also reduces incubation after cocaine withdrawal. These results
highlight the importance of understanding REMS mechanisms in regulating drug seeking. To probe for the
mechanisms, the Huang lab identified that the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-producing neurons in
the lateral hypothalamus are an important contributor to the REMS-induced effects. MCH neurons
predominantly fire during REMS. Following cocaine self-administration and withdrawal, MCH neurons exhibit
persistent reduction in membrane excitability and deficient glutamatergic transmission. Moreover,
counteracting cocaine-induced functional impairment in MCH neurons by enhancing their activities in sleep
through environmental warming, chemo-, or optogenetic stimulations decreases incubation after cocaine
withdrawal, with corresponding neurophysiological restorations in the reward circuitry. These results suggest
that MCH neuron activities may provide important functional measures for the anti-relapse effects of REMS. In
recent preliminary studies, the Huang lab discovered a sleep EEG derivative which was strongly correlated
with the real-time MCH neuron Ca2+ activities in vivo. This correlation persisted following cocaine experience
and withdrawal, as well as under different REMS manipulations. This provides a potential means for non-
invasive monitoring of MCH neuron activities in vivo through measuring surface EEG signals. Based on the
extensive published and preliminary results, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that EEG spectrogram
decoded for MCH neuron activities in REMS may produce biomarkers that predict drug-relapse propensity.
The proposed experiments and comprehensive analyses are strategically designed for characterizing and
testing such biomarkers. The anticipated novel biomarkers from this EEG feature are uniquely quantifiable and
versatile, which will have important implications for SUD research and therapeutic development. The outcomes
have high translational potential and are in line with NIH’s Sleep Research Plan (2021)."
10800448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent studies reveal up to half of children with childhood onset atopic dermatitis (AD) may remit
over time, whereas in others, AD worsens with age. AD in childhood often heralds the development of
subsequent comorbidities including asthma, food allergies, skin infections and neurodevelopmental
disorders. It is not known whether the timing or type of treatment for AD alters the natural course of
the disease or modifies the risk of comorbidity development. Therapeutic strategies that prevent or
alter the natural course of AD represent the highest priority research gap as identified by the
International Eczema Council in 2021. This gap aligns with the overarching long-term goal of our
research team to identify and test interventions that prevent the overall burden of AD and
comorbidities in broad and diverse communities. The overall objective of this application, as a critical
step towards our long-term goal, is to develop tools that facilitate patient-centered decentralized
clinical trials investigating the role of early intervention on disease course and comorbidity risk. We
will achieve this objective by completing the following aims: Aim 1) Determine the feasibility and
accuracy of identifying new-onset AD remotely in a community-based high-risk pediatric cohort using
parent/guardian-reported validated diagnostic criteria with photographic documentation using a novel
mobile application; and Aim 2) Determine the accuracy of parent/guardian report of AD severity using
an image-based assessment of skin lesions in order to efficiently measure disease severity over time.
These tools will be utilized in future decentralized trials of early therapeutic intervention. Our
established community-based clinical trial network, central study team infrastructure, and
decentralized study design expertise allow for increased efficiency in enrollment and improved
generalizability of results as compared to traditional approaches – two factors that will ensure the
success of this proposed project."
10800450,"Project Summary
Anxiety- and stress-induced psychiatric disorders affect millions of Americans and often involve social
avoidance as a coping strategy for reducing the risk of confronting a stressor. Chronic social defeat stress
(CSDS), a widely used rodent model of stress, reliably leads to decreased social interaction in stress
susceptible animals, which may reflect clinically relevant fear-based behavior. Accordingly, our work in
129Sv/Ev mice indicates a role for fear learning in CSDS-induced social avoidance, implicating the
involvement of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, surprisingly little is known about the
contribution of the BLA to circuits underlying CSDS-induced social avoidance, where the primary focus has
been on reward circuitry. We propose to address this gap in the literature in three specific aims, using a
combination of behavior, functional circuit mapping, circuit manipulations, and in-vivo physiology. First, in Aim
1, we will investigate whether BLA inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key region for mediating social
interactions, contribute to CSDS-induced social avoidance. To this end, we will use functional circuit mapping
to identify whether CSDS upregulates activity in BLA projections to the NAc during social avoidance of a CD-1
relative to a non-avoided conspecific. Further, using chemogenetics, we will test whether BLA-NAc projections
are necessary for CSDS-mediated social avoidance of the CD-1. Then, in Aim 2, we will use the same
methods to focus on how input from the prelimbic region (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex to the BLA affects
social interaction in defeated and non-defeated mice. Given the importance of the PL-BLA circuit in fear
expression and avoidance learning, we expect that PL inputs to the BLA will be active during social avoidance
and necessary for expression of this learned response. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use multisite in-vivo
physiology to investigate the dynamics of PL-BLA-NAc communication during social interaction before and
after CSDS in both sexes. These findings will fill an important gap in our understanding of how fear learning
circuitry contributes to the well-studied reward circuitry that mediates non-selective social avoidance. Given the
high co-morbidity of anxiety- and mood- disorders, this project will provide critical new information to help
integrate our understanding of the fear and reward systems in mediating social avoidance, providing a more
holistic understanding of this behavioral response to stress."
10790657,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The placenta plays a crucial role during pregnancy ensuring fetal growth and development. Successful
pregnancy hinges upon placental adaptations to the maternal environment. The human placenta is classified as
hemochorial and is characterized by extensive intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion. During the course of the
gestation, invasive trophoblast cells or extravillous trophoblast, as they are referred to in humans, migrate from
the placenta into the uterine parenchyma where they act to anchor the placenta to the uterus and remodel uterine
spiral arteries. Uterine NK (NK) cells are major immune cell population at the uterine-placental interface. Uterine
NK cell numbers expand at the uterine-placental interface during early gestation. In addition to functioning as
sentinels, they promote uterine vasculature development by secreting proangiogenic factors and initiating
crosstalk with cellular constituents. Invasive trophoblast cells and uterine NK cells contribute to an effective
partnership in modifying the uterine vasculature. Uterine vascular remodeling is central to providing adequate
nutrient flow to the fetus and normal fetal development. Aberrant modification of the uterine vasculature is directly
linked to preeclampsia, early pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, pre-term birth, and placental
abruption. Placentation in the rat is characterized by contributions of uterine NK cells and invasive trophoblast
cell to uterine spiral artery remodeling, resembling developmental processes evident in human placentation.
Global genome-editing in the rat is an effective tool for investigating a sub-set of candidate genes implicated in
regulating events at the uterine-placental interface. Some genes possess multiple roles in the biology of the
maternal rat, precluding an evaluation of a specific role in uterine NK cells. The generation of a conditional allele
circumvents this issue. In the proposed research, we will develop a rat model for uterine NK cell specific
conditional alleles using Crispr/Cas9 genome editing. We will generate a transgenic rat model expressing Cre
recombinase in uterine NK cells under control of Ncr1 regulatory sequences and validate the Ncr1-Cre driver rat
strain. The proposed experiments will provide valuable new tools for the scientific community to discern roles
for candidate genes in the regulation of the uterine-placental interface, including uterine spiral artery remodeling,
and thus a novel experimental paradigm to explore the etiology of high-risk pregnancies."

 Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the primary causes of chronic liver disease worldwide and cirrhosis-
associated deaths in the United States. Current treatments for ALD are not satisfactory. Novel therapeutic
strategies are desperately needed, which warrants a further understanding of the mechanisms of ALD
development. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism and glycolysis plays a critical role in ALD development. As
key enzymes of phosphorylation of glucose, hexokinases play critical roles in regulating glucose metabolism and
glycolysis. Recently, the hexokinase domain containing 1 (HKDC1), a novel hexokinase that catalyzes the
phosphorylation of glucose and plays a vital role in cellular glucose and liver metabolism, was identified as the
most up-regulated kinase in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Increased HKDC1 activity contributed to the
accumulation of glucose-6-P and glycogen in primary rat hepatocytes. We recently also found that HDKC1
expression is increased in human and mouse alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) samples compared to normal livers.
Based on the existing literature, we hypothesize that alcohol-induced HKDC1 expression promotes glycolysis
and ATP production, thus serving as a protective mechanism against alcohol-induced hepatocyte death and ALD
development. The Overall Objective of this grant is to answer three questions: 1) What impact does the
excessive expression of HKDC1 have on ASH development? 2) Is HKDC1 indispensable for ASH development
to occur? 3) How does EtOH lead to an elevation in HKDC1 expression? The results of this proposal could
potentially reveal novel mechanisms for ALD pathogenesis and provide the groundwork for the development of
novel treatment strategies for ALD."

Prostate cancer (PCa) develops in sixteen percent of males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related
death in men in the United States. While incidence is high, PCa presents with a wide range of aggressiveness
and in many cases does not develop into life-threatening aggressive cancer. Current diagnostic strategies may
fail to detect all instances of clinically significant PCa and have limited ability to accurately distinguish clinically
significant from indolent PCa due to incomplete and inconsistent information. This not only subjects patients to
detrimental co-morbidities including overtreatment and undertreatment, but also exacerbates already significant
healthcare costs. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to achieve accurate detection and classification
of clinically significant PCa and determine the appropriate management strategy.
Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced
imaging, has emerged as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa.
However, the current standardized scoring system for mp-MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System
(PI-RADS) v2, has limited ability to distinguish between indolent and clinically significant PCa, with sensitivity
and specificity in the range of 60-85%. This suboptimal accuracy and considerable variation in performance is
mainly due to the fact that current PI-RADS scoring is based on qualitative analysis and subjective interpretation
of mp-MRI, confounded by scanner- and patient-specific variations, including B1+ inhomogeneity, arterial input
function, and susceptibility and eddy current effects.
This proposal aims to overcome these critical limitations of current mp-MRI by establishing a new MRI-based
artificial intelligence based on two synergistic innovations: 1) new quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
analysis techniques and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition methods that minimize scanner- and patient-specific
variations, and 2) novel multi-class deep learning models that can fully integrate the multi-labeled quantitative mp-
MRI information. By leveraging the synergy between existing mp-MRI data and to-be-acquired quantitative mp-
MRI data with subsequent mapping of all lesions at whole-mount histopathology, the proposed MRI-based deep
learning model will be evaluated for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, compared with the
current standard-of-care, PI-RADS v2.
Completion of this project will lead to the creation, clinical deployment, and pivotal validation of a new MRI-based
artificial intelligence that achieves unprecedented accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant
PCa, thereby increasing confidence in separating indolent PCa from significant PCa and reducing unnecessary
biopsies, undertreatment, and overtreatment."

This new R21 application “Respiratory Distress in Sheep with Hypophosphatasia: Etiology, Functional
Consequences and Rescue” will provide novel insights into the role of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase
(TNSALP) on lung development and function. Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited disorder of mineral
metabolism in patients with loss of function mutations in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene
(ALPL). This disorder is associated with high neonatal morbidity and mortality, impaired musculoskeletal
development, and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), yet the in utero origins of the disease are unknown and
the ontogeny of development of lung pathology is poorly understood. The PI’s laboratory developed the first
large animal model of HPP in sheep, creating an ALPL gene mutation in exon 10 (c.1077C>G) recapitulating the
human HPP phenotype. As observed in human patients, but not in mice, neonatal lambs carrying a loss of
function mutation in ALPL commonly have respiratory complications as neonates and have an increased
incidence of pneumonia compared to wildtype control lambs throughout life. Preliminary findings in HPP sheep
demonstrate severe lung pathology on Day 100 of gestation (GD100), suggesting programming of the postnatal
lung phenotype during fetal development, and that the known postnatal respiratory complications result from
more than insufficient rib cage mineralization. This sheep HPP model will be used to test the hypothesis that
reduced TNSALP activity causes lung-specific developmental abnormalities, as well as deficiencies in
diaphragm structure and respiratory function that contribute to RDS by the analyses of WT and HPP
fetuses on GD130 and in lambs at 4 months of age. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the respiratory
phenotype in WT and HPP sheep throughout development (GD130 and postnatal 4 months of age). Specific
Aim 2 will determine the impact of HPP on resting lung function in 4 month old WT and HPP sheep by
measuring arterial blood gases (pO2, pCO2), bicarbonate, pH, ammonia and lactate, and bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL). Specific Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of recombinant TNSALP therapy to rescue the
developmental respiratory phenotype in HPP sheep using lentiviral GFP control or ALPL-GFP constructs
injected into WT or HPP sheep zygotes. This interdisciplinary collaborative team includes a current clinical
veterinary physiologist collaborator (an expert on respiratory diseases in ruminants) who will collect arterial blood
and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids for assessment of lung pathophysiology. This study will provide the first
investigations into the in utero developmental origins of the severe respiratory phenotype in sheep with
HPP, and describe contributions of non-skeletal tissues (lung, lung-resident immune cells, diaphragm)
to RDS in HPP. These findings will have immediate relevance to the management of RDS in human HPP."

Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is age-related progressive irreversible neurological disorder which affects approximately 50
million people worldwide. It is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with an
estimated annual cost of 1 trillion USD. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques.
The failure is partially due to aggregation of A𝛽 protein. The fibrillation of A𝛽 occurs through A𝛽 oligomers which
have substantial neurotoxicity. Therefore, there is much interest in understanding the mechanism by which A𝛽
aggregates because the aggregation pathway dictates the structures and populations of toxic intermediates.
Amyloid aggregation is a difficult problem to study for the standard structural biology techniques because it
involves kinetically evolving proteins. Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) is an emerging analytical
technique that probes protein dynamics with chemical bond-specific spatial and high temporal resolution. 2D IR
spectroscopy is analogous to 2D NMR spectroscopy, except that it uses pulses of infrared light to measure
molecular vibrations rather than pulsed magnetic fields measuring nuclear spins. New methodology
improvements expand the frontiers of 2D IR spectroscopy permitting the study of amyloid aggregation and tissue
imaging in native environments. Interpreting congested 2D IR spectra is difficult without simulations that connect
spectral features to structural models. Computational spectroscopy advances alongside the improvements in
experimental 2D IR technique. With the present algorithms and software, it is possible to calculate 2D IR spectra
for a given all-atom or united-atom protein models and achieve at least qualitative agreement with experiment.
There is, however, an important technology gap—methods for calculating linear and multidimensional vibrational
spectra from coarse-grained protein and implicit solvent models do not exist. Such methods are highly desirable
because the study of protein aggregation, especially in the membrane environment, involves large length- and
timescales beyond the current capabilities of traditional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Instead, such
simulations require the use of coarse-grained protein and implicit solvent models. The proposed work will
address this gap. In Specific Aim 1 we will introduce a data-driven approach for calculating infrared vibrational
spectra of all-atom protein models in a coarse-grained solvent. Specific Aim 2 will focus on an implicit solvent
and coarse-grained protein models. The methods will be tested on the existing libraries of well-characterized
small proteins whose vibrational spectra have been measured. Specific Aim 3 is devoted to efficient software
implementation of the algorithms developed in Specific Aims 1 and 2. The new computational algorithms and
software developed in the proposed work will allow interpretation of linear and 2D IR spectroscopy experiments
on amyloid aggregation and will become an important technology in unravelling the fundamental molecular-level
insights not only into Alzheimer’s disease but also into other pathologies associated with the aggregation of
amyloid proteins such as Parkinson disease, type 2 diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases."

Advanced age is a major risk factor for age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and many others. It remains elusive what aging mechanisms, or more generally what biological
mechanisms are responsible for promoting the development of multiple age-related diseases. To address this
question, we believe it is essential to investigate the heterogeneity of human aging. We posit that human aging
can be generally divided into two major subtypes, i.e., the healthy and pathological aging, and the pathological
aging contains critical information on the link between aging and age-related diseases. Using tissues’
transcriptomes, we can divide a cohort into two major subgroups which roughly correspond to healthy and
pathological conditions. Molecular mechanisms associated with pathological tissue aging can be learned by
comparing the differential gene regulations between the two major subgroups. Using this general approach, we
will focus on studying the common pathological aging mechanisms between brain (e.g., hippocampus, and
frontal cortex) and adipose tissues (e.g., visceral adipose tissue VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue SAT).
We will also examine the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the adipose-brain cross-tissue talk. We will
perform experimental validation for the findings using mouse models.
This proposal is innovative as to our best knowledge, the systematic study of the heterogeneity of human tissue
aging, the classification of healthy and pathological aging, and identification of the molecular mechanisms shared
between adipose-brain tissues and their crosstalk have not been well-examined. The project will help to elucidate
the common molecular mechanisms related to pathological aging in metabolic and neurological disorders using
an unbiased data-driven approach. We will work on the following two Specific Aim. In Aim 1, we will Identify
common gene regulations between brain and adipose tissues in pathological subgroups and the gene
regulations putatively mediating adipose-brain cross-tissue talk using GTEx data and other existing human tissue
transcriptomic data. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate the transcriptomic changes involved the adipose-
brain axis that may mediate the inter-organ communication and promote pathological brain conditions.
In summary, our proposed work represents a novel comprehensive unbiased framework to study the human
tissue aging heterogeneity and to identify the key molecular mechanisms shared by brain and adipose tissue. It
will generate important pilot results and new insights into the pathological aging mechanism across human body
and how the pathological aging in peripheral tissues could contribute to the disease development in the brain."
10804745,"Pediatric anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are prevalent and impairing, yet a significant 
subset of youth who receive the first-line treatment (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; CBT) will not 
experience symptom remission. Youth with anxiety and OCD report high rates of sleep problems; 
evidence suggests that self-reported sleep-related problems predict slower improvement and poorer 
clinical outcomes in exposure-based CBT. Gaps in knowledge remain about the role of sleep for 
therapeutic learning during CBT treatment. This project aims to address these gaps by integrating 
multi-method sleep assessments with fear extinction learnings, which is one of the presumed mechanisms 
of action in CBT for anxiety and/or OCD. The research objectives are to characterize sleep problems in a 
sample of youth with anxiety and/or OCD and examine the association between sleep variables and 
psychophysiological measures of fear extinction learning. The central methodology involves multi-method 
sleep assessments including self-report measures, actigraphy, and night time electroencephalography, 
and a computer-based fear extinction learning task, which includes measuring skin conductance 
responses (SCR) in 84 adolescents (age 13-17) with primary anxiety or OCD entering a CBT-based 
intensive outpatient program. The central hypothesis is that shorter sleep quantity and greater sleep 
disruption are associated with psychophysiological responses indicating reduced fear extinction learning 
and reduced fear extinction recall in adolescents with anxiety and OCD. This project is innovative in that 
the use of multi-method sleep assessments in a clinical sample of youths with anxiety and/or OCD is 
novel. In addition, linking sleep measures with psychophysiological indexes of fear extinction learning in a 
clinical sample of youths has not yet been done, to our knowledge. Future research will investigate these 
associations with repeated measurement across a full course of CBT treatment. If successful, we will be 
poised to develop and test augmentation strategies that target specific aspects of sleep that contribute to 
sub-optimal fear extinction learning. Ultimately, results from this work may serve as proof-of-concept for 
identifying sleep targets to guide the augmentation of behavioral treatments for anxiety and OCD."
10908727,"Summary: Every year, 15 million babies are born premature. Over 75% of preterm births (PTBs) are termed
spontaneous (sPTB) resulting in parturition at early gestational time points without clear causes. Our lack of
understanding of the mechanisms and overall pathogenesis that promotes sPTB results in limited successful
interventions. While uterine contractility and cervical remodeling appear to be obligatory processes in
parturition, premature triggers of these processes remain poorly elucidated. Recent studies reveal close
associations between cervicovaginal (CV) microbial communities and the occurrence of sPTB. In particular, we
recently studied a cohort of 2000 pregnant women and assessed the CV microbial communities, metabolic and
immune responses early in pregnancy, providing strong evidence that colonization with specific bacterial taxa,
specific metabolic profiles, and local immune responses were strongly associated with sPTB. However, to
develop preventive or therapeutic strategies, understanding the cause of sPTB is essential. We speculate that
interplay between the CV microbial communities, local immune response and the cervical and vaginal epithelial
barriers induce premature cervical remodeling and initiate sPTB. The overall goal of this study is to define
how specific CV bacteria interact with vaginal and epithelial cells in clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo
models and to understand how those interactions modify tissue remodeling and biomechanics of the pregnant
cervix, driving sPTB. We propose a process whereby bacterial taxa that are highly associated with sPTB in
humans provoke exfoliation of the vaginal epithelium. This process promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) from both vaginal and cervical epithelial cells. While activation of EMT prevents the ascension of these
bacteria, a tradeoff is that EMT fosters breakdown of the extracellular matrix in the cervical tissue, triggering
premature cervical remodeling and sPTB. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that specific bacteria, such as
Gardnerella vaginalis (G.vaginalis), promote EMT of the vaginal and cervical epithelial barrier which alters the
structure and function of the pregnant cervix, leading to sPTB, even in the absence of ascending infection
(above the cervix). This paradigm-shifting hypothesis will be tested through a series of in vitro and in vivo
experiments. This proposal will first address whether ascension of bacteria into the uterus is actually necessary
for PTB to occur; these studies have the potential to reframe our scientific and therapeutic approach to PTB.
We will then demonstrate how bacteria induce EMT in CV epithelial barriers and how EMT might promote
premature cervical remodeling. Unique to this proposal, we will provide quantitative assessment of the
pregnant cervix, in terms of structure and function, in a mouse model of PTB. A multidisciplinary team adds
rigor to our work by applying novel concepts and techniques to the study of sPTB. These studies will provide
insight as to new and focused therapeutic targets to limit or prevent sPTB and will significantly advance this
field."

There is a growing need for new options for male contraception. Consequently, the NICHD has a program to develop novel hormonal drugs for male contraception. Preliminary studies have been completed to demonstrate first-in-man safety, repeat dose gonadotropin suppressive activity, and longer-term dosing that prove that the drugs suppress sperm production. At the conclusion of that evaluation process, a decision was made to pursue drug development to demonstrate contraceptive efficacy in couples. The goal of the current Phase 11B study, CCN0l 7, is to demonstrate safety, sperm suppression and contraceptive efficacy when the product is used by the male partner. It has required large numbers of couples to be recruited to the two main male sites, and with approval from NICHD and Fogarty International as well as State Department clearance, awarded subcontracts to the international sites that had pre-qualified at the time of initial review for selection of CCTN sites for male contraceptive evaluation. The SCCC recruited subcontract partners to provide regulatory assistance with the appropriate regulatory agencies and to monitor clinical trial activity at the international sites. Target enrollment has been achieved such that recruitment has ceased; all remaining couples are expected to complete all activities and phases of the study as outlined in the current protocol. This task order will support the coordination of the clinical trial and all of activities associated with the study. The SCCC will continue to coordinate and monitor the multi-site clinical trial of the combination Nestorone Testosterone Gel for use as a novel male contraceptive product. All sites will continue to transfer data to the SCCC. Upon study completion, the SCCC will collect the data and perform data analysis as well as prepare a clinical study report suitable to support regulatory guidelines to pursue eventual FDA approval of the new drug. The proposed task order will provide continued clinical trial conduct, oversight and monitoring, data analysis and a final clinical study report for the supporting regulatory approval of the novel product for male contraception.

SCOPE
To provide statistical and clinical coordination as well as monitoring of a multi-site clinical trial, including services and support related to protocol changes, logistical support, data collection, database preparation, data analysis and eventual preparation of clinical study report of the clinical trial of a new product for contraception in men."
10797124,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are critical to the regulation of inflammation in systemic as well as neurological
diseases. Studies have shown that during an acute phase response (APR), SAA levels increase 1000-fold and
can stimulate the inflammasome, trigger the recruitment of immune cells to inflammatory sites, and elicit the
induction of enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix. SAA levels are significantly elevated following
stroke/cerebral ischemia linking systemic inflammation and neurological disorders. Our long-term goal is to
dissect the mechanisms regulating SAA function, particularly the contribution to stroke related damage would
have a major impact on the clinical management of stroke by providing new biomarkers that will predict poor
outcome and death as well as strategies for intervention. Recent studies from our laboratory have provided
information for the role of SAA proteins in stroke progression: 1) SAA levels are increased in mice and humans
following stroke; 2) in mice and humans, SAA is present in the brain following stroke in regions with inflammation,
microglial activity, and neuronal cell loss; and 3) SAA deficient mice have reduced infarct volumes and
inflammation. We have shown that SAA mediated by RAGE induces NLRP3 and elaborates IL-1 in microglial
cells, indicating activation of the inflammasome. Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of the
inflammasome is a critical event in stroke progression in mice. The central hypothesis is that SAA activates the
NLRP3 inflammasome and amplifying the local inflammatory responses that enhance neuronal cell death and
stroke progression. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: Investigate the role of NLRP3
inflammasome in SAA’s ability to exacerbate stroke in mice. Aim 1a. Using mice deficient in SAA, RAGE and
various inflammasome components (cathepsin B, NLRP3, and IL-1), we will determine whether SAA-mediated
stroke outcomes are dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will also investigate whether small-molecule
anionic sulphonates, a treatment that blocks SAA deposition in tissue, is effective in reducing infarct volumes in
mice. Aim 1b. Using microglial cell cultures, we will determine the impact of SAA on RAGE mediated pathologies
(ROS generation, etc.) as well as the influence of SAA-HDL on SAA-mediated NLRP3 activation. Aim 2: To test
the hypothesis that systemic SAA exacerbates the progression of neuronal cell death and inflammation in stroke.
Aim 2a. Using SAA deficient mice, we will determine the impact on stroke infarct volume and outcomes. In
addition, using viral vectors to express SAA as well as an inducible transgene will allow us to determine the role
of SAA with specific expression of SAA. The impact of SAA on inflammation, neuronal cell death, matrix
remodeling, etc. will be determined. Aim 2b. We will investigate the role of SAA and the inflammasome in
human stroke, the relationship between plasma SAA, IL-1 and the impact on stroke outcomes. This contribution
is significant since it will establish that targeting of SAA by therapies have the potential to regulate inflammatory
activity through cellular mechanisms."
10924018,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application aims to use existing data within the All of Us Researcher Workbench to improve our ability to
identify hypertension (HTN) patients at increased risk for apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH)
and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Resistant hypertension describes a subset of hypertensive individuals
with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications, or BP
control that requires four or more antihypertensive medications. The term aTRH is used for resistant
hypertension when pseudoresistance (e.g. medication nonadherence, white coat effect) cannot be excluded.
The prevalence of aTRH was recently estimated at ~17-19% among adults taking antihypertensive
medications. HTN is a major risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, and heart failure. Additionally, when compared to controlled hypertension patients, patients
with aTRH are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, target organ damage, and all-cause
mortality. Although there are numerous first-line antihypertensive drugs to lower blood pressure and ultimately
prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes, there is great inter-patient variability in antihypertensive drug
response. It is poorly understood why patients respond differently to the same drug, why some patients
develop aTRH, and why some patients experience adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Our central hypothesis
is that HTN patients and subpopulations at increased risk for aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes
associated with HTN can be identified through clinical factors, biochemical factors, genomic factors, and
patient reported data. To test our central hypothesis we will complete the following Specific Aims: 1)
Characterize aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in HTN patients by health care institutions, urban
versus rural areas, and geographic regions, using longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-based data, and
2) Identify early signs of aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in HTN patients by health care
institutions, urban versus rural areas, and geographic regions, using EHR-based data, genomic data, and data
from surveys and wearables. To achieve these aims, we will utilize existing data from the All of Us Researcher
Workbench. The All of Us Research Program is enrolling a diverse group of persons in the United States, and
including multiple types of real-world data (e.g. EHR, demographic, wearables, patient surveys, genomic). We
will deploy our validated HTN algorithms to determine observed rates of HTN, aTRH, and adverse
cardiovascular outcomes. We will identify characteristics of aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
HTN patients. We will also use multivariable regression analyses and machine-learning models to identify
predictors (EHR-based, genomic, patient reported) of aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We will
examine characteristics and predictors of aTRH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in HTN patients by
health care institutions, urban versus rural areas, and geographic region."
10797892,"The genome is relatively stable in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but mutation rates increase during
progression from chronic phase (CP) to blast crisis (BC). And, 30-50% of CML patients relapse in CP during
prolonged treatment with inhibitors of the Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase (TKIs). Relapse usually involves point mutations
in the BCRABL oncogene that impair TKI sensitivity, but many patients achieve remission after switching TKI.
Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is relatively high in CML bone marrow, suggesting efficient ROS
handling may be required for low mutation rates in CP-CML during remission. CML neutrophils (PMNs) may
contribute to bone marrow ROS via the phagocyte-specific NADPH oxidase; activated during the innate immune
response. Consistent with this, we found aberrant activation of innate immune response pathways in human and
murine CML, and emergency (stress) granulopoiesis (EG) was sustained in CML mice. Failure to efficiently
terminate EG may favor mutagenesis by enhancing ROS production by CML-PMNs and expansion of leukemia
stem cells (LSCs) during this process. In a murine model of CML, we found that episodes of EG accelerated
TKI-resistance and BC compared to steady state. Oxr1 is the major mechanism for detoxifying PMN-ROS. Oxr1
has low (Oxr1S) and high efficiency (Oxr1L) isoforms. We found switch from Oxr1L to Oxr1S during EG in CML
mice but not Wt controls. Oxr1L also increased in CP relapse. Oxr1-knockdown in the bone marrow of CML mice
accelerated TKI-resistance and BC, consistent with a functional role for Oxr1 in leukemogenesis.
 Half of CML patients with a sustained major molecular response to TKI-treatment (<0.01% IS) remain in
remission after TKI-discontinuation. Unfortunately, molecular markers to predict relapse vs sustained therapy
free remission (TFR) are unknown. During the current funding period, we performed single cell RNA-Seq on
CD34+CD38- cells from a CML patient cohort undergoing therapy discontinuation. We identified interaction of
αβT cells and CML-LSCs in patients with relapse post TKI-discontinuation and in our murine CML model. T cell/
LSC interaction was not found with sustained TFR, or in second remission after failed discontinuation. T cell
interaction with CML cells were not previously described, but interaction with αβT cells facilitates intercellular
pathogen killing by phagocytes during the innate immune response. We found TFR was prolonged in mice
transplanted with single LSCs vs αβT cell/LSC doublets, or by treatment with an αβT cell antibody. These results
suggest a functional contribution of these T cells to LSC persistence and relapse post TKI-discontinuation.
 We hypothesize that dysregulation of the innate immune response in CML facilitates mutations that lead to
relapse or BC progression via inadequate ROS-handling and/or aberrant interaction of αβT cells with CML-LSCs.
The corollary to this hypothesis is that exposure of CML subjects to infectious challenge may enhance the risk
of mutagenesis or failed TKI-discontinuation. We will investigate this through 2 independent Aims;
 Aim 1: Define mechanisms for impaired Oxr1 activity and detoxification of PMN-generated ROS in
CML-LSCs. We will use a murine CML model with Oxr1 knockdown to determine the impact of impaired ROS
handling on CP relapse and/or BC. Molecular mechanisms regulating and consequent to these events will be
investigated. Results will inform mechanistic studies in human Lin-CD34+CD38- CML cells.
 Aim 2: Define mechanisms for CML-LSC/αβT cell interaction to induce LSC expansion and relapse
during TKI-therapy or after discontinuation. We will use a murine CML model to investigate mechanisms for
αβT cell interaction to induce LSC persistence and short TFR. Contribution to TKI-resistance will also be
investigated. Molecular characteristics of LSCs that interact with T cells, and T cells that interact with LSCs, will
be defined. Results will inform studies of T cell/LSC interactions in human Lin-CD34+CD38- CML cells.
 Our goal is to define the role of aberrant activation of the innate immune response in CML progression and
identify possible molecular markers or therapeutic targets to decrease progression during or after TKI therapy."
10797560,"Abstract/Summary
In 2020, Alabama and Mississippi had the highest stroke mortality in the US, each with a rate of 54.5 per 100,000 population. Over the last five years, the Stroke Belt StrokeNet (SBSN) including the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its partner institutions, the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), the University of South Alabama (USA), and Children’s of Alabama (COA) successfully advanced the stroke system of care and science of stroke treatment in a minority population of at-risk patients in the heart of the underserved Stroke Belt region of the United States. The SBSN will continue to benefit from its 1) established infrastructure, 2) basic science and clinical stroke expertise, and 3) stroke clinical trial experience. Established infrastructure included the recently expanded UAB Neurology Research Unit (NRU) that facilitates study activation, conduct, and pre-/post-award management and the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), supported by an NIH CTSA award (UL1 TR001417) and an associated CCTS Partner Network including UMMC and USA, which offers faculty and trainees access to their Training Academy, Project Panels, clinical populations and samples, and Research Commons. The CCTS provided training to our RCC and our partner site investigators and coordinators as well as coordinator support for Stroke Net trials through its Clinical Research Support Program. The SBSN includes a very large potential pool of RCT co-investigators that offer extraordinary depth and breadth of expertise and experience in investigations of acute treatment, prevention and recovery, as well as collaborators in basic and translational science in stroke, neuroimaging, epidemiology, statistics, stroke systems of care, multi-site programs, and health disparities. We have extensive experience in stroke recovery with specific expertise in stroke-related aphasia recovery/rehabilitation, TMS and imaging, and motor recovery; and in stroke systems of care / implementation science. The SBSN has a track record of successful enrollment in stroke clinical trials across the Stroke Net spectrum and inclusion of underrepresented and minority populations. Over the last 5 years, the SBSN has enrolled 120 subjects in Stroke Net treatment, recovery, and prevention studies, ranking 16th among RCCs over this period. SBSN has successfully included underrepresented and minority populations with 37.6% black subjects enrolled, putting us 3rd among the 29 RCCs. Over the last 5 years, the SBSN has matured and demonstrated the capacity to improve as a network. This includes the addition of research coordinators to better support trial conduct, adoption of a more rigorous and structured daily, weekly, monthly, and annual approach to network activities, the willingness to drop nonproductive satellites, and the introduction of randomization-based satellite incentive payments. In this application, we endeavor to improve our already strong program, including the addition of the Birmingham VA Medical Center as a new partner, a focused effort to ensure the best possible data quality, and enhancement of our Internal Advisory Committee to include community as well as academic representation."
10932410,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 is the most frequently mutated metabolic gene across all cancers. Among epithelial
malignancies, IDH1 mutations are particularly common in cholangiocarcinoma, a deadly cancer of the liver bile
ducts. These hot-spot mutations generate the oncometabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits -
ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, altering epigenetics and metabolism. While pharmacological inhibition of
mutant IDH1 shows efficacy in cholangiocarcinoma, the effects are not durable, and there has been limited
insight into the basis for response and resistance. Recently, by developing mIDH1-driven genetically
engineered mouse models and utilizing patient samples and models, we demonstrated that mIDH1 causes
tumor cells to evade attack by the immune system. We find that inhibitors of mutant IDH1 slow tumor growth by
reverting this immune evasion phenotype, leading to sensitization to immune checkpoint blockade. A major
mechanism of this evasion involves the (R)-2HG-mediated inactivation of the TET2 demethylase, which
prevents the tumor cells from responding to interferon gamma produced by immune cells. The second
mechanism involves limiting the recruitment and activity of cytotoxic T cells, although we have yet to fully
elucidate the associated molecular basis. Based on our extensive new preliminary data, we hypothesize that
IDH1-mediated control of cellular differentiation and of innate immune signaling are potential mediators of this
T cell cross-talk. The present proposal will test this hypothesis and investigate the interplay between T cell
recruitment and the IFN-g-TET2 program in IDH1 inhibitor response and eventual resistance. These studies
will inform the improved treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and potentially the range of other cancer types
harboring IDH mutations."
10800314,"ABSTRACT
Therapeutic use of nitric oxide (NO) gas has several important applications in medicine. Inhaled NO (INO)
has become a mainstay of intensive care for lung failure patients. As a pulmonary vasodilator, INO is
essential in neonatology, lung transplantation, and pulmonary hypertension. As an inhaled antiseptic
agent, NO has been proposed to treat chronic airway infection that occurs in cystic fibrosis, sinusitis,
tuberculosis and COVID-19 infections. NO added to the sweep gas in extracorporeal circulation (ECC)
prevents activation of platelets (preventing thrombosis) and white blood cells (preventing systemic inflam-
matory response syndrome [SIRS]). Current methods of creating NO gas are extremely expensive owing
to its instability at high concentrations within conventional gas cylinders. The use of NO to prevent intra-
vascular (IV) catheter related infections and clotting has received considerable attention, including the
incorporation of NO donors into IV catheter walls that dramatically reduces the risk of infection and
thrombosis on catheter surfaces. Via prior NIH grants, we have developed a completely new and very
low-cost electrochemical (E-chem) method to generate high purity NO gas (E-NOgen) for both inhalation
and ECC applications, as well as to release NO from IV catheter surfaces. The method is based on the
E-chem reduction of nitrite ions to NO gas via novel Cu(II)-ligand complexes. For gas phase NO genera-
tion, a solution of nitrite and Cu(II) complex is circulated through a chamber with large area working and
counter electrodes to generate the NO (by applying fixed current or voltage). The circulating solution is
passed through a gas-exchange unit made with silicone or microporous polyethylene fibers so that the
NO can permeate the fibers into a recipient stream of N2 gas for medical use. For the catheters, the Cu(II)-
ligand complex and nitrite ions are contained in one lumen of a multi-lumen catheter with tiny wire
electrodes to generate NO that then passes through all of the catheter walls to prevent infection/clotting.
The major challenge in both of these applications is the effect of dioxygen (O2), decreasing the efficiency
of NO generation by reacting with the intermediate Cu(I)-ligand species and by reacting with NO within
the catheter walls or gas exchanger tubing, thereby greatly decreasing the total level of NO generated. In
the proposed R01 grant, we will prepare a host of new Cu(II)-ligand complexes that have much lower O2
sensitivity and thereby enable higher levels of NO to be generated in the presence of ambient and
physiological (arterial blood) levels of O2 for both the INO generator and IV catheter technology. We will
optimize the reduction potential of the complexes to decrease O2 sensitivity and use ligands that provide
hydrogen-bonding interactions to accelerate nitrite reduction. Further, for the IV catheters, immobilized
oxidase enzymes on the outer surface and new materials will be explored to greatly reduce the levels of
O2 in the catheter walls. Testing of such catheters in the arteries/veins of pigs and sheep will be conducted."

Despite reductions in antimicrobial use and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs, antimicrobial
resistant (AMR) pathogens continue to emerge and persist, causing millions of deaths every year. The long-term
goal of this proposal is to decrease clinical AMR incidence by advancing knowledge of how AMR develops,
persists and transmits to pathogens within the microbiome. The overall objective of this project is to develop a
novel high-throughput method for generating enriched long-read sequencing data that accurately reflects the in
situ dynamics of AMR genes across entire microbial communities. This is a major gap in methodology that
hampers knowledge discovery and leads to suboptimal patient outcomes. The rationale is that this method will
enable fundamental advances in both applied and basic research through: improved prediction about when and
how bacteria exchange AMR genes; and rapid, lower-cost, higher-throughput generation of metagenomic
resistome data. The project objective is achieved through three specific aims: 1) Increase the sensitivity and
specificity of probe-based pre-sequencing enrichment; 2) Generate contextualized metagenomic sequence data
with real-time enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes; and 3) Evaluate the performance of triple-enrichment
using samples with diverse antimicrobial resistance gene composition. Under aim 1, probes for all potential off-
target (i.e., AMR) DNA will be designed using a novel compressed colored de Bruijn graph. Probes will be
manufactured and used to deplete off-target DNA from metagenomic samples prior to enrichment of AMR genes.
For aim 2, adaptive Nanopore sequencing will perform real-time rejection of off-target DNA using a compressed
pangenomic index of all off-target regions, followed by on-the-fly classification of antimicrobial resistance genes.
For aim 3, the potential bias of probe- and sequence-based enrichment will be quantified on a gene-by-gene
basis to fully evaluate the performance of the enrichment workflow for various sample types and use cases. The
proposed research is innovative for two major reasons: first, it enables the applied use of microbial ecology for
clinical and public health applications, which is a major gap in the field of metagenomics; second, it allows for
deep sequencing and robust genomic co-localization of rare and low-abundance metagenomic targets, which is
currently very difficult to obtain. The proposed methodology will open new horizons for basic research into how
and why bacterial communities evolve; and under what conditions diverse bacteria share critical functions such
as AMR. The proposed research is significant because it will have broad applicability to many critical activities
for combating AMR, including patient-centric decisions about antibiotic use and public health activities such as
AMR surveillance. The proposed advancements will help predict AMR emergence events in patients and
populations; identify hot-spots of AMR development and dissemination in hospitals and the community; and help
track critically important AMR genes that may be rare or low-abundance within a given environment or set of
samples."

Subacromial pain, a generic term used to describe pain with disorders of structures within the subacromial space,
is the most common reason for shoulder-related visits to primary care and has a high one-year prevalence.
Patients with subacromial pain frequently complain of difficulty using the arm, impaired lifting, and limited
exercise tolerance. Strengthening is a clinically relevant outcome in patients with subacromial pain. However,
the high loads required for strengthening exacerbate pain and stress the rotator cuff tendons. Therefore, clinical
practice guidelines recommend strengthening with low intensity and high frequency, but this combination often
results in undertraining exercise prescriptions and lasting weakness. Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is
emerging as a novel adjunct treatment to address muscle weakness. It consists of strengthening exercises while
an inflatable cuff restricts blood flow at the extremity. It is popular with athletes because it promotes muscle
hypertrophy. It is also highly appealing as a rehabilitation strategy because it requires low external loads for
strengthening. BFRT could have a tremendous positive impact on the recovery of patients with subacromial pain,
but research is lacking. Our long-term goal is to conduct a large-scale efficacy trial of BFRT in patients with
subacromial pain. As a critical step toward our long-term goal, this proposal is a pilot randomized trial to test trial
procedures, safety and feasibility of the intervention, and preliminary efficacy of BFRT. Our pilot trial will be
double masked (investigator & outcome assessor), include two parallel arms (active or sham BFRT), and two
endpoints (after 16 BFRT sessions, primary endpoint; and after six months, secondary endpoint). This design is
robust because it controls the non-specific effects of receiving BFRT (sham). The first aim tests recruitment,
randomization, participant masking, retention, and data collection procedures. The second aim determine the
safety and feasibility of the interventions (active BFRT and sham BFRT). The third aim describe the effect of
active BFRT on clinical outcomes (shoulder strength, patient-reported outcomes, shoulder performance, muscle
hypertrophy, and tendon thickness & elasticity). This application is innovative because: a) applies BFRT in a
clinical population with subacromial pain; b) has clear objectives, analytic plans, and criteria to establish the
success of the trial procedures, safety, and feasibility outcomes; and c) uses comprehensive outcomes to
evaluate clinical recovery. The popularity of BFRT among professional athletes favors quick transitions to clinical
applications even without support from high-quality research. Completing this preliminary trial will demonstrate
that we have the capacity and capability to conduct and deliver a large-scale efficacy trial as planned.
Collectively, this line of research will directly impact clinical practice."
10800158,"ROMK (Kir 1.1, the product of the KCNJ1 gene) channels in the distal nephron are
exquisitely regulated to adjust renal potassium excretion and maintain potassium balance.
Still, the underlying mechanisms have been a great mystery. Here we overcome this major
conceptual roadblock, building on our recent discoveries of a mechanism we call the
potassium switch. We identified two new elements of the switch pathway that regulate
ROMK: structural remodeling of the connecting tubule (CNT), and a plasma potassium
sensing signaling pathway in the CNT, composed of Kidney Specific (KS)-WNK1, WNK4,
and ERK. To carry these breakthrough observations toward a completely new
understanding of how potassium balance is achieved, we will use a stepwise
multidisciplinary approach, combining molecular genetics, genomics, cellular biology,
innovative imaging, state-of-the-art physiological phenotyping in novel mouse models, and
mathematical modeling to: 1) Rigorously explore the physiology of newly developed
inducible cell-specific ROMK knockout to determine if the regulated expression of ROMK
in DCT2 and CNT controls potassium homeostasis, 2) Investigate the adaptive expansion
of the CNT as a normal homeostatic mechanism that preserves potassium balance in the
face of increased dietary potassium consumption. 3) Test if switch activation of the cell-
fate determinants, Jagged 1-Notch 1/2, are required for proper remodeling of the CNT. 4)
Explore a potassium-sensing signaling pathway that downregulates ROMK in potassium
deficiency via KS-WNK1/WNK4/ERK5 phosphorylation of the clathrin adaptor, ARH,
which targets ROMK for endocytosis. The pathway provides a molecular mechanism to
explain how ROMK channels are regulated in hypokalemia and dietary potassium
deficiency and pathologically misregulated in a human disease of familial hyperkalemia
that is induced by gain-of-function mutations in the kidney-specific WNK1. The studies
should provide novel insights into the molecular basis of renal K+ handling and K+
homeostasis in health and disease while illuminating novel drug targets for the treatment
of common hyperkalemic disorders."
10804513,"Project Summary
 Infants born before 28 weeks of gestation are at high risk for morbidity that often persists through childhood
in the form of asthma, alveolar disease, or pulmonary vascular disease. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is
the clinical description of chronic respiratory disease that is typically defined by the need for respiratory support
at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA, termed “typical BPD”). This description, though, may be discordant with
later outcomes, that is, approximately 60% of babies with BPD have long-term cardiorespiratory morbidity, but
conversely, approximately 40% of infants without BPD have some long-term cardiorespiratory morbidity. Thus,
there is an unmet need to anticipate these outcomes early in the newborn period to develop precise, mechanism-
based interventions for prevention or treatment. We hypothesize that these later cardiorespiratory outcomes
represent endotypes of BPD that can be defined by key mechanistically linked gene pathways (“BPD
endotypes”). We have a unique opportunity to address the limitations of preceding genetic studies by leveraging
several cohorts of approximately 2000 former premature children who were enrolled in prospective studies in
the newborn intensive care unit (NICU), who have existing genome-wide data or DNA samples, and who are
being followed at school-age and above. Through leveraging extant data obtained through the Environmental
Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program (n=~1500) and deeper phenotyping of a prospective
cohort of children with echocardiography and spirometry (n=~500), we will perform what we believe will be the
largest cross-cohort genetic meta-analysis that will integrate genetic networks and longitudinal data and will have
the statistical power to characterize these longer-term BPD endotypes. Our overall goals are to include genetic
variation and longitudinal clinical data in directed and agnostic fashions to address a critical gap by providing
physiologic and genetic criteria for early diagnosis of subtypes of respiratory disease. We will use a combination
of traditional genetic association approaches that focus on gene pathways rather than individual variants or
genes, as well as novel gene-forward approaches that incorporate genetic pathways to inform mechanism-based
BPD endotypes. As we try to move away from the concept of “typical BPD,” understanding the physiologic
processes resulting in these “BPD endotypes” will permit developing personalized, mechanism-specific
interventions to prevent or treat these respiratory consequences of prematurity."

Rodent models remain an important in preclinical studies of brain disease and disorders, as well as basic
neuroscience investigations. Rodent imaging data, acquired through techniques including MRI and microscopy,
play a critical role in many of these studies. While a great deal of effort has gone into the development of software
tools for analyzing MRI of the brain, much of this work has been focused largely on human data, and investigators
studying animal models of disease must often resort to adapting these tools for their research. In this project, we
will address this need by developing a dedicated suite of open source software tools for processing, analyzing,
and visualizing neuroimaging data acquired from rodent brains. These tools will operate on structural diffusion,
and functional MRI, as well as optical microscopy of optically cleared serially sectioned tissue samples. These
tools will build upon our decades of experience developing software for analyzing human and mouse imaging
data, our experience in developing multimodal atlases of the mouse brain, and our active efforts in community
engagement and dissemination while applying these resources in neuroscientific studies. Where suitable, we
will make use of deep learning methods to produce powerful segmentation and registration networks trained on
manually annotated and delineated data. We will also develop easy-to-use interfaces that will facilitate data
processing and provide advanced visualization capabilities of datasets with sizes on the order of one terapixel.
The project has five specific aims. Aim 1 will develop MRI processing tools, which will include intrasubject co-
registration of MRI modalities, extraction of brain tissue from whole head scans, tissue classification, and
processing of diffusion and functional MRI data. Aim 2 will develop tools for processing microscopy of cleared
and sectioned tissue, with the major goal of aligning these data to a reference atlas generated from either optical
microscopy or MRI. These tools will perform cell counting in automatically segmented regions; axon following;
dendritic arborization; and dendritic spine counting. In Aim 3, we will develop a statistical analysis toolbox, which
will perform statistical inference for neuroimaging measures from microscopy and MRI data analyzed using
methods from Aims 1 and 2. In Aim 4, we will integrate the components from Aims 1-3 into an informatics platform
that will provide command line tools for easy scripting, interoperability with related imaging tools, and a graphical
interface for visualizing data across different scales. In Aim 5, we will perform evaluation of our software tools
using two studies: imaging an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple
sclerosis; and imaging a mouse model of normative aging. We will also work with a network of small animal
imaging experts external to the project, who will use and evaluate the software. These driving projects will serve
as testbeds to ensure the practical utility of the software in a research setting, providing direction for the
development of our research platform. We will distribute the software freely under an open source license, and
provide user support through our website."

Adolescents urgently need efficacious skin cancer preventive interventions due to their poor use of sun
protection and likelihood to tan intentionally. Schools offer the ideal setting for delivering skin cancer preventive
interventions to large numbers of adolescents. Existing efficacious school skin cancer preventive interventions
target young children (elementary school students), use a one-size-fits-all approach, and focus on either sun
protection or tanning but not both. We designed a novel and personalized skin cancer preventive intervention
for adolescents that is delivered in the school setting and includes complementary content delivered to parents
and teachers. This multi-modal intervention builds on adolescents’ interest in novelty and need for highly
personalized interventions. In our preliminary study of the intervention components with 1,573 students in 11
schools, we observed medium to large effects for sun protection behaviors and small to medium effects for
tanning and sunburn, with increased adolescent sun protection and better control in intentional tanning and
sunburn pre- to post-intervention. We propose a two-arm, cluster randomized trial to test the efficacy of the
intervention we developed against standard education among 30 schools (10,250 students total). The in-class
intervention sessions will be delivered through health education classes. The co-primary outcomes of the trial
will be adolescent sun protection use and intentional tanning assessed via self-report questionnaire pre-
intervention and at three follow-up timepoints through one year post-intervention. Secondary outcomes include
objectively assessed ultraviolet radiation exposure and sunburn occurrence. Assessment timepoints will be
seasonally timed and ambient UVR will be included as a covariate. We will also identify the mechanisms by
which the intervention impacts adolescent sun protection use and intentional tanning. Through this project, we
will also examine moderators of the intervention effects on sun protection and tanning outcomes in order to
guide future tailoring of the intervention to maximize efficacy for potentially underserved groups. This project
addresses the critical need for school-based skin cancer preventive interventions that both increase adolescent
use of sun protection and decrease intentional tanning. The project will also lead to new scientific
understanding of the theoretical mechanisms underlying intervention outcomes and moderators of the
intervention effects, which will inform future tailoring of the intervention to better meet the needs of particular
subgroups."

 The impact of climate change, including the increased frequency of weather extremes such as flooding,
on the incidence of malaria and other vector-borne diseases is an issue of substantial public health importance.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective mitigation and control strategies. In May 2020, we piloted
a post-flood malaria chemoprevention intervention in rural western Uganda. When compared to two neighboring
villages where no intervention was deployed, we estimated a 53% reduction (aRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.34 – 0.62,
p<.01) in malaria incidence in the six months post-intervention. Building on these results, the scientific aim of
this proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted, time-limited malaria chemoprevention intervention
with and without larval source management (LSM) to reduce excess disease burden in a perennial, high-
transmission setting following severe flooding. Our premise is that the intervention will reduce the parasite
reservoir during the critical “rebound” period, when vectors are re-establishing habitats thereby maintaining
relatively low levels of transmission until conditions have returned to the pre-flood baseline. Specifically, we will:
 Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of chemoprevention with or without peri-domestic larvicide
application to reduce the incidence of P. falciparum malaria after severe flooding. We will conduct a cluster
randomized trial in 50 villages (144 clusters) in rural western Uganda, where flooding relatively predictable, to
compare: (i) LLIN distribution (control), (ii) LLIN distribution plus three, monthly rounds of DP provided to children
≤12 years of age (DP), and (iii) LLIN+DP with three months of bi-weekly application of larvicide in the peri-
domestic space (DP+Bti). Hypothesis: Chemoprevention will achieve a sustained (≥6 months) reduction in
malaria incidence of ≥30% compared to the control arm without the emergence of artemisinin resistance.
 Aim 2: Elucidate the evolution of vector populations, feeding behaviors, and sporozoite rate in
affected villages up to one year after flooding. We will perform weekly surveillance for adult and juvenile
Anopheles mosquitoes in sentinel households and within the peri-domestic space. Collected mosquitoes will be
counted, and identified to species and tested for the presence of P. falciparum sporozoites. Hypothesis: Flooding
will create innumerable small pools favored by An. gambiae complex resulting in predominance of An. gambiae
s.s. with potential for emergence of An. arabiensis as important vector in setting of widespread LLIN use.23
 Aim 3: Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention (Aim 3A) and assess social
and economic impacts on households (Aim 3B). We will conduct baseline and longitudinal quantitative
surveys in sample clusters to evaluate impacts of the interventions on (i) economic activities and income, (ii)
health seeking and expenditures, and (iii) mental health and well-being. These data will inform a cost
effectiveness analysis of chemoprevention compared to the control (i.e., relative cost per case averted).
Hypothesis: Chemoprevention will mitigate negative effects of malaria in the aftermath of a flood."

Patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) are at increased risk of lifestyle limiting
claudication, ulceration, amputation, and death. Despite this knowledge, an ongoing challenge for the vascular
community is the lack of a standard non-invasive test for quantifying regional abnormalities in skeletal muscle
perfusion in PAD. Our laboratory has been at the forefront of translating nuclear perfusion imaging techniques
to patients with PAD and demonstrated the potential prognostic value of these methods for prediciting clinical
outcomes. Specifically, in the prior funding period of this award, we clinically translated a single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging approach from pigs with limb ischemia to patients with
PAD and demonstrated that SPECT/CT perfusion imaging measures were repeatable in patients, detected
regional abnormalities in resting perfusion of the lower extremities, assessed perfusion defects that
corresponded with the level of future amputation, and quantified revascularization-induced regional
improvements in relative perfusion that were associated with risk of amputation after endovascular therapy. We
then developed and validated a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) perfusion imaging approach
using fluorine-18 (18F)-sodium fluoride (NaF), a radionuclide traditionally used for molecular imaging of bone
and vascular microcalcification. Dynamic 18F-NaF PET imaging revealed utility for quantifying regional,
absolute measures of muscle perfusion (i.e., ml/min/100g) in pigs and PAD patients with limb ischemia that
coincided with microvascular remodeling in pig skeletal muscle and symptom severity in PAD patients. The
goal of this proposal is to leverage the novel PET perfusion imaging method developed in the prior funding
period to optimize regional evaluation of absolute measures of skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients
undergoing endovascular revascularization. To accomplish this goal, in Aim 1, we will validate dynamic 18F-
NaF PET perfusion imaging as an approach for monitoring ischemia-induced alterations in skeletal muscle
morphology and mitochondrial function using a newly developed porcine model of chronic limb-threatening
ischemia (CLTI). In Aim 2, we will establish a healthy clinical database for 18F-NaF PET perfusion measures
and compare these perfusion measures to standard indices of macro- and microvascular disease in patients
with PAD. In Aim 3, we will quantify absolute changes in regional calf muscle perfusion in response to
revascularization procedures in patients with PAD using dynamic PET imaging, and evaluate the relationship
between regional perfusion responses and clinical outcomes. These studies are designed to pre-clinically
validate the utility of dynamic PET perfusion imaging for evaluating adverse remodeling of skeletal muscle and
test the clinical efficacy of this method for monitoring regional responses to endovascular treatment and
predicting clinical outcomes."

Hypertension (HTN) is a leading modifiable risk factor for global cardiovascular disease and stroke morbidity
and mortality. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has a high HTN burden. Evidence-based interventions
(EBIs) for detection and initiation of treatment for HTN are not widely implemented in Nigeria. These EBIs
include widely available (1) BP screening (reaching all adults >18 years of age) to identify HTN early and (2)
connections to ongoing primary care for HTN management. In partnership with community and clinical
stakeholders, we are currently adapting community-based strategies shown to be effective in increasing HIV
screening and connections to care. The proposed adapted strategies – called community vital signs (CVS)
strategies – will utilize community-based screenings, digital technologies, and supportive approaches to
connect people to healthcare facilities, leveraging our practice-based research network of community clinics
within the Model Innovation Research Centers created by the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance. We will
use the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and EPIS (Exploratory,
Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment) implementation science frameworks to guide our work. Aim 1 / R61
Phase (Year 1): Engage stakeholders to refine and finalize the co-creation of CVS strategies aiming to
increase rates of BP screening and connections to care in Nigeria. By the end of the R61 Phase, we will have
final CVS strategies and will recruit, train, and conduct implementation readiness assessments at 12
community-based sites connected with 12 healthcare facilities in 12 Nigerian cities (2 in each of Nigeria's 6
regions). R33 Phase (Years 2-5) Aim 2: Implement and assess CVS strategies aiming to increase rates of BP
screening at all 12 study sites (n=24,000 participants). We will initiate quarterly, community-based BP
screenings and evaluate using RE-AIM. Aim 3: Implement and compare 2 different CVS strategies to make
connections to primary care for those found to have high BP readings that meet HTN criteria at all study sites.
We will conduct a nested, hybrid implementation-effectiveness type III trial using a parallel 2-arm cluster
randomized design. Arm A (6 sites, n~3,000 participants): support connection to primary care by utilizing
mHealth digital technologies with bidirectional sharing of BP data between community screening site and
primary care clinic, coupled with a voucher for a medication starter kit (core strategies); Arm B (6 sites,
n~3,000 participants): Core strategies plus community health navigators making handoffs to clinic and sending
text messages (core+ strategies). This project promotes equitable access to HTN diagnosis and connections to
care, especially in cities where HTN prevalence is highest. It has the potential to significantly increase rates of
early HTN detection and prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with the downstream effect of
undiagnosed and uncontrolled HTN. It will provide evidence for scale-up of interventions to support self-
management of non-communicable chronic diseases in Nigeria and other low- and middle-income countries."
10804084,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylases (HAT) are zinc-dependent enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the
epsilon amine of lysine side chains. These proteins have been widely pursued as anti-cancer drug targets, but
therapeutic development has been largely unsuccessful given the essential nature of many HDAC proteins.
Recently, we discovered a synthetic lethal relationship between HDAC1 and HDAC2, which is caused by
recurrent chromosomal deletions that result in hemizygous deletion of HDAC1 in neuroblastoma and HDAC2 in
multiple myeloma. As a result of HDAC1 deletion, neuroblastoma cells are hypersensitive to disruption of
HDAC2, and vice versa in multiple myeloma. Using dTAG-mediated degradation or CRISPR/Cas9-based gene
disruption, we discovered that targeting HDAC1/2 synthetic lethality (e.g. degrading HDAC2 in neuroblastoma
cells with a hemizygous HDAC1 deletion) results in dissociation of the NuRD chromatin remodeler complex, of
which HDAC1/2 are members. Dissociation of the complex results in degradation of NuRD subunits that are
selectively required for neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma survival, suggesting that HDAC1/2 synthetic
lethality can be leveraged to target subunit-specific NuRD vulnerabilities in cancer. We hypothesize that HDAC1
deletions cause the NuRD subunits, HDAC2 / MBD3 / MTA3, to be essential for neuroblastoma, whereas HDAC2
deletions cause vulnerabilities to loss of their paralogs, HDAC1 / MBD2 / MTA2, in multiple myeloma. Here, we
will address this hypothesis and explore the translational potential of these vulnerabilities by developing small-
molecule modulators that target NuRD structure and/or function. In Aim 1, we will (i) Determine whether MBD
and MTA vulnerabilities are caused by HDAC1/2 deletions using CRISPR/Cas9, inducible RNAi, and dTAG-
based approaches in vitro and in vivo, (ii) Reveal whether the loss of NuRD subunits required for cancer cell
survival leads to dissociation and/or degradation of the NuRD complex using unbiased proteomics approaches,
and (iii) Establish if HDAC1/MBD2/MTA2 and HDAC2/MBD3/MTA3 form distinct NuRD sub-complexes as a
result of HDAC2 and HDAC1 deletions, respectively. These experiments will determine if subunit-specific NuRD
vulnerabilities are caused by HDAC1/2 deletions or simply exploited by HDAC1/2 synthetic lethality. In Aim 2,
we will develop small molecules targeting the NuRD complex to exploit NuRD vulnerabilities in genetically
defined cancer sub-types. Specifically, we will: (i) develop paralog-selective PROTACs that distinguish between
HDAC1 and HDAC2, (ii) determine the potential for covalent ligands of MTA3-Cys532 to disrupt NuRD structure
and/or function in MTA3-dependent cancers, and (iii) develop MTA3-targeted PROTACs based on ligands that
covalently engage MTA3-C532. Altogether, successful completion of these aims will determine the mechanisms
underlying NuRD vulnerabilities in cancer and advance novel chemical tools to drug and study them."

 Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) and associated neuropathic pain is a significant adverse
effect experienced by cancer patients who received paclitaxel infusion. It can adversely affect daily activities and
quality of life, and sometimes forces the suspension of treatment, which can negatively impact survival. However,
the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PIPN are uncertain, hindering the development of effective
therapies for this comorbidity. The proposed studies aim to identify molecular/cellular mechanisms initiating
PIPN. Patients with acute pain during paclitaxel infusion have a higher risk of developing PIPN, suggesting acute
excitation of sensory neurons is linked to the development of PIPN. Our recent study indicates that paclitaxel
excites sensory neurons by inhibiting KCNQ channels that are abundant in sensory neurons and axons.
Neuronal over-excitation results in quick ATP depletion. Transportation of molecules towards and away from the
soma is an ATP-dependent process critical for mitochondrial assembly and clearance. We hypothesize that the
acute over-excitation of primary sensory neurons induced by paclitaxel leads to ATP-dependent transport
impairment (including of mitochondria and mitophagosomes) in the axon, resulting in the pathological alteration
to the extremities in a “stocking and glove” distribution. In the proposed study, we will first detect whether early
over-excitation of DRG neurons induces PIPN-like alterations. Genetic tools will be used to stimulate sensory
neurons and monitor PIPN-like changes. Simultaneously, we will also use genetic tools to inhibit sensory neurons
and determine if it can prevent the development of PIPN. The relationship between ATP level and mitochondria
movement in the axon will be observed by live-cell imaging. The spatiotemporal distribution of abnormal
mitochondria and mitophagy activity along peripheral fibers after paclitaxel exposure will be observed in vivo to
evaluate the role of neuronal hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is critical
for the development of PIPN, and its relationship to the “stocking and glove” distribution of sensory dysfunction.
The effect of creatine, an ATP buffer, on mitochondria and mitophagy will also be observed. Finally, the efficacy
of the creatine and retigabine regime in the PIPN animal model will be determined in the context of metastatic
tumor burden. Therefore, this study may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying PIPN as
well as delineate novel targets for the treatment of PIPN."

Delivering molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a major challenge in treating mental
disorders and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Many therapeutic agents that have the potential to treat
these disorders have difficulty entering the brain due to the presence of the BBB. In this project, we are
responding to the NIH PAR-22-031 that calls for development of delivery systems that can target drugs to the
brain. We have recently developed BBB modulators (BBBMs) that significantly increase in vivo brain delivery of
small-to-large drug molecules including therapeutic peptides and proteins. Recently, BBBMs (i.e., HAVN1 and
DWI peptides) have been shown to selectively modulate the BBB over the peripheral vasculatures in the in vitro
and in vivo systems. Our hypothesis is that these BBBMs enhance brain delivery of therapeutic proteins by
modulating cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the paracellular pathway of the BBB. The overall goal of this
project is aimed at developing and optimizing the next generation of BBBMs as a novel and non-invasive delivery
system to target drugs to the brain. BBBMs transiently increase the porosity of the BBB paracellular pathways
to allow drugs to enter the brain from the bloodstream. To accomplish the overall goal, we will pursue the
following Specific Aims. First, a combination of virtual screening and 3D in vitro models of the BBB vs. peripheral
vasculatures will be used to optimize modulatory activity and selectivity of the next generation of BBBMs from
VE-cadherin. Second, DMPK profiles, toxicity, and selectivity of BBBMs will be evaluated using animal models.
Toxicity of BBBMs in various organs will be determined. Third, the biological effects of BBBMs-facilitated brain
delivery of FL-BDNF and BDNF peptides will be evaluated in mouse models of both sporadic and familial
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological effects of FL-BDNF and BDNF peptides in the brain will be assessed
by determining TrkB signaling, synaptic activity, AD neuropathology, and learning and memory. If successful,
this project will have impacts on (a) reversing neurodegeneration, (b) improving diagnosis and treatment of brain
diseases and injuries, (c) expanding our understanding of how the brain works at both the cellular and molecular
levels, and (d) designing new tools for monitoring brain function in vivo."
10931683,"Label-Free Optical Redox Imaging for Pretreatment Prognosis of Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast
Cancer
Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has significant intratumor variations in microenvironments and metabo-
lism, which can substantially affect disease progression and clinical outcomes. A TNBC tumor can contain hy-
poxic and normoxic regions and exhibit glycolytic, oxidative, or mixed metabolic subtypes. These metabolic
subtypes are typically on a submillimeter scale in clinically presented breast tumors, below the resolution of
current clinical metabolic imaging methods, highlighting the need of new high-resolution metabolic imaging
methods in the clinic. Optical Redox Imaging (ORI), a label-free fluorescence imaging technique developed at
the Britton Chance Laboratory of Redox Imaging, can detect intratumor metabolic subtypes three-
dimensionally (3D) with a resolution down to 25 µm. ORI measures the intrinsic fluorescence signals of re-
duced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and oxidized flavoproteins (Fp) and determines the oxidized
and reduced status of redox metabolism. Our preliminary results found redox hotspots, the highly oxidized re-
dox subtype in treatment-naïve specimens, from a pilot cohort of early-stage TNBC patients. Notably, in the
studied cohort, ORI redox hotspots predicted the risk of disease progression better than conventional clinical
indicators (e.g., tumor size, stage, grade, and nodal status). Our data studying untreated TNBC xenografts and
cell cultures also suggested that the redox hotspots are underpinned by the Warburg effect (glycolytic switch),
corroborating the prediction of risk of progression by ORI. Based on these results, the long-term goal of this
program is to establish the prognostic value of pretreatment ORI by expanding observations in TNBC clinical
specimens and preclinical models. Aim 1 will be a full-scale retrospective ORI study of frozen untreated surgi-
cal specimens from early-stage TNBC patients. We will test the hypothesis that the intratumor redox hotspots
predict an increased progression risk and add value to conventional prognostic indicators. Aim 2 will assess
the prognostic value of ORI in human TNBC mouse xenografts and cultured cell models using progression
endpoints and confirm that the activated glycolytic switch is the basis for the higher redox hotspot and risk of
progression. The successful accomplishment of this project will establish ex vivo ORI as a novel pretreatment
tool that is indicative of the intratumor glycolytic switch at submillimeter resolution and inform the risks of pro-
gression for individual patients with early-stage TNBC. Our project will help resolve the unmet clinical need for
accurate prognostic biomarkers to improve risk stratification and personalized treatment in TNBC."
10803899,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 During early human pregnancy, placental extravillous trophoblasts invade and remodel the uterine spiral
 arteries into distensible low-resistance vessels to promote placental perfusion and thus fetal development. A
 defect in uterine spiral artery remodeling (SAR) is the primum movens step that underpins adverse human
 pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia, which leads to systemic vascular dysfunction in and increased morbidity
 and mortality of the mother and offspring. However, there are no experimental primate models of defective
 SAR, noninvasive methods to detect the defect in SAR in early pregnancy or therapeutic modalities to prevent
 the maternal and offspring vascular dysfunction. We established a model of impaired SAR by slightly elevating
 estradiol in the first trimester of baboon pregnancy. This model is characterized by a decrease in extravillous
 trophoblast vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, increase in placental expression and
 maternal serum levels of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 receptor (sFlt-1) that suppresses VEGF
 bioavailability, maternal (published) and offspring (preliminary) vascular dysfunction, reduced fetal growth and
 increased incidence of perinatal demise. We also employed B- flow/spatio-temporal image correlation (STIC)
M-mode ultrasonography to detect SAR impairment in early pregnancy. Importantly, ultrasound-
 mediated/microbubble-facilitated gene delivery (UMGD) of VEGF to the placental basal plate of estradiol-
 treated baboons early in pregnancy abolished the defect in SAR. However, it has not been established
 whether reversing the defect in SAR by UMGD of VEGF will prevent maternal and offspring vascular
 dysfunction. The foundation built upon this primate model during the recent R01 HD 93070 project period,
 provides a highly unique opportunity to test the novel hypothesis that VEGF gene delivery to restore SAR will
 prevent vascular dysfunction in the mother, fetus and offspring. Baboons will be untreated, treated with
 estradiol to suppress SAR or treated with estradiol and UMGD of VEGF to reverse SAR impairment. Normal
 and defective SAR will be determined by B-flow/STIC M-mode ultrasonography in the first trimester. Vascular
 function will be quantified in the mothers and fetuses at midgestation and near term and the offspring at 0.5,
 1 and 4 years after birth. Systemic microvessel endothelial function will be ascertained by quantifying
 microvessel endothelial cell-specific nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and VEGF mRNAs by RT-PCR and protein
 levels by proximity ligation assay and capillary density by image analysis. Microvessel endothelial function will
 be assessed in mothers and offspring by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and microvessel flow by
contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEU) before and after hyperemia induced shear-stress and
acetylcholine with/without L-name administration. This study will be highly significant in establishing a
 therapeutic modality to prevent the maternal and infant vascular dysfunction that is caused by improper SAR."

This project will expand and improve the IPUMS Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (MLP), the world’s largest
longitudinal population data system. MLP currently includes linked censuses from 1850 through 1940,
administrative records from Social Security, selected vital records, and links between several surveys of aging
and the 1940 census. We propose to multiply the analytic power of MLP by expanding it and making it easily
interoperable with other sources of linked data. Under our proposed Aims, MLP will be expanded to include all
available records from the 1950 decennial census, new death certificate data, additional linkages to surveys of
aging, and rich data on health outcomes. To make this massive infrastructure sustainable and accessible, we
also propose refinement of software and methods for automatic record linkage, maintenance of the system of
linked records, and dissemination of linked data. The expanded and improved MLP will provide the most
comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will
transform our understanding of processes of population aging.
MLP is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education,
and policy-making on health and aging. The longitudinal panel will reduce redundant effort by researchers,
increase data quality, and improve replicability and comparability. The proposed work is directly relevant to the
core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: The new data will advance fundamental
knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in social, demographic, economic, and health
characteristics of the older population in the U.S. and will support research on the effects of public policies, social
institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, cognition, well-being, and functioning of people, both
over the life course and in their later years."
10803635,"The inability to slow or revert progression to posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after injury has devastating
consequences for a young population, whose only therapeutic option remains knee replacement at a young age.
Despite extensive research, PTOA pathophysiology continues to be poorly understood which translates in
suboptimal diagnosis tools and limited treatment options. Although there is consensus that cell death (apoptosis)
and low-grade inflammation play a major role in PTOA onset, we lack understanding on how these factors tip
the healing response to injury into a vicious cycle of perpetuating joint damage. Unfortunately, blocking
inflammation or apoptosis alone has proven to be insufficient to prevent progression to PTOA. In our preliminary
studies we found a synergistic interaction between apoptotic articular chondrocytes and the inflammatory
response of synovial cells that exacerbates apoptosis and inflammation creating a devastating production of pro-
inflammatory and catabolic signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that a combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis
and inflammation is needed to reinstate joint homeostasis after injury. Here we propose a comprehensive
approach to characterize the crosstalk between inflammation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We will identify
in vitro the crosstalk mechanisms and the molecular interplay between apoptosis and inflammation by analyzing
the transcriptome of articular chondrocytes and synovial cells exposed to one or both stimuli and by
characterizing the paracrine signaling. In vitro studies will allow us to study single interactions between cells and
stimuli. We will then assess inflammation and apoptosis in vivo. Studying the dynamic crosstalk between events
in knee joints represents a major challenge since we need to capture two processes in the same animal in vivo
overtime. Molecular imaging represents a natural approach that can capture both inflammation and apoptosis in
the same animal overtime and make possible the study of the dynamic synergistic interaction between these two
processes. We will combine our novel MRI contrast agent that detects pro-inflammatory signaling in articular
cartilage, with optical imaging agents targeting apoptosis and a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer
targeting the folate receptor expressed in activated macrophages. This multimodal imaging approach will allow
longitudinal assessment of the activity and timing of inflammation and apoptosis during the progression to PTOA.
We will investigate in vivo the effect of blocking apoptosis has in inflammation and vice versa. Finally, a
combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis and inflammation will be explored to reinstate joint homeostasis after
injury. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the crosstalk
between apoptosis and inflammation but also contribute to a fundamental understanding of how the interplay of
crucial pathological mechanism can contribute to PTOA onset."
10803699,"Project Abstract:
Membrane proteins are complex molecular machines whose functions are governed by sets of programed
conformational transitions. Attempts to establish the fundamental molecular mechanisms that link membrane
protein structure and dynamics to functions they induce have been thwarted by a number of seemingly
insurmountable technical barriers. Principal among these barriers is that the conformational transitions are too
transient to be studied using traditional structural biology techniques. To overcome these barriers, we have
developed and implemented a set of novel methodologies and reagents based on phage display generated
synthetic antibodies (sABs). Customize phage display selection strategies enable generation of sABs endowed
with special properties, for instance, conformation and regio-specificity. These reagents have been used to study
the molecular properties of transient states of membrane proteins at unprecedented detail. While sABs have
demonstrated efficacy as crystallization chaperones, their use in cryo-EM as powerful fiducial marks, adding 50
kDa to the particle and their ability to trap conformation states, is especially impactful in studies linking
conformational transitions and function. This is particularly relevant for smaller membrane proteins (< 50 kDa),
which include ion channels transporters and receptors. These constitute the largest class of biomedically relevant
target systems, but are recalcitrant to crystallization and are far too small for cryo-EM analysis. Building on our
current technology platform, we propose to design and deploy a set of higher-order sAB constructions that will
serve to increase the size, rigidity and, in some cases, the symmetry of the target membrane protein. These
sAB-based entities will be engineered to serve as prefabricated modules of assembly. They are targeted to
specific epitopes that have been introduced into the membrane protein and thus, can be universally employed
irrespective of the system they are applied to. The power of the approach is that these “universal” sABs can be
added to the molecule of interest in a “plug and play” fashion allowing any investigator access to the powerful
technology without requiring generating target specific sABs. To test and evaluate these novel sAB modules, we
will use a set of high value small membrane proteins provided by investigators from our collaborator network.
These systems have been recalcitrant to structural analysis using traditional approaches and thus, will provide
a good measure of the performance of the chaperone-assisted structure determination technologies. An
important byproduct is that these structures will provide valuable information about linkages between structure
and dynamics that had been out of reach previously."

Metabolic dysregulation with all of it pathophysiological sequelae, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and cancer, continues to be on the rise. We need to identify new areas that can be targeted for improvements
in systemic metabolism. Over the last funding period, we have made significant progress towards defining key
processes in the white adipocyte that lead to mitochondrial challenges and consequently, impaired adipose
tissue function. These include challenges to the mitochondrial import machinery through overexpression of
Amyloid Precursor Protein , loss of mitochondrial DNA and a dysregulation in iron metabolism through
overexpression of mitoNEET and mitoferritin. We have applied many of these challenges to other cell types of
relevance in adipose tissue, such as macrophages and adipocyte precursor cells. Here, we propose to
integrate these challenges and observe how they feed into the Integrated Stress Response of
mitochondria. We will analyze how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the mitochondrial stress
pathways result in altered cellular physiology of the white adipocyte. We can carefully time and titrate
these mitochondrial manipulations, then probe them either in the presence or absence of the integral
mitochondrial stress sensor, DELE1. We will examine these phenomena in the following areas: A) at the
cellular level in the mature adipocyte; B) in the microenvironment at the level of whole adipose tissue
physiology; C) at the whole-body level, assessing the systemic effects of the Integrated Stress Response.
Specifically, we propose to address the underlying mechanisms with the following hierarchical approaches: In
Aim 1, we will measure and manipulate mitochondrial stress. In Aim 2, we will manipulate mitochondrial
matrix iron levels and assess the impact on the Integrated Stress Response. In Aim 3, we will address the
interplay between the mitochondrial and ER stress phenomena. In Aim 4, we will determine the role that
the Integrated Stress Response has in activating the removal and packaging of sub-mitochondrial
particles through exosomes.
 Combined, this proposal will provide significant novel insights into the downstream consequences of
mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress and the Integrated Stress Response in the white adipocyte in vivo. We
are uniquely positioned to address these aims with mouse models that we have generated and characterized
during the initial ten years of this grant. In adipocytes, these interventions will severely tip the balance of
lipid storage, lipid oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism, thereby contributing directly to the
development of obesity and insulin resistance. These experiments will also enable us to carefully dissect
the effects of altered mitochondrial function on the production of the critical adipokine, adiponectin. These are
the first comprehensive in vivo experiments assessing the role of the Integrated Stress Response in the white
adipocyte. As such, this will enhance our understanding of how we define a properly functioning adipocyte."

The overall mission of the Georgia Food and Feed Rapid Response Team (GA RRT) is to
characterize, investigate, mitigate, and conclude food and feed emergencies as a part of a
coordinated federal-state-local integrated food safety system. This project will allow Georgia to
build upon past successes and continually improve and sustain the mission and resources of
the GA RRT. Since 2012, Georgia has built and strengthened an integrated and multiagency
response team not only within the state, but state to state, and engages all appropriate federal,
state, local, and tribal stakeholders. These stakeholders include representatives from
agriculture, environmental health, epidemiology, laboratories, law enforcement and many more.
The GA RRT has been heavily involved in rethinking what an effective response is by
innovating, developing, and revising best practice guidelines, standard operating procedures,
and memorandums of understanding to build and strengthen the state’s capability and capacity
to respond to food and feed emergencies.
One of the major goals the GA RRT intends to build upon is the continual use of a coordinated,
standardized, and integrated incident management team to respond to food and feed outbreaks
and emergencies. The GA RRT intends to expand its resources to both neighboring RRT and
non-RRT states. A commitment to mutual reliance is shared and the GA RRT has participated in
PFP projects, including a reportable food registry coordination and recall information sharing
project. We look forward to working on a project tying together response work utilizing the
Incident Command Structure and resource sharing with other RRT states across the nation on
FoodSHIELD.
Finally, the GA RRT will emphasize data analysis and prevention by conducting environmental
assessments and evaluating the data collected to share internally and externally. The GA RRT
is confident the goals outlined in this project will advance efforts for a nationally integrated food
safety system by supporting the MFRPS and FSTF programs within Georgia."

Craniofacial bone health is important to support eating, speaking, breathing, and expressing emotions, and is
critical to overall health and quality of life. It is known that the jawbone (mandible) is unique because it supports
teeth and shows a higher bone turnover rate than long bones. Our preliminary data described in the next
paragraph further reinforces this notion, especially in response to the loss of BMP signaling and alteration in
the mechano-environment. The FDA has approved recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2
(rhBMP-2) for clinical applications in treating skeletal defects and spinal fusions. In dentistry, rhBMP-2 has
been used to augment bone grafts in sinus augmentation and localized alveolar ridge augmentation, which
allows better prosthetic reconstruction. Much of the current knowledge for bone homeostasis is based on
research focused on long bones, including the efficacy of rhBMP-2 treatment. These facts prompted us to
identify unique mechanisms by which osteoblasts of the jaw respond BMP signaling, mechanosensing, and
their crosstalk. Completion of the proposed experiments will provide a unique set of data describing the means
by which osteoblasts in the jawbone may behave differently from those in long bones at a molecular level.
We previously reported that loss of function of Bmpr1a in osteoblasts (cKO), which encodes the type 1A
receptor for BMPs, results in increased trabecular bone mass in long bones, including tibia, spine, and ribs,
due to an imbalance between bone resorption and formation. In the jawbones, however, Bmpr1a cKO leads to
decreased bone mass - an opposite phenotype compared to long bones. The reduction of jawbone mass in the
cKO is rescued by a reduction of masticatory forces, while control mice lose bone mass in this condition.
Therefore, we hypothesize that mechanical loading induced by mastication plays a key role in the differential
response to BMP signaling between jawbones and long bones. We will set up 2 types of unbiased approaches:
1) using single-cell RNA-sequence to compare 2 bones (jaw and tibia) in WT and Bmpr1a cKO with different
mechanoenvironment (soft diet), and 2) using a newly emerged engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2)-
based proximity labeling technology to identify binding proteins to BMPR1A. The advantage of the APEX2
technology is to biotinylate interacting proteins with a 30-second time resolution, therefore, it is ideal for
obtaining alterations of the landscape of interacting proteins following stimulation of growth factors or
mechanical loading, or both. Completing this study will provide novel molecular insight for better physical and
pharmacologic interventions to treat degenerative bone conditions unique to the jawbone such as
osteonecrosis in the jaw and alveolar ridge augmentation by BMPs."
10786770,"Project Summary/Abstract: Septic encephalopathy (SE) constitutes a common form of encephalopathy with
an associated 70% mortality rate, underscoring the need for a highly effective treatment. The pathophysiology
of SE is linked to an energetic crisis in the brain combined with immune-mediated neuro-inflammation.
Specifically, neural cells shift their energy generation from aerobic oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to less-
efficient glycolysis. Energy deficiency in the brain leads to excess accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and subsequently to oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuronal cell death. Studies have highlighted a
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-related improvement in energetics that is partially achieved by the transfer of
bioactive molecules such as miRNAs and proteins carried by secreted extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). In our
preliminary work using a murine model of SE, we showed that MSC-EVs administered intravenously restore
cerebellar ATP and improve neuro-inflammation and Purkinje and granule cell viability. However, the
mechanisms by which MSC-EV cargo exerts its protective effects on neuronal integrity in SE have not been
studied. The goal of this application is to examine the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in SE using a mechanistic
approach to connect EV cargo with the regulation of metabolic and immune pathways. By including a murine
model of SE, we propose to examine whether specific members of the MSC-EV cargo (miRNAs and proteins)
alter metabolic and immune pathways, leading to improved neuronal cell viability. We hypothesize that in SE,
based on our previous work, MSC-EV cargo directly activates cerebellar OXPHOS-related and other metabolic
pathways, improving ATP generation, neuro-inflammation, and neuronal cell death. We will study in vivo the
MSC-EV mechanism of action by using inhibitors of MSC-EV miRNA and protein cargo members that are
abundant in the utilized EVs. The practical implication of this effort includes the development of EV-based
therapeutic protocols to alleviate the metabolic and immune abnormalities that can broadly affect neural cells in
encephalopathy and other conditions that cause brain injury. The PI is firmly committed to a career in translational
neuroscience research and his goals are strongly supported by his institution and the co-Is. He is currently a
tenure-track Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with 75% protected time for research and recently funded by
K12/STTR grants, and Children’s National Hospital has been providing him with bench and office space, and
computer/software support. The current proposal includes a comprehensive research plan that will advance our
knowledge in EV therapeutic properties using techniques such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry,
ATP measurement using Seahorse© technology, RNA/miRNA sequencing and advanced cerebellar
histopathology. This work will lead to an R01-level grant focusing on SE metabolism and EV therapeutics using
MSC-EVs and more efficient engineered EVs."
10786772,"1 Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common malignancy among young men aged 15 to 44 in the Unites States
 2 and many other countries. Whereas TC has strong genetic risk factors such as race or family history, the
 3 recent and global increase in TC incidence rate suggests the importance of the environmental risk factors in
 4 TC etiology. Multiple epidemiological studies independently found a significant link between marijuana use and
 5 increase in the TC risk. TC is derived from embryonic germline precursor cells – namely, primordial germ cells
 6 (PGCs) or gonocytes, and its tumorigenesis initiates prenatally to form pre-malignant precursor lesions known
 7 as Germ Cell Neoplasia In Situ (GCNIS) in testes before birth although diagnosis of TC peaks 25-35 years
 8 after birth. Because all available studies link the increased TC risk to adolescence/adult marijuana use, critical
 9 knowledge on effects of prenatal exposure to marijuana on TC risk is missing. The endocannabinoid system
10 regulates development of mammalian germ cells via paracrine actions through the cannabinoid receptors CB1
11 and/or CB2 expressed in germ cells and/or testicular somatic cells. We therefore hypothesize that the major
12 marijuana cannabinoids D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabidiol (CBD) may disrupt the normal
13 development of male PGCs/gonocytes via the cannabinoid receptors expressed by these germ cells and/or the
14 testicular somatic cells, leading to germ cell maldevelopment and transformation. To test this hypothesis, our
15 Specific Aim 1 will use human PGC-Like Cells (PGCLCs), a pluripotent stem-cell derived cell culture model of
16 PGCs, and the xenogeneic reconstituted testis (xrTestis), an organoid culture model in which human PGCLCs
17 are supported by mouse embryonic testicular somatic cells and differentiate to gonocyte-like cells (GoLCs). We
18 will expose normal or TC patient-derived PGCLCs (which harbor the genetic TC risk) with or without CRISPR-
19 knockout of CB1 and/or CB2, or xrTestes involving these PGCLCs, to THC, CBD, endocannabinoids, and
20 selective agonists/antagonists of the two cannabinoid receptors followed by bulk/single-cell deep sequencing
21 and various standard assays to obtain evidence that exposure of PGCLCs/xrTestis to cannabinoids causes
22 germ cell responses relevant to transformation, such as enhanced growth, delayed mitotic arrest of GoLCs,
23 suppression of apoptosis, chromosomal aneuploidy, and/or impaired differentiation. To distinguish the whole-
24 body effects of marijuana and its direct actions on prenatal testes, Specific Aim 2 will expose timed-pregnant
25 mice to THC and CBD during 12.5-17.5 dpc and collect fetal testes. Organ cultures of E12.5 embryonic testes
26 will also be exposed to THC and CBD for 5 days in vitro. Testicular samples after the in vivo or ex vivo
27 exposure to marijuana cannabinoids will be subjected to assays as described for Specific Aim 1 to obtain
28 evidence of germ cell transformation. The proposed research may obtain mechanistic evidence supporting the
29 link between marijuana and TC risk via direct gonadal effects of the cannabinoids, urging epidemiological
30 studies on marijuana use by pregnant women and TC risk of their male children."
10931676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to define vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to comprehensively eradicate MDS stem
cells (MDS-SCs). This objective is based on the concept that MDS-SCs lie at the root of disease and are not
effectively targeted by current therapies. A significant challenge in achieving this goal is the heterogeneity of the
MDS-SC population, as recent studies have identified distinct subsets of MDS-SC with varying responsiveness
to therapy. Thus, the premise of our work is that understanding and targeting the unique properties of
heterogenous MDS-SCs is critical to improve outcomes in MDS. The foundation of our project is built upon
laboratory studies coupled with an active clinical trial (NCT03564873) evaluating the clinical impact of targeting
protein synthesis with the global translation inhibitor omacetaxine (oma) in MDS-SC from individuals with high-
risk MDS. While the results from our trial using oma in combination with the hypomethylating agent azacytidine
(aza) are indeed promising and represent a substantial improvement over standard of care (aza alone), instances
of disease progression in patients suggest oma may not eradicate all MDS-SC subsets. These outcomes,
alongside toxicities associated with global protein translation inhibition have motivated us to better characterize
the unique biological and functional properties of heterogenous MDS-SC subsets. With the goal of developing
next-generation approaches that more effectively target MDS-SC while minimizing dose-limiting toxicities to
patients, here we will address two primary questions: 1) what is the overall efficacy of protein synthesis inhibition
amongst varying MDS-SC subtypes, 2) what are the optimal therapeutic strategies to eradicate MDS-SC based
on their sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibition? Hence, we will leverage comprehensive CITE-seq based
analyses of serial pre- and post-treatment specimens from our oma/aza clinical trial alongside PDX-based
functional studies to identify the link(s) between features such as protein synthesis activity, MDS-SC genotype
and clonal behavior with oma response at single cell resolution. We will define the mechanisms governing
reliance on protein synthesis in MDS-SC, focusing on pharmacological and molecular genetic-based targeting
of key pathways linked with oma sensitivity. Lastly, we will develop improved approaches to comprehensively
target heterogenous MDS-SC populations, with focus on next-generation strategies that more selectively target
aberrant metabolic features of MDS-SC uncovered by our ongoing CITE-seq characterization of patient
specimens. Taken together, the proposed studies will use advanced functional models and single-cell resolution
analyses to identify key vulnerabilities of MDS-SC that can be leveraged to design rational therapeutic
approaches to improve outcomes for MDS patients."
10874781,"Mechanistic Investigation of Gut Mycobiota in the Regulation of Lung Immunity and Disease (PA-20-188)
Project summary/Abstract
Asthma is a common, chronic airway inflammation that affects around 25 million Americans and 334 million
people worldwide. In the mammalian gut, a diverse fungal community, known as the mycobiota shapes local and
systemic host immune responses. Alterations of the gut fungal community are strongly associated with
inflammatory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD). Our recent findings suggest that intestinal specialized phagocytes could mediate the activation
of fungal-primed T cells during allergic airway disease. Despite these, the precise mechanisms of gut- lung
immune crosstalk are unknown. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that gut commensal fungi
initiate antifungal immunity that affects lung immunity and modulates the progression of airway inflammation.
The objectives of this project are to understand the molecular and cellular interplay between gut fungi and host
lung immunity with specific focus on T cells. While the current proposal is to illuminate the basic effects of gut
fungi on lung immunity and disease and to uncover mechanistic insights about gut-primed antifungal T cell
activation and migration on the development of immune-mediated airway inflammation. My long-term goal is to
investigate how the gut commensal mycobiota modulates the gut-systemic axis and impacts other pulmonary
diseases, such as COPD and cystic fibrosis (CF). During my K99 training, I will be supervised by a team of
mentors and scientific advisors with expertise in mycobiota, mucosal immunology, T cell biology and pulmonary
diseases. They will provide strong support and mentorship in both research and career transition to
independence, and help me to develop necessary technical skills and conceptual knowledge on lung immunity
and antifungal T cells. This K99/R00 award will enable me to acquire the skills necessary for a deep analysis
and understanding of the gut-systemic axis with the goal of creating novel therapies to treat asthma, COPD, CF,
and other immune-related pulmonary diseases."
10800127,"This R01 renewal application seeks to extend our initial observation that the cytosolic RNA-sensing pattern-
recognition receptor MDA5 plays a critical role in regulating the alveolar macrophage-mediated host resistance
against the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Mechanistic understanding of how alveolar
macrophages keep fungal infections at bay in immune competent individuals remains ill-defined. Currently,
there is a critical gap in understanding how the early host-pathogen interactions between fungi and
alveolar macrophages work to drive fungal clearance and host resistance. Our data from the last funding
period demonstrate a novel role of live fungal conidia in triggering the cytosolic RNA-sensing MDA5 receptor
specifically in alveolar macrophages to initiate the host protective type I and type III interferon response. Thus,
our central hypothesis is the lung specific programing of alveolar macrophages enables them to sense
multiple vitality features of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates to serve as a central hub of inflammation and
host resistance against this menacing fungal pathogen. In SA1 we identify features of alveolar macrophages
that enable the effective type I and type III interferon response which are necessary for host resistance against
A. fumigatus. This will be done using the adoptive transfer of a novel transgenic fetal-liver derived alveolar
macrophage technology developed in our Co-I’s laboratory to our MavsCd11c conditional knock-out mouse line,
which has been shown have a critical defect in host resistance against Aspergillus fumigatus. In SA2 we will
mechanistically follow-up on our observation that there are fungal dsRNA-dependent and fungal dsRNA-
independent mechanisms for triggering MDA5/MAVS activation. This will be done using novel isogenic pairs of
Aspergillus fumigatus that are infected or not with a dsRNA mycovirus, as well as Aspergillus fumigatus mutants
defective in mycotoxin production to identify the fungal effectors triggering MDA5/MAVS-dependent inflammatory
responses. Overall, this research fills a critical knowledge gap regarding the molecular mechanisms of the host-
pathogen interaction occurring in the lungs to drive the protective antifungal MDA5-dependent type I and type III
interferon response induced by Aspergillus fumigatus in alveolar macrophages in both mice and humans."
10925390,"Abstract
Persistent prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its high morbidity and mortality suggest that there
are significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that impair CVD health and better strategies are
needed. It is well known in the scientific community that the impact of environmental justice on CVD extends
beyond that of air pollution and encompasses neighborhood deprivation and social determinants. The literature
also consistently demonstrates that low income, vulnerable, and underrepresented individuals are at the greatest
risk of excessive exposure and lower resources to cope with and respond to the problems posed by these factors,
including CVD. However, integrated, and comprehensive investigation of the multiple layers of environmental
influence with individual-level factors is limited, especially in studies powered to investigate racial/ethnic
disparities. We recently estimated that median All of Us participant PM2.5 level is 10 μg/m3, slightly higher than
the US average of 7 μg/m3 and that people in the highest category have a 1.5 times increased risk of
stroke. These preliminary results suggest that effects are certainly being detected, but the story is complex and
requires analytic methods to tease apart correlated effects, weight influence, consider the effect of bias and offer
insight into the factors commonly thought to be protective among diverse populations and communities. This
project leverages the unprecedented opportunity to utilize existing data in the All of Us Researcher Workbench,
our prior linkage of environmental factors into the dataset, and novel analytic methods to investigate how the
social context and physical environment jointly contributes to disparities in CVD risk, and to further evaluate the
impact of individual-level factors (e.g., established genes, individual demographics) on the modification and/or
mitigation of these impacts. Our prior work in this area highlights how novel methods such as weighted quantile
sum regression can offer interpretable effects and clear messaging on the percent contribution of different factors
to chronic disease risk and disparities. As such, in addition to leveraging the unprecedented diversity in this
national cohort, the approach is responsive to what our IPMC communities and community partners have
requested in terms of areas of research interest and understandable answers."
10797844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Signal transduction and protein phosphorylation are vital for life. The ability to respond to stimuli is
considered a key characteristic of life. Cells detect new conditions, transduce relevant information into a
usable form, and execute appropriate responses. Errors in signal transduction can cause reduced fitness or
disease. A common strategy is to represent information by the specific and transient placement of phosphoryl
groups on proteins. Many pathogens use phosphorylation to regulate virulence in response to host parameters.
Thus, understanding the mechanisms, regulation, and impact of phosphoryl group transfer among microbial
signaling proteins is of fundamental interest, and of practical significance to infectious diseases of humans.
Kinetics of two-component regulatory system (TCS) phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to biological
function. TCSs are widely used for signal transduction by microorganisms and plants (but not humans) to
control virulence, physiology, development, behavior, etc. Sensor kinases detect stimuli and internalize input
on intracellular dimerization and histidine phosphorylation (DHp) domains using phosphoryl groups. Receiver
domains catalyze transfer of phosphoryl groups from sensor kinases to themselves and from themselves to
water to modulate response regulator output. Receiver domains can also reversibly exchange phosphoryl
groups with histidine-containing phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains to create more complex phosphorelays. The
kinetics of phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to synchronize responses with stimuli and can differ by many
orders of magnitude between TCSs that control biological functions operating on different timescales.
Innovative uses of protein sequence data to design experiments that provide insight into all TCSs. We
deliberately confront a key challenge arising from the genomic era - the large and increasing gap between the
number of identified TCSs and the number that can reasonably be studied experimentally. Our long-term goal
to comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in TCSs demands a
fundamentally different and less granular approach than studying one TCS at a time. We focus on aspects of
DHp, Hpt, and receiver domains that vary between TCSs, using bioinformatics to guide our experiments to
unravel the factors governing TCS specialization. We will determine mechanisms and factors that modulate
phosphotransfer reactions between DHp, Hpt, and receiver domains (AIM 1); DHp phosphatase activity (AIM
2); and receiver domain autocatalytic reactions, which form the basis of TCS signaling (AIM 3).
High impact on TCSs and beyond. TCS proteins are among the most abundant in nature. Completion of
our Aims will help predict the properties of uncharacterized TCSs from amino acid sequence features, facilitate
systems and synthetic biology applications of TCSs, and potentially aid design of antibiotics that target TCSs.
Robust predictive capability could mitigate limited experimental capacity to investigate uncharacterized TCSs.
The innovative bioinformatics strategies used and refined here can also guide study of any protein domain."
10800578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studying how human brain activity gives rise to mental states can reveal the neural mechanisms of emotional
functioning and provide novel neural-physiological markers to enable personalized therapies for diverse mental
disorders. For brain monitoring alone, intracranial EEG (iEEG) can measure multi-region multiday brain activity
with high temporal resolution. However, the above goals hinge upon the ability for simultaneous brain-behavior
monitoring, which remains immensely difficult for mental states due to challenges on the physiology, behavior,
machine learning, and ethics fronts. First, physiological monitoring beyond a single modality – e.g., electrodermal
vs. cortisol – is not possible with current wearables and the demonstrated wearables do not measure cortisol.
Second, behavioral monitoring during intracranial recordings is largely limited to self-reports, which are sparse.
Also, while social processes are a major trans-diagnostic domain of emotional functioning in NIMH’s RDoC
framework and adversely affected in diverse mental disorders, they are largely absent in current brain-behavior
monitoring, which does not afford systematic scalable measurement of mental states during social interactions.
Third, modeling of concurrent neural-physiological-behavioral data introduces a machine learning challenge,
involving many modalities, nonlinearity, and mixed behaviorally relevant and irrelevant dynamics to dissociate.
Finally, there are ethical issues. We build an interdisciplinary team of engineers, psychiatrists and behavioral
scientists, computer scientists, neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, and neuroethicists to address these challenges.
We will develop novel software and hardware tools to enable multimodal neural-physiological-behavioral
sensing and machine learning for mental states within social processes and beyond. The R61 in years 1-
4 will develop and validate the tools in healthy subjects (Aims 1,2) and in epilepsy patients with already-implanted
iEEG electrodes which cover many regions related to mental states (Aim 3). In R61, we develop i) an integrated
wearable skin-like sensor for multimodal physiological, biomechanical, and cortisol sensing; ii) conversational
virtual humans to evoke naturalistic social processes and enable emotion recognition using multimodal audio-
visual-language modalities; and iii) a nonlinear, multimodal, brain-behavior modeling, learning, and inference
framework for mental states. We will also study the ethics of multimodal data collection, mental privacy, and self-
trust. Once the R61 tools are validated, we will combine them with intracranial brain activity in epilepsy patients
in R33 in year 5 to learn multimodal biomarkers of mental states. Our approach spans multiple RDoC systems
including Negative Valence, Arousal and Regulatory Systems, and Social Processes. It enables several levels
of analysis including Circuits, Physiology, Behavior, and Self-Report. These systems span diverse disorders
such as anxiety and depression. Thus, our multimodal, convergent, and integrated approach will likely enable
unique brain-behavior insights into human emotion functioning applicable to broad domains of mental health."

In the United States (US), 85% of people living with HIV (PLWH) are aware of their HIV status, but only 62% are
linked to HIV care and less than half (48%) are retained in care and virally suppressed (49%). Violence has been
increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of poor engagement along the HIV care continuum. For
example, histories of intimate partner violence and child abuse are common among PLWH. Further, in the
Southeast, the current epicenter of the national epidemic and a region plagued by persistent
homophobia/transphobia, racism, social conservatism and poverty, PLWH are more likely to also experience
hate crimes and other community violence. Thus, violence screening and intervention within HIV care is critical
to ending the HIV epidemic in the South. But, given the multi-dimensionality of violence experience (i.e. intimate
partner violence, child abuse, community violence including non-partner assault and hate crimes) and the
resource and time constraints of Ryan White-funded HIV Clinics (RWCs) and Ryan White-funded AIDS Service
Organizations (ASOs) who serve the bulk of PLWH, it is paramount to first determine which forms of violence
are experienced most frequently and have greatest impact on HIV outcomes. This insight could help RW
agencies prioritize violence screening and support services. Thus in, Aim 1, we comprehensively assess
violence experience (interpersonal & community) and its association with RW program indicators of retention in
care (% of patients with no medical visit in last 6 months of measurement year; % with medical visit every 6
months over 24-months) and viral suppression (% with HIV viral load <200 copies/ml) among 300 PLWH (men
and women, cis and transgender) from RWCs and ASOs in Metro Atlanta. Next, in response to the dearth of
evidence regarding preferences of PLWH for violence screening and to ensure violence screening does not
inadvertently re-traumatize survivors, in Aim 2, we conduct semi-structured interviews among a purposive
sample (n=75) of survey participants (men and women, cis and transgender PLWH, in and out of care) to
determine acceptability and preferences for violence screening (e.g., what, where, how, who) and support
services/treatment options that RWCs and ASOs could adopt. Lastly, in recognition of the need to integrate RW
agency stakeholder preferences and address provider, staff, and agency-level barriers to screening and support
service provision/referral for the process to be effective, in Aim 3, we conduct an explanatory sequential, mixed
methods assessment consisting of a regionally-targeted survey (N=600) and key informant interviews (n=60)
among administrators, staff and providers working in RWCs and ASOs in Atlanta and across the Southeast to
assess inner and outer setting factors that may influence adoption and implementation of (a) violence screening,
and (b) violence-relevant treatment/support. Findings will inform development of (1) key stakeholder-driven,
evidence-based violence screening protocols and (2) a proof-of-concept violence support model that leverages
existing local RWC and ASO infrastructure to address psychosocial consequences of violence among PLWH."
10804738,"Project Summary
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in Western countries. Forebrain HSE (which develops via olfactory neurons) in otherwise healthy children can result from inborn errors of the TLR3 pathway (mutations in TLR3, UNC93B1, TRIF, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3), whereas brainstem HSE (via trigeminal (TG) neurons) can result from inborn errors of RNA lariat metabolism (DBR1). Children with a broader defect of impaired production of (NEMO) or response to all IFNs (STAT1) are prone to HSE and other infections. We analyzed the cellular basis of HSE by deriving peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (NIH R01NS072381). TLR3-deficient forebrain cortical neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors have impaired anti-HSV-1 cell-intrinsic immunity, unlike astrocytes and neural stem cells; microglial cells were not tested. Moreover, iPSC-derived TG neurons do not rely on TLR3 to control HSV-1; olfactory neurons were not tested. Finally, TLR3 controls both basal IFN levels and early steps of anti-HSV-1 immunity in cortical neurons. Childhood HSE results thus from inborn errors of non-hematopoietic, CNS-specific, cell-intrinsic immunity, affecting cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes in particular. We have since identified new forebrain HSE-causing genes that are connected to the TLR3-IFN circuit (MEX3B, IFNAR1), the TLR3-necroptosis pathway (RIPK3), and of unknown function (SNORA31, TMEFF1). In this renewal application, we hypothesize that genetic etiologies of forebrain HSE impair intrinsic immunity in cortical but not olfactory neurons, and in oligodendrocytes and probably microglial cells, and DBR1 deficiency impairs intrinsic immunity in brainstem and/or TG neurons and probably microglial cells. First, we will assess the responses of iPSC-derived olfactory and cortical neurons, and other CNS cells, from controls and patients mutated in new forebrain HSE-causing genes, to TLR3, IFN-α/β or IFN-λ, and HSV-1 stimulation. Second, we will study RNA lariat accumulation, immunity to HSV-1 infection, and responses to IFN-α/β or IFN- λ, in control and DBR1-deficient iPSC-differentiated TG and brainstem neurons. Third, the role of microglial cells in forebrain vs brainstem HSE will be assessed by studying the responses to TLR3 agonists, IFN-α/β, IFN-λ and HSV-1, in isolation and in neuronal co-culture. Patient and isogenic iPSC lines in which the mutation is corrected or introduced by gene editing will be used. Cell-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 and its molecular basis will be analyzed. Exciting preliminary data have been obtained, including (1) novel genetic etiologies of HSE, (2) novel mechanisms by which TLR3 controls HSV-1 in cortical neurons, and (3) novel protocols to differentiate brainstem neurons and microglial cells. The expand of this human iPSC-based study of HSE will enable us to dissect in greater breadth and depth its molecular and cellular basis in children with inborn errors of CNS-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1."
10801330,"Project Summary. New anti-inflammatory therapies are needed to help the millions of Americans that are
afflicted by one or more chronic inflammatory conditions. Conventional anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective
and limited by deleterious side-effects that result from administering drugs systemically and at high doses. Many
chronic inflammatory conditions manifest locally, not systemically. Localized delivery of natural
immunoregulatory molecules is an attractive strategy to treat chronic local inflammation. The proposed research
will develop a new anti-inflammatory therapy based on synthetic multivalent assemblies of galectin-1 (“G1”) and
galectin-3 (“G3”). G1 and G3 are natural regulators of inflammation that signal changes in immune cell behavior
via membrane glycan recognition. Despite some reported successes of wild-type G1 and G3 as anti-
inflammatory therapies, their potency is ultimately limited by their low carbohydrate-binding affinity and their
unstable active quaternary structures. To address these limitations, our approach joins G1 and G3 into synthetic
multivalent nanoassemblies. We make these nanoassemblies through recombinant fusion of G1 and G3 onto
the N- and C-termini of peptide linkers that form a-helical coiled-coils. Using this approach, we created G1/G3
Zipper, a heterotetramer with two G1 and two G3 domains (i.e., a dimer-of-dimers). G1/G3 Zipper was shown to
have significantly greater signal potency than wild-type G1 and G3 in vitro, and acts through different receptors
and different pathways than the wild-type proteins. Preliminary data demonstrate that G1/G3 Zipper can
suppress sterile inflammation induced by l-Carrageenan, whereas an engineered G1 homodimer is ineffective.
G1/G3 Zipper can also resolve imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Using a similar coiled-coil scaffold approach, we
recently demonstrated that the signaling activity of G3 increases as the number of G3 domains increases from
two to six. Informed by these data, the guiding hypothesis of the proposed research is that the anti-
inflammatory potency of G1/G3 Zipper constructs can be maximized by increasing the number of G1 and G3
domains. To test this hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 is to measure the signaling activity of G1/G3 Zipper constructs
with four or six G1 and G3 domains using various cell models of G1 and G3 signaling. Specific Aim 2 is to
evaluate the effectiveness of G1/G3 Zipper constructs to suppress local inflammation using the l-Carrageenan
and imiquimod-induced psoriasis models. We will use ELISA, bulk RNAseq, and in vivo imaging to identify the
mechanisms of action of G1/G3 Zipper. We will use in vivo imaging and histology to establish G1/G3 Zipper
pharmacokinetics. We will use humoral immunity models to assess G1/G3 Zipper safety. Completion of the
proposed studies will establish our innovative G1/G3 Zipper construct as a new class of anti-inflammatory
therapy. Harnessing the immunomodulatory activity of G1 and G3 to treat chronic local inflammation has the
potential to impact nearly all aspects of human health. Establishing valency-function relationships of G1/G3
Zipper in two inflammation models will be valuable for translation of galectin therapies."

Every year, more than 15M babies are born too soon, resulting in more than 1M deaths. In fact, preterm birth
(PTB) affects approximately 1 in 10 births across the globe, including 1 in 10 US births. Despite this, methods
for the prediction and prevention of PTB are sorely lacking. Of note, more than 60% of PTBs are spontaneous
(sPTBs), brought about by premature contractions or membrane rupture. The most common finding in sPTB is
significant inflammation among the expectant mother. Yet, levels of circulating and even localized inflammatory
markers during pregnancy fail to clinically predict who will versus will not progress to future sPTB. Similarly,
antibiotics for asymptomatic infections and anti-inflammatories do not reduce risk for sPTB and are therefore
not recommended for broad administration. To address such deficits, we developed a novel immunomonitoring
method for use in prenatal care with the goal of predicting future sPTB and informing allocation of targeted,
preventive interventions. In other words, we aimed to diagnose and address the immunopathologies driving
sPTB risk. We have now shown that our novel prenatal immunomonitoring method can predict future birth
timing in low-risk cohorts and future sPTB in moderate to high-risk cohorts, outperforming all available
methods. In addition, our ex vivo experiments showed considerable inter-individual variation in the
immunomodulatory effects of progesterone on immune function during pregnancy, which may explain why the
drug is beneficial for some but not others. Thus, quantifying these immunomodulatory effects may provide a
direct avenue toward targeted prevention of sPTB using a drug that is known to be safe during pregnancy. In
the “Prenatal Immunomonitoring in Spontaneous Preterm Birth Prevention (PROMIS)” study, we
propose to refine, expand, and clinically validate our prenatal immunomonitoring methods in a large, diverse
clinical cohort. Our long-term goal is to save lives by predicting and preventing future sPTB. Our central
hypothesis is that this can be accomplished using our novel prenatal immunomonitoring methods, which aim
to diagnose and address the drivers of sPTB risk. To test this hypothesis, we’ll enroll a diverse cohort
presenting for the prenatal care of singleton pregnancy, with early pregnancy patient-oriented data and
biospecimen collection, mid-pregnancy cervical length measurement, and post-birth medical record review.
We’ll test a prenatal immunomonitoring algorithm for the prediction of future sPTB. We’ll characterize the
immunomodulatory effects of progesterone and examine the association between this profile and future sPTB.
We expect the PROMIS study to produce novel insights into the pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention of
sPTB. Importantly, risk prediction and targeted prevention go hand-in-hand, making advancements in one area
dependent upon our capacity to advance the other. The potential impact of this study lies in its potential to
identify sPTB risk using clinically feasible methods AND characterize risk phenotypes in a manner that allows
us to address them. Thus, this project could provide unprecedented opportunity to predict AND prevent sPTB."

hormone therapy is a community priority for TG people and can be a critical protective factor for
improving general health and well-being. However, exogenous hormone use doubles the risk of
breast cancer (BC) in cisgender (sex assigned at birth aligns with gender) women. Yet it is
unknown whether gender-affirming hormone therapy modifies BC risk in TG individuals. Despite
this lack of evidence, current BC screening guidelines state TG men and women should follow
cisgender guidelines, especially if they are ≥50 years old and if TG women have used hormones
for ≥5 years. We hypothesize that gender-affirming hormone therapy modifies BC cancer risk,
and the steroid metabolome will reflect this. We will test our hypothesis with our SPECTRUM
(Studying PRIDE to Enhance Cancer screening guidelines for TRansgender Users of gender-
affirMing hormones) Study in response to the Notice of Special Interest NOT-MD-19-001. We will
recruit individuals (aged 25-50 years) across the spectrum of gender identities with varying
hormone use through an ancillary study of PRIDE, one of the largest nationwide cohorts of sexual
and/or gender minority people, of whom 33% are TG. We will use this cohort to conduct the
following aims: Aim 1) Quantify hormone use across the gender identity spectrum (n=5000) and
examine the association between hormone use and the steroid metabolome in a subset (n=1200),
Aim 2) Evaluate longitudinal changes in the steroid metabolome based on age, gender-affirming
hormone use, and gonad inventory in TG men and women (n=600), Aim 3) Incorporate hormonal
evidence into screening guidelines using the Delphi method with 10 experts. Until gender identity
data are collected systematically, a TG-enhanced cohort provides a valuable resource to
understand the role of gender-affirming hormone therapy and BC risk at the molecular level. Such
knowledge is lacking yet could greatly improve screening recommendations, which now simply
extrapolate cisgender guidelines to TG populations. Given the high prevalence of gender-
affirming hormone therapy and the benefits it provides in terms of mental and general health, TG
populations deserve to know what hormone use means in terms of their cancer risk. Practitioners
who serve SGM people and screen for cancer also need guidelines that are evidence-based and
gender-affirming."

Seasonal influenza viruses cause significant disease burden. While seasonal influenza vaccines are available,
these are often poorly efficacious due to mismatch with circulating virus strains, particularly in the populations at
greatest risk of complications from infection, including the elderly, infant, and immunocompromised. Influenza A
viruses (IAV) also pose a pandemic risk for which seasonal influenza vaccines provide no cross protection. In
2018, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) released a strategic plan for developing
a universal influenza vaccine and subsequently released the FOA PA-18-859, “Advancing Research Needed to
Develop a Universal Influenza Vaccine.” The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a universal influenza
vaccine.
We hypothesize that a flu vaccine composed of broadly cross-reactive B-and T-epitopes covalently linked to an
immune adjuvant will elicit potent immune responses and protect against diverse influenza A virus infections and
associated disease. This expectation is supported by our prior studies which demonstrated a fully multi-
component vaccine composed of tumor associated glycopeptide B- and CTL-epitope, a peptide CD4 T cell
epitope and a TLR2 agonist (Pam3CysSK4) elicited robust immune responses and protected against a stringent
tumor challenge in a murine cancer model. We will chemically synthesize multi-component vaccines that are
composed of conserved peptide antigens derived from IAV and an adjuvant such as Pam3CysSK4 or
monophosphoryl lipid A (Aim 1). In addition, we will employ an enzymatic glycan remodeling strategy to modify
recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA), which is used as a licensed flu vaccine, with various TLR agonists and DC
targeting moieties (Aim 2). It is expected that the self-adjuvanting rHA vaccines will enhance antigenicity of
conserved but poorly immunogenic stalk domain thereby providing heterologous protection. We will also explore
whether covalent attachment of immune-potentiators to recombinant neuramidase (rHA) can enhance its
immunogenicity and provide broad protection (Aim 3). The immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine
candidates will be evaluated in murine and ferret vaccination and challenge models, using innovative approaches
and antigen probes to assess polyfunctional T cell responses and geminal center (GC) B cell response. This
research is significant as it directly addresses multiple NIAID priorities in their strategic plan for developing a
universal influenza vaccine. The results of these studies could have a significant impact as the universal influenza
vaccines developed should be suitable for advancement to pre-clinical studies. Moreover, the adjuvants and
approaches developed in this proposal will be applicable to other vaccines and study of the host response to
influenza infection, and will have broader impacts beyond universal influenza vaccine development."

 The ability to perform dynamic imaging of time-varying physiological processes in small animal models is
critically needed to understand the progression of human disease and develop new therapies. Although dynamic
imaging methods have been used to evaluate tumor vascular perfusion in small animal models, the available
methods typically provide only two-dimensional (2D) spatial imaging, lack the precision needed for quantitative
measurements, or suffer from other drawbacks. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) can circumvent
the limitations of existing methods and has been recognized as a promising tool for dynamic small animal
imaging. By exploiting the optical absorption of hemoglobin or exogeneous contrast agents, dynamic PACT holds
great potential for measuring important time-varying biomarkers such as tumor vascular perfusion and
oxygenation and improving the assessments of anti-cancer and other therapies.
 While exciting, current dynamic PACT technologies for small animal imaging still possess several
fundamental limitations. Many biological models require true 3D spatial imaging of time-varying physiological
processes. However, most of the available dynamic PACT technologies have been designed to rapidly image
two-dimensional (2D) slices. While fully 3D PACT imagers are available, most employ a tomographic
measurement process in which a gantry containing acoustic transducers is rotated about the animal. This
presents unmet challenges for dynamic image reconstruction because only a small number of tomographic views
is available to reconstruct each temporal image frame. Moreover, the ability of the available image reconstruction
methods to produce quantitatively accurate estimates of the wavelength-dependent optical properties of an
object is largely unproven. For dynamic PACT to be established as a transformative preclinical imaging modality,
there remains an urgent need for accurate new image reconstruction methods that can be deployed with widely
available 3D imagers that use rotating gantries.
 The broad objective of this project is to directly address these challenges by developing novel and advanced
dynamic PACT image reconstruction methods that permit both four-dimensional (4D) imaging (3D space + time)
and five-dimensional (5D) multi-spectral imaging (3D space + time + wavelength). This will be game-changing
and will enable, for the first time, high-resolution and quantitatively accurate 4D and 5D whole-body PACT
imaging of small animal models with widely available PACT imagers that utilize rotating gantries.
 The specific aims of the project are: Aim 1. To develop 4D image reconstruction methods for dynamic PACT;
Aim 2. To develop 5D image reconstruction methods for dynamic PACT; Aim 3. To refine and validate the
proposed methods using well-characterized phantoms; Aim 4. To demonstrate and validate the proposed
reconstruction methods in in-vivo studies."

Advances in catalytic science and technology enable the preparation of pharmaceutical agents used to
treat human disease. This project has the long-term goal of developing a broad class of inexpensive
nonmetal catalysts that promote catalytic transformations via formal oxidation state cycling in qualitative
analogy to transition metal catalysis. Within this overarching goal, the primary focus of this proposal is
the design and application of phosphorus-based catalysts that function in the P(III)⇌P(V) redox couple.
While phosphines are well-established in catalysis as spectator ligands for transition metal catalysis and
as nucleophilic catalysts, this research describes innovative phosphorus-based catalysts of novel com-
position and structure that explore the structural and electronic conditions required to enable new catalyt-
ically-relevant reactivity via reversible P(III)⇌P(V) oxidation state cycling. The first major effort is the de-
velopment of new methods for activation of amides and stable oxoanions for direct functionalization via
P(III)⇌P(V) redox reactivity. The second major effort is the development of phosphine-catalyzed O-atom
transfer methods that result in reductive transformations of nitroarene compounds to furnish functional-
ized anilines through the formation of new carbon-nitrogen bonds. The third major effort involves the de-
velopment of P(III)⇌P(V)-catalyzed O-atom transfer methods that result in reductive N-functionalization
of nitroalkanes, including new phosphacyclic structures that express biphilic P(III)⇌P(V) redox reactivity.
The proposed research is expected to yield new practical catalytic methods for the construction of phar-
macologically-relevant small molecules that meet the challenges of sustainable synthesis, and an im-
proved fundamental understanding the interplay between structure and reactivity in the p-block that will
underpin future development of nonmetals for atom transfer, bond activation, and catalysis. Taken to-
gether, these outcomes will advance nonmetal-based redox catalysis as a powerful modality in pharma-
ceutical synthesis."

Vancomycin is one of the most commonly used antimicrobial drugs in inpatient settings. National guidelines
recommend Bayesian models to monitor the therapeutic drug concentration of vancomycin, especially for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), to minimize drug toxicity while maintaining its efficacy.
Existing Bayesian models, despite being claimed as patient-specific pharmacokinetic (PK) models, use simple
patient features and are studied in limited patient populations for the population-based PK parameters (the
Bayesian prior). Increasingly available real-world electronic health records (EHR) provide a wide range of
patient-specific data, including data on vancomycin dosage and serum levels. However, the limited flexibility of
the Bayesian model structure prohibits the full use of these rich data. Deep-learning models, such as recurrent
neural network (RNN), are particularly attractive for PK of vancomycin in EHR, compared to Bayesian models
and other traditional machine learning models, because deep-learning models enable more flexible patient-
specific inputs and possess a higher latent capacity. Thus, they deliver better predictions for a diverse
population. Our deep-learning model for vancomycin (PK-RNN-V) outperforms publicly available Bayesian
models but can be improved on various aspects. In Aim 1, we will improve PK-RNN-V model architectures and
add more patient-specific data and a finer timestep. We will construct two-compartment PK-RNN models to
increase predictive power in patients with unsteady states. We will augment PK-RNN-V with Med-BERT to
improve the embedding of categorical data. We will also develop multi-track ordinary differential equations
models for simultaneous prediction of serum creatinine and vancomycin levels. In Aim 2, we will use EHR from
different sources to validate our PK-RNN-V model and improve the data-extraction flow and pre-processing to
harmonize data from healthcare systems. We will use EHR from Houston Methodist Hospital and Memorial
Hermann Hospital System/The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, TX, the University of
Arizona in Phoenix, AZ, and the publicly available MIMIC-IV database (Boston, MA). These databases contain
data from more than 121,007 patients who received at least one dose of intravenous vancomycin. In Aim 3, we
will add dosing recommendations based on PK-RNN-V model predictions as a feature and validate our model
in specific subgroups with challenging vancomycin PK to predict PK levels. This project will deliver substantial
model improvements, leading directly to the optimization of vancomycin use in hospitals, increased in patient
safety by minimizing adverse events, and reduced healthcare costs, which align with NIH’s research mission."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the most common and growing complications in pregnancy,
presents striking racial and ethnic disparities. Asian American women are twice as likely to have GDM as non-
Hispanic White women and there is also substantial heterogeneity in GDM rates across Asian subpopulations.
The molecular mechanisms and upstream determinants for the high and heterogeneous risk of GDM across
Asian subpopulations remain largely understudied since they are under-represented in health research. As one
of the fastest-growing racial and ethnic groups in the US, it is crucial to better understand the molecular
differences and similarities across Asian subpopulations to help elucidate the pathophysiology underlying their
high and heterogeneous risk of GDM. Metabolomics is a powerful tool for comprehensively evaluating global
metabolic signatures and understanding biological pathways. However, metabolomics studies among pregnant
individuals are still limited and most have no or few Asian Americans. This study aimed to fill the current data
and knowledge gaps for GDM disparity research by using a highly cost-efficient design that leverages the existing
and unique resources: the California (CA) Alpha-fetoprotein Screening Program (CA-AFSP) and the Pregnancy
Environment and Lifestyle Study (PETALS). In the discovery sample from the CA-AFSP program which covers
>74% of the pregnant individuals in Southern CA, we propose to perform integrated untargeted and targeted
metabolomic profiling using stored serum samples collected in early-mid pregnancy (15-19 gestational weeks)
from 1500 individuals of four Asian subpopulations (i.e., 375 each of Chinese, Filipinos, Indian, and Vietnamese).
We will identify metabolomic signatures in early-mid pregnancy associated with GDM in the CA-AFSP program
and determine which metabolites and pathways overlap across all Asian Americans or distinguish across Asian
subpopulations (Aim 1). We will construct an external validation set from the above four Asian subpopulations
who participated in the PETALS cohort at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA. The PETALS is a well-characterized
cohort with anthropometrics, multi-domain survey data, comprehensive health data from state-of-the-art
electronic health records, and serum metabolomics assessed at 16-19 gestational weeks. We will validate GDM-
related metabolomic signatures in the PETALS cohort for all Asian Americans and each Asian subpopulation
(Aim 2) and examine associations of upstream lifestyles and social determinants of health (SDOHs) with GDM
risk and metabolic signatures and whether metabolomic signatures partially mediate the association between
upstream lifestyles and SDOHs with GDM risk (Aim 3). As the largest-scale study to date, our integrative
approach encompassing metabolomics, lifestyles, and SDOHs provides an unparalleled opportunity to elucidate
mechanisms of the drastic racial and ethnic disparities in GDM and to inform precision preventions for the high-
risk, heterogeneous Asian subpopulations. Thus, this study has the potential to improve minority health and
health equality in our nation."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are characterized by neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death.
Also associated with these diseases is an abnormal deposition of the TDP-43 protein. This protein has
multiple roles in RNA metabolism, and we have previously demonstrated that one of its functions is to limit the
accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA rarely accumulates in normal cells (particularly in the
cytoplasm), but commonly occurs during viral infection. Thus, abnormal dsRNA is recognized by cells as a
sign of infection, leading to the induction of an antiviral innate immune response and the induction of cell death
pathways. The central hypothesis we will test in this proposal is that in AD and ALS/FTD the accumulation
of dsRNA induces inappropriate activation of antiviral responses that contribute to the observed
neuropathology. Our goals are to determine: 1) the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to dsRNA
accumulation, and 2) how dsRNA accumulation leads to glial and neuronal dysfunction. Characterization of
pathways that lie both upstream and downstream of dsRNA accumulation in the context of AD, ALS/FTD, and
other neurodegenerative diseases has the potential to generate novel therapeutic targets for these currently
untreatable pathologies.
 Our preliminary studies demonstrate that dsRNA accumulates in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients
and the motor cortex of ALS patients. We will immunopurify and sequence this dsRNA from human brain to
determine its origins. Transgenic mouse models with conditional depletion of TDP-43 will be characterized to
define the temporal relationships between TDP-43 loss, dsRNA accumulation, gliosis, and neuronal cell death.
Infection of human iPSC-derived neural cultures with engineered lentivirus and infection of mouse models with
engineered adenovirus will be used to artificially generate dsRNA to investigate the pathways by which dsRNA
leads to disease-relevant neuropathology."
10806138,"Atherosclerosis is initiated and promoted by the arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing

intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and then low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. Current cholesterol-

uncontrolled VLDL- and IDL-cholesterols still significantly contribute to the high residual atherosclerotic

the underlying mechanisms by which hepatocyte tPA lowers plasma apoB-containing lipoprotein-cholesterol

of VLDL particles requires proper apoB lipidation, but major gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms
by which this happens. Our preliminary data strongly support our hypothesis that silencing hepatocyte tPA
increases plasma apoB lipoprotein-cholesterol by promoting hepatic VLDL lipidation. Completion of this aim will
add novel insights to the understanding of the production of atherogenic apoB-lipoproteins. Aim 2: Determine
whether hepatocyte tPA enhances apoB-VLDL intracellular degradation before secretion. Intracellular
degradation of apoB-VLDL particles prior to their secretion is important to maintain the optimal plasma levels of
atherogenic cholesterol and normal liver lipid levels, but the mechanism is poorly understood. We will increase
hepatocyte tPA expression in mice to test hypothesis that hepatocyte tPA enhances VLDL intracellular
degradation before secretion. Completion of this aim will provide a novel mechanism to maintain intrahepatic

VLDL and IDL) while maintaining the homeostasis of intrahepatic lipid levels is a promising strategy to reduce
the residual atherosclerotic risk. However, therapeutic gaps remain in lowering atherogenic cholesterol without

Atrial excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release have unique features
and are distinctly different from ventricular ECC. During ECC the action potential (AP) initiates Ca release from
the SR Ca stores primarily through the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca release channels. The atrial SR has a
second, albeit less abundant Ca release channel, the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). IP3R induced
Ca release (IICR) participates in ECC but also has non-ECC functions, including contribution to pacemaker
activity, mitochondrial Ca signaling, and regulation of transcription factor activity important for
pathophysiological atrial remodeling. IICR has sex-specific attributes and exerts positive inotropic effects, but
also facilitates proarrhythmic Ca release. IICR is upregulated in atrial tissue in heart failure (HF), which
facilitates SR Ca release and enhances atrial contraction, but also leads to increased risk of alternans and
atrial fibrillation. The cardiac IP3R is target of post-translational modifications. New preliminary data
demonstrate that in atrial myocytes the IP3R is co-regulated by IP3 and ROS provided by NADPH-oxidase type
2 (NOX2) and involves ROS-dependent IP3R glutathionylation. The overall goal of this proposal will test the
hypothesis that in atrial tissue a NOX2/ROS/IP3R signaling domain is responsible for the positive inotropic and
proarrhythmic effects of IICR, and to determine HF induced changes in ROS dependent IICR regulation and
their consequences for atrial remodeling, alternans and atrial fibrillation (AF) risk. The 3 specific aims are:
Specific aim 1: Define the mechanism of IP3R co-regulation by IP3 and ROS and determine its sex-specific
attributes. We will test the hypotheses that IICR is co-regulated by IP3 and ROS in a defined NOX2/ROS/IP3R
microdomain and that ROS dependent glutathionylation of IP3R modulates atrial Ca release during ECC.
Alternative candidates of cellular ROS sources (mitochondria, NOX4) for IP3R modulation in addition to NOX2,
and sex-specific attributes of ROS/IP3 co-regulation of IICR will be determined.
Specific aim 2: Determine atrial remodeling of NOX2/ROS/IP3R signaling and its consequences for ECC, Ca
release and transcription factor regulation in HF. We will test the hypothesis that in atrial tissue of a ventricular
HF model ROS sources alternative to NOX2 upregulate IICR and thereby change its contribution to atrial Ca
transient (CaT), contraction, and transcription factor (NFAT) activation through nuclear IP3Rs.
Specific aim 3: Determine the mechanisms of ROS/IICR mediated increase in Ca alternans propensity and
AF susceptibility in normal and HF atrial tissue. We will test the hypotheses that IICR facilitates pacing induced
CaT alternans that is further enhanced in HF, and that synergistically ROS/IICR mediated alternans generates
a substrate that increases the susceptibility for AF episodes."

Advances in B cell biology and molecular virology have enabled the discovery, characterization, and commercial
development of several classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), with applications for prevention,
treatment, and cure of HIV disease are under study. Yet, virus resistance remains the central vulnerability
of effective bnAb use. This application proposes to address the problem of bNAb escape by rationally selecting
combination bNAb therapy that limits virus escape. We propose to apply lessons from the successful
development of combination antiretrovial therapy (cART), whereby bidirectional phenotypic antagonism was
exploited. Our multidisciplinary team has secured plasma virus or virus sequences from recent or ongoing
prevention and treatment studies of VRC01-class CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-targeting monotherapy, as well as
combination therapy with V3 glycan-targeting (Table 1). We will leverage these unique samples to map the in
vivo escape pathways of virus replicating in the presence of sub-suppressive levels of these clinically relevant
bNAbs (Aim 1). Using the evolving escape variants, we will identify putative complementary bNAbs with
maintained or inverse antibody sensitivities from rationally designed panels of candidate bNAbs (Aim 1). We will
then characterize the autologous neutralizing antibody (anAb) response in the treatment cohorts, to determine
the capacity of anAbs to impede virus escape from administered bNAbs (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the most
promising complementary bNAbs to restrict virus escape in vivo in a validated barcoded TF SHIV/NHP model
(Aim 3). Our scientific premise is that in vivo mapping of virus escape from bNAbs, identification of
complementary bNAbs, defining the role of autologous antibodies, and rigorous in vivo testing in an authentic
NHP model will elucidate basic mechanisms of virus resistance to bNAbs and inform more effective use of bNAbs
across the HIV prevention, treatment and cure fields. If accomplished we will (i) have defined the sensitivities of
escaped viruses from clinical trials to alternate bNAbs, (ii) identified bNAbs that cannot mutually escape using
the same pathway, (iii) defined the role of anAbs in bnAb escape and (iv) tested the ability of complementary
bnAbs to improve therapy in an authentic NHP model."

10806148,"Abstract
Psychosis is a debilitating chronic illness associated with marked impairments of functional capacity in individuals
and a significant economic burden for society. Despite various treatment options to address the positive
symptoms of the illness, relatively few have been successfully developed to target cognitive symptoms that
account for significant deficits in social and occupational functioning. Recent work suggests that deficits in
bottom-up visual perceptual processes contribute to these more established cognitive impairments and their
associated functional decline. Furthermore, distortions in visual perception have a significant clinical impact,
particularly during early stages of the illness, despite being underappreciated in traditional clinical settings.
Unfortunately, our limited understanding of the relationship between perceptual and cognitive systems in
psychosis hinders our ability to isolate targets for therapeutic interventions. The proposed study will examine
disruptions in bottom-up perceptual responses emerging from local cortical processes in addition to their
modulation by coordinated activity across a distributed attentional network and ascertain the impact of each on
clinical outcomes in first-episode psychosis. Response amplification in visual contrast perception, a well-
documented disruption in chronic psychosis with implications for treatment of the disorder, remains understudied
at disease onset. Moreover, the top-down modulation of this fundamental perceptual mechanism remains
unexplored in psychotic illness despite significant literature detailing the facilitation of contrast perception via
attention in healthy populations. I hypothesize that this modulation, mediated by long-range cortical
communication across a distributed visual attention network, will exhibit marked disruption and be more closely
associated with cognitive and functional deficits in early psychosis compared to disruptions in local perceptual
responses. I will use simultaneously recorded M/EEG data to localize regions of visual cortex exhibiting altered
stimulus contrast processing. This approach will also be used to isolate sources of impaired connectivity across
regions of the dorsal attention network underlying the modulation of contrast perception by attention in healthy
adults. Finally, symptoms and functional impairments will be assessed using validated clinical instruments to
quantify the clinical impact of these visual processing deficits in first-episode patients. Identifying the various
levels of information processing at which dysfunctions arise in psychosis is key to elucidating the mechanisms
underlying its least well treated yet most devastating symptoms. Results from this study will inform interventional
approaches targeting specific disruptions in visual processing associated with negative clinical outcomes.
Examining disruptions at an early illness stage will help disambiguate the effects of primary disease processes
from confounds such as age and medication usage and inform longitudinal trajectories of these disease
impairments to identify vulnerable developmental timepoints and maximize the benefits of our interventions."

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising approach to treat major health problems, such as
depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. The last extensive MBSR systematic review was for trials (k=101
studies; N=
8,135 participants) available through 2015. It showed a moderate evidence level using the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, with a call for more and
higher quality randomized controlled trials. This literature has expanded with hundreds of clinical trials. It is
past time to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine how strong the evidence is. This will
inform whether and how MBSR should be included in health insurance coverage to reduce the global burden of
disease and to aid development of better MBSR-related treatments. To do so, scientists recommend integrated
knowledge translation (iKT), where researchers and knowledge users co-create knowledge. Although iKT has
been used in systematic reviews, it has not been used in a mindfulness systematic review. Primary aims are:
1. Perform stakeholder evaluations to identify: (a) Key questions they have to make decisions about if, how,
and when MBSR should be covered by health insurance; (b) what is the highest priority evidence they
need on MBSR’s effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; (c) barriers that are important to understand and
resolve in order for MBSR to be covered by health insurance.
2. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis, determine the impacts of MBSR on key health-related
 outcomes informed by the iKT strategy in Aim 1b, such as: (a) anxiety, (b) depression, (c) stress, (d)
 physical functioning, (e) quality of life, (f) pain with related opioid use, and (g) cost effectiveness.
3. Evaluate whether meta-analytic effects differ based on implementation-related factors informed by
stakeholders, such as length adherence (e.g., session length), program fidelity (e.g., teacher training, home
practice), delivery modality (in-person vs. online), setting and population (e.g., clinical vs. non-clinical,
specific genders and racial/ethnic groups), and effect sustainability (e.g., whether benefits last ≥1 year).
Aim 1 methods include stakeholder meetings to conduct formative evaluations involving qualitative interviews
and a modified Delphi approach. Methods for Aims 2 and 3 will be state-of-the-science systematic evidence
syntheses. These will utilize all major databases to identify MBSR trials that address the primary health
outcomes; examine the robustness of evidence across both randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled trials
(facilitated by a comprehensive behavior change technique taxonomy to characterize active content); and
analyze effect sizes following the best standards. Throughout the review process, we will engage stakeholders,
guided by the SPIRIT (Supporting Policy In health with Research: an Intervention Trial) Action Framework.
Overall, these evidence syntheses will provide evidence that may transform not only the science of MBSR and
related treatments but also increase health insurance coverage and access for millions of people."

The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily is the largest family of secreted proteins in mammals.
These dimeric ligands, which function in nearly every developmental, physiologic, and pathophysiologic
process, including infertility, signal through a heterodimeric complex of type 2 and type 1 serine-threonine
kinase receptors that phosphorylate downstream regulatory SMAD proteins and bind SMAD4 to regulate
transcription. With NICHD support that started with a physician scientists award (K11HD00960; 1991-93) and
this R01 grant (1994-present), we have been productive leaders in the identification and characterization of the
oocyte-secreted TGFβ family members, growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein
15 (BMP15), and granulosa cell-secreted activins and inhibins. We have published extensively in this field
including >30 papers in Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Medicine, PLoS Biology, PLoS Genetics, PNAS, and
Science. Whereas mammalian oocytes were initially hypothesized to be passengers rather than drivers in
ovarian folliculogenesis, we showed that GDF9 is essential for fertility, discovered the X-linked BMP15 gene,
and showed that GDF9:BMP heterodimers are the most active oocyte-secreted ligand in mice and women.
These insights have defined the oocyte-somatic cell dialogue in ovarian folliculogenesis. In parallel, we showed
that inhibin α-knockout mice are infertile, develop ovarian cancers and die due to an activin-induced cachexia
syndrome. BMPs, GDF9:BMP15, activins, and myostatin share common type 2 receptors [activin receptor type
2A (ACVR2A) or type 2B (ACVR2B) or BMPR2], type 1 receptors (ALK4 and ALK5), and receptor-regulated
SMADs (SMAD1,2,3,5). Using mouse genetics, we have shown that these proteins function in the pituitary,
ovaries, and uterus (e.g., granulosa-specific knockout of SMAD2 and SMAD3 leads to cumulus defects and
infertility due to defective GDF9:BMP15 signaling, whereas uterine-specific knockout of SMAD2 and SMAD3
leads to infertility secondary to endometrial hyperplasia). Although SMAD2 and SMAD3 play redundant roles in
GDF9:BMP15, activin, and TGFβ signaling, we know little about the transcriptional complexes or DNA
sequences that they bind. In addition, there are no small molecule inhibitors of ACVR2A/2B and BMPR2. Our
overall hypothesis is that oocyte GDF9:BMP15, granulosa cell activins, and uterine BMPs and TGFβs signal
through unique SMAD-mediated transcriptional complexes to regulate ovarian and uterine physiology in mice
and women. Our proposal will take advantage of state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 strategies to manipulate the
mouse genome and DNA-encoded chemical libraries to create novel inhibitors of ACVR2A/2B and BMPR2 and
perform follow-up genetic, proteomic, and biochemical approaches to reach our goals. At the end of 5 years,
we expect to have unlocked key molecular events that are orchestrated by TGFβ family ligands in the female
reproductive tract, thereby accelerating translational research to optimize assisted reproductive procedures for
women and to create the first ACVR2A/2B and BMPR2 specific small molecules to regulate female fertility."

The success of preventive and supportive approaches in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) depends on the
spontaneous recovery of β-cell function. A central component of β-cell function, glucose metabolism, is
impaired in T2D. Its causes, and how this impairment might lead to functional failure of β-cells, remain
unknown. Until delineated, targeting of the dysfunctional pathways and addressing the cause of the ab-
normality are unlikely and therapies remain supportive rather than disease-modifying. The overall objec-
tive is to identify components of human β-cell metabolism that are critical for insulin secretion in healthy
individuals and fail to support physiological secretion in T2D, and to identify components mediating β-cell
compensation. We have identified a novel intramitochondrial metabolic activation phenomenon as such a
component, and intend to determine its mechanism and role. The central hypothesis of the project is that
in T2D β-cells a metabolic rearrangement impairs the response of β-cells to glucose by limiting the acti-
vation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and triggers an upregulation of amplification pathways, alter-
ing the physiological dynamics of insulin secretion in T2D. Using human organ donor islets and micro-
scale bioenergetic and cell physiology assaying together with genetic (CRISPR) and pharmacological
modulation of metabolism, 1) The mechanism of bioenergetic activation of normal human β-cells during
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) will be identified. We hypothesize that the activation of SDH
is required for GSIS, and this is conveyed by metabolic coupling factor pathways through regulating ma-
trix oxaloacetate, malonate or the flux control by SDH. 2) The mechanism of T2D β-cell compensation
and its effects in the context of impaired bioenergetic activation will be determined. Here, our hypothesis
is that T2D β-cells compensate for the loss of bioenergetic control by upregulating amplification path-
ways, and this alters characteristics of secretion. 3) The beta-cell-specific gene expression pattern re-
quired for the bioenergetic activation and compensation will be determined. Our hypothesis is that the
mitochondrial activation mechanism is a network-level phenomenon, requiring a particular gene expres-
sion pattern. Harnessing cell-to-cell and individual-to-individual heterogeneity, mitochondrial function and
nuclear gene expression will be correlated on the single-cell level. The proposed research represents a
substantial departure from the status quo by recognizing a novel mitochondrial regulation mechanism as
the controlling entity of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. Furthermore, it departs from the tradi-
tional dichotomy of triggering and amplification pathways controlling GSIS by determining how these
pathways converge in bioenergetic regulation. This work will be significant because combining the identi-
fication of abnormalities in T2D β-cell energy metabolism with knowledge of related compensatory mech-
anisms, will allow targeting of these pathways to support β-cell function."

Early life exposure to air pollution (AP), which disproportionately affects underserved communities, is thought to
disrupt cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development. Human studies show that exposure during the
prenatal and early postnatal periods are associated with developmental delays, autism, more severe attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. Increasing evidence also suggests that exposure to AP is
associated with variation in the human gut microbiome, which other evidence suggests can alter brain physiology
and cognitive development. Despite these prior findings, no studies have considered the role of the gut
microbiome as a potential mediator of the effects of AP exposure on brain development and neurodevelopment
outcomes in early life. Further, human studies have focused on the associations of AP exposure with cognitive
outcomes at a single timepoint, and very few have examined AP-induced changes in brain structure and function.
Our overarching hypothesis is that AP exposure adversely impacts brain and neurodevelopmental outcomes,
and that these effects are partially explained by alterations in the gut microbiome. Our preliminary data show
that AP exposure is associated with a) poorer Bayley’s motor scores at 24-months, b) adverse gut bacterial and
fecal metabolic profiles at 6-months, and c) brain tissue microstructure and blood flow; and d) the newborn gut
microbiome is associated with brain measures. Our multidisciplinary team of investigators proposes to test our
hypothesis in a cohort of 200 Latino mother-infant pairs, with detailed assessments of maternal health and
nutrition, infant growth, and early feeding practices at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24-months of age. Child cognitive,
language, and motor capacities were previously assessed using Bayley Scales at 24 months. With separate NIH
funding, we are currently collecting follow-up measures at 6yr, including anthropometric measures, nutritional
information, and current and cumulative environmental exposures to ambient and near-roadway AP. We will use
archived (1, 6, 12, 18, 24-months) and newly collected stool samples (6yr) to examine gut bacterial species and
fecal metabolic pathways (SCFA, lipid, amino acid, bile acid) that can alter brain development. Our specific
aims are to determine the extent to which early life exposure to AP is associated with neurodevelopmental
outcomes and brain measures (Aim 1), and with the gut microbiome and fecal metabolome (Aim 2) in early- and
mid-childhood. We further aim to determine whether air pollution-associated gut microbial profiles and fecal
metabolic pathways mediate the associations of AP exposure with neurodevelopmental outcomes and brain
measures (Aim 3). This study offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the harmful effects of
early life exposure to AP. Results may also suggest interventions that could prevent or attenuate
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as limiting prenatal and early life AP exposure or other novel interventions
to promote or quell growth of specific gut bacteria."

The rising prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) among children is a public health concern. An
expanding landscape of genetic and environmental risk factors has been implicated in ASD’s development,
indicating complex, multifactorial origins in early life. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have
neurotoxic potential, but their role in ASD development needs clarification. EDCs are implicated in maternal
immune dysregulation and inflammation, a leading research hypothesis of ASD’s developmental origins. Gene-
environment investigations of EDCs, with focus on plausible biological mechanisms, could provide critical
insight into whether genetic subgroups of individuals may be more sensitive to environmental chemicals and
bring clarity to this inconsistent evidence between ASD and EDCs. The proposed research seeks to combine
polygenic and complex environmental mixtures approaches to address gaps in understanding of ASD’s
etiology. During the K99 phase of this award, I will pursue didactic and mentored training in autism
epidemiology, immunology, and methodologies of analyzing complex environmental mixtures, genome-wide
data, and gene-environment interplay. Under the mentorship of a strong multidisciplinary team with a history of
collaboration, I will apply this training to studies of the relationships between environmental, immunologic, and
genetic data from the Early Markers for Autism study (EMA; R01ES016669, PI: Croen), a population-based
case-control study (n=1005). In Aim 1, I will apply training in complex mixtures methods to examine the
pathway between joint exposure to multiple EDCs during gestation, biomarkers of maternal and neonatal
immune function, and child ASD. In Aim 2, I will apply training in genome-wide analysis to identify maternal and
fetal genetic variants associated with mixtures of EDCs in mid-pregnancy circulation. In the K00 phase (Aim 3),
I will harness these new analytical skills to conduct a GxE analysis of the association of EDCs and polygenic
risk on early life immune function and ASD development. I will conduct Aim 3 in EMA with replication in two
larger mother-child cohort studies. The long-term goal of this research is to identify modifiable risk factors and
key biological pathways in ASD which can inform not only interventions to lower neurotoxic exposures in
pregnant mothers and infants but also pharmacologic interventions targeting the immune and other physiologic
intermediates. These training and research activities will serve as the springboard for developing a competitive
R01 application and launching my independent career in autism epidemiology."

In epidemiologic studies, a strong association has been noted between cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins
and lower risk of death from prostate cancer. Animal studies suggest that cholesterol-lowering can decrease
the progression of prostate cancer. The biologic effects of lowering-cholesterol in prostate cancer patients are
not fully understood. It is very likely that lowering cholesterol can directly inhibit the growth of the tumor and its
potential to metastasize. However, our preliminary data suggest another important mechanism: cholesterol-
lowering enhances an antitumor immune response. In our animal models, cholesterol-lowering reduced
signaling through the mTOR pathway in immune cells. We show that this same signaling change is seen in
prostate cancer patients when their blood cholesterol is lowered. Our preliminary data also suggest that
cholesterol-lowering enhances immune memory cells that are critical for long-term cancer control. Our working
hypothesis is that lowering serum cholesterol (1) decreases TORC2 signaling in lymphocytes and enhances
formation of central memory CD8+ T cell, (2) can be optimized by controlling Tregs, and (3) directly increases
tumor immunogenicity. To test this hypothesis and to relate findings from our mouse models, we propose parallel
mouse and human clinical studies. Therefore, Aim 1 evaluates the effects of cholesterol-lowering on CD8+
memory cells as well as other critical components of the adaptive immune response, such as regulatory T cells.
Our preliminary data show that cholesterol-lowering makes the tumor more “visible” to the immune system by
increasing the expression of heat shock proteins. We evaluate the effects of cholesterol-lowering on the tumor
itself, which may then alter the immune response. We also assess the effects of tumor, exposed to cholesterol-
lowering, on dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Aim 2 evaluates cholesterol-lowering in a prospective
clinical trial in men with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer being managed with active surveillance. These
men are at high risk for cancer progression and needing radical surgery or radiation, which often leaves men
with permanent incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In the proposed trial, men with newly diagnosed prostate
cancer will undergo maximal cholesterol-lowering or standard management. The prostate biopsy tissue before
and after starting treatment will be compared to determine if cholesterol lowering increases CD8+ T cells in the
tumor, which are required for an antitumor immune response. We will also examine immune cells in the blood
to identify and enrich for patient subgroups most likely to respond. A positive study will provide a strong rationale
for a phase 3, multicenter clinical trial to determine if cholesterol-lowering can prevent the formation or
progression of prostate cancer. It will also provide an immune mechanism that can potentially improve outcomes
in other cancers beyond prostate cancer."

Maladaptive alcohol seeking, a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD), is thought to be driven not only by
increased function of neural circuitry that drives natural reward seeking, but also by loss of control of circuitry
that serves to suppress behaviors incompatible with safety and survival. The posterior paraventricular thalamus,
(pPVT), and its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), provide feedforward inhibition onto dopamine
receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which are largely responsible for promoting reward-
motivated behaviors. Stimuli and situations that naturally serve to limit maladaptive behaviors, such as behavioral
threats, have been shown to activate these pPVT®NAc projection neurons and suppress behavior through the
activation of downstream parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs). Our labs have shown that an acute
stressor (TMT predator odor), quinine-adulteration of alcohol and optogenetic activation of pPVT®NAc circuitry
reduces reward- and, of particular importance to this proposal, alcohol-seeking in non-dependent mice.
Furthermore, we show that the ability of this circuit to provoke behavioral inhibition is lost after the induction of
alcohol dependence. These behavioral adaptations parallel reduced synaptic efficacy at pPVT®NAc
glutamatergic synapses onto downstream PV-INs in alcohol-dependent mice. Our data therefore suggest, for
the first time, that pPVT®NAc projection neurons are responsible for the suppression of alcohol-seeking
behavior but are dysregulated by chronic alcohol exposure. We formally test independent components of this
hypothesis in three independent Aims. In Aim 1, using two-photon calcium imaging we will measure and
longitudinally track neuronal ensemble dynamics in both pPVT®NAc projections and NAc PV-INs during alcohol
self-administration, consumption, and tests of behavioral inhibition in non-dependent and dependent mice. Aim
2 will explore the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on intrinsic and synaptic adaptations in pPVT synaptic
inputs to both PV-INs and MSNs in the NAc using slice electrophysiology. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will determine
whether activation of pPVT®NAc inputs and/or activation of PV-INs in the NAc are sufficient to restore
feedforward inhibition and control alcohol-seeking in non-dependent vs. dependent mice. This project will identify
how activity in a principal – but understudied – reward circuit changes from the onset of alcohol use to
dependence and will further determine how this activity influences the expression and suppression of alcohol
seeking."

Dementia is a daunting public health crisis facing many industrialized nations. A key component of the global
action plan for dementia proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) involves early detection and the
development of novel therapeutics.1 There exist great racial and socioeconomic barriers to dementia care in the
United States. Many existing neuropsychological measures lack sensitivity to accurately screen for dementia in
under-represented minority populations. During the next project period, we will focus on early detection of
emerging semantic deficits in naturalistic language samples. Our focus is on changes in language cognition,
and physiology of the pupil response function among a cohort of older African American adults at elevated risk
for dementia. We will derive age-based norms for language content during narrative production and evoked
pupillary dynamics (e.g., speed of pupil dilation) during both the production and perception of language. Our
studies will elucidate the relationship between changes in executive functioning and semantic knowledge over
the span of five years in a radically underserved population."
10803578,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Targeting of oncogenic kinases with small molecule inhibitors is ow a well validated paradigm for treatment of
particular cancer types. Unfortunately, resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors typically develops due to the
selection for tumor cells that harbor new mutations that induce resistance to kinase inhibitors or due to activation
of by-pass signaling pathways. In addition, many tumors depend on the scaffolding function of a kinase and not
on enzymatic kinase activity, thereby rendering inhibitors ineffective. For example, the pseudokinase HER3 is
an obligate heterodimerization partner with EGFR and HER2 but its kinase activity is not required. In the first
funding cycle, we successfully explored a fundamentally different approach to abrogate kinase signaling by
developing novel small molecules that induce kinase degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and
systematically explored the degradable kinome. Here we propose to expand on this extensive fundamental
work to increase coverage of the degradable kinome, further investigate the mechanism of small
molecule-mediated protein degradation and expand probe development to non-degrading molecular
glues. In particular, we will increase the chemical space of potential degraders to not-yet explored kinase ligand
scaffolds as well as recently reported E3 ligase ligands including ligands for ligases such as IAP, MDM2, KEAP1,
DCAF11, DCAF15, DCAF16, AHR, FEM1B, RNF4 and RNF114 and novel ligase attachment geometries for our
previously characterized E3 ligases CRBN and VHL, and will also include the development of trivalent degrader
molecules as a novel compound design approach. We have also developed new and improved global proteomics
workflows to enable increased proteomic profiling of degraders in a panel of up to five different cell lineages,
which will increase identified kinases from ~400 to almost 600 per compound treatment. In addition, we have
developed new chemoproteomics workflows to determine ternary complex formation of glue molecules and are
able to determine ubiquitination sites and profiles of degrader molecules. This extended degrader
characterization data will enable us to further expand our open-source accessible degradable kinome database
and will deepen our understanding of E3 ligase-dependent degradation mechanisms. We will further broaden
our probe development efforts to HER3-targeting non-degrading glue molecules to investigate alternative modes
of action for development of novel therapeutics. The goal of this grant application is to expand the
degradable kinome database by covering an extended chemical space and expanding cellular treatment
conditions, interrogate structural mechanisms of targeted protein degradation and non-degrading
complexes, and assemble a HER3-targeted compound library for the development of non-degrading glue
molecules as a novel therapeutic strategy to modulate HER3 activity in cancer models."

The emergence of eukaryotes from an exclusively prokaryotic biosphere, a momentous event that charted a
divergent course for life on Earth, coincided with symbiotic adoption of mitochondria. The complexity of
eukaryotes could not have existed and evolved but for the energy economy supported by mitochondrial
physiology. Given the strong evidence for the monophyletic origin of mitochondria, it is probable that all extant
mitochondria can trace their origin to that singular primordial event at the dawn of eukaryotes. Yet, the evolution
has led to tremendous variety of mitochondria, their genomes, their regulation, and their functions, which are as
diverse as the organisms they reside in We are interested in understanding mitochondrial functions in malaria
parasites, pathogens that extract a tremendous toll from the health and wellbeing of vast multitudes. Over 30
years ago, our group discovered the unusual mtDNA in Plasmodium that encoded just 3 mitochondrial electron
transport chain (mtETC) subunits and ribosomal RNA in fragmented and scrambled pieces. With the long-term
support of this grant award, we have elucidated many aspects of mitochondrial functions in malaria parasites,
showing the organelle to be the target for antimalarial drugs currently in use as well as those in development.
We have shown which of the canonical mitochondrial functions are critical in blood stages and which are
essential only for the insect stages of the parasite. We have also identified unique and essential features of
Plasmodium mitochondrion using genetic and proteomic investigations. In recent years, our efforts have been
joined by other investigators working to understand the mitochondrion in apicomplexan parasites. Together, we
are at a stage when many of the mysteries surrounding this organelle in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma are being
addressed with the application of powerful new approaches. For the next funding period, we are proposing to
conduct studies that would bring us closer to answering some of the most critical questions remaining about
mitochondrial functions in malaria parasites. These include potential dual function of Complex III, understanding
the nature of mitochondrial complexes, and the unusual structural features of mitochondria in asexual and sexual
stages of the parasite. As before, the work we are proposing will be carried out by an outstanding collaborative
team including a consortium arrangement. Specifically, we will investigate an essential mitochondrial protein an
human orthologue of which has been shown to have multiple functions in mitochondrial biogenesis and
metabolism. These studies will use biochemical and metabolomic approaches in addition to genetic
manipulations. In a consortium arrangement, we will use cryo-electron tomography to study in situ unusual
features of mitochondrial structures in asexual and sexual stages of P. falciparum as well as consequences of
genetic disruptions of a select number of mitochondrial functions. We will also explore a potential secondary
function of the mtETC Complex III as a reason to maintain mtDNA even in mtETC independent parasites."

Early, high-risk drinking and drug use during adolescence conveys risk of both acute harms and long-term
consequences. NIDA has invested considerable resources in targeted prevention programs to reduce, delay, or
mitigate these outcomes. The public health impact of these programs is limited by the current lack of a method
to accurately and reliably identify which youth would benefit from these programs before they initiate substance
involvement. Existing screening instruments to quantify risk among substance-naïve youth were developed in
small, non-representative samples and have not yielded accurate and reliable predictions in new data.
Responding to RFA-DA-24-037, Accelerating the Pace of Drug Abuse Research Using Existing Data, we
propose to leverage the unprecedented Adolescent Brain and Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study to
develop and conduct a preliminary validation of practical, accurate, and equitable screening tools for use in real-
world prevention settings. The ABCD Study® is large (N=11,880), sociodemographically diverse, spans 21 cities
across the U.S., measured every well-established risk/resilience factors for adolescent substance use, and will
be followed prospectively for 10 years, enabling us to distinguish adolescents with early, high-risk drinking/drug
use patterns from peers exhibiting developmentally normative, infrequent, and transient experimentation with
substances. Thus, no prior study has offered a better opportunity for developing accurate and generalizable
screening measures to quantify risk among substance-naïve youth. Aim 1: Develop a portfolio of brief, accurate,
equitable, and generalizable screening measures. Following a systematic algorithm designed to maximize
accuracy and eliminate inequities, we will construct and refine brief, survey-based measures quantifying risk for
early, high-risk drinking and drug use. Aim 2: Conduct a preliminary validation of the developed screening
measures in holdout data (n=5,000) weighted to be sociodemographically representative of all children in the
U.S Census. To anticipate the tools’ likely performance in real-world settings, we will obtain unbiased estimates
of screener performance in holdout data, then conduct sensitivity analyses probing potential limits on
generalizability. Together, these aims have potential to deliver screening tools that can unlock the public health
potential of existing targeted preventive interventions to reduce early, high-risk drinking/drug use, enabling wider
implementation at cost-effective scale. This developmental/exploratory research (R21) leverages existing data
to develop novel measures and conduct a preliminary validation. If we are successful at producing measures
that yield accurate and equitable screening decisions in holdout data, we will further refine and externally validate
the measure in a subsequent R01-scope project."

Currently, in the United States, there are 5.8 million older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Twenty-one percent of older adults with AD/ADRD have unplanned,
and often preventable, hospital readmissions within 30-days, which are estimated to cost over $5.4 billion per
year. The development of clinical data research networks (CDRN) and their large complex datasets including
patient and clinical level data have led to the development of various models to predict readmissions. However,
the existing models have not demonstrated adequate predictive capability. The opportunity to integrate nursing
care plan (i.e., patient problems, goals, and interventions) to these large datasets can fill gaps and improve the
accuracy of prediction models. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the integration
of nursing care plan data to CDRN datasets is therefore critical for understanding and improving
interdisciplinary care aimed at reducing readmissions of older adults with AD/ADRD. In this project, we
propose to expand the research infrastructure of the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium and Data Trust
through the creation, for the first time, of a reusable and feasible data pipeline that will ultimately integrate key
care plan data elements documented by nurses into the OneFlorida Data Trust. The long-term goal of our
research program is to gain a deeper understanding of readmissions for the aging population with AD/ADRD
through the availability of an expanded dataset with interdisciplinary data. We plan to carry out the following
aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Develop and test a prototype pipeline for extracting, translating, and
integrating problems and goals in nursing care plan data from the University of Florida (UF Health) into the
statewide OneFlorida Data Trust. We will map the local vocabulary used to represent the two nursing data
elements to nationally recognized terminology sets using natural language processing and have registered
nurses validate the mapping results. We will then use automated scripts to replace the local vocabulary with
the standardized terms and integrate the data into the Trust. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Convert and
integrate into the Trust nursing interventions from UF Health. Specific Aim 3 (R33 Phase): Extract, convert,
and integrate to the Trust nursing data from a second organization, using the pipeline from the R21 phase.
Specific Aim 4 (R33 Phase): Construct and test readmissions prediction models for older adults (aged 65 and
above) with AD/ADRD using pertinent variables from the Trust and environmental dataset linked to it. We will
develop machine-learning models for predicting readmissions from the nursing care elements, other patient-
level data in the Trust, and important environmental variables that influence post-discharge follow-up care. Our
team will be among the first to develop sustainable data pipelines for transforming local nursing care plan data
into standardized data for integration into a large dataset. Through this study, we will learn the improvements
nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions."

Bordetella pertussis (PT) is the causative agent of whooping cough. Highly effective vaccines to protect from
PT infection have been in use since the early 1940s. However, the last fifteen years have witnessed a consistent
increase in the number of whooping cough cases, and the reasons for this are not completely understood. This
highlights the need to better understand how immune responses against PT vary between individuals, which we
can determine by measuring immune responses to PT booster vaccination as a proxy for immune responses to
infectious challenge.
We will use these data to develop computational models that will help establish a quantitative and predictive
understanding of the factors that impact immune responses resulting from PT booster vaccination. Specifically,
we will examine the impact of demographic variables such as age and sex, the type of vaccine received in
infancy, and the immune state prior to vaccination. Understanding how these variables can impact vaccine
responses is of importance not only for PT, but for vaccine research in general.
To achieve this, we are proposing an iterative process of model building, model evaluation, experimental data
generation, and model refinement. We will engage the wider scientific community in this process by hosting an
annual prediction contest. We have placed particular emphasis on making this process transparent and open, to
ensure that the value of the models and the results from the evaluation are accepted by the community at large.
Specifically, we will:
1) Establish and seed an open platform to build and evaluate computational models of PT booster vaccination.
2) Generate new experimental data with staggered release dates to test and iteratively improve computational
models.
3) Engage the broader scientific community in this modeling effort."

The Center for Pediatric Brain Health will be a NIGMS-supported COBRE at the Boys Town National Research
Hospital (BTNRH) in Omaha, NE. The Center will focus on developmental neuroscience, neuroimaging, and
brain health. The Administrative Core will manage and continuously evaluate the Center’s major programs and
provide oversight of the fiscal and scientific components of the Center. The Core will be directed by Dr. Tony
Wilson of BTNRH with the assistance of a Master’s-level scientific administrator. Upon launching the Center for
Pediatric Brain Health, the Administrative Core will initiate a series of integrated programs to support the
research project leaders (RPLs) and the local pediatric neuroscience community and to help build a sense of
thematic cohesiveness across the BTNRH campus. Specifically, the Administrative Core will initiate mentoring
and career development programs, a pilot projects program, multifaceted training initiatives, two distinct seminar
series, community outreach, and research support and development initiatives. The mentoring and career
development approach will include the formation of a Supervisory & Mentoring Committee comprised of 10
highly-experienced mentors, with each RPL being directly advised by two co-mentors from this committee. To
help ensure the RPLs reach critical milestones, the Center will provide extensive resources and develop an
evaluation system comprised of project forums and mini progress reports, which will be presented regularly to
the Supervisory & Mentoring Committee to provide an ongoing assessment of each RPL’s progress. The Core
will also implement a pilot projects program that will award $100,000 per year to support new projects related
to pediatric brain health, with 50% of these funds being contributed by BTNRH. The Center’s training programs
will include two annual neuroimaging workshops aimed at the approaches most commonly used by pediatric
neuroscientists, as well as a postdoctoral neuroimaging training program and an extensive internship program
for post-baccalaureate and undergraduate students, with the latter also receiving substantial financial support
from BTNRH. The Administrative Core will also initiate a monthly seminar series focused on pediatric brain
health, which will bring internationally-known developmental neuroscientists to BTNRH to present their findings
and network with local scientists, and a bimonthly career development seminar series aimed at advancing the
junior scientists associated with the Center. Additionally, the Core will support a community outreach program
aimed at getting youth interested in science, with an emphasis on the brain. Finally, the Administrative Core
will provide extensive research support to Center investigators, including a participant registry to enhance study
recruitment, shared research infrastructure dedicated to study coordination and participant testing, and access
to the Neural Quantification & Imaging Core. Through these thematic programs and a network of established
mentors and scientists, the Administrative Core will instill a strong sense of cohesion among investigative teams
and ensure the proposed COBRE has a major, long-term impact on pediatric brain health across the nation."
10793547,"Abstract/Summary: Neural Quantification & Imaging Core
The Neural Quantification & Imaging Core will manage, support, and provide access to the major equipment
and resources of the Center for Pediatric Brain Health. It will be the only research core of the Center and will
be housed in the new 15,000+ square feet Institute for Human Neuroscience at Boys Town National Research
Hospital (BTNRH). The Core will provide critical support and infrastructure to all four of the COBRE research
project leaders (RPLs), as well as a collection of established research programs associated with the Institute
and across BTNRH more broadly. The key equipment and resources of the Core will include two state-of-the-
art Triux Neo magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems for recording and imaging neural oscillations, a 3-Tesla
Siemens Prisma MRI scanner equipped with high-performance gradients and a 64-channel head coil for high-

children and other participants prepare for the claustrophobic and loud MRI environment. In addition, the Core
will operationalize a brain stimulation suite, extensive computing and data processing resources, comprehensive
analytical support, and in the near future, an ultra-modern optically-pumped magnetometry (OPM) system for
advanced neurophysiological measurements. The Neural Quantification & Imaging Core will also host at least
two neuroimaging workshops per year, support targeted equipment usage through the Center’s pilot projects
program, and serve as the home base for fellows supported through the Center’s postdoctoral neuroimaging
training program. The Core will be directed by Dr. Tony Wilson, who is an expert in multimodal neuroimaging
with over 20 years of experience with MEG imaging, structural and functional MRI, brain stimulation, and other
tools and analytical approaches for advanced human neuroscience research. The Core’s staff will also include a
dedicated site engineer/physicist and technicians for the MEG and MRI systems. Financially, the Core will be
supported by instrument use fees, BTNRH, and the COBRE, with BTNRH covering any year-to-year deficits

Cognitive, Immunological, and Neurophysiological Consequences of
 Home Radon Exposure in Children and Adolescents
The public at large has grown keenly aware of the effects of environmental pollutants and toxins on the
developing body. From lead and pesticides to cigarette smoke and industrial air pollution, studies consistently
show that environmental toxins have substantial, lasting impacts on the development of youth, including chronic
deficits in cognitive and brain development. These consequences can have reverberating impacts on academic
achievement and mental health. That said, one surprisingly common, but rarely studied environmental toxin is
radon. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that accumulates in homes and poses significant health
risks, including increased risk of developing certain cancers, and damage to developmentally sensitive tissues
and organs (e.g., the brain) through accentuated inflammatory processes. The United States (US) Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) set the action limit for home radon concentrations at 4 pCi/L, which is the carcinogenic
equivalent of smoking 10 cigarettes per day. An astonishing 1 in 15 homes across the US is expected to have
radon concentrations at or above the EPA action limit, leaving a large number of youth across the country
chronically exposed to high concentrations of radon. However, studies linking radon toxicity to altered neural and
cognitive development are extremely sparse. The current proposal aims to address this critical gap in knowledge
by examining the impact of toxic levels of radon exposure on brain and cognitive function in typically-developing
youth. Our groundbreaking preliminary work is the first to show that attention (i.e., the ability to direct and maintain
focus on specific stimuli and tasks) is uniquely impacted by radon exposure. Specifically, we have found that
youth who are chronically-exposed to higher home radon levels had markedly worse performance on behavioral
measures of attention, and exhibited altered neural dynamics within the critical brain networks serving attention
and higher-order cognition. In the current multimodal neuroimaging study, we will quantify the impact of home
radon exposure on multiple distinct attentional systems during child and adolescent development. To this end,
we will enroll a large sample of typically-developing youth who will undergo magnetoencephalography (MEG)
during a battery of tasks designed to assess multiple unique neural systems serving attentional processing.
Youth will also complete structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), complete a battery of neuropsychological
assessments targeting attentional abilities, and provide saliva samples to capture measures of inflammation that
are known to be elevated in the context of radon exposure. Our specific aims are to 1) identify specific attentional
domains and neural substrates that are affected by radon exposure, and 2) quantify the mechanistic role of
inflammatory processes through which radon alters attentional development in youth. The outcomes of this study
have the potential to shape the future of public health policy surrounding radon awareness and mitigation efforts,
and this is especially true in the surrounding region where home radon levels are some of the highest in the nation."

Developmental changes in the reconfiguration of brain networks and
 their association with psychiatric traits during adolescence
Adolescence is typically defined as the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is a critical period for neural
changes, including maturation of the brain’s major cognitive networks, but also a period of increased vulnerability
to psychopathology. The incidence of psychiatric disorders increases exponentially from adolescence to
adulthood, with 75% of cases being first diagnosed before the age of 24 years. It is therefore critical to understand
the impact of adolescent development on brain network architecture and the alterations that may lead to the
onset of mental illness. It is well accepted that the brain is functionally organized into multiple interacting
networks. Extensive literature has also demonstrated that the brain connectome shows age-related alterations,
with the largest changes happening during adolescence. While these findings have significantly advanced the
field, the vast majority of the underlying studies have focused on a single cognitive state such as a specific
cognitive task or a resting-state, with the assumption that the brain network definition remain unchanged across
cognitive states. However, it is now clear that it is not the case, and that this dynamic brain reconfiguration plays
a major role in both cognition and psychopathology. Thus, our currently incomplete view may limit our overall
capacity to identify the impact of adolescent brain development on such dynamic network reconfiguration, as
well as its association with cognitive ability and risk for developing mental disorders. Based on our prior studies
and pilot analyses, we show that collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from both resting-
state and several cognitive tasks will improve the characterization of the brain functional connectome and its
links to psychopathology in adolescence. In this context, the aim of this application is to combine these imaging
data with cognitive and behavioral information to provide an integrative framework that quantifies the dynamic
reconfiguration of the brain connectome across cognitive states from adolescence to adulthood. To achieve this,
we will use both resting-state and task-based fMRI from 160 typically-developing participants aged 12 to 25
years. We will identify developmental changes in both the spatial (Aim 1) and functional (Aim 2) reconfigurations
of the major brain networks by cognitive states. Our third aim (Aim 3) will provide an integrative view of
developmental changes in the brain’s dynamic networks and behavior by conducting robust multivariate
analyses, which will test the degree to which brain network organization measures are associated with
psychiatric traits during adolescence. We aim to demonstrate a progressive increase in network reconfiguration
across states as a function of age and propose that such changes reflect better functioning and lower-risk for
psychopathology. By mapping the brain connectome in this critical age window, this work has the potential to
elucidate how developmental brain network alterations contribute to psychiatric traits and ultimately the risk of
developing mental illness during the transition to adulthood."

 Characterizing the Impact of Auditory Experience
on Language, Cognitive, and Neural Development in Children
It is well-established that children with hearing loss are at risk for language and academic deficits. Hearing loss
is also known to impact cognitive measures such as working memory, and language ability positively correlates
with these higher-order cognitive skills. However, delays in children with hearing loss are not universal; some
fall significantly behind children with normal hearing (CNH), while others perform similarly to CNH. Recent work
in children with mild-to-severe hearing loss (i.e., children who are hard-of-hearing (CHH)) who wear hearing aids
(HAs) suggests that the severity of language delays correlates with auditory dosage, an index of auditory
experience defined by HA audibility, or the degree to which a HA improves access to speech, and the amount
of HA use. Taken together, language, cognitive function, and auditory experience appear to be tightly linked, and
a combination of these factors likely explains much of the variability in outcomes in CHH. However, there is
currently no overall framework that captures these relationships. It is difficult to probe the interactions between
language and cognition using behavioral tests, as they rely on end-point metrics and cannot evaluate cognitive
processing in real-time; thus, an investigation of the central neural mechanisms is crucial. The proposed project
will provide pivotal new data on the impact of auditory experience on cognitive, language, and neural function in
children. Our groundbreaking preliminary work has shown altered neural dynamics during higher-order cognitive
processing in CHH relative to CNH, and that these neural aberrations are significantly linked with the amount of
HA use and language ability. In the current study, we will probe the interactions between auditory experience,
language, and cognition using an innovative multimodal approach. Specifically, we will enroll a large cohort of
CHH and demographically matched CNH and all will undergo magnetoencephalographic imaging during verbal
and nonverbal cognitive tasks, structural MRI, and a battery of neuropsychological and audiometric tests. In Aim
1, we will identify differences in behavior and neurophysiology during verbal and nonverbal cognition in CHH and
CNH. We posit that CHH will exhibit altered neural activity in fronto-parietal language regions during verbal
cognitive tasks, while executive function and memory networks will be atypical during nonverbal cognitive tasks.
In Aim 2, we will determine which neural markers of higher-order cognitive processing predict language ability,
and how the relationships between language and neural function are altered in CHH. We hypothesize that neural
activity during nonverbal cognition will predict language function above and beyond neural markers of verbal
cognitive processing. In Aim 3, we will clarify the impact of auditory dosage on language, cognitive, and neural
function in CHH. We posit that auditory dosage will mediate the relationships between behavioral outcomes and
neural dynamics in CHH. This study will provide direct physiological evidence linking language development and
higher-order cognition in the context of hearing loss, which will lead to better-informed, individualized therapeutic
approaches for CHH."
10786648,"ABSTRACT
A large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the brain’s default-
mode network (DMN)—a set of brain regions that are highly active at rest—exhibits a “de-activation”, i.e.,
reduced activity, when the subjects perform attention-demanding cognitive tasks. While disrupted DMN de-
activations have been associated with a broad range of psychiatric and neurological conditions, mechanisms
underlying such reduced fMRI signals remain elusive, hindering their potential use as an imaging marker for
disease diagnosis and treatment.
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying stimulus-driven
fMRI de-activations in DMN. To achieve this goal, we will integrate fMRI with a novel functional PET framework
and cutting-edge 3D functional MR spectroscopy imaging to enable concurrent measures of fMRI signals, blood
flow, glucose and oxygen metabolism, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate levels within a single
imaging session. These multi-faceted measures will be jointly analyzed to test a specific hypothesis on task-
negative fMRI signals in DMN. We will further leverage the sufficient spatial coverage and high sensitivity of our
multi-modal framework to assess how the characterized fMRI de-activation model varies in space and across
subjects.
Outcomes of this study will illuminate the metabolic and neurotransmitter processes contributing to task-evoked
DMN de-activations, providing testable hypotheses on their disruptions in various mental illnesses. If successful,
the proposed imaging and analytical framework will also enable a new line of inquiries to decipher the biophysical
basis of fMRI (de-)activations in broad cognitive and clinical settings."

Intratumor genetic heterogeneity is present in a vast majority of solid cancers and correlates with tumor
aggressiveness and poor therapeutic response. Whether tumor heterogeneity promotes tumor growth and
survival, and the potential mechanisms driving these phenotypic changes, are open areas of investigation. To
explore this fundamental gap in knowledge, I generated a model for studying subclonal cooperation and tumor
heterogeneity in vitro and in vivo, respectively, using isogenic MCF10A cell lines that either overexpress MYC
(MYC) or oncogenic HRASG12V (HRAS). MYC and oncogenic RAS are two canonical oncogenes that are known
to signal in distinct pathways, though studies focused on MYC and HRAS interactions have primarily explored
cell intrinsic mechanisms of cooperation. Therefore, I will use MYC and HRAS as an exemplar for subclonal
cooperation to study their cooperativity in distinct cell populations. In preliminary studies using the MYC and
HRAS model, I made the exciting observation that individual subclones expressing MYC or HRAS cooperate
non-cell autonomously: cell proliferation increases when subclones are grown together in vitro and tumor growth
is more rapid when subclones are co-injected into mice. Importantly, these data suggest targeting clonal
interdependence may be necessary to improve therapeutic strategies. We hypothesize tumor subclones
cooperate to elicit emergent tumor properties promoting tumor growth, and, potentially, tumor metastasis and
drug resistance.
The three Experimental Aims of this proposed research will rigorously test my hypothesis, studying the
phenomenon of subclonal cooperation in cell culture and in orthotopic and patient derived xenograft (PDX)
models. Experimental Aim 1 will test if subclonal cooperation is necessary for more rapid tumor initiation and
proliferation, by deconstructing heterogenous tumors at distinct timepoints during tumor progression.
Experimental Aim 2 will explore how tumor heterogeneity is functional by defining how exosome mediated protein
transfer contributes to subclonal cooperation. Finally, in Experimental Aim 3, I will test whether subclonal
interactions promote therapeutic resistance in orthotopic mouse mammary tumors generated using human-
derived cell lines. Additionally, I will validate our findings of subclonal heterogeneity by characterizing the
subclonal expression of specific oncogenes present in in a library of readily available PDX models. Together,
these data will improve our understanding of subclonal cooperation in tumor progression, providing key insights
for future work aimed at efficiently deconstructing and treating complex, heterogenous tumors."

Life and Death in the Nursery will analyze the emergence of a new subspecialty – neonatology – and the
medical technologies employed by neonatologists. The development of new sophisticated machinery
meant that clinicians were now able to keep infants alive who in earlier years would have died. In the
1960s, hospitals around the country established NICUs. Clinicians and parents approached this highly
technological world with worries over the health and lives of severely ill newborns and negotiated
significant medical ethics questions about life, death, and quality of life. They debated these questions
within the emerging bioethics’ movement and in a larger social and cultural context in which attitudes
about reproduction, disability, quality of life, and death and dying shaped their respective understanding
about the ethics surrounding life and death. I will investigate how health care providers and parents
experienced the NICU, how it shaped their identity, and what impact their personal position and
understanding of neonatology had on their clinical experiences. The book will focus on the impact that
changes in medical technologies, reproductive politics, our understanding of disabilities, and attitudes
about race had on clinical care and the ways these changes shaped medicine in the NICU. This analysis
not only sheds light on the history of neonatology itself, but also points to ongoing dilemmas in
medicine: decisions about the continuation/ discontinuation of therapies at the edges of life and death,
as well as the pervasive existence of health inequities. Clinical issues inside the NICU are embedded in a
larger context of women’s reproductive health care. Much happens to women, their pregnancies, and
fetuses before infants enter the NICU and these events determine the problems with which infants
present. How women become pregnant, what kinds of screening and prenatal care they receive, their
access to abortion care, and how they give birth has changed significantly over the course of the last six
decades, leading to concomitant shifts in the demographic characteristics and clinical problems of NICU
patients. Taking the NICU as a focal point, my study addresses larger questions about life, death, and
quality of life that continue to be of importance in clinical care – in the NICU and beyond: How do
therapies, treatments, and procedures in one medical specialty shape the clinical problems in another?
How should clinicians balance rapid technological and therapeutic innovation with the development of
standards of care? In an area of rapid innovation, where therapies quickly move from experimental to
innovative, routine, and outdated, how do researchers adhere to treatment protocols and informed
consent? And how do patients and family members understand and participate in clinical decision
making in a specialty where so much seems at stake and hopes are so high?"
10910198,"Project Summary: The BSL3 suites in the Rocky Mountain Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RMRBL) at
Colorado State University (CSU) have been operational and at capacity since being commissioned. These
facilities support research in response to new threats from established pathogens, such as Mycobacterium
spp. (tuberculosis, leprosy, and emerging diseases caused by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria) and high
consequence, select agent pathogens, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine
Encephalitis, Francisella tularensis, and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The RMRBL BSL3 is required to pivot and
rapidly respond to new, emerging pathogens with pandemic potential. The RMRBL has been exemplary,
researching new threats such as MERS-CoV, MPox, and SARS-CoV-2. The RMRBL BSL3 thus represents the
backbone of research capabilities in infectious disease at CSU. CSU, in turn has supported the facility for the
past 15 years. CSU’s support includes much of the day-to-day operating costs of the RMRBL BSL3 facilities;
remaining costs are covered by assessing user fees to CSU researchers based on square footage and entries.
Expenses beyond day-to-day operational costs, including non-annual facilities repairs and replacement
upgrades require additional advocating and are addressed when eminently needed. This disrupts crucial
operations. Work within the BSL3 comes with a sacrifice to personal comfort due to the requirements for
biosafety and biosecurity, along with the inherent risk of work on high consequence pathogens. Maintaining
safe, operational and appropriate scientific instruments is challenged as servicing these instruments is difficult
and frequently results in the need to replace equipment. The consequence of the cost, work environment,
deprecating equipment and operational disruptions is our inability to maintain a trained workforce and
sufficiently technically equipped BSL3 ‘warm ready’ space. In response to this challenge, we propose our Core
1 – Facility Management, Maintenance & Operations. This core is strategically designed to resolve many of the
RMRBL BSL3 challenges through three functional aims; Aim 1 - Management, will improve upon the current
structure for communication across research and support teams; Aim 2 – Maintenance, will maintain the
RMRBL BSL3 facilities functionality through proactive preventative maintenance, reducing unplanned
disruptions; and finally, Aim 3 – Operations, will institute dedicated operational and animal husbandry support
and improve IT-communications within the RMRBL BSL3/ABSL3. Our comprehensive approach to improving
the management, maintenance, and operations of the RMRBL BSL3 will result in an improved RMRBL BSL3
system that exemplifies communication and collaboration across our diverse leadership and research teams in
a biosafe and bio-secure compliant environment. As a result, the penultimate goal of this core - to perpetuate
warm ready RMRBL BSL3 facilities; compliant with the dynamic requirements for biosafety and biosecurity,
appropriately resourced, and responsive to our national and state RBL mission – will be achieved."

This project aims to develop a microscopic nuclear imaging instrument that can provide the 3D distribution of
clinical radiotracers within a thick, living multi-cellular organism. The proposed instrument will improve our
understanding of how clinical radiotracers are distributed at a cellular level and thereby help us to better interpret
clinical nuclear imaging. It will also allow us to test and select new radiopharmaceuticals using patient-derived
organoids for safe and effective therapy.
Microautoradiography (MAR) is the current gold-standard method for microscopic nuclear imaging. However, it
can provide a high resolution only for thin (~ 5 µm) sliced specimens using low-energy radionuclides; the
resolution is only moderate with the high-energy radionuclides used for clinical imaging, even for a thin sliced
specimen, let alone single intact cells or cell spheroids. The resolution of MAR and other existing methods rapidly
decreases with the sample thickness, because the positrons obliquely incident onto the scintillator spread more
widely as the distance between the source and the scintillator increases. The scattering of positrons in the
sample, which increases with the sample thickness, will further blur the image.
We will develop a new instrument that can address these challenges by using radioluminescence microscopy
(RLM) as a base platform. RLM is a state-of-the-art technique recording the scintillation tracks of individual
positrons. The enabling idea is to record the 3D orientations of scintillation tracks at the crystal surface and trace
them backward to the source (i.e., the radionuclide that emitted the positron) in the sample volume. To record
the 3D orientations of scintillation tracks, which decay within tens of microseconds, we will use snapshot
projection optical tomography (SPOT). SPOT was previously demonstrated with fluorescent or absorbing
specimens, which is extended here to record the 3D orientations of scintillation tracks, for the first time to our
knowledge. For a thin specimen, we can trace back the scintillation tracks using filtered backprojection. For a
thick specimen, we will investigate statistical reconstruction, which can handle the scattering of positrons in the
sample and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem.
Using radiolabeled beads, [18F]FDG-filled microdroplets, and biological specimens incubated with [18F]FDG, we
will demonstrate the feasibility of 3D microscopic nuclear imaging of a thick, living multi-cellular organism using
the same radiotracers as used in clinical imaging and therapy. In particular, we aim to demonstrate subcellular
resolution (< 1 µm) for confluent living cells and cellular resolution (10–20 µm) for thick cell spheroids."

Nearly 1 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are performed each year in the US. Approximately
70% of these cases are considered complex and require the treatment of calcified lesions, tortuous vessels, and
multi-vessel disease, often with total or sub-totally occluded lesions. Many operators avoid these more complex
cases due to the lack of guide catheter support required to effectively deliver coronary stents and other
interventional devices. To overcome this limitation, guide extension catheters (GEC) have been developed to
help deliver stents in these challenging anatomies. However, GECs are utilized in only 18% of all coronary
interventions, mostly as a bailout option, because of their inability to access more distal tortuous lesions in 28%
of cases which prevents stent delivery. Blunt ended tubular GECs also have serious safety issues with coronary
artery dissection and/or plaque or thrombus embolization. Such limited utilization demonstrates that a significant
volume of patients are not treated effectively. Hence, CrossLiner Inc. has developed a novel multi-functional
GEC that combines the requirement for deeper catheter intubation with a microcatheter leading tip, and pre-
dilatation balloon on the leading element, to allow safe crossing of severe lesions in tortuous coronary vessels,
with balloon pre-dilatation, followed by crossing the lesion with the guide extension and then seamless stent
delivery. The combination of a GEC with a seamless transition to a microcatheter-balloon provides the capability
for easier and safer stent delivery, which can be unsheathed at the lesion as opposed to being delivered from a
poorly supported proximal location. This approach enabled by the CrossLiner GEC will substantially improve PCI
in patients with complex lesions while reducing risks, procedural duration, radiation/contrast exposure, stent
dislodgement, coronary dissection and perforation that occur with current GECs. Data from Phase II bench
verification studies demonstrates safety and performance against ISO standards while conforming to design
specifications. Formative usability evaluation supports the ease of use and safety, as validated on bench and in
vivo which demonstrated a 100% technical success rate, 40% reduction in time to treat, 43% reduction in
radiation dose, and 2-3x increase in coronary intubation depth compared to current market leading GECs. These
results, value proposition and likely market adoption were corroborated by interviews with 67 interventional
cardiologists where over 70% expected improved clinical outcomes and 94% indicated they would use the
CrossLiner GEC, rather than a conventional GEC. The company is now ready for final verification and process
validation in conjunction with regulatory submission and clearance. Successful execution of these Phase IIB
studies will position the CrossLiner GEC system for full commercialization of a highly innovative approach to
improve the treatment for complex PCI patients."

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a growing public health concern in the US, with an increasing number of cases
of Human Papillomavirus associated Oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+ OPC). Locoregional therapy in the form of
surgery and/or radiation therapy (RT) is often successful in treating HPV+ OPC, but the resulting damage to
normal tissue can lead to a decreased quality of life (QOL) for survivors. To improve treatment planning for
HPV+ OPC patients, we aim to use artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately identify patients who can benefit
from curative trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) without adjuvant therapy. Currently, identifying HPV+ OPC
patients that can benefit from TORS without adjuvant therapy is based on ad hoc estimation of risk factors for
adjuvant therapy, including tumor resectability and the presence of extracapsular nodal extension (ENE). ENE
is often used as an indicator for the requirement of adjuvant therapy and plays a critical role in patient risk
stratification and decision-making for treatment planning. To address the issue of accurately identifying ENE in
HPV+ OPC, we will develop AI methods with performance that meets or exceeds segmentation and detection
accuracy of metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs) and ENE using pretreatment imaging/clinical data. This approach
has the potential to enable clinicians to make better-informed decisions regarding treatment planning, which
can ultimately lead to better outcomes and improve the QOL for HPV+ OPC survivors. Current approaches to
identify ENE radiologically using diagnostic imaging such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) are unsatisfactory for robust clinical implementation.
To address this issue, we will combine novel deep learning (DL) approaches for 3D multi-modality
(PET/contrast-enhanced CT [CECT]) medical image segmentation and classification with predictive uncertainty
approximation methods, i.e., probabilistic DL (PDL), and evaluate models against human performance for
clinical acceptability. The central hypothesis of this research is that PDL methods can incorporate pretreatment
multi-modal anatomical and functional imaging (PET/CECT) with clinical data to provide probabilistic
segmentation of MLNs and ENE detection with high accuracy and quantified level of confidence that is
sufficient for clinical decision making. Therefore, if successful, this approach would redefine the standard-of-
care regarding TORS/definitive RT treatment planning for HPV+ OPC patients. The proposed AI-assisted
approach aims to improve the accuracy of risk stratification for HPV+ OPC patients by identifying ENE more
accurately and providing a more precise risk assessment. This approach has the potential to enable clinicians
to make better-informed decisions regarding treatment planning, which can ultimately lead to better outcomes
and improve the QOL for HPV+ OPC survivors."

Natural products, often known as specialized secondary metabolites, are used by microbes to control complex
processes such as fitness, biofilm formation, nutrient acquisition, stress response, and virulence. Recent
genomics and transcriptomics analysis of human oral microbiota has indicated that oral microbes have great
potential to synthesize diverse natural products which are correlated with oral health or disease. However,
among thousands of predicted oral natural products, less than 1% have been known. This knowledge gap
prevents thorough study of natural product-mediated microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions and
hampers our understanding of the interplay between oral microbiota and host at a molecular level. There is
currently an urgent need for experimental characterization of these abundant, yet poorly understood, molecules
and the downstream socio-chemical relationships they mediate, which impact human oral health and disease.
Our long-term goal is to harness the medical benefits that are offered by understanding chemistry and biology
of oral natural products. This project focuses on the identification and characterization of bioactive natural
products from the two important oral microbial species: Streptococcus mutans, a key etiological agent of human
dental caries, and Streptococcus salivarius, a probiotic widely available over the counter for oral health. Following
our extensive preliminary data, particularly the recent discovery and mechanistic interrogation of mutanofactin
from S. mutans, we here organize our efforts into three independent specific aims to scrutinize three unique
families of bioactive natural products. These oral metabolites have been predicted to play important roles in
biofilm formation, acid production, or chemical defense from omics analysis and phenotypic correlations, but
their chemical structures, direct biological activities and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Using a
combination of bioinformatics, microbiology, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, metabolic engineering, and
molecular biology, three major questions related to these bioactive natural products will be addressed: “what is
the chemical structure”, “how it is biosynthesized and regulated”, and “why it is produced”. The research strategy
is both innovative and significant, because innovative multidisciplinary approaches are adopted to reveal new
knowledge on oral microbial metabolism, gene functions, and molecular mechanisms of bioactive metabolites.
This project is expected to reveal new targets to inform the design of prophylactics and treatments for oral
disease and infection. Ultimately, new therapies may be developed to complement or synergize with traditional
treatments for oral diseases such as dental caries."

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a severe dose-limiting toxicity that affects over 65% of
patients receiving taxane- or platinum-based chemotherapy for breast or gastrointestinal cancers. Not only does
CIPN increase mortality by limiting the dose of chemotherapy, CIPN affects walking, writing, eating, and dressing
via numbness, tingling, pain, cold sensitivity, and cramping in the hands and feet. There are no FDA-approved
treatments for CIPN because we need a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of CIPN in humans. This
project is motivated by an innovative perspective that CIPN symptoms are not due simply to peripheral nerve
damage, but rather that CIPN symptoms are worsened by changes in the brain, including interoception—the
brain’s processing of sensations from the body.
This is an observational longitudinal cohort study in 120 patients with breast or gastrointestinal cancer scheduled
to receive taxane or platinum chemotherapy along with 60 age-matched healthy controls. The patients will be
assessed within 2 weeks before starting chemotherapy, less than one month after completing chemotherapy,
and six months after completing chemotherapy. Controls will be assessed at matched time intervals. Each
assessment will include (1) measures of neural substrates of interoception (a brain MRI scanning session), (2)
patient-reported and clinical features of interoception and peripheral nerve function, and (3) patient-reported
CIPN severity. Our aims are to assess changes in interoception along the cancer chemotherapy continuum
compared to healthy controls, and to assess the relationships between interoception and CIPN in patients.
This is the first study assessing interoception before and after chemotherapy compared to healthy controls, let
alone how interoception contributes to CIPN: a common, severe, dose-limiting toxicity with enigmatic
mechanisms. By including taxane- and platinum-induced CIPN we can address two common neurotoxic agents
that exhibit distinct signs, symptoms, and mechanisms of toxicities, and may respond differently to a given
treatment. Our results will inform our novel theoretical framework that CIPN is related to interoception, thereby
informing a follow-up clinical trial using interoception-based biomarkers, prophylactics, or treatments for CIPN
for example using exercise, meditation, or pharmacological agents. This work will ultimately help alleviate the
burden of chemotherapy on patients with cancer."

While significant advances have been made over the past decade in understanding how sensory responses are
modulated in the awake behaving animal, significant gaps in our knowledge still remain about how non-sensory
internal factors related to changes in behavioral state can impact sensory signaling. First, our current
understanding of how visual signaling is modulated by behavioral state is still limited to cortex with less emphasis
on the inputs to cortex such as those coming from the thalamus, which is a brain region strongly modulated by
changes in behavioral state. Second, while it has been widely recognized that spontaneous factors such as
running, whisking, and changes in arousal can modulate visual activity, very few studies take these factors into
account. Without accounting for non-sensory factors, we cannot fully understand the neural circuitry underlying
sensory responses during active behavior. Thus, as the field of systems neuroscience moves towards
understanding sensory processing in awake behaving animals, there is a critical need to understand how early
sensory processing is modulated by shifts in the waking behavioral state. The proposed project will combine the
recording of non-sensory internal factors such as arousal and spontaneous face movements with simultaneous
extracellular recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus while animals are
actively performing a visual spatial detection task.
 By dissociating non-sensory variables such as arousal and movement from task engagement and visual
spatial attention, I can test my main hypothesis that shifts in arousal, task-engagement, and spatial attention,
have distinct effects on activity in dLGN. This hypothesis will be tested through three Aims. First, in Aim 1 I will
determine the relationship between arousal level, face movement, and visual response properties in dLGN in
mice passively viewing visual stimuli. In Aim 2, I will quantify how stimulus detection accuracy in a behavioral
task impacts visual response properties in dLGN while simultaneously recording non-sensory variables, and use
neural data combined with non-sensory factors to predict behavioral outcome on a trial-by-trial basis with a
generalized linear model (GLM) to understand which predictors significantly contribute to behavioral outcome.
In Aim 3, I will determine how visual spatial attention modulates visual responses in dLGN while recording non-
sensory variables and dissociate changes in cognitive state from changes in arousal and movement to gain a
more complete understanding of the circuit mechanisms of visual spatial attention. Together, these experiments
will yield a detailed characterization of how sensory activity and non-sensory activity can be both complementary
and dissociable at the level of dLGN. This work will underscore both a critical need to account for non-sensory
internal variables, and the impact of shifts in behavioral state on early visual signals."

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified 403 association signals at 243 loci (T2D variants) that increase T2D
genetic risk. Functional (epi)genomic analyses strongly suggest that non-coding T2D variants alter transcriptional
regulation and target gene expression in pancreatic islets, but only ~20% of T2D variants elicit changes in islet
cis-regulatory element (CRE) use or gene expression under steady state conditions. Environmental factors such
as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been implicated in islet dysfunction. However, studies to date have
not assessed if or how T2D variants modulate the response of islets to ER stress. I hypothesize that these T2D
variants alter islet ER stress-responsive CRE use or activity and target gene expression to contribute to
islet β cell dysfunction or death in T2D. In my preliminary data analysis, I have identified ER stress-responsive
CREs that overlap 407 T2D variants in islets and connected these CREs to 22 putative target gene promoters
using islet promoter capture Hi-C maps. In Aim 1, I will comprehensively assess the effects of T2D variants on
the use or activity of ER stress-responsive CREs using chromatin accessibility quantitative trait locus (caQTL)
and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), respectively. In Aim 2, I will determine if the putative CRE-
targeted genes are required in human islet cells for their ER stress response and survival by altering their
expression using CRISPR/Cas9 epigenomic editing platforms. Successful completion of these Aims will yield a
functionally characterized set of T2D variants and a validated set of downstream 'T2D target genes’ that
modulate islet function and survival in response to a central (patho)physiologic stressor. More broadly, I
anticipate that the principles and framework I employ in this mechanistic variant-to-function project could be
applied to characterize the effects of T2D variants in the context of other environmental stressors and metabolic
tissues. Importantly, completion of this project will help me master current concepts and state-of-the-art
techniques in genetics and functional genomics and increase my scientific communication skills through
extensive opportunities to present and publish my studies. Finally, my position as an MD/PhD student at UConn
Health and The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine will not only allow me to be mentored in a world-
class, highly collaborative environment, but it will provide me with opportunities to continue honing my clinical
skills and gain specialized experience during and after my research phase. Fulfilling my training and development
plan will be a crucial step toward my future career as a physician-scientist studying the genetic and (epi)genomic
mechanisms of disease-associated variants in patients."

In biology, structure determines function. To understand the function of organs (i.e., physiology), we must obtain
structural information on the organs’ structure (i.e., anatomy). Mapping organs’ structures must occur at
(sub)cellular spatial resolution with sufﬁcient details on cells’ molecular states. Spatial transcriptomics
technologies have made signiﬁcant advances in mapping thin tissue sections. However, all spatial transcriptomics
approaches are restricted to sections thinner than 150 µm, with the vast majority needing to be less than 15 µm.
While 2D sections are informative, sampling 3D organs with 2D sections loses information and provides a partial
view of the organs’ full structure. Here we propose to develop whole organ spatial transcriptomics. Key to our
approach is our recent invention (patent pending) of dimensionality reduced Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization
(dredFISH). Single-molecule FISH approaches, such as smFISH, MERFISH, seqFISH+, and many other variants, label
and count individual RNAs. dredFISH is not a single molecule FISH. Instead, it is designed to directly measure an
approximation of cells’ transcriptional state by measuring multiple distinct weighted sums of thousands of genes.
The transcriptional signatures represented by the distinct sums of genes are generated for the reference scRNAseq
and compared to the ones directly measured by dredFISH. Integrating and harmonizing the directly measured FISH
signatures and the reference data allows the inference of cell types (kNN classiﬁcation) and gene expression
reconstruction (kNN regression). By leapfrogging the need for individual gene measurements, dredFISH achieves
multiple features that make it ideal for fast light-sheet microscopy of thick samples (500 µm). Speciﬁcally, i)
dredFISH is performed using low magniﬁcation objectives (10x, 16x) instead of high magniﬁcation objectives
(60x,100x) used for single-molecule FISH. ii) dredFISH utilizes the tissue clearing and hydrogel embedding
technique used by CLARITY, making it compatible with existing light-sheet imaging protocols. iii) dredFISH signal
comes from the weighted sums of ﬂuorescence from tens of thousands of RNA molecules per cell, each stained by
tens of probes, making it much brighter and easier to measure than all other FISH approaches. Our preliminary
results demonstrate that dredFISH works well in thin 2D sections validating our approach. The goal of this
proposal is to extend dredFISH from 2D to 3D to allow whole organ spatial transcriptomics. This goal will be
accomplished by parallel development steps divided into two aims. Aim #1 will continue optimizing and validating
dredFISH in 2D by changing a few aspects of the method that will ease the transition to 3D. Aim #2 will update
the staining and imaging steps in the dredFISH protocol to make them compatible with thick samples. Aim #3 will
demonstrate the power of dredFISH whole organ spatial transcriptomics by creating the entire mouse brain's cell
type and gene expression atlases. By completing these aims, we will deliver new capabilities: whole organ spatial
transcriptomics that will have transformative effects on numerous biomedical disciplines."

Oncoproteins drive tumor development and aggressive growth by dysregulating the signaling pathways involved
in cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Targeting oncoproteins directly, or their downstream pathways, has
resulted in novel therapies currently being used for the treatment of different cancer subtypes.
The RAS family of guanosine triphosphatase (GTP) hydrolases (GTPases) are a group of oncoproteins, that
have roles in cancer initiation, progression, and resistance to therapies. Furthermore, mutations in genes
encoding classical RAS proteins are very frequent in cancer. RAS proteins cycle between a guanosine
diphosphate (GDP) inactive form and a GTP active form. In its GTP-bound conformation, RAS proteins promote
activation of downstream signaling pathways that contribute to the growth and proliferation of cells. This
nucleotide cycle is assisted by accessory proteins that catalyze the loading or hydrolysis of GTP and
dysregulation of this mechanism is also frequent in cancer.
Emerging evidence has shown that non-classical RAS proteins also play critical roles in cancer biology; however,
their mechanisms of regulation and tumorigenesis are not well-understood and differ from classical RAS proteins.
We have recently discovered a novel mechanism of regulation of the non-classical RAS proteins RIT1 and MRAS
that is mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the inactive GDP-bound form. Our work
identified LZTR1, a novel protein that binds RIT1 and MRAS and forms a complex with the E3 Ubiquitin ligase
Cullin-3 (CRL3LZTR1). Cancer-associated mutations in RIT1 or LZTR1 disrupt their interaction and lead to the
accumulation of non-classical RAS GTPases and activation of downstream signaling.
In this application, we propose to study critical aspects regarding the regulation of this novel complex, its
contribution to tumorigenesis, and potential pharmacological strategies to restore protein degradation.
In Aim 1, we will use biochemical and structural approaches to understand the determinants of LZTR1 selectivity
towards the non-classical RAS GTPases RIT1 and MRAS and the function of its protein domains.
In Aim 2, we plan to elucidate the signaling mechanisms that regulate CRL3LZTR1 activity in cells and how these
pathways can contribute to the resistance to specific targeted therapies.
In Aim 3, we will develop novel mouse models that are driven by an oncogenic RIT1 mutation that is resistant to
LZTR1-mediated proteasomal degradation and analyze the molecular signatures of these tumors. In addition,
we will develop proof-of-concept pharmacological treatments for RIT1-driven cancers.
Overall, our project will address a major knowledge gap in the mechanisms of regulation of non-classical RAS
oncoproteins and will provide novel preclinical models and therapeutic strategies for these cancers. The work
described in this application is the first step to develop mechanism-based and precise medicines for targeting
these oncogenic pathways in cancer."

Suicidality in children is a pressing and understudied public health concern. Rates of suicide in youth have tripled
in recent years, yet little is known about the early emergence or development of suicidal ideation and behaviors
(SI/SB). Suicidal ideation (e.g., wishing to be dead, expressing desire to kill oneself) and behaviors (e.g., choking
oneself) have been identified as early as the preschool period in the context of early-onset depression. However,
if and how suicidality presents in non-depressed young children is unknown. Importantly, early suicidality remains
stable into school-age and confers risk for later psychopathology, suggesting lasting impact and continuity of this
early manifestation. Consistent with the NIMH Strategic Objective 2, to “chart mental illness trajectories to
determine when, where, and how to intervene,” the overarching aim of this K01 application is to understand the
developmental contexts in which suicidality emerges in order to identify at-risk youth and to inform preventative
intervention efforts. The proposed study will address a number of questions central to understanding the
development of suicidality in early childhood including how SI/SB is expressed at this early age, the normative
development of the understanding of suicide, if children with SI/SB exhibit lack of optimism and/or pessimism,
and how children with SI/SB process peer acceptance and rejection. A variety of measures, including child
interview and narrative approaches, behavioral tasks, and event related potentials (ERPs) will be administered
to three groups of 4- to 7-year-olds from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds: 1) children with a history
of SI/SB, 2) children with or at risk for psychopathology but no history of SI/SB, and 3) low-risk healthy children.
The inclusion of children with or at risk for psychopathology with no history of SI/SB will address the specificity
of risk factors for suicidality relative to depressive symptoms and other forms of psychopathology. This approach
has the potential to identify transdiagnostic risk-factors of suicidality in young children. The inclusion of low-risk
healthy children will inform our understanding of typical and atypical trajectories of suicide understanding and
provide guidance regarding how and when to address expressions of suicidality in childhood as a clinical
concern. This will be the first study of children this young with SI/SB to be targeted for a study designed to
investigate the developmental antecedents of risk and resilience for SI/SB. Suicide research and prevention is a
high priority research area for NIMH and the described research and training activities will enable the candidate
to develop an independent research program that addresses the rising rates of childhood suicidality. Specifically,
the execution of the proposed project will provide the candidate with training and expertise in suicide research
and prevention, child psychopathology, and ERP techniques. A rich training environment and a multidisciplinary
team of mentors in each of these areas is detailed. Data from this project will be used in a planned R01 to more
deeply investigate racial and/or sociocultural differences in risk factors and developmental trajectories of early-
onset suicidality."

The US is in the midst of an opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. Oxycodone is one of the most prescribed
analgesics, is the first opioid many people experience, and has physiochemical properties that allow it to
accumulate in the brain at rates higher than other opioids, perhaps explaining its considerable abuse potential.
Here, I seek to perform high-throughput experiments to generate brain-wide data on the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of cue-induced reinstatement to oxycodone seeking. Specifically, I propose to use FosCreER mice
to fluorescently `tag' neuronal ensembles activated by cue-induced reinstatement. I will then use cutting-edge
transcriptomics to identify relapse-related genes in these cellular ensembles that drive reinstatement. I will then
prioritize, and test, whether these genes may serve substrates for the development of novel medications to
prevent relapse using a ”circuit therapeutic” approach. In aim 1, iDISCO+, a lipid clearing method, will produce
brain-wide data on regions activated by relapse. I will then use ClearMap, a published Python package, to
conduct high-throughput detection of activated neurons and registration of coordinates onto the Allen Brain
Atlas. I will then rigorously examine this large data set, and test whether reinstatement-responsive cell
ensembles in prioritized structures contribute to relapse behavior. In aim 2, I will focus on cellular populations
in brain regions shown to be required for relapse-related behavior, and will again tag neurons activated by
reinstatement in these sites. Tissue will be dissected, and fluorescence activated cell sorting will be used to
isolate these activated neurons for trancriptomic profiling via RNA-Seq. Together, these two aims will yield
large data sets directly related to the neurocircuitry and molecular biology of reinstatement of oxycodone
seeking. I will once again rigorously analyze these data sets, with strict adherence to pre-established criteria,
to prioritize reinstatement-responsive genes most likely to represent efficacious targets for development of
novel pharmacotherapeutics. Following completion of the training phase, in aim 3 I will extend these findings to
both rat and mouse models of self-administration, and will validate that these transcriptomic adaptations occur
across species, and that they are detected as changes in functional proteins. Once again, I will rigorously
prioritize these targets for translational potential. In aim 4 I will use pharmacological agents that modulate
prioritized protein targets to determine whether they can block cue-induced reinstatement of oxycodone
seeking, focusing on compounds that may be able to quickly move into clinical settings. The training added in
this proposal will allow me to emerge as an exceptionally well-rounded independent investigator. During my
independent career I will perform translational research to develop novel circuit-based therapeutics for
prevention of relapse."

A frequent complaint in older adults is difficulty with speech comprehension, especially in the presence of
background noise, such as when at a busy restaurant. A common strategy that listeners use in such situations
is to use the linguistic context to fill in gaps in comprehension. Older adults tend to do well with this, at least in
laboratory situations: given a meaningful linguistic context, their word recognition is much more like young adults’
than when speech is meaningless. An open question is what cognitive mechanisms underly this ability. Based
on research in young adults, it is widely believed that prediction plays a central role in language processing –
listeners could predict upcoming words from a meaningful context, and thus compensate for noisy input. Yet, a
line of research using an electroencephalography (EEG) signature of predictive language processing, the N400,
suggests that predictive processing is impaired in older adults. This raises the question of how, then, older adults
can successfully use context to facilitate speech recognition. This proposal uses cutting-edge neuroimaging
techniques to examine a wider range of predictive speech processing than previous work, as well as non-
predictive compensatory mechanisms, in younger and older adults. To maximize relevance to older adults’ real-
world experience, brain responses are measured while listening to continuous narrative speech, in quiet and in
multi-talker babble background noise, approximating conditions in a busy restaurant. EEG is used to model the
temporal dynamics of predictive language processing at multiple levels (acoustic-phonetic, sublexical, lexical,
sentential). This will test several hypothesis that older adults use predictions during speech processing, but at
different levels than young adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to characterize
language networks related to speech processing in quiet and in noise. Whereas previous research has mostly
relied on small sample sizes, obscuring individual differences, this work will be based on a large dataset,
adequately powered for individual difference analysis, and will collect a range of individual variables that may be
related to speech comprehension, such as hearing ability, working memory span and inhibitory functioning. This
work will relate individual differences in prediction at multiple levels of the processing hierarchy to language,
cognitive, and functional outcomes. Together, this work aims to uncover which cognitive strategies (predictive or
non-predictive), neural representations and network are related to successful speech comprehension in older
adults. By relating neural measures to comprehension, it will distinguish between successful compensation and
maladaptive changes in brain activation. The dataset will be shared publicly, providing a unique testbed for future
researchers interested in speech and aging."

 Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NPI) in the U.S. are a rapidly growing racial group that suffers severe
alcohol-related disparities. In NPI communities, young adults (18-30 years) endure the greatest burden of alcohol
use disorders (AUD) and alcohol-related harms with our earlier NIAAA R21 study revealing that almost 50% of
community-dwelling NPI young adults are at heavy risk for, or have, AUDs with 40% experiencing alcohol-related
harms (e.g., health, social, work). Despite this, NPI young adults have received minimal alcohol research
attention, leading to a lack of effective interventions to prevent or reduce their extreme AUD risk.
 Guided by the findings of our NIAAA R21, this resubmitted R01 study will respond to this public health gap
by refining and efficacy testing SPEAR (Strategies for Pacific Empowerment and Alcohol Reduction): a novel
culturally grounded AUD prevention intervention for NPI young adults. Building on our R21-developed Model of
SPEAR intervention components for NPI young adults (previously chosen and shaped in our R21 by NPIs from
existing AUD prevention interventions), in Aim 1, we will assemble our treatment manual from our NPI-shaped
R21 AUD prevention components. To assemble the manual, we will use our culturally congruent intervention
design methodology for NPIs involving an Advisory Council of community experts and citizens’ panels—an
innovative research approach that mirrors NPI collective decision-making practices—to obtain critical feedback
for refining SPEAR content/components from NPI young adults with high AUD risk and informal NPI providers.
In Aim 2, we will review and refine our treatment components and manual through expert review by 3 leading
alcohol research experts and feasibility pilot test the manual with 36 NPI young adults with high AUD risk for
feasibility, acceptability, and impact, using our findings to finalize SPEAR for our randomized controlled trial. In
Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of SPEAR by conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial with 240 NPI
young adults with high AUD risk in two large NPI communities in Los Angeles County and Northwest Arkansas
for generalizability. Aligning with community research principles, we will share study findings with the NPI
community through public reports and presentations, and to the scientific community through academic
presentations and manuscripts.

Cilia damage and ciliated cell loss brought on by epithelial remodeling contributes to defective mucociliary
clearance in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS),
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Proper ciliated cell formation requires
coordination of ciliated cell fate acquisition and ciliogenesis programs, but our mechanistic understanding is
incomplete. Current treatments do not directly target or fully reverse ciliary dysfunction, highlighting the
need for novel molecular targets for specific therapies. We showed that ciliated cell formation and function
depend on sequentially deployed Wnt signaling pathways. First, canonical, or β-catenin-dependent Wnt
signaling (Wnt/β- cat) is required for ciliated cell fate acquisition, which then must be turned off. Next,
noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling (Wnt/PCP) is turned on and stays on to control ciliogenesis
and polarized ciliary motility. In CF and CRS airways and in primary cultures remodeled by proinflammatory
cytokine treatment Wnt/β-cat stays active, and Wnt/PCP is blocked. Wnt/β-cat inhibition alleviates ciliary
dysfunction in vitro. Thus, we propose that instead of two independent Wnt pathways, a canonical to
noncanonical Wnt signaling switch controls healthy ciliated cell formation, and “switch failure” is a mediator
and therapeutic target in ciliary dysfunction. Our preliminary data show that DKK3, a canonical Wnt/β-cat
inhibitor and WNT4, a noncanonical ligand, co-secreted by airway epithelial stem cells are required together
to suppress Wnt/β-cat and to activate Wnt/PCP within ciliated cells. Downstream, we show that β-catenin,
the central effector of Wnt/β-cat is inactivated and sequestered at the basal bodies of cilia. We demonstrate
that DKK3 and WNT4 expression is disrupted in diseased, and cytokine treated epithelia. Thus, we
hypothesize that DKK3/WNT4-dependent signaling and β-catenin basal body sequestration are required for
healthy ciliated cell formation and that disruption of this Wnt switch mechanism mediates in ciliary
dysfunction in inflamed airway epithelia. Here, we use transgenic mouse models, human primary cells, and
tissues to test this hypothesis in the following aims: In Aim 1, we test the necessity and sufficiency of
epithelial DKK3/WNT4 to regulate Wnt signaling and ciliated cell formation through the switch using
Dkk3/Wnt4 knockout mice, CRISPR deletion in cells and ectopic expression. In Aim 2, we test if the switch is
mediated by the DKK3/WNT4-dependent sequestration β-catenin at basal bodies where it then acts to
control ciliogenesis. In Aim 3, we investigate the IL-1β cytokine as a driver of Wnt switch failure and test the
ectopic DKK3/WNT4-mediated mitigation of ciliary dysfunction. The new paradigm of the canonical to
noncanonical Wnt signaling switch explored in this proposal will establish molecular mechanistic insight into
the role of airway epithelial Wnt signaling, elucidate switch failure as a cause of ciliated cell dysfunction,
and provide the rationale and potential targets for Wnt modulation in a wide range of chronic lung diseases."
10804384,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a disorder of the glomerular filtration barrier caused by mutations in type IV
collagen resulting in an abnormal development of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) that ultimately
leads to progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal failure. Although the genetic causes of AS are
well established the biological mechanisms and complex molecular signaling regulating disease progression
remain elusive. Contrary to the podocentric view of AS progression, our analysis on GEC transcriptome and
lipidomic studies combined with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy suggest pathologic changes in
cellular metabolism of lipids in GEC early in disease in our model of AS, Col4a5-/- mice, before podocyte
detachment. In particular, we found 2-fold increase in triglyceride levels in GEC, which were associated with
modulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), and PPARα. In
addition, we have supporting evidence that links altered lipid metabolism in GEC to VEGF mediated
remodeling of caveolae and downstream signaling via the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. Therefore,
understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of lipid metabolic changes and
therefore glomerular endothelial dysfunction in AS will provide important insight into the molecular
mechanisms of Alport progression.
 We also have evidence that extracellular vesicles derived from amniotic fluid stem cells (EVs) provide
therapeutic benefit in AS mice, ameliorate glomerular injury, improve renal physiology and prolong survival.
Proteome studies revealed expression of various angiogenic and lipogenic cargo in human EVs, including
FASN. A spatial transcriptomic analysis of AS glomeruli injected with a single dose of human EVs resulted in
regulation of lipid metabolism pathways to normal. These findings were confirmed in vitro by applying human
EV to FASN knock-out GEC. Therefore, based on our preliminary supporting data we hypothesize that lipid
dysregulation in GEC contributes to AS progression and that EVs can re-establish lipid metabolic
homeostasis in GEC and prevent disease progression.
 In this project, we will use a novel in vitro 3D glomerulus-on-a-chip system, designed to mimic the
glomerular filtration barrier and GEC of human origin to investigate how lipid metabolic changes following
VEGF mediated remodeling of caveolae leads to GEC dysfunction. Using gain and loss of function studies, we
will establish the role of lipids in lipid metabolic homeostasis in GEC, and the link to GEC dysfunction in AS.
Lastly, we will assess the potential of EVs to restore lipid homeostasis in GEC as a rescue mechanism using
different in vitro systems, and in vivo approaches. Successful completion of this proposal will significantly
improve our knowledge on the role of glomerular endothelium in AS glomerulopathy. Knowledge gained
from these studies can be applied to other CKD etiologies."

Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) remains a global public health crisis. Molecular TB assays such as Xpert
have led to dramatic increases in RR-TB case detection and ongoing expansion of the global estimated need for
newer treatments. Tremendous financial and scientific resources are directed toward the investigation of new
and repurposed drugs, but efforts to optimize and scale-up shorter course, all-oral RR-TB regimens are hindered
significantly by the scarcity of availability and access to phenotypic or molecular susceptibility testing for these
agents. Longstanding critical barriers of routine phenotypic drug susceptibility testing include prolonged
turnaround time and infrastructure requirements that preclude efficient scale-up, contributing significantly to the
DR-TB diagnostic gap. Patients are often committed to months of ineffective treatments, leading to acquisition
of further drug resistance through selective drug pressure and worse clinical outcomes. Our goal in proposing
this work is to improve patient outcomes through strategic and evidence-based use of genomics tools in high

funded cohort, and commercial partners to translate our established targeted deep sequencing assay onto a
cost-efficient, handheld nanopore-based sequencing platform (Aim 1, near-clinic solution); and prospectively
sequence patient samples early in the course of their treatment in two diverse geographic regions with differing

 The spatial organization of chromosomes and gene expression are mutually influential processes.
Perturbations of either can lead to developmental defects and disease. Studies on chromatin structure have
been dominated by those focusing on the architectural transcription factors CTCF, YY1 and the cohesin complex.
The central hypothesis of this application, supported by preliminary data, is that the non-DNA binding adapter
protein Ldb1 presents a separate, equally important category of nuclear chromatin organizers. In prior work we
demonstrated that artificial recruitment of Ldb1 to chromatin can be sufficient to forge long range enhancer-
promoter contacts at the b-globin locus. This nominated Ldb1 as a key architectural protein in erythroid cells.
Yet a global view of Ldb1 chromatin occupancy patterns during cell differentiation or cell cycle progression is
lacking, and genome wide direct Ldb1 dependent chromatin contacts and corresponding transcriptional patterns
are largely unknown. More broadly, the cause-effect relationships of architectural features and gene expression
are still hotly debated in the field.
 Here we propose to carry out the following aims in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Ross Hardison. In
Aim 1 we will assess in erythroblasts undergoing cell maturation the dynamic Ldb1 chromatin landscapes in
relation to high resolution Hi-C chromosomal connectivity maps, and nascent transcription measurements (PRO-
seq). In Aim 2 we will use an auxin-inducible acute Ldb1 degradation system to interrogate direct architectural
and transcriptional Ldb1 dependencies. In Aim 3 we will exploit the massive and swift changes in chromatin
architecture during the mitosis to G1-phase progression to assess the chromatin occupancy dynamics of Ldb1
and its role in establishing the multi-layered hierarchy of chromatin organization and gene expression.
 All aims are accompanied by perturbative and mechanistic experiments.
 We believe that the power of the proposed studies lies in the complementarity of highly dynamic natural
transition states (cell maturation and cell cycle progression) as well as acute experimental perturbation (auxin
degron), which to our knowledge has never been done before within the same cell system. Gains in knowledge
are further enhanced by parallel studies in the same cellular system on CTCF, YY1 and cohesin with support
from different funding sources. The forward looking view is that the end result of our studies is, for the first time,
a unified view of the dynamics of major architectural components and gene expression. Therefore, the studies
proposed here coupled with parallel studies in the lab generate a cost-effective synergy, such that the outcome
will be greater than the sum of its parts."
10806232,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint
blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies, but have failed in all Phase III
trials in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients. This limited efficacy of ICBs is due to
profound immunosuppression in the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) caused by paucity of cytotoxic T
cells, abundance of regulatory T cells, resident macrophages and microglia and infiltration of myeloid-
derived cells from the bone marrow. Wnt signaling fuels GBM progression by aiding proliferation, stemness,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance. However, the role of Wnt signaling in immune
suppression in GBM is not known. In our preliminary studies we found that Wnt signaling is elevated in
murine and human GBMs. A porcupine inhibitor WNT974 -- that blocks Wnt signaling -- in combination with
anti-PD-1 antibody (αPD1) prolonged the survival of GBM-bearing mice. This increased survival was
accompanied by an expansion of a novel DC3-like dendritic cell state and decrease in granulocytic myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) that may mediate the response to this combination in responding tumors.
By contrast, poorly-responding tumors showed an increase in monocytic (m) MDSCs, insufficient T cell infiltration
and T cell effector function, suggesting potential resistance mechanisms. Our prior work shows that genetic
deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling disrupts the GBM vasculature and makes it leaky.
Moreover, ICBs themselves increase edema in GBM patients and require the use of steroids that are highly
immunosuppressive. Our preliminary studies show that losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, can reduce
αPD1-induced edema and reprogram the immunosuppressive TME to an immunostimulatory milieu to favor T
cell infiltration and effector function. Building on these exciting findings, our overarching hypothesis is that Wnt
signaling reprograms the GBM tumor microenvironment from immune suppressive to immune
stimulatory, thus potentiating αPD1 therapy, and adding losartan further enhances the outcome by
overcoming treatment resistance mechanisms, and reducing edema. We will test this hypothesis by
examining the function of (a) antigen cross-presenting DCs and (b) decreased gMDSCs in mediating the
response to WNT974 and αPD1 (Aim 1). We will also test the hypothesis that resistance to WNT974+αPD1
is caused by (a) increased mMDSCs and (b) lack of T cell infiltration and function (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that the combination of losartan with Wnt-inhibition and αPD1 will (a) reduce mMDSCs
infiltration and increase T cell infiltration and effector function and (b) alleviate edema and provide durable
responses in GBMs that are refractory to WNT974+αPD1. If successful, our results will inform the design of
future GBM clinical trials to improve the outcome of ICBs using agents currently in clinical trials for non-CNS
tumors (WNT974: e.g., NCT01351103; and losartan: NCT03563248)."

at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior
scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in
three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the
Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on
large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer
surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of
which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years.
These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These
themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal
data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of
learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race-
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our
projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population
sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which
in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward
by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and
methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community,
streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the
Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more
broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas
through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants.
The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues
by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey
development, and analysis."

More than 90% of individuals experience a substantial traumatic stress exposure (TSE) in their lifetime. While
most individuals recover following TSE, a substantial subset develop chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP).
Despite growing evidence that mechanisms driving CMSP are vastly different in men and women, sex-specific
mechanisms that drive the transition from acute to chronic pain following TSE remain poorly understood. This
lack of knowledge is an important barrier to the discovery of novel therapeutics for the prevention/treatment of
CMSP. The proposed work will help address this barrier by evaluating sex-specific, highly influential microRNA
(miRNA) regulatory mechanisms affecting CMSP development. Experiments will center on miR-19, a miRNA
repeatedly demonstrated to have an important sex-dependent influence on the pathogenesis of chronic pain and
related neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on substantial preliminary data from the investigative team,
experiments will evaluate the overarching hypothesis that miR-19 drives CMSP development differently in men
vs. women via sex-dependent effects on circadian rhythm biology and TLR4-driven innate immune responses.
Proposed experiments will leverage the translational research expertise of the study team by performing
causation and mechanistic studies using both human cohort data and animal model systems. Human cohort
data analyses will include first-in-kind transcriptomic, physiologic, and neuroimmune data collected as part of the
AURORA study, a forty-million-dollar study that enrolled thousands of men and women trauma survivors and
followed them prospectively over the course of one year. Objective accelerometry-based measures of circadian
rhythmicity, measures of immune cell profiling/intracellular signaling (via mass cytometry), RNA and microRNA
sequencing data, cytokine profiles of AURORA samples, and self-report pain and quantitative sensory testing of
study participants will provide a unique opportunity to comprehensively evaluate study hypotheses. In addition,
results from human cohort analyses will be supported by miR-19 knock-down, rescue, and gene expression
studies in a well-validated and robust animal model of TSE-induced enduring stress induced hyperalgesia. By
the end of the award period, we will have gained important new insights into sex-specific mechanisms of CMSP
development and will elucidate exciting new therapeutic strategies for men and women."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the 3rd most deadly cancers with a 5-year survival rate of only 3%
in patients with metastases. Current efforts to improve outcomes in PDA have yet to significantly extend patient
survival. This is in part due to the fact that 80-90% of PDA cases are not surgically resectable and exhibit local
or distant metastases upon diagnosis, thereby significantly shortening survival. The most aggressive and toxic
chemotherapy cocktail regimen, FOLFIRINOX, fails to extend median
survival beyond 11.1 months.
While
combinations of chemotherapy with immunotherapy (chemo-immunotherapy) have been paradigm-shifting for
several primary and metastatic cancers, they still fail to significantly extend PDA patient survival. For example,
chemo-immunotherapy using gemcitabine, nab-Paclitaxel and Pembrolizumab extended overall survival in PDA
patients to only 15 months. As such, there remains a critical need for transformative modalities that
improve response rates to chemo-immunotherapy in PDA patients. Chemo-immunotherapy is largely
limited in PDA by desmoplasia which contributes to 1) poor drug delivery, and 2) an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment that neutralizes the action of immunotherapies. This project capitalizes on a non-toxic light-
activated modality known as photodynamic priming (PDP), which we have shown to directly remediate
desmoplasia. In doing so, PDP augments the delivery of small molecular weight therapeutics, monoclonal
antibodies, and nanomedicines, and also mechanistically sensitize tumors to both chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Furthermore, we and others have shown that PDP induces T cell mediated anti-tumor
responses, thereby synergizing with immune-checkpoint blockade.
In this proposal, we will use optical molecular imaging to direct the engineering of a single PD-L1 targeted
liposome that delivers PDP and chemo-immunotherapy in a spatiotemporal, synchronized fashion. We
will use syngeneic models representing T cell inflamed and non-T cell inflamed PDA tumors, Genetically
Engineered Mouse Models, and orthotopic patient-derived PDA xenograft models in order to: 1) promote a
homogenous tumor deposition of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents, 2) mechanistically sensitize
tumors to chemotherapy, 3) induce immunogenic cell death, and 4) provoke a T cell mediated anti-tumor
attack. By first remediating desmoplasia, we propose that a single targeted liposome integrating PDP and
chemo-immunotherapy will improve PDA responsiveness at considerably lower chemotherapy doses, thereby
prolonging patient survival, while mitigating dose-limiting toxicities and improving patient quality of life."

Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for chronic health conditions (CHCs) and early mortality at
rates typically among individuals decades older, suggesting an accelerated aging phenotype. However, there
are limited studies applying molecular biomarkers to quantify the acceleration of aging in long-term survivors of
childhood cancer. Here, we propose to apply epigenetic age to measure biological aging and investigate the
trajectories of epigenetic aging, risk factors and health outcomes in this population. Our proposal is built upon
our previous studies reporting that that epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is significantly higher in survivors of
childhood cancer than individuals without a history of cancer, and is associated with treatment exposures,
unfavorable health behaviors, and presence of CHCs. To further our research, we will take advantage of the rich
resources of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), which includes 4,263 5+ year survivors of childhood
cancer who have been characterized with genome-wide epigenetic profiling (MethylationEPIC BeadChip) using
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at one time point (T1), and are well documented for cancer
treatment exposures, health behaviors, social determinants of health (SDOH) as well as comprehensive clinical
assessments of CHCs. We will also measure EAA for a set of 1,804 survivors with PBMCs collected at a second
time point (T2) and 1,000 survivors for a third time point (T3), with an interval of approximately 5-years between
adjacent time points. In addition, we will leverage two ongoing NIH-funded intervention trials: Telehealth-based
intervention to improve fitness [CA246570], and eHealth intervention for late effects of childhood cancer
[CA239689], where biospecimens will be collected before and after the intervention and will undergo epigenetic
profiling. The overarching goals are to: 1) examine the effect of health behaviors and SDOH factors on the rate
of change in EAA during follow-up of the SJLIFE cohort; 2) evaluate the association between the rate of change
in EAA and subsequent long-term outcomes including prevalence/severity/cumulative burden of CHCs and
mortality during follow-up of the SJLIFE cohort; and 3) determine the impact of behavioral interventions for
physical fitness and sleep quality on the changes in EAA. Our novel study will encompass observational and
interventional components, each with a longitudinal repeated measures of EAA at up to three time-points to
enable evaluation of the changes in EAA. Findings from non-Hispanic White survivors will be evaluated in diverse
populations including non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic survivors as well as non-cancer controls in an exploratory
fashion. Successful completion of the proposed study will substantially advance our understanding and generate
new insights into the accelerated aging phenomenon, inform development of novel interventions to slow down
accelerated aging and prevent or remediate age-related CHCs, and facilitate future clinical translation of EAA
and/or other aging biomarkers to patient care, which is critically needed for aging survivors of childhood cancer."
10803794,"Project Summary/Abstract
Late-stage functionalization is a powerful strategy used in nature and in synthetic chemistry to expand structural
complexity and diversity. In natural product biosynthesis, this strategy is exemplified by diverse reactions
catalyzed by metalloenzymes. Among them, non-heme-iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) enzymes
have been shown to perform a staggering array of transformations including carbo- and hetero-cyclization,
halogenation, hydroxylation, olefination, and rearrangement. The catalytic diversity makes Fe/2OG enzymes an
attractive target for biocatalyst development, organic synthesis, and other applications. However, despite the
prevalence of Fe/2OG enzymes in all kingdoms of life (>160,000 encoded Fe/2OG enzyme genes in genomic
data), efficient and precise strategies to annotate Fe/2OG enzyme functions are still lacking. Cyclopropane and
aza-cyclopropane (aziridine) are unique three-membered carbo-/hetero-cycles, and are important
pharmacophores widely used in drugs. In addition, the isocyano (isonitrile) group is found in hundreds of
secondary metabolites with roles in metal trafficking. As demonstrated in the preliminary results, our combined
bioinformatics and retro-biosynthetic analysis has identified Fe/2OG cyclopropanases, aziridinases and
isonitrilases from thousands of functionally unannotated Fe/2OG enzymes. In this project, we will continue to
apply this strategy to identify enzymes with these targeted activities. In cyclopropanation and aziridination, these
newly discovered Fe/2OG enzymes and the related Fe/2OG hydroxylases will be subjected to mechanistic
studies using a multifaceted approach consisting of molecular probe design/synthesis, product analysis,
spectroscopic (EPR and Mössbauer) characterization, transient enzyme kinetics, and protein structure prediction
and computational modeling. The acquired mechanistic insights, together with bioinformatics and retro-synthetic
analysis, will be used to guide Fe/2OG enzyme functional (re)assignment in genomic data, to formulate effective
strategies for conversion of hydroxylases to cyclopropanases or aziridinases, and to enable alternative carbo-
and hetero-cycle formations. In the isonitrilase project, we will define factors that govern substrate selectivity of
these enzymes, elucidate product structures, innovate a versatile method to prepare isonitrile-containing
molecules, and assess their metal-binding properties."
10803731,"The primary research question of the proposed study is this: Is a water-based exercise + cognitive training
(WATER+CT) intervention for Veterans with neurological manifestations of long-COVID feasible? We
address the need to enhance recovery in this vulnerable population through an innovative multi-component
training program that has successfully been used in other cognitively impaired populations. The aims of the
proposed research include: 1) demonstrate feasibility as shown by good recruitment and retention rates and
stakeholder ratings; 2) evaluate appropriateness of suggested inclusion and exclusion criteria; 3) evaluate
acceptability of water-based physical exercise + cognitive training interventions; 4) assess ability of selected
outcome measurement techniques to determine the efficacy of water-based physical exercise + cognitive
training; and 5) examine outcome “moderator” and “mediator” measurement techniques.
These aims will be tested in a single-blind randomized controlled pilot trial that will establish the feasibility of
WATER+CT. This trial will include 50 Veterans, age 18 – 89, experiencing neurological manifestations of
long-COVID, with half randomized to WATER+CT and half to usual care. WATER+CT consists of two-
phases: 1) an exercise training phase and 2) a cognitive training phase. The exercise training (i.e., WATER)
consists of a six-month long individualized exercise program of water-based exercises. During this phase,
Veterans will come to thrice-weekly group sessions at Aquatic Therapy Center at VA Palo Alto Health Care
System (VAPAHCS). After completion of the exercise program, Veterans will begin classroom-based
cognitive training at VAPAHCS for up to two months. The CT is based on an efficacious training program
that is structured around two components, pre-training, and mnemonic training, both of which have been
used successfully in persons with cognitive impairment. Veterans randomized to the UC control condition
will receive educational materials about brain health in addition to their usual care, which is the care they
would typically receive in the VA. Assessments of adherence will be administered throughout treatment and
measures of feasibility will be completed post-treatment.
Participants will complete a variety of neuropsychological measures taping into areas of cognition such as
attention, executive functioning, and memory. Participants will also undergo physical fitness assessments
including a 6-minute walk test and an exercise treadmill test. To study possible predictors of response to
treatment, we will also collect physiological (VO2 max), biological (inflammatory markers and BDNF plasma
levels), and genetic data (APOE and BDNF genotypes) from these participants. We hope to provide initial
evidence of the feasibility of a water-based exercise training + cognitive training program and provide
foundational support for a future VA Merit application targeting enhanced recovery in Veterans with
neurological manifestations of long-COVID."
10828762,"While much is known on the causes of epiretinal membrane formation in retina diseases such as 
Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), the progression 
of cell transformation into myocontractile phenotype and the machinery responsible for the 
contraction is less understood. The long-term goal is that when a membrane in patients with 
Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy or Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy is identified we have an 
understanding of the contraction machinery responsible and can prescribe treatments to stop or 
reverse membrane contraction. The objective of this proposal is to determine the components of the 
contraction machinery that are essential for membrane contraction. The central hypothesis is 
contraction associated genes we identify during whole transcriptome sequencing of patient 
epiretinal membranes are components of the contraction machinery are responsible for membrane 
contraction and retinal detachment in patients with PVR and PDR. The rational underlying this 
proposal is that completion will identify key physical targets that when disabled will prevent or 
reverse membrane contraction. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 
1) To determine the mechanisms underlying the transformation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
into a contracting membrane. 2) To identify contraction-associated genes in the membranes from 
patients with PVR and PDR and evaluate their necessity for contraction by retinal cells in a new 
model of membrane contraction and a well established animal model. We will pursue these aims using 
an innovative combination of analytical and manipulative techniques. These include using the 
protocol we designed to isolate RNA from patient dissected membranes with sufficient yield and 
quality enabling whole transcriptome sequencing. Additionally we will use retina cell culture 
methods and a new model of contraction developed by this team that enables the preservation of 
native physiology and resembles the disease contraction phenotype. We will use these new methods in 
tandem with well-established techniques in molecular biology. The research proposal is significant, 
because the results will identify the machinery responsible for retinal membrane contraction and 
vision loss in PVR and PDR. From this understanding, new therapeutic approaches may be developed 
for rescuing patients from vision loss. The expected outcome of this work is a more complete 
understanding of retinal membrane formation and contraction in two devastating eye diseases, which 
will provide insight into other fibrotic membrane diseases of the retina. The results will have a 
positive impact immediately as the new knowledge gained will point to new targets for the 
prevention of vision loss."
10828759,"Direct examination of presynaptic processes has historically been limited by the resolution constraints of
conventional light microscopy. As a result, much of what we know about vesicle movement, fusion, and
recycling relies on inferences from indirect electrophysiological and/or biochemical assays, or from electron
micrographs that reflect a single instant of a dynamic system. The long-term goal of my research program is to
understand the fundamental mechanisms of synaptic transmission at central synapses, including details of
spatiotemporal dynamics under normal conditions, and what disruptions lead to disease states. Current
projects in the lab address two central knowledge gaps. First, we directly probe and track dynamic presynaptic
processes in living tissue by applying our own novel, nanoscale resolution imaging technology. Using this
approach, we will, for the first time, visualize these processes at the level of single synaptic vesicles within
identified synapses. We have already made significant contributions using this approach, including the
discovery that synaptic vesicle dynamics are active, not passive, and are controlled by actin cytoskeleton and
myosin motors. The second major knowledge gap we address is the contribution of presynaptic deficits to
pathophysiology of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is the most common known cause of heritable intellectual
disability and autism. Our recent findings have triggered a necessary shift in the field towards considering the
contributions of presynaptic mechanisms in addition to postsynaptic mechanisms, thus creating an entirely new
array of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Continuing work in this area will focus on linking presynaptic
defects with abnormalities at the circuit level and the implications of these abnormalities for behavior and
cognition. Sustained funding through this R35 mechanism will support a multipronged approach to these
important neurobiological questions that will maximize the potential for synergy and translational impact."
10828766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Older adults (85 and older), the fastest growing segment of the population, are at very high risk of dementia.
Some minority groups, such as African Americans, are at higher risk of dementia compared to Whites.
However, little is known about the risk factors that might be involved in their high susceptibility to dementia.
Depression, one of the most frequent and debilitating psychiatric conditions in older adults, has been
consistently associated with cognitive decline in Whites. Although depression in African Americans is more
chronic and untreated, compared with Whites, only a handful of studies have investigated the relationship
between depression and cognitive decline in this racial/ethnic group. To our knowledge, this relationship has
not been examined in oldest-old (≥80) African Americans. Chronic inflammation is also associated with both
depression and cognitive decline. Because depression and inflammation are treatable conditions, better
understanding of their role in cognition may lead to reduced dementia risk in this very high risk, growing, and
understudied population.
This study will examine the inter-relationships of depression and inflammation with change in cognition over
time in 192 non-demented community-dwelling oldest-old African Americans. We will examine the following
three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To examine the association between depression measures and cognitive decline
over time. We hypothesize that: a) Depression is related to a greater rate of cognitive decline. b) Based on
compelling preliminary data, apathy is the depression measure hypothesized to be most strongly related to a
greater rate of cognitive decline. Aim 2: To examine the association between baseline inflammation and
cognitive decline. We hypothesize that higher levels of inflammatory cytokines at baseline are related to a
greater rate of cognitive decline. Aim 3: To examine the inter-relationships of depression, inflammation and
cognitive decline. a) We hypothesize that inflammation serves as a moderator in the relationship between
depression and cognitive decline in oldest-old African Americans. If significant results are generated, they can
lead to increasing public awareness about the importance of timely depression diagnosis and development of
mechanism-based effective and well-targeted treatment for the oldest-old community of African Americans,
who are at particularly high-risk for dementia."

Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are the major cause of acute non-bacterial, epidemic gastroenteritis, resulting in
~200,000 deaths/year, mostly in infant, elderly and immunosuppressed groups. HuNoV vaccines are under
development but the results are mixed, in part reflecting antigenic seniority, virus diversity and escape. Our
premise is that the function, epitope specificity and atomic level understanding of the virus type specific and
broadly cross reactive epitopes in the virion that elicit neutralizing antibody will reveal the mechanisms of
protective humoral immunity, which in turn is required for the design of more effective immunogens and
vaccination strategies. Consequently, our program is designed to critically inform the development of broadly
effective HuNoV vaccines that target highly prevalent, medically important genogroup II strains (GII.4 and GII.2).
To achieve these goals, we have relevant time-ordered sample sets from cohorts of vaccinated individuals,
natural infections and human challenge studies which are leveraged throughout the program to elucidate the
fundamental mechanisms governing protective immunity, virus escape and pandemic strain emergence. We
have also assembled a complementary group of renown experts to elucidate the essential issues in HuNoV
serological immunity, identify the key neutralizing epitopes targeted by type specific and broadly protective
immunity, and reveal the molecular mechanisms governing HuNoV neutralization, antigenic seniority and broad
protective immunity. Moreover, the program is designed to translate these novel findings to improved 2nd
generation structure-guided HuNoV vaccine immunogens which are designed to improve the breadth and
durability of humoral immune responses associated with protective immunity. To achieve these goals, the
program has three specific aims. In aim 1, we will define the HuNoV-specific serological antibody repertoire and
produce recombinant antibodies for detailed structure and molecular analyses. In aim 2, we identify type specific
and broadly cross neutralizing antibodies and use molecular approaches to identify key interacting epitopes. In
aim 3, we will solve the atomic level structure of several relevant antibodies with the P domain of the capsid
protein to delineate the structural basis for HBGA blockade and neutralization and use structure-guided
strategies to increase immunogenic breadth and antigen stability, leading to improved vaccine function in vivo."
10806945,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders persist in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART) while HIV latency, and cell-specific expression of HIV transcript in human CNS remains
incompletely understood. There is high prevalence of HIV-associated neurologic disease and increasing
recognition of CNS viral escape in people stably suppressed with cART, often further complicated by the
co-registered epidemic of substance use disorders (SUD) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), as
SUD also have profound impact on CNS function. Ongoing work in our laboratory is providing first
assessments of cell-type specific HIV 'molecular signatures', including genome integration patterns and
alterations on the level of the transcriptome and epigenome in reward- and addiction circuitry of the
human postmortem brain. However, like virtually all other genomic approaches in the field, our ongoing
studies face two massive limitations: (A) Exclusively cross-sectional design, limited to a snapshot of
genome organization and function at a single time point – the time of death of the brain donor. The very
same limitation obviously applies to cell culture and animals. This is extremely unfortunate as such types
of endpoint epigenome and transcriptome mappings in infected and non-infected brain cells cannot inform
about cell-specific chromatin status during earlier periods in the life of the cell (B) Conventional brain
neurogenomics is thus far limited to short read sequencing of chromatin, typically extending 150 base
pairs or less per read. However, it would be much more informative to profile, at base pair resolution,
epigenomic chromatin landscapes across a wider window encompassing full length retroviral insertion
sites, which are two orders of magnitude above current read length. In this Avant-Garde project, we will,
for the first time, for each brain, embark on retrospective/longitudinal epigenomic profiling, using a
xenograft model well established in the HIV field, together with genetically engineered human iPSC-
derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). We will, for the first time, embark on the longitudinal
epigenomic tagging of single chromatin fibers, and explore dynamic changes and even reversibility (or
progressive deterioration) of the epigenomic dysregulation in HIV infected myeloid derived cells residing
in brain and blood."

Career Development: This K01 application describes a 5-year training program to support my career
development as an independent clinician-scientist. My goal is to expand my research experience to achieve my
long-term goal of directing a translational research program in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA)
regeneration. This K01 award will provide me with the guidance and protected time necessary to achieve the
following goals: (1) To complete the studies outlined in Specific Aims 1 and 2. (2) To translate the basic research
findings into clinical applications that can benefit patients with painful and disabling degenerative TMD disorders.
(3) To be actively involved in mentoring the next generation of clinician/scientists, promoting the inclusion of
underrepresented individuals into health professions and craniofacial research. To achieve the listed goals, I
have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts in craniofacial translational research,
musculoskeletal health as well as academic leadership in diversity promotion in the School of Dental Medicine.
Science: TMJ-OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage loss and sclerosis of the
subchondral bone, causing pain and disability. There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutic
interventions that are anabolic for the TMJ which could prevent or reverse degeneration of the TMJ cartilage.
We have identified that the FDA approved treatment, intermittent parathyroid hormone (I-PTH), promotes
anabolic responses in the osteochondral tissues of the TMJ. Our goal is to gain insights into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which these effects are exerted. Our central hypothesis is that FGFR3 is the master
regulator of the anabolic response observed in the TMJ due to I-PTH administration. This hypothesis will be
tested by following specific aims: Specific Aim 1A: To determine the role of FGFR3 signaling in the anabolic
effects of I-PTH administration in the MCC of the TMJ. We will delete FGFR3 in αSMA expressing cells in the
mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC) and determine the effects of FGFR3 loss-of-function with and without I-
PTH. We will also inject a soluble FGFR3 to rescue the FGFR3 conditional deleted to confirm that this signaling
is the master regulator of the effects of I-PTH. Aim 1B: To define the molecular mechanism by which FGFR3
regulates the anabolic effects of I-PTH in vitro. FGFR3 in the primary chondrocytes from the MCC of triple
collagen transgenic reporter mice will be inhibited using RNA silencing and specific FGFR3 inhibitor. Specific
Aim 2: Evaluate the role Intermittent PTH plays in a model of cartilage injury and repair. The MCC of triple
transgenic reporter mice will be injured and animals will receive either injected with I-PTH or saline to understand
the role of I-PTH in early and delayed healing of the MCC."
10791157,"The longstanding paradigm in vaccine development has been the introduction of immunogens that
culminates in generation of pathogen-binding antibodies (Ab). While the precise format of the antigen
presentation differs, all vaccines rely on somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes in B cells to generate
Ab with greater affinity, avidity or anti-pathogen activity. Unfortunately, the natural variations in our immune
system leads to highly variable Ab responses, both in magnitude of the induced Ab response and the
breadth/potencies of the specific Ab clones generated, resulting in variable efficacy. Here, we seek to
overcome these shortcomings by directly reprogramming circulating B cells to secrete specific potent Ab of
interest, including stable integration of Ab-encoding transgenes into circulating B-cells. The resulting chimeric
antibody reprogrammed (CAR) B cells can produce Ab with magnitude, affinity and effector functions that
can all be controlled with molecular/genetic specificity. We refer to this as in vivo engineering of CAR-B cells.
 The key to realizing this vision is a delivery platform that can facilitate highly specific transduction of B-
cells in vivo. We have engineered lentivirus (LV) vectors that effectively transduce circulating immune cells.
Our first-generation system achieved highly specific transduction of circulating T-cells even at very low
virus:cell ratio, and generated substantial CAR-T cells in the circulation and in tumor of immune-deficient NSG
mice with highly aggressive BV173 lymphoma, leading to effective suppression of the tumor and prolonged
survival. We have since improved upon our first-generation system with a second-generation LV system
incorporating the Nipah virus fusion protein. Nipah LV (NLV), coupled with a proprietary combo of
transduction enhancers (TE), efficiently and specifically transduced non-activated B-cells in human PBMCs.
In pilot studies, a single injection of NLV+TE into NSG mice with circulating human PBMCs lead to effective
transduction of >0.5% of all circulating B-cells. We have also demonstrated we can harness CRISPR/Cas9 to
insert Ab transgene into a well conserved site in B cells, leading to functional B cells that can react to antigens.
 In this proposal, we seek to perform key enabling studies that substantiate our proposed CAR-B
strategy. In Aim 1, we will engineer NLV that targets different B-cell populations, and identify the combination
of NLV and TE that maximizes transduction of key human B-cells. We will then assess delivery of transgene
encoding for a potent RSV neutralizing Ab (nAb) either by non-specific integration or site-specific integration.
We will then advance into animal studies in Aim 2, where we will assess transduction efficiency and specificity
in NSG mice infused with circulating human PBMCs. We will quantify for the levels of the nAb in serum over
time, and assess protection against infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). If successful, our work
will advance an alternative strategy for achieving highly tunable immune protection in cases where specificity
of the variable domain or Ab isotype is essential, or in individuals who do not respond to traditional vaccination."
10791113,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cell replacement therapies are one of the best options for multifactorial diseases of the retina like aged
related macular degeneration (AMD), which normally cannot be treated by correcting mutations in individual
genes. The retina is also highly surgically accessible, allowing stem cell derived neurons to be precisely
transplanted and tracked post-operatively. While transplant therapies into the retina are ongoing, including
Phase I human trials, success has been limited due to the inability of photoreceptors (PRs) to integrate
properly into complex existing circuits. One potential means to improve PR integration is to transplant
genetically modified PRs that have enhanced ability to extend processes and form synapses. We recently
found that stem cell derived PRs have a limited time they are capable of autonomous axon extension, which
correlated with a loss of an organized actin cytoskeleton within their terminals and an upregulation of synaptic
proteins (Rempel et al., 2022). This result suggests that PRs become immobile due to their decreased ability to
polymerize and organize actin, which is essential for cell and growth cone motility. Therefore, identifying age-
dependent molecular changes that account for the loss of actin filaments and decreased PR terminal motility
would provide potential targets to potentiate intrinsic PR terminal motility. Transplanting more motile older PRs
that also express synaptic proteins could greatly improve circuit integration. It also should be noted that even
young human PRs only extend axons an average of 20 um in isolation, so methods to improve terminal motility
at any age could help restore circuits in the adult retina. Transplantation of “motility enhanced” PRs could
greatly improve their integration into existing circuits. Here we propose a series of innovative experiments to
first test likely upstream modulators that may be lost as PRs mature within retinal organoids (ROs). Next, we
will conduct an unbiased proteomic screen of protein expression changes within PRs across relevant time
points. Candidates will be tested to determine if PR actin dynamics, terminal motility and axon extension can
be enhanced by increasing the activity of key proteins that show age-dependent loss of expression."
10790755,"Among more than 180 types of RNA modification, ribose 2’-O methylation (or called Nm, where N stands for any nucleotide) is the second most abundant. In 2’-O methylation, a methyl group is added to the 2' hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of a nucleoside. There are two types of Nm, the cap Nm which is the 2’-O methylation on the 5’ mRNA cap structure, and the internal Nm which occurs in the body of an RNA molecule. Cap Nm is extensively studied and its function is known. However, the enzymatic activities and biological functions of internal Nm are currently unknown. Viral RNA modification is a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. In addition to the 5’ cap guanine N-7 methylation and ribose 2’-O methylation (cap Nm), SARS-CoV-2 RNA is heavily epigenetically modified. We recently developed a high throughput Nm-Mut-seq technique allowing for mapping internal Nm sites at a single base resolution. Using this technique, we found for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures and Vero-E6 cells contains 24 and 11 internal Nm sites, respectively. Thus, the goal of this R21 project is to identify enzymes that install internal Nm sites in SARS-CoV-2 RNA and to explore the biological functions of internal Nm sites in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In Aim 1, we will determine if any known host RNA 2’-O methyltransferase (MTase) or viral nsp16 protein (the only known viral RNA cap 2’-O MTase) installs Nm on SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As a parallel strategy, we will also use RNA affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics to identify this unknown 2’-O MTase. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that internal Nm in SARS-CoV-2 RNA increases RNA stability, enhances mRNA translation, and prevents viral RNA from being recognized by host innate immunity. The Nm sites in viral RNA will be mutated and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking internal Nm will be recovered using a SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system. The effects of internal Nm on viral RNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune response will be determined. This project will have an impact because it will not only fill a major gap in our understanding of the biological functions of internal Nm in SARS-CoV-2 RNA but will also facilitate the development of therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 by targeting internal Nm."
10931732,"Project Summary/Abstract. Electronic cigarettes are gaining popularity as alternative to traditional cigarettes,
with sales increasing from $283 million in 2012 to $2.5 billion in 2018 in the US. The global e-cigarette market is
estimated to reach $24.2 billion by 2024. E-cigarette solutions, also known as e-liquids, are highly variable with
enticing flavors, such as tobacco, menthol, fruit, candy, and dessert. Liquid nicotine concentrations vary in these
products from 0 to 100 mg/ml according to an FDA study. Although nicotine toxicity in adults is rare with an
estimated lethal dose between 60 and 500 mg (0.8-6.7 mg/kg), flavored e-liquids are increasingly being ingested
orally, putting children at risk for exposure to high concentrations of nicotine. Indeed, nicotine toxicity in children
under 5 years of age can occur with consumption of as little as a teaspoon of liquid nicotine. The unforeseen
consequences of e-cigarettes, with respect to nicotine poisoning in children, presents an unmet need to
counteract the harmful and potentially fatal outcomes that may occur among this vulnerable population. It is the
pediatric population we plan to address in this proposal, as a high potential of accidental ingestion of liquid
nicotine from e-cigarettes exists. Despite the increase in nicotine-related poisonings reported, there is no
treatment for acute nicotine toxicity. Current treatment regimens for nicotine poisoning range from supportive
care, to activated charcoal, to respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. An alternative means of altering
the toxicity of nicotine poisoning could come via simple sequestering of the drug. Antibodies to nicotine have
been prepared as a means to block the pharmacological effects of this drug. To date, vaccines for smoking
cessation have shown promise in preclinical animal models; however, in clinical studies, these vaccines failed
to measure significant differences in smoking abstinence between the intervention and placebo groups. Thus,
the likelihood of an antibody attenuating an acute dose of nicotine is doubtful. What is needed is a sufficient
pharmacokinetic (PK) biologic with the capacity to not just sequester nicotine but also increase its metabolism.
We envision a biologic able to catabolize nicotine rather than simply sequestering the drug would have the
potential to treat acute nicotine poisoning. The proposal at hand details a bacterial strain, Pseudomonas putida,
which has evolved to use nicotine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen. From this bacterial strain, we will
examine a first-in-class enzyme, a nicotine oxidoreductase termed NicA2, as a means to treat nicotine poisoning.
Our initial characterization of the enzyme indicates that it could be an excellent candidate for altering nicotine
poisoning. However, the successful demonstration of this enzyme reversing nicotine poisoning will require
several experimental undertakings including: (1) Evaluating the efficacy of NicA2 to attenuate acute nicotine
toxicity in rodent models including plethysmography, blood/brain distribution and lethality. (2) Directed evolution
of NicA2 to increase its catalytic capacity through gene recombination and random mutagenesis."
10910201,"Project Summary: The Rocky Mountain Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RMRBL) must maintain
excellence in biosafety and biosecurity to fulfill its charge of responding to public health and potential
bioterrorism emergencies. Updating, modernizing, and continuously improving the biosafety and
biosecurity program at the RMRBL ensures that researchers can effectively contribute to the important
mission of the RBL network. This BSL-3 Practices Core will facilitate the long-term goals for sustaining
high quality biosafety and biosecurity in the RMRBL through three overarching aims. Aim 1- Continuous
evolution of biosafety and biosecurity for a dynamic research environment is critical for protecting
researchers, the community, and the environment. Efforts supported by this funding will include
modernizing current training using universal design principles and evidence-based teaching strategies
for improved retention. New feedback mechanisms will be developed to promote regular updates to
training based on ever-changing research needs. Emergency response and crisis management training
will be amplified so personnel are better equipped to automatically react according to standard operating
procedures. This includes coordinating with external emergency management partners for live scenarios
and table-top exercises. Aim 2- Enhancing biosecurity through modernization of physical and
administrative infrastructure will bring current RMRBL biosecurity systems up to date and provide a robust
framework for a comprehensive biosecurity program. Keeping up with rapid changes in information
technology and global interconnectedness is an increasing challenge. Through this project, the RMRBL
biosecurity program will undergo physical security upgrades and administrative support expansion.
Considering the increased public awareness of high containment laboratory research, proactive changes
to the RMRBL biosecurity program will facilitate adaptation in the face of a changing regulatory
environment. This is essential for constant readiness in line with the mission of the RBL network. Aim 3-
Strengthening administrative controls for alignment with biosafety and biosecurity best practices will build
safety culture among RMRBL personnel. In synergy with Aim 1, standard operating procedures (SOPs),
plans, policies, practices, and inventory systems will be strategically reviewed and updated with an
emphasis on researcher comprehension and ease of use. Developing consistent feedback mechanisms
for users about the effectiveness of administrative controls will increase buy-in. New ideas for improving
RMRBL processes will be gathered during personnel exchanges with other RBL network biosafety teams.
Additionally, biosafety and biosecurity best practices will be reinforced through systematic investigation
of the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. In sum, this core will ensure that biosafety and biosecurity
at the RMRBL is contemporary and flexible to adequately support the mission of the RBL network."
10910203,"Project Summary: RMRBL UC7 Core 3
The Rocky Mountain Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RMRBL) was conceived concomitant
with a Research Center for Excellence in Biodefense / Emerging Infectious Diseases. The
outcome of these synergized investments in infrastructure and research was a multidisciplinary
team of investigators and core research services. The RMRBL’s ability to respond to emerging
and persistent pathogen threats are due to our collective understanding of pathogen
characteristics, pathogenesis of infection, immunity and host range. Our prolific history of rapid
response to high consequence pathogens posing a threat to public and socioeconomic health is
due not only to the diverse strengths of the resident investigator teams, but also our ability to
conduct these important studies in BSL3 facilities. Specifically, the CSU RMRBL has strengths in
defining and optimizing in vitro culture conditions for pathogens and pathogen inactivation,
establishing the requisite animal models to investigate wildlife and domestic animal spillover
events and reservoir potential, and vaccine models using both viable and inactivated infectious
materials produced in vitro. Further, the CSU RMRBL has expertise in cutting-edge technologies
to study microbial physiology and animal models; such as conducting proteomic and
metabolomics mass spectrometry analyses, detailed histopathologic analyses using spatial
transcriptomics and AI-driven quantitative pathology scoring. Lastly, our collective research teams
have established programs for supplying biological reagents that can be robustly used for animal
and human clinical research, including inactivated biomaterials that can be safely and
reproducibly used outside the BSL3. In this Core, we culminate our collective strengths into one
Biocontainment Research Resources Core within the BSL3 facilities of the RMRBL. This resultant
pathogen characterization core devises our capacity through independent and highly interactive
aims; Aim 1: Natural reservoirs of infection and spillover threat for pathogens of pandemic
potential; Aim 2: Reagents and models for vaccine and diagnostics studies for pathogens of
pandemic potential; and Aim 3: Pathogen:Host materials processing for molecular mass
spectrometry imaging and single cell ‘omics analyses.
The RMRBL BSL3 Pathogen Characterization core provides opportunities to synergize activities,
expand our resources across the RBL network and to additional partners, forge new technologies
within the RMRBL BSL3, and ultimately improve our ability to adapt and rapidly deliver research
resources acutely responsive to pathogens possessing a threat to our health systems."
10910200,"SUMMARY (OVERALL):
The University of Louisville Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) is operated by the University Center for
Predictive Medicine for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (CPM). The RBL is a regional resource
that facilitates translational research to develop diagnostics, prognostics, therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate
biodefense and emerging infectious disease threats. Our Center operates the only BSL-3 and ABSL-3 facilities
currently operating in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The CPM mandate is to prepare for and respond to public
health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The broad, long-range objectives and goals of the University of Louisville (UofL) CPM RBL are:
1. To offer state-of-the-art research services to the regional and national biomedical research community to
 learn from past pandemics and biological warfare experiences and effectively predict and mitigate future
 emerging infectious disease threats.
2. To manage, maintain and operate the UofL RBL to serve the national and regional need for biocontainment
 facilities suitable for research on Risk Group 3 pathogens and other biothreats.
3. To follow a philosophy of continuous improvement in BSL-3 and ABSL-3 work practices and to ensure that
 all personnel who need to access BSL-3 and ABSL-3 containment laboratories are appropriately trained and
 prepared to serve the national and regional need for biocontainment research professionals.
To achieve these aims we propose to establish three collaborative Cores. The Facilities Management
Maintenance and Operations Core (FMMO Core) is responsible for ensuring that the facility is always available
to meet the research and emergency preparedness mission of the RBL. The BSL-3 Practices and Workforce
Development Core (BSL-3PWD Core) formalizes our mentor-mentee training plan to ensure our laboratory is
staffed with BSL-3 research professionals who are proficient at biocontainment research professionals. This core
responds to the reality that response to rapidly emerging public health emergencies like COVID-19 is limited by
the number of available BSL-3 trained and experienced research professionals. Our Pandemic Preparedness
and Response Integrated Research Core (PaPR Core) responds to the substantially increased requests for our
BSL-3 research services by organizing an integrated full-service BSL-3 research support function to support
investigator needs. These cores will work in unison to achieve the CPM mission: to prepare for and respond to
public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic."

Older populations in low and middle income countries are often highly dependent on children and other family
members for their economic and physical wellbeing. Elders’ housing and households, however, may be
adversely impacted by extreme climate events. Extreme rainfall events have already produced more frequent
major coastal urban flooding events in India. Its four largest coastal cities, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and
Surat, each experienced extreme flooding events in 2005-2007. Although these extreme flooding events were
closely spaced relative to each other, they were each at the time they struck the largest flooding event either of
the past three or four decades (Kolkata, Surat) or in recorded meteorological history (Mumbai, Chennai). The
2005-2007 events coincidentally occurred between two successive survey data collection waves of a major
panel survey of Indian households, the India Human Development Survey (IHDS). We use pre- and post-flood
IHDS panel observation in a decomposition analysis of flood impacts on disability and chronic morbidity
acquisition among individuals age 50 and above. Informed by a social-vulnerability theoretical framework, this
decomposition analysis uses as predictors both pre-flood socio-demographic and economic characteristics and
pre-flood to post-flood housing condition changes, residential mobility, and living arrangement changes. The
aims of the study are to estimate India’s urban older population’s: (1) acquisition of disability and chronic
morbidity associated with experiencing an extreme coastal-urban flooding event; (2) housing and living
arrangement change, kin proximity, and individual and household mobility associated with the flooding events;
(3) extent to which changes in housing, living arrangements, and individual and household mobility were
mechanisms responsible for acquisition of disability and chronic morbidity; and (4) disparities in adverse
impacts on health and family-household stability by pre-flooding individual, family, and household socio-
economic and socio-demographic characteristics. The substantive findings and methodological developments
of the study are expected to have generalizabilty for examining threats to elders’ health and wellbeing from
extreme climate events globally."
10799894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25-30% of US adults and has a major impact on healthcare
burden and population health due to higher morbidity and mortality than the general population. Even though
NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis, decompensation, and liver cancer, these outcomes affect a small proportion
of patients, but there are no accurate methods that are accessible in primary care to identify these patients
early. The heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes, lack of universal screening, and risk-stratification approaches
lead to delayed diagnosis, phenotype-specific prophylactic or therapeutic intervention, and poor patient
outcomes. The long-term goal is to develop easily accessible methods for NAFLD screening and prediction of
disease trajectory. The objective of this application is to leverage large electronic health record (EHR) datasets
and analytics to enhance the early identification of NAFLD in general healthcare settings. The central
hypothesis is that targeted screening with machine-learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) models applied to
longitudinal healthcare data (diagnoses, laboratory values, medications, anthropometrics, demographics) can
identify predictors of NAFLD risk and, subsequently, a progressive phenotype toward liver events. The
rationale that underlies the proposed research is that EHR-based clinical algorithms which identify NAFLD and
phenotype the disease trajectory will guide clinicians in selecting patients who need liver-related diagnostic
evaluation and enable timely intervention to prevent hard outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, the
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. In Aim 1, a predictive model for NAFLD will be
developed using retrospective data from a population-based EHR-linkage system with validated diagnosed
NAFLD and non-NAFLD controls by chart review. Among those with NAFLD, an EHR-based model to predict a
clinical phenotype at risk for future liver-related events or death will be developed, using death from other
causes as competing risk. In Aim 2, the two models will be validated and calibrated to screen for NAFLD in the
population and to predict a liver phenotype at early stage (steatohepatitis or stage≥2 fibrosis). In this aim, the
cohort will be prospectively enrolled from the community to undergo NAFLD screening by magnetic resonance
imaging and assessment of liver disease severity by biopsy. Lastly, an AI-based NAFLD care model using the
predictive models introduced in the EHR system will be implemented in the primary care practice to measure
impact on disease identification and management. The approach is innovative because it expands the
analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods and challenges the current clinical paradigm which targets
only late-stage liver disease identification. These multimodal EHR-based algorithms of NAFLD screening and
clinical phenotyping will serve as scalable and unbiased clinical decision-making tools that enable
personalized intervention, thereby fulfilling a critical unmet need in the healthcare burden of NAFLD."
10800032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is now the 2nd leading cause of death among children ages 10-14 (CDC, 2022). This proposal responds
to this public health crisis by testing an intergenerational mechanistic model of suicide risk in children while
simultaneously testing a prevention and intervention approach that could be immediately useful. We focus on
children whose mothers have a history of suicidal behavior (intent, planning, attempt) as an especially vulnerable
group with increased risk for an early and persistent course of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). Theory
and research point to emotion regulation (ER) as a potential intergenerational mechanism of suicide risk
transmission from mother to child. Maternal ER affects child ER development via maternal emotion socialization,
whereby maternal responses to child’s emotions (validating/supportive vs. invalidating/unsupportive) shape how
the child identifies, expresses, and modulates their emotions. We theorize that maternal ER, a prerequisite for
optimal maternal emotion socialization, serves as a clinically and etiologically significant pathway through which
maternal history of suicidal behavior impacts the continued development of child ER and emerging STB and
other mental health problems into adolescence. This proposal maximizes impact by leveraging a randomized
controlled trial of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills Training to improve maternal ER and testing a
mechanistic model of suicide risk transmission from mothers to their children during a critical developmental
juncture for the emergence and rapid accelaration of STB and other mental health problems. Mothers will be
randomized (1:1) to 6 months of either DBT Skills Training or Treatment As Usual (TAU), with expectation that
mothers with a history of suicidal behavior + ER difficulties who are randomly assigned to DBT Skills Training
will experience improvements in ER relative to mothers assigned to TAU. We hypothesize that DBT skills-driven
improvements in maternal ER will predict meaningful decreases in child STB from late childhood into early
adolescence through improved maternal emotion socialization and subsequent improvements in child ER. We
will enroll 250 mother-child dyads with children ages 9-11 across mother-child dyads. Dyads will complete
repeated multimodal assessments of maternal and ER, maternal emotion socialization, and child STB and other
mental health problems over 24 months: baseline (intervention initiation), 3 months (intervention mid-point) 6
months (intervention termination), 12- and 24-months (post-intervention follow-up) when children will be ages
11-13, a high-risk time for STB emergence and the onset of other mental health problems. Additionally, in families
with two caregivers, fathers/other caregivers will be invited to complete an assessment battery measuring history
of suicidal behavior and psychopathology, ER, and emotion socialization to support an exploratory examination
of these influences on child outcomes. Findings from this study will identify intergenerational mechanisms of
suicide risk and provide an intervention and prevention model for mitigating suicide risk in mother-child dyads."
10798534,"Language deficits after stroke resolve to different degrees across individuals. In previous funding cycles we
have characterized distinct mechanisms of recovery, including restoration of blood flow to dysfunctional brain
tissue surrounding the infarct and reorganization of networks (brain regions or their connections) underlying
specific language functions. We have previously focused on mechanisms of recovery of naming and spoken
word comprehension. Here we propose to characterize mechanisms of recovery of discourse comprehension,
reading, and spelling (functions that are increasingly critical in a society dependent on internet use such as
online banking and shopping, email, texting, and so on) in each individual with aphasia over the course of one
year. In addition, we will evaluate the use of compensation by learning to accomplish the function in a different
way or using different modalities to communicate, as another mechanism of recovery. We will use longitudinal
structural and perfusion imaging, along with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and language
assessments twice within 10 days of stroke onset (once before and once after intervention to restore blood
flow or 3 days after initial testing in cases of no intervention) and again at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
after acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke. Furthermore, we propose to identify variables that predict
recovery through each mechanism. We will determine which demographic, imaging, and genetic factors
influence the success of each mechanism. Results will allow clinicians to focus treatment strategies on the
mechanisms most likely to be successful for an individual. Thus, the brain imaging and behavioral data
together will help us achieve another important clinical goal, aligned with the mission of NIDCD, to improve
prognosis for aphasia recovery at an individual level. Identifying lesion and brain health characteristics,
polymorphisms of the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor allele, selective serotonin receptor antagonists
(SSRIs), demographic factors, pre-stroke written language use information, and use of compensatory
strategies that independently contribute to aphasia recovery will allow us to better predict who is likely to
achieve the greatest recovery and under what conditions. These results will also provide the critical basis for
individualized aphasia rehabilitation. We will test our hypotheses in a racially and socioeconomically diverse
population of people with post-stroke aphasia, which is essential to allow generalization of findings to improve
management of a wide range of people with aphasia (PWA)."
10798782,"Summary
This is a resubmission of the competitive renewal of the ongoing R01 grant. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is
an important tool that can be used to better understand visual plasticity. The long-term goal is to comprehensively
understand the mechanisms of VPL and their underlying plasticity, which may provide important information for
the development of training and rehabilitation tools and programs for improving and restoring damaged, declining
or degraded vision. This proposal aims to examine the roles of global processing, such as reward and arousal,
in the specificity of VPL, which is one of the most important characteristics of VPL. VPL is generally characterized
as specific to the trained feature and the retinal location in which the feature is presented, minimally transferring
to other features or locations. The specificity of VPL may impose serious restrictions on the use of VPL in clinical
applications that require generalized effects in everyday life. Early studies suggested that the specificity of VPL
comes from properties of neurons in early visual areas. However, later studies indicate that the specificity is
greatly influenced by global processing that does not originate in early visual areas. The current proposal aims
to examine the roles of global processing such as reward and arousal in the generalizability and specificity of
VPL. No research has ever been conducted to test whether and how reward and arousal each influence the
generalizability/specificity of VPL. There are two types of VPL. Task-irrelevant VPL (TIVPL) refers to the learning
resulting from passive exposure to a task-irrelevant feature or object, whereas task-relevant VPL (TRVPL) refers
to the learning of a task-relevant feature or object through a given task. Significantly different mechanisms may
underlie these two types of VPL. Thus, the abovementioned questions will be addressed for TIVPL and TRVPL
in Specific Aims 1 and 2, respectively. Our preliminary results consistently suggest the following aspects: (1)
Arousal plays a role in generalizing the trained feature or object to untrained features or untrained objects within
the same category of the trained object, whereas reward is not involved in the generalization of VPL and rather
plays a role in inducing the specificity of VPL. (2) Generalization due to arousal is not involved in reinforcement
processing, which may play an important role in the specificity of VPL due to reward. The information that will be
obtained from the research results is expected to be important for the development of a clinical training method,
for which the generalization of VPL is crucial. We will test the following hypotheses by psychophysics.
Hypothesis (H)1: Reward plays a role in increasing the specificity of TIVPL and TRVPL. H2: Arousal plays a
role in increasing the generalizability of TIVPL and TRVPL. H3: H1 and H2 are valid for both VPL of a primitive
feature and VPL of an object. H4: Reinforcement processing is involved in the role that reward plays in the
specificity of TIVPL and TRVPL, whereas it is not involved in the role of arousal in the generalizability of TIVPL
and TRVPL."

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular genetic disorder characterized by enlarged, leaky
small vessels (telangiectasias) and inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called
arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). HHT patients develop AVMs in a specific subset of major organs, which
can rupture causing severe hemorrhage and anemia, as well as aneurysms, stroke and even death. Causes of
HHT are linked to the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway, with over 90% of patients
exhibiting heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (Acvrl1/Alk1) or Endoglin
(Eng) co-receptors, or the downstream transcription factor, Smad-related protein 4 (Smad4). Despite knowing
the causative mutations, a significant gap remains in our understanding of the immediate TGF-beta downstream
signaling components responsible for HHT pathologies. Furthermore, no cure is currently available for HHT. We
have found that directly downstream of Alk1, Eng and Smad4 loss-of-function, the angiogenic factor and
antagonistic ligand to the Tie2 receptor, angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2/ANG2), is transcriptionally elevated to trigger
HHT vascular pathologies; ANG2 neutralization efficiently reduced AVM pathology in two HHT mouse models.
In addition, loss of Alk1 signaling led to a robust and consistent transcriptional and signaling inhibition of
Tek/Tie2. Together, these observations strongly support the working model that ANG2 is elevated and Tie2
signaling is repressed during the pathogenic process of AVM development in HHT. Moreover, the metabolic
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is deregulated in HHT to sustain AVM development, however its connection to ANG2
pro-AVM signals is unclear. Using mouse models of the different genetic forms of HHT and primary endothelial
cells (ECs), we have obtained strong pilot data indicating that ANG2-Tie2 deregulations, working in concert with
enhanced FoxO1 transcriptional activity and sequential overactivation of the mTOR pathway via CXCR4
chemokine signaling, drive HHT phenotypes. The central objective of this application is to answer 3 fundamental
questions: 1) how does ANG2 elevation and Tie2 signaling repression direct AVM pathogenesis, 2) what is the
mechanism by which mTOR overactivation is controlled by ANG2-Tie2 signaling deregulations and 3) are
approaches targeting ANG2 and the newly identified ANG2-regulated pathogenic signaling cascade universally
effective in treating HHT vascular pathologies? We will address these topics by testing the following specific
aims: 1) Assess ANG2 and Tie2 signaling deregulations in the most physiologically affected organs and
determine if ANG2 inhibition universally blocks vascular pathologies in HHT mouse models; 2) Determine FoxO1
contributions to ANG2 and CXCR4 elevations and HHT vascular pathologies; and 3) Test if TGF-beta-Tie2-
FoxO1-mediated CXCR4 elevations drive mTOR activation. These studies will advance our mechanistic
understanding of AVM pathogenesis and uncover new potential targets for treating of HHT."

Juxtacrine signaling mediates cell-cell communications via direct molecular interactions at the signaling
interface, during development, synapse formation and remodeling, immune activities, and tissue formation.
Despite increasing knowledge of these signaling events, little is known about how the juxtacrine receptors
sense and regulate cell signaling in response to the dynamic changes of its surrounding cells. The challenge of
interrogating spatiotemporal dynamics of juxtacrine cell-cell signaling stems from the fact that many juxtacrine
receptors integrate chemical, spatial, and mechanical cues to differentially regulate cell signaling. To
deconstruct and decode the working mechanisms of these receptors with high spatiotemporal complexity, new
technology tools allowing manipulation of the individual cues with different modes of stimulation, while
reporting cellular responses with high spatiotemporal precision. Toward this aim, we previously developed
nanotechnology platforms including monovalent quantum dot (mQD) probes, mechanogenetics, nanoruler
force microscopy (NRFM), and magnetically amplified protein-protein interaction (MAP-I) tools. mQDs report
single molecule trajectories of the targeted receptors, providing its dynamic spatial and diffusion properties
precisely. Mechanogenetics allows us to manipulate chemical, spatial, and mechanical properties of the
targeted receptors, while monitoring cellular responses to the respective cues. NRFM enables us to investigate
force-responsive structural changes of the target receptors, and hence provides important insights into the
mechanism of mechanotransduction. MAP-I allows for ultrasensitive detection of protein-protein interactions
through magnetic amplification, enabling identification of weak protein-protein interactions that have not been
possible with any other technologies. By using these new technologies, here, we propose to investigate the
interaction and signaling dynamics of Notch and Neuroligin, key signaling proteins in development and
synaptic function, respectively. Ultimately, we aim to provide a platform technology for the systematic
investigation of operating principles for a wide range of juxtacrine signaling, accelerating our understanding of
cell-cell communication."

The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is a member of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein family that
regulates adaptive and toxic responses to a variety of chemical pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD). We observed that the newly identified endogenous AhR agonist, cinnabarinic acid (CA) does not
upregulate prototypical AhR target gene, Cyp1a1 and is not involved in xenobiotic regulation. On contrary, CA
induced expression of a novel AhR target gene, stanniocalcin 2 (Stc2) in liver. Our studies indicate that in
response to CA-treatment, AhR interacted dichotomously to xenobiotic response elements (XREs, 5'-GCGTG-
3') present within the Stc2 promoter regulating its expression. Additionally, this proposal capitalizes on our
recent observation that CA treatment protected against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in an AhR-dependent
manner. The in vitro model that mimics fatty liver disease, showed significant role of STC2 in CA-specific AhR-
driven hepatoprotection. Moreover, we recently constructed hepatocyte-specific Stc2 conditional knockout
mice (Stc2-hKO) which showed exacerbated hepatic steatosis and metabolic deterioration. The studies
proposed in this renewal application are logical extension of our current award and hypothesize that the CA-
specific AhR-regulated hepatic STC2 signaling plays critical role in attenuation of lipogenesis resulting in
protection against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Using the Stc2-hKO mice, Specific Aim 1 of this application
will investigate role of in vivo STC2 signaling in AhR-mediated protection against steatohepatitis in response to
CA treatment. Specific Aim 2 will utilize lipidomics and single-nuclei transcriptomics to characterize CA-specific
STC2 mediated hepatoprotective pathways involved in the mitigation of lipogenesis. Specific Aim 3 will
investigate AhR-mediated regulation of Stc2 promoter in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The current
application will unravel mechanism of transcription regulation of Stc2 by CA-specific AhR activation and
characterize its significance against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
10804602,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Elevated psychosocial stress – a hallmark of modern, fast-paced societies – has been repeatedly associated
with altered immune function and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but the mechanisms underlying
these associations are unclear. DNA methylation, one of the critical and most studied epigenetic processes in
humans, has emerged as a key link between environmental exposures and human health. Our long-term
goal is to elucidate the epigenetic and other molecular mechanisms through which psychosocial stress
contributes to atherosclerotic disease. The overall objective of this application is to define the methylomic
differences associated with stress both in whole blood and in distinct immune cell types and to determine how
these differences can shape immune function and predict CHD risk. The central hypothesis is that stress
drives methylomic patterns that epigenetically upregulate proinflammatory and other immune mediators across
distinct blood cell types, thereby contributing to incident CHD. The rationale for this application is that determining
stress-associated epigenomic patterns and their functional sequelae in peripheral blood immune cells can yield
novel composite predictors and molecular targets that can be leveraged to enhance CHD prevention and
treatment. The central hypothesis will be tested by combining large-scale analyses in human cohorts and
mechanistic investigations in cell models. Three distinct but complementary specific aims will be pursued: 1)
Identify stress-associated methylomic profiles in whole blood that predict incident CHD; 2) Define cell type-
specific methylomic patterns that are associated with stress and predict CHD; and 3) Mechanistically dissect
how stress epigenetically regulates monocyte function in culture. Aims 1 and 2 will leverage multiple large cohort
studies that participate in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program and have suitable
psychosocial stress, whole-blood DNA methylation, and/or incident CHD data. Cell type-specific methylomic
patterns will be deconvoluted using cutting-edge computational methods recently developed by the research
team. Key epigenetic signals will be mechanistically dissected using cell models of monocytes and monocyte-
derived macrophages undergoing exposure to physiological levels of stress hormones and targeted DNA
methylation editing in culture. This interdisciplinary proposal is innovative as it will integrate large-scale
association efforts that apply novel computational methods across multiple TOPMed studies with cutting-edge
mechanistic work in immune cell models. The proposed research is significant as it is expected to yield innovative
epigenetic predictors and actionable molecular targets that can be leveraged to enhance prevention and
treatment of stress-associated CHD."
10804603,"Most studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology have examined a single, putative causative
domain. In this proposed study of MDD pathogenesis, we will evaluate relationships between three path-
ogenic domains related to MDD, that are largely unknown because these three domains have never been
studied together in a single depressed population. The domains are: neuroinflammation, serotonergic
dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This project is a cross-sectional study that will directly assess
brain functioning in all three pathophysiologic domains by using positron emission tomography (PET) to measure
neuroinflammation and 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding, and near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) to measure mito-
chondrial function, in MDD (N=45) and healthy volunteers (HV; N=20). A third-generation, high-affinity PET
tracer, [11C]ER176, will measure binding to translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of glial activation and mito-
chondrial function. Brain mitochondrial function also will be assessed with transcranial near infrared spectros-
copy (NIRS). PET with [11C]WAY-100635 will quantify 5-HT1A autoreceptors which regulate serotonin neuron
firing and release. Brain measures will be compared between MDD and HV groups and within MDD as they
relate to depression severity. Brain indices also will be correlated with peripheral blood measures, which will
include kynurenine pathway components, a panel of cyto/chemokines, and the mitochondrial health index (MHI),
a scalar measure of peripheral mitochondrial function. This rich dataset will be used to generate descriptive
models of interrelationships between pathophysiologic domains and the relative correlation of each domain with
depressive symptom severity. Exploratory analyses will seek to identify subgroups of patients who exhibit do-
main-specific pathology.
AIM 1: Compare 45 unmedicated, depressed, non-psychotic DSM5 MDD patients with 20 HVs, on neuroinflam-
matory, serotonergic and mitochondrial effects measured in vivo in brain. Determine correlations of brain
measures with MDD severity in the MDD group. AIM 2: In the same groups from Aim 1, determine the relation-
ships of brain TSPO binding and oxCOX activity to the respective peripheral measures of neuroinflammation
and mitochondrial functioning. blood cyto/chemokines, kynurenine pathway components, and the mitochondrial
health index (MHI). AIM 3: Develop descriptive models.
This study is innovative in combining assessment of neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and 5-
HT autoreceptor binding in a single set of subjects, in using a third-generation TSPO radiotracer, and in
employing novel NIRS and MHI methodologies. The research team has a strong record of translational re-
search with all proposed modalities and is equiped to carry out this proposed study. Findings from this study
would have potential to unify major theories of depression pathophysiology, and guide the development of new,
more individualized treatment approaches."

In this grant we propose three aims focused on exploring the following: (Aim 1) Determine the
efferent target selectivity of granular and infragranular SST cINs and determine the developmental
strategy by which this is achieved. (Aim 2) Explore the developmental molecular and cellular
basis by which SST cIN diversity is generated. (Aim 3) Identify and validate the SST prototypes
during late embryonic and early developmental periods that give rise to the nine SST cIN cell
types that populate the mature cortex.
 A chief goal of my laboratory is to determine cortical interneuron diversity contributes
selectively to cortical function and how perturbations in these programs result in brain disease.
This grant is an exemplar of the multidisciplinary approaches that has become our hallmark and
combines individuals with skills ranging from molecular biology, transcriptomic analysis, genetics
and physiology. By combining these with the Fishell laboratory's expertise in development,
genetics and circuit formation, we will explore in this proposal how developmental programs in
SST cINs shape them selective synaptic connectivity.
 Together, this grant represents a broad scale effort to both develop and test the
proposition that cortical circuits are much more precisely crafted such that the bewildering
diversity we have discovered in excitatory and inhibitory neurons reflects a level of circuit
organization that we are only beginning to understand. From our preliminary data it is evident
that canonical cortical circuits are much more precise and specific to particular subtypes. By
defining their relationships, as well as the molecular mechanisms that dictate their synaptic
specificity, this work will greatly increase both our understanding of cINs, as well as the
microcircuits they contribute to. This in turn will greatly extend our understanding of how
discrete cIN and pyramidal neurons interact in the obligate lock and key mechanisms that allow
their assembly."

Modifier genes are responsible for the diverse phenotypes among Gaucher disease (GD) patients harboring
identical GBA1 mutations. Thus, identification and characterization of new modifier genes in GD will provide
invaluable information for understanding the pathogenesis of GD and discovering novel therapeutic targets for
GD. We identified progranulin (PGRN), encoded by the gene GRN, as a key modifier of GCase through direct
interaction and stimulation of GCase activity. During the original funding period, we generated Grn-/-GbaD409v/null
(termed PG9Vn) mice. Initial assays of PG9Vn mice demonstrated that PGRN deficiency markedly exacerbated
GD phenotypes. Importantly, PG9Vn mice developed significant neuronopathic GD (nGD). There is an urgent
medical need for treating nGD, since Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy
(SRT) for GD cannot penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). Excitingly, a PGRN C-terminal domain, ND7, could
cross the BBB and act to increase endogenous CNS GCase activity and exhibit potential therapeutic effects
against nGD. Further, we isolated C5a as a novel binding partner of PGRN. PGRN inhibited C5a/C5aR1
signaling by blocking the binding of C5a to C5aR1; deletion of C5aR1 reversed the GD phenotypes seen in
ovalbumin-challenged Grn-/- mice. Intriguingly, PGRN N-terminal domain mediates PGRN’s interaction with C5a
and may act as an SRT through inhibition of C5a/C5aR1 activated UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase,
leading to the suppression of GCase substrate glucosylceramide production. Thus, this continued application is
primarily based on 1) the generation of new PG9Vn model and discovery of PGRN derived ND7 as a BBB-
penetrating biologic, 2) the isolation of PGRN as an antagonist of C5a/C5aR1 signaling, and 3) the finding that
PGRN’s N-terminal and C-terminal domains have SRT- and ERT-like activities, respectively. The central
hypothesis of this renewal is that PGRN is a key modifier in GD and its derivatives are therapeutic against GD.
The Specific Aims are: (1) To determine the importance of PGRN/GBA1 mutation interplay in GD in vivo and to
evaluate the therapeutic effects of PGRN-derived ND7 in treating GD. We will characterize the visceral GD and
CNS nGD phenotypes of PG9Vn mice and elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved (SA#1A,
1B); and we will leverage various GD models, including our newly generated PG9Vn mice, Gba-specific models
(Gba9V/null, 4L;C*) and GD patient derived brain organoids, to test the therapeutic effects of ND7 in GD, with
special focus on nGD (SA#1C); and (2) To define the importance of PGRN/C5a interplay in the pathogenesis of
GD. We will characterize the PGRN/C5a interaction in GD (SA#2A); elucidate the interplay between PGRN and
C5a in regulating macrophage and lysosomal function, as well as the molecular events involved (SA#2B); and
determine the interplay between PGRN and C5a/C5aR1 signaling and therapeutic potential of inhibiting
C5a/C5aR1 signaling through PGRN derivatives to treat GD (SA#2C). The proposed research will not only
advance our understanding of GD pathogenesis, but may also lead to novel biologics for GD, in particular nGD."
10804227,"The long-term goal of our research is to identify pro-regenerative to improve liver regeneration. The only curative
therapy for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation as no regenerative therapies exist. Liver
transplantation is limited by donor graft supply. Living donor transplantation or split liver transplantation, in which
one organ is split among two patients, rely on the regenerative capacity of the liver to restore its mass. The
number of these interventions has increased to gap the bridge between demand and supply but post-
hepatectomy or ‘small-for-size’ syndrome, which reflect a regenerative failure, present severe complications for
which only supportive but no regenerative therapies exist. We have identified a novel hepatic growth factor,
neurotrophin-3 (NTF3), that induces hepatocyte proliferation in culture and increases liver mass after
administration to rodents. NTF3 is a member of the nerve growth factor family, that is secreted by hepatic stellate
cells (HSC) and signals through tropomyosin kinase receptors (TRKs). While HSCs contribute to liver
fibrogenesis during injury, HSCs are known to release growth factors which may be critical during liver
regeneration. Using a novel HSC-depletion mouse model that used genetically engineered T cells to deplete
HSCs after adoptive transfer, we discovered that HSCs maintain liver zonation, hepatocyte proliferation and liver
mass. As liver regeneration occurs staggered in a zonal fashion to ensure functioning hepatocytes at any time
during the process, liver zonation is critically important for liver regeneration. Our preliminary data indicate that
HSCs and NTF3 promote liver regeneration and that NTF3-TRK signaling is relevant to humans as well. As there
are known TRK-agonists and FDA-approved TRK-antagonists, our central hypothesis is that HSCs and HSC-
derived NTF3 promote liver regeneration and that TRK-agonists improve liver regeneration. We will test our
hypothesis in three specific aims: 1. To determine if NTF3 and TRK signaling maintain liver zonation and promote
liver regeneration in rodent models of liver regeneration; 2. To establish NTF3 and TRK signaling in human liver,
primary hepatocytes and hepatic organoids; 3. To clarify NTF3-TRK downstream signaling pathways in cultured
liver cells. Our proposed studies will provide important insights into a novel hepatocyte growth signaling pathway
and generate preclinical data to assess TRK-agonists for potential regenerative therapies."
10804314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For lung health to be restored after inflammation, dead cells must be removed from the airspaces and the alveolar
epithelium must be repaired. Airspace macrophages (AM) have been implicated in clearance of apoptotic cells,
termed efferocytosis, and in orchestrating epithelial repair. Whether all AM are capable of these functions, or
whether distinct subsets perform specialized roles following inflammation is poorly understood. In previous
studies, we leveraged an endobronchial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenge model of acute lung inflammation
in healthy adults to obtain human AM and investigate their transcriptional signatures. Using single cell RNA
sequencing, we discovered that after exposure to LPS, the airspaces are dominated by recruited AM. These
recruited AM can be divided into two discrete subsets based, in part, on their efferocytic and reparative
signatures. However, the causal mechanism by which efferocytosis is linked to reparative programing of AM in
humans has not been established. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify the unique functions and
molecular drivers of AM subsets during resolution of inflammation and active lung repair. Based on analysis of
transcriptional signatures and our prior studies, we postulate that a subset of AM that closely resemble interstitial
macrophages (imAM) are characterized by two unique functions. First, we propose that imAM are uniquely
programed for efferocytosis. Second, we hypothesize that imAM drive repair of the alveolar epithelium through
production of paracrine signaling molecules. The proposed studies will independently test the dependence of
efferocytosis on driving these functions. We will use primary AM obtained from endobronchial LPS-challenge of
research participants and cutting-edge organotypic co-culture systems in the following three Specific Aims: 1)
Test the hypothesis that imAM are specialized for efferocytosis. 2) Test the hypothesis that imAM promote
alveolar epithelial repair. 3) Determine whether efferocytosis is required for reparative programing of human AM."

This new F31 proposal is to support the career development of Erin Hughes who will receive training in
cannabinoid receptor biochemical neuropharmacology with Drs. Howlett and Lowther. Recent years have seen
a global increase in the usage of marijuana containing the psychoactive constituent Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a
partial agonist of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R). The CB1R is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) found
in the central nervous system and modulates neuroprogenitor development, neural commitment and migration,
and neurotransmitter release. GPCR function is dependent upon the ability to change conformations and to
transduce a response via G-proteins. This process requires association of a Gα-GDP subunit with Gβγ subunits
to form a heterotrimeric G-protein complex that binds to the GPCR. Stimulation of CB1R initiates the exchange
of GDP for GTP bound to Gα, activating the G-protein heterotrimer, and releasing the Gα and Gβγ subunits. The
released G-protein subunits propagate the signaling cascade through various interactions. Cannabinoid receptor
interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) is a protein found in human neurons at various brain regions, which suppresses
CB1R cellular signaling via modulating G-protein activation. The Scientific Premise is that CRIP1a modulation
of CB1R can be understood providing us with an in-depth view of the role of CB1R in neuronal cell
signaling. CRIP1a can modulate the type of Gα subunit bound to CB1R, however the mechanism of switching
is unknown. Previous immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the CB1R C-terminal region interacts with
CRIP1a, and therefore one possible explanation for CRIP1a-mediated Gα switching may involve formation of a
ternary complex between CB1R, subtype-specific Gα proteins, and CRIP1a. The Lowther-Howlett collaboration
has determined the high-resolution structure of CRIP1a by X-ray crystallography and found that CRIP1a is a
member of the family of carriers for myristoylated or isoprenylated proteins. Based on the knowledge of the
structure and function of CRIP1a, I hypothesize that CRIP1a binds N-terminally myristoylated cargo
proteins, such as Gαi proteins. I propose to investigate CRIP1a interactions in the N18TG2 neuroblastoma
cell model which endogenously expresses the CB1R and associated proteins. The aims of this project are to
determine (i) the regulation of the CRIP1a- Gα interaction during agonist stimulation and heterotrimeric
G protein dissociation and the cellular localization of such interactions; and (ii) the role of palmitoylation
and myristoylation on G-protein interaction with CRIP1a. The results of the proposed studies will prove to
be transformative for the field by characterizing a new class of cargo carrying proteins and providing evidence
that will advance our understanding of how, when and where CRIP1a interactions modulate CB1R pathways."
10806156,"Half of US adults have diabetes or pre-diabetes, illustrating a critical need for novel diabetes treatments. There is a
fundamental gap in the understanding of the paracrine feedback in control of insulin and glucagon secretion. The long-term
goal of the research program is to elucidate the key players in (patho)physiological crosstalk within pancreatic islets in order
to identify novel therapeutic targets. The overall objective in this application is to understand the mechanisms of action for
the long chain fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4). This G protein-coupled receptor is a promising T2D drug target that increases
insulin secretion. However, there is conflicting information with regards to the islet cell type(s) involved in the salutary
actions of FFA4. The central hypothesis is that within pancreatic islets FFA4 is predominantly expressed in d cells where
its activation inhibits somatostatin (SST) release and alleviates tonic inhibition of insulin and glucagon secretion. This
hypothesis was formulated on the basis of preliminary and recently published data produced collaboratively in the
laboratories of both PIs that place FFA4 expression predominantly on d cells. Furthermore, FFA4 stimulation inhibits d
cells and stimulates cAMP, Ca2+ and hormone secretion in b and a cells - effects that depend on d cell expression of FFA4.
Nevertheless, FFA4 agonists stimulate b cell proliferation independently of d cells and others claim direct FFA4 stimulation
of b cells. The rationale for the proposed research is to definitively resolve the mechanism(s) by which FFA4 agonists
promote insulin and glucagon secretion and beta cell proliferation. This hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims. Aim 1
tests the hypothesis that FFA4 activation in d cells lowers cAMP generation and inhibits SST secretion, which indirectly
enhances cAMP generation in b and a cells to stimulate insulin and glucagon secretion, respectively. SST will be deleted
genetically, or d cells will be ablated by diphteria toxin, to determine if stimulation of FFA4 stimulates b and a cells if 1)
SST is deleted, 2) d cells are ablated. Aim 2 test the hypothesis that direct FFA4 activation of a or b cells has minimal
impact on hormone secretion, but promotes b-cell proliferation. FFA4 will be selectively deleted in a or b cells to determine
whether FFA4-induced hormone release, cAMP generation, or proliferation is a or b cell-autonomous. Aim 3 tests the
hypothesis that FFA4 couples to Gaz in d cells to inhibit SST secretion and to Gas in a and/or b cells to stimulate b-cell
proliferation. The G proteins involved in FFA4-mediated islet responses will be identified by genetic deletion of Gaz in
specific islet cells combined with pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated silencing of select G-protein isoforms.
The research is conceptually and technically innovative as it evaluates the important physiological role of d cells within
intact islets in attenuating a- and b-cell activity and applies sophisticated functional imaging to quantify the kinetics of
cAMP and Ca2+ in a, b, and d cells at single cell resolution within intact islets. These experiments provide previously
unattainable single-cell resolution combined with approaches to experimentally interrupt SST-mediated intra-islet feedback
to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of FFA4 stimulation on insulin secretion and b-cell
proliferation. This is significant because a full mechanistic understanding of the pathways that mediate the salutary actions
of FFA4 will inform new therapies to improve and preserve functional b-cell mass and insulin secretory capacity."

Each year an estimated 275,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the US. Despite major
advances being made to improve breast cancer treatment, the disease still accounts for over 40,000 deaths
annually. Research in the past decades has helped to identify inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants.
These variants are often associated with an aggressive form of breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer. Although
treatments are available for BRCA1-mutant breast and ovarian cancers, most breast cancer patients will relapse
within 9 months of therapy due to resistance to the treatment. Therefore, more treatment options are needed.
We have recently established a connection between BRCA1 protein and the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).
We found that BRCA1 is an E3 ligase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, our study also reveals
that the UPR stress sensors, PERK and IRE1, are endogenous protein substrates targeted by BRCA1 for
ubiquitination. Our data shows that both PERK and IRE1 proteins are expressed at a much higher level in the
BRCA1-deficient (def) cancer cells than in the BRCA1-proficent cancer cells, probably due to under-
ubiquitination from the lack of a functional BRCA1 protein. Subsequently, we discovered that BRCA1-def cancer
cells (in vitro) and BRCA1-def tumors (in vivo) can be targeted by depleting specific components of the UPR
signaling pathway. Since our proposed treatment is most effective in targeting BRCA1-def cancer, therefore, it
will be imperative to identify patients that will be most benefit from the treatment. Currently there is no definitive
means to identify a loss of E3 ligase function BRCA1 variant. With this new information from our study, we plan
to explore the potential of using proteins that are ubiquitination substrates of BRCA1 (e.g., PERK and IRE1) as
biomarkers to identify patients who have an E3 ligase-deficient (E3D) BRCA1. Our study shows that PERK and
IRE1 proteins are consistently overexpressed in BRCA1-def cancer cells so we hypothesize that we will be able
to differentiate the BRCA1-proficient and BRCA1-def tumors by examining the quantitative densitometric staining
intensity difference in the protein expression profile of PERK and IRE1 via immunohistochemical staining or by
ELISA/Mass Spectrophotometric analysis if flash frozen samples are available. We will examine the protein
levels of PERK, IRE1 and other components of the UPR signaling pathway in patient tumor biospecimens and
will evaluate whether any of them can be used as valid biomarkers to screen for patients who have a BRCA1
variant that has caused a loss of E3 ligase function of the BRCA1 protein. In this study we propose an exploratory
measure of the integrity of E3 ligase function of BRCA1 by profiling the expression pattern of PERK and/or IRE1
protein. We will also study the correlation between high UPR activity and tumor’s responsiveness to the UPR
target therapy. We will address the following questions in this proposal: (1) How does BRCA1 mediate protein
homeostasis in cancer cells? (2) Can we apply UPR sensors/effectors as biomarkers to differentiate
BRCA1-proficient and BRCA1-def tumors? (3) How do we identify UPR-dependent cancers?"

The goal of this research is to characterize the role of Treponema denticola surface proteins in interaction of
this human oral spirochete with host tissue, thereby gaining insight into mechanisms by which T. denticola
contributes to initiation and progression of periodontal disease. We focus on analysis of T. denticola protein
complexes that directly affect cells isolated from tissue comprising the periodontal ligament (PDL) that
comprises the junction between the tooth and the alveolar bone of the tooth socket: specifically the PrtP
lipoprotein protease complex (dentilisin) and the oligomeric Msp protein. Our overall hypothesis is that
dentilisin and Msp are major contributors to T. denticola cytopathic behavior in periodontal disease, In this
context we will examine specific domains of dentilisin and Msp, as well as the T. denticola lipooligosaccharide
component of the outer membrane. To characterize their specific roles in microbe-host interactions, our
approach is to utilize purified native and recombinant proteins as well as isogenic T. denticola strains carrying
defined mutations in individual components of these outer membrane complexes. We will first extend our
ongoing studies characterizing dentilisin and Msp assembly in the Td outer membrane. Then, to further studies
of host responses to challenge by Td and its specific components, we will then characterize in a cell model T.
denticola-induced dysregulation of TLR/MyD88 and Integrin/FAK signaling mechanisms and consequences for
the cytoskeleton as well as expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases. We will determine the extent
to and the mechanisms by which specific T. denticola components contribute to tissue destruction in a mouse
model of periodontal disease. Finally, we will test the ability of the the antimicrobial peptide nisin to modulate T.
denticola-induced dysbiotic signaling in both the cell and animal models. Our research team is uniquely
positioned to conduct these studies, with combined expertise in spirochete molecular biology, extracellular
matrix biology and cytopathology of inflammatory diseases. Completion of this project will contribute to both
basic knowledge of spirochete molecular biology and to understanding of microbe-host interactions in chronic
infections such as periodontal diseases."

During embryonic development cells must be correctly allocated to distinct fates needed for organismal
growth and reproduction. Germ cells generate eggs and sperm and must be specified to avoid disorders of
the reproductive system, including gonadal and ovarian cancers, teratomas and other germ cell tumors, and
ultimately infertility. Germ cells often acquire their fate by inheriting cytoplasmic components that are
maternally synthesized, membrane-free, gel-like aggregates of proteins and RNAs collectively called germ
plasm. The highly conserved proteins, RNAs and organelles within germ plasm are assembled, or
nucleated, by other proteins that can be different in sequence across animals, but that share similar
evolutionary histories and biophysical properties. The molecular mechanisms by which these nucleators
ensure assembly and function of germ plasm remain unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand the
molecular mechanisms that drive the assembly and function of cytoplasmic fate determinants. In this
proposal, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which the Drosophila nucleator, encoded by the oskar gene,
assembles germ plasm. This proposal is significant because it has the potential to uncover generalizable
principles of germ plasm assembly, which may be broadly applicable to the formation and function of
membrane-less, gel-like cytoplasmic aggregates that regulate cell fates in many different contexts. Our
bioinformatic discovery of hundreds of new oskar sequences, combined with X-ray crystallography and
biochemical assays, suggested previously unexplored hypotheses for the molecular mechanism of oskar
function, which we will test as follows: In Aim 1, we will elucidate the role of the conserved LOTUS domain
in germ plasm assembly with in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo transgenic assays of the biological
function and biophysical properties of germ plasm, testing hypotheses regarding the importance of
dimerization, higher-order aggregate formation, phase separation, and Vasa binding to germ plasm
assembly. In Aim 2, we will determine for the first time the specific sequences and structural properties of
the Long Oskar Domain that enable the Long Oskar isoform to recruit and anchor mitochondria in the germ
plasm. In Aim 3, we will test the novel hypothesis that the conserved OSK domain interacts with specific
classes of lipids in the oocyte posterior, to help anchor Oskar to the posterior pole. Since defects in germ
cell development can lead to reproductive system pathologies affecting up to 12% of the US population,
elucidating the mechanisms that ensure assembly and function of germ line determinants is highly relevant
to human health. More generally, germ plasm is a type of ribonucleoprotein multimer (RNP), which are
membrane-free, gel-like organelles that regulate translation in both germ line and somatic cells.
Understanding germ plasm assembly may thus shed light on the general principles underlying assembly of
cytoplasmic RNPs required for the proper function of multiple critical cell types."

Prevalence of obesity is at an all-time high, but treatment methods are still limited. Proper regulation of food
intake and body weight rely on coordinated control of orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons in the central
nervous system, but our understanding of the neuronal circuits governing feeding is still not complete. Agouti-
related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons are known to be one of the most potent drivers of feeding, and they
are currently thought to be exclusively located in the mediobasal hypothalamus. In this application, we present
evidence demonstrating the existence of a previously unknown population of AgRP-expressing cells in the
area postrema, adjacent subpostrema area and the commissural part of the nucleus of the solitary tract. We
further show that these hindbrain AgRP cells potently promote feeding. In this study, we will identify neural
substrates that mediate the orexigenic effects of hindbrain AgRP neurons. We will determine how these
neurons are regulated by metabolic signals and explore functional redundancy between hindbrain and
hypothalamic AgRP neurons. Together, experiments outlined in this proposal will delineate the mechanisms
underlying the orexigenic effects of this novel population of AgRP neurons in the brainstem. As such, this study
will broaden our knowledge on how central neuronal network operates to control feeding."

We previously reported that the viability of some breast cancers depends on histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). We
also developed a biomarker (HDAC6-score, validated with a NY CLIA certified test) to identify cancers that depend
on HDAC6 function. By analyzing over 3,000 primary breast cancers, we have recently found that ~30% of all
breast cancers can benefit from targeted therapy against HDAC6. Thus, we designed a clinical trial in partnership
with Acetylon/Celgene to investigate the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i, Ricolinostat) plus nab-paclitaxel as
breast cancer therapy (NCT02632071). Notably, we have observed that this regimen is well tolerated, and that
clinical activity is identified in patients with metastatic disease. Molecularly, we have found that HDAC6 de-
acetylates cMyc and that inhibition of HDAC6 promotes hyperacetylation of cMyc and its degradation by the
proteasome. Furthermore, we linked the reduction of Myc expression due to HDAC6 inhibition to the anticancer
activity of HDAC6i (manuscript accepted in Nature Cancer).Objective: In this grant proposal, our ultimate goal is
to understand the molecular mechanism that mediates the anticancer activity of HDAC6i/s and to use this
information to improve HDAC6-based breast cancer regimens. In this grant proposal, we will pursue these
objectives by two independent but complementary aims.
Aim 1. Define the clinical space for HDAC6 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment
we hypothesize that including HDAC6i/s in therapeutic regiments for HR+ and HER2+ patients with high HDAC6
scores will have a superior therapeutic impact.
 - Aim 1a. Evaluate the response of high and low HDAC6-score HR+/HER2- cancer cells to a combination of
 HDAC6i/s and the standard of care systemic therapy.
 - Aim 1b. -Aim 1b. Evaluate the response of HDAC6-score high and low HER2+ cancer cells to a combination
 of HDAC6i/s and standard-of-care systemic therapy.
-Aim 1c. Molecular characterization of tumor response at a tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) level using sc-
 RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics.
Aim 2. Investigate the mechanisms of resistance to HDAC6i/s in breast cancer cells.
Despite the success of targeted therapies, resistance to treatment can emerge. Here, we will perform both, candidate-
driven and unbiased comprehensive analysis of tissue samples from patients in our trial plus cell lines and PDOs to
catalog and functionally test the molecular differences between sensitive and resistance cancers.
- Aim 2a. Profile the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of c-MYC in HDAC6i-resistant and sensitive BCs.
- Aim 2b. Evaluate the steady-state levels of proteasomal activity in HDAC6i-resistant and sensitive BCs.
- Aim 2c. Network analysis of HDAC6i/s sensitive and resistant BC cells.
- Aim 2d. Increase the specificity of the HDAC6 score with resistance data."

cause of global mortality and the most expensive hospital treated condition. Gram-negative species underly
about half of all bloodstream infections, thus bacteremia pathology is critical to understand. K. pneumoniae
(Kp) is the second leading cause of Gram-negative bacteremia and a leading cause of health-care associated
infections. The pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteremia involves three phases: 1) initial site infection, 2)
dissemination to the bloodstream, and 3) survival in blood filtering organs. Kp fitness in the lung, a common
initial site of infection, has been studied but last phase of Kp-bacteremia is largely unexplored. There is a
fundamental gap in our understanding of how Kp perpetuates infection in the blood and filtering organs.
Macrophages have differing interactions with Kp across organs that correlates to overall Kp abundance within
tissues during infection. However, the relationship between macrophages and Kp is poorly understood. The
objective of this proposal is to define mechanisms of Kp restriction across distinct macrophage subsets
relevant to bacteremia. The central hypothesis is that tissue-resident macrophages provide distinct niches that
restrict or permit Kp in a manner dependent on bacterial initiation of cell death. I will test this hypothesis
through three specific aims: 1) define splenic macrophage restriction of Kp during bacteremia, 2) define host
pathways of Kp restriction by macrophages, and 3) discover Kp mechanisms of resistance to macrophage-
mediated killing through initiation of cell death pathways. This work is innovative as it will harness CRISPR-
genomic screening to study Kp pathogenesis and use existing transposon sequencing data to identify bacterial
factors that are required for resistance to macrophage killing. Findings from these approaches will be applied
to splenic macrophages, an immune cell subset rarely studied in Gram-negative disease. The research in this
proposal will support sustained positive impact through identifying both host and pathogen factors required for
unique tissue-specific responses across sites in bacteremia. This proposal is supported by a comprehensive
training plan which will support the development of technical and conceptual skills to investigate host-pathogen
interactions across tissue-resident immune cells during Gram-negative bacteremia. The skills gained with this
training plan could be applied to multiple organ sites and Gram-negative pathogens. This training will occur at
the University of Michigan with a team of mentors dedicated to the success of this proposal. The candidate's
background in innate immunology and bacteriology will be unified by mentors with expertise in host-pathogen
interactions, macrophage biology, CRISPR-genomics, bacterial genetics, and spleen biology. Together, the
expertise of the mentors and the research in this proposal will facilitate independence of the candidate. This
research will reveal tissue-specific interactions between macrophages and Kp during bacteremia."

Diversity is critical to innovation and the advancement of our society. Yet despite our best efforts as a nation, the
United States has not been able to achieve STEM workforce diversity goals, which have been long attributed to
the failure of the “academic pipeline” to recruit and retain students from underrepresented minorities (URM), a
phenomenon often described as a “leaky pipeline”. Addressing this challenge will require innovative, multi-
pronged interventions that concurrently address social and environmental contributors to disparities. Recent
studies have shown that choosing a STEM major in college is directly influenced by academic interactions during
high school, suggesting that involvement in a college-based STEM education program can enhance recruitment
and retention into STEM disciplines. Programs that use a college-based academic experiences to engage
underserved individuals during high school can steer their educational path to college STEM majors. URM
disparities in the interest and persistence in STEM education are driven by the combination of individual,
environmental and school factors. This confluence of factors suggests that changing student outcomes could
benefit from a digitally-interconnected social ecological framework that goes beyond individual interests and
competencies to consider the the multi-level environment within which the student learner is situated. To address
the challenges in STEM diversity, we propose the Brain Explorer Academy (BEA), a comprehensive, multi-year,
socio-ecological informal science education program that uses neuroscience to instill curiosity and foster interest
in STEM careers. The BEA will marshal high school students in a Title 1 School through a multi-stage intervention
that fosters interest in STEM, knowledge and skill development, critical thinking, scientific communication, and
quantitative/analytical competencies. The proposal will We will test the hypothesis that the staged approach of
the BEA, which proceeds from highly structured learning in the first year, to highly individualized mentoring in

10932323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This proposal describes a five-year research and career development training plan that will prepare Dr. Bryan
to achieve her career goal of becoming an independent pediatric clinical researcher focused on improving
healthcare outcomes for hospitalized children by accelerating the translation of evidence-based interventions
into clinical practice using innovative technologies. This proposal is focused on improving vaccination rates in
hospitalized children, a high priority population and issue for NICHD. Up to 74% of hospitalized children are
missing ≥1 non-influenza vaccines. Currently, hospitalization is a missed opportunity to vaccinate as ~2% of
hospitalized children receive any non-influenza vaccines. Integrating implementation science and user-
centered design methods, Dr. Bryan’s project goal is to design and test a user-centered intervention that
optimizes the integration of Immunization Information Systems data into hospital Electronic Health Records to
improve vaccine delivery for hospitalized children. In Aim 1, Dr. Bryan will conduct a mixed methods study of a
local and national sample of pediatric hospitalists, nurses and pharmacists to identify determinants and
contextual factors for an intervention to identify undervaccinated children and offer needed vaccines using the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). In Aim 2, she will engage with parents, nurses,
pharmacists, physicians, and health information technology experts through workshops and rapid cycle
prototyping to develop a prototype for a user-centered intervention that meets the user needs and context
identified in Aim 1. She will conduct usability testing and expert evaluation to ensure the design meets the
requirements prior to the intervention build and workflow integration. In Aim 3, Dr. Bryan will deploy and pilot
test the designed intervention to assess feasibility and acceptability for clinicians and parents. This pilot test
will inform a future multicenter cluster-randomized effectiveness-implementation trial to improve vaccine
delivery in hospitalized children. To complete this research, Dr. Bryan will develop new competencies in: 1)
implementation science, 2) user-centered design methods, and 3) technology-based intervention design. To
prepare for the future clinical trial to test the developed intervention, she will also develop skills in clinical trials
design and analytic methods for vaccine communication during the award period. Dr. Bryan has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in vaccine communication research, implementation science,
user-centered design, and technology-based intervention design. Her mentors are dedicated to ensuring the
success of this project and her career development into an independent researcher. By accomplishing the
aims in this proposal, Dr. Bryan will address key gaps in our ability to increase vaccination rates in hospitalized
children. Ultimately, this proposal will provide Dr. Bryan the skills she needs in implementation science, user-
centered design, technology-based intervention design, clinical trials design and analytic methods for health
communication for a research career dedicated to improving healthcare outcomes in hospitalized children."
10807974,"The core concept of our proposed studies is that sex-biased gene expression early in human
development pattern the brain differently in males and females, and that this patterning underlies
differential susceptibility of males and females to neurodevelopmental disorders. We envision that
these sex differences are regulated by epigenetic programs controlling the expression of
developmentally regulated genes in a sex-biased manner. We further postulate that these sex-
dependent epigenetic mechanisms interact with genetic risk factors that influence risk,
progression, and severity of autism sprectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), and we
will test these hypotheses in two specific aims. Aim 1 is to delineate the sex-dependent regulation
of early brain development in typical individuals. Epigenetic and gene expression programs in
brain organoids and postmortem fetal brains will be evaluated on multiple levels, including
transcriptome, proteome, and activity of noncoding regulatory elements. The objective of this aim
is to define a network of genes and their regulatory elements—primarily enhancers—that are
differentially active between males and females during early brain development. Aim 2 will
determine whether the sex-biased regulatory network carries an increased burden of potentially
pathogenic or risk associated genetic variants in developmental disorders such as SCZ and ASD.
We will query available genome sequencing and GWAS datasets of probands and typical controls
to determine whether the sex-biased regulatory network are enriched for rare and common
inherited disease variants. Enrichment of these variants in the sex-biased regulatory network will
reveal potential mechanisms by which sex-biased gene expression affects SCZ and ASD genetic
risk and trajectory. The impact of this work is seeking the first detailed understanding of early
sexually dimorphic brain development. The new knowledge will constitute a fundamental advance
in our understanding of normal development, and will pioneer the discovery of how disease
susceptibility depends on sex-biased gene regulation in the developing brain."
10806952,"As an essential nutrient, manganese is required for the function of numerous enzymes. Through these enzymes, manganese plays important roles in human health. Manganese deficiency leads to impaired growth, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, asthma, and cognitive defects. Manganese overload, on the other hand, produces a spectrum of neurological and behavioral defects, clinically known as manganism. Therefore, manganese homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled to meet the dual challenge of avoiding deficiency and overload. Manganese transporters play critical roles in this control. ZIP14 (Zrt- and Irt-like protein, member 14, or SLC39A14) is a newly identified manganese importer. It is highly expressed in the small intestine and liver, that are the two major organs involved in the control of manganese metabolism. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in ZIP14 developed severe childhood-onset manganese overload, indicating an indispensable role for ZIP14 in maintaining body manganese homeostasis. However, the precise mechanism of this disease has not been determined. The goal of this proposed research is to determine the function of ZIP14 in regulating manganese homeostasis and to elucidate how ZIP14 mutations lead to manganese toxicity. This application focuses on ZIP14’s function at two levels: its role in regulating cellular manganese transport and its function in balancing whole-body manganese homeostasis. We will use a combination of cell assays and genetically modified mouse models to identify new factors that determine ZIP14’s function and to investigate the physiological significance of new findings in disease biology. Our proposed research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how manganese homeostasis is controlled and how manganese overload is induced in individuals lacking functional ZIP14. This project will have great potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and developing effective prevention strategies that would minimize adverse health impacts occurred in patients"

hundreds of nutritive and bioactive factors in milk and their functions in the infant remain mostly unexplored. A
genomics approach enables investigation of human milk as a biological system and can identify the most
important factors connecting human milk composition with infant health. One such approach is milk
metabolomics, which reflects the biology of the lactating mammary gland and the bioactive and nutritive
components of milk that shape its function in the infant. This proposal leverages metabolomics and other
cutting edge technologies to comprehensively profile the composition of human milk and its impacts on infant
development. The results will provide foundational data for advancing milk research and help advance our
knowledge of human nutrition during the critical first 1000 days of life. Aim 1 will identify genetic variants
influencing specific milk metabolites and the genes underlying these associations, and investigate connections
between the milk metabolome and infant gut microbiome. In Aim 2, the effect of human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) reactivation in the mammary gland on the milk metabolome will be assessed. HCMV is a highly
prevalent virus, and postnatal exposure to HCMV via breast milk often has serious clinical consequences for
preterm infants. This aim will also test for impacts of mammary HCMV reactivation and the milk metabolome
on infant serum markers of inflammation. The first two aims will occur primarily during the K99 period, and will
be accompanied by training in virology, immunology, and computational methods for integration of multimodal
datasets. Aim 3, during the R00 phase, will investigate the impacts of human milk composition on the
systems-level development of the preterm infant immune system and gut microbiome, utilizing a new cohort of
preterm infants. Longitudinal sample collection will enable disentangling of the connections across these
dynamic biological systems. Training in the K99 period will take place at the University of Minnesota – Twin
Cities, a major research institution, with state-of-the-art core facilities for genomics and clinical/translational
research. The PI will receive training from an interdisciplinary team of mentors in the departments of Pediatrics,
Epidemiology & Community Health, and Genetics, Cell Biology and Development. This training plan will result
in the trainee acquiring the skills and a scientific foundation to launch an independent academic career."

10783852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inhibitors against mutant KRAS—the oncogene once deemed undruggable—are impressively showing tumor
control in preclinical testing, entering the clinic for testing in various malignancies, and in the case of the
KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib, gaining FDA approval. MRTX1133, a KRASG12D inhibitor now entering phase 1
clinical testing, represents hope for patients bearing other KRAS mutations, including a significant number of
never smokers with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 56% of whom have a KRASG12D-mutant cancer.
MTRX1133 will likely result in a paradigm shift for these NSCLC patients. Moreover, NSCLC responds well to
immunotherapy, and thus, the efficacy of combining KRAS inhibition with immune checkpoint immunotherapy
(ICI) is expected to be even greater. However, for many molecularly targeted therapies, resistance, and therefore
relapse, is common. This has been observed in patients treated with Sotorasib, and there is concern that
resistance to MRTX1133 and other KRAS inhibitors will also develop. Resistance is often linked to the
remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and thus, an imperative need has emerged to understand
this remodeling process during intervention and tumor recurrence to guide development of future therapeutic
treatment paradigms with long-term responses.
Our analysis of the TME in a unique KrasG12D inducible and reversible mouse model of NSCLC using single cell
RNA sequencing data shows KrasG12D-dependent control of the TME. Upon initiating KrasG12D, the expression of
PDL1 decreased in a subset of myeloid cells, potentially indicating that patients with mutant KrasG12D are unlikely
to respond to immune checkpoint therapy using PD1/PDL1 inhibitors. Interestingly, when KrasG12D was turned
OFF, the expression of PDL1 increased, providing strong rationale for co-treatment of KRAS inhibitors with ICI
for these patients. Thus, we hypothesize that a) inactivation of oncogenic KrasG12D in advanced tumors
sensitizes lung cancer to anti-PDL1 antibodies and b) therapeutic interventions targeting KrasG12D will
result in remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we will determine tumor
regression and survival benefit of KrasG12D inhibition wherein oncogenic KRAS is inhibited either genetically or
by MRTX1133 in combination with anti-PDL1. Importantly, we will also study tumor recurrence in NSCLC due
to therapeutic resistance in our model (Aim 1). To address the urgent needs to devise effective treatments
with long-term responses and understand the interaction between oncogenic KRAS expressing cells and the
surrounding TME during treatment and relapse, we will thoroughly evaluate fibroblasts and immune status in
relapsed KrasG12D-driven lung cancer in these mice. The intricate mechanisms of a KRASG12D-regulated TME,
particularly fibroblast cells, will also be scrutinized in patient derived organoid models using MRTX1133 in
co-cultures with matching fibroblasts (Aim 2). Successful completion of this proposal will provide actionable
biomarkers and therapeutic targets in relapsed tumors for developing long-term therapeutic solutions."
10792935,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As United States cannabis policy shifts toward liberalization, norms and behaviors around adult use have
shifted in kind. This includes parent use, which is increasing in frequency and prevalence. While certain deficits
have been found in children of parents who use cannabis, these associations are inherently subject to
confounding by parents and children’s social environments, and potential for causal inference has been limited.
Parents report using for stress-coping, but the relationship between cannabis and stress is complex and highly
dependent on social context. Patterns of cannabis use among parents mirror existing health inequities.
Theoretical social epidemiologic models suggest that drug use as a stress-coping mechanism is both a
reflection of health inequities and cause of health disparities, which may be further exacerbated in the context
of intergenerational effects. Theoretical models and empirical evidence from developmental psychology
underline the important and interacting roles of substance use, stress and the social environment on parenting.
 This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support the Candidate’s career
development as an independent interdisciplinary researcher in modifiable factors that produce disparities and
inequities in substance use, treatment and consequences across the life course. The award will support the
Candidate’s short-term goal of understanding the intergenerational transmission of cannabis-related harm. This
application aims to contribute a clearer understanding of the complex relationships between diverse families’
social environments, maternal cannabis use, parenting behaviors, and the maternal-infant relationship in the
six months postpartum. Specific aims are to 1) understand the impact of maternal cannabis use in the first six
months postpartum on parenting behaviors and maternal-infant interaction; 2) understand the influence of
discrimination in the relationship between stress, cannabis use and parenting; and 3) characterize motivations
for maternal cannabis use through qualitative interviews. Research aims will be explored in a prospective
longitudinal cohort of pregnant women who use cannabis, following mothers and infants until one year
postpartum. Outcomes will be assessed using qualitative and quantitative techniques, including interviews,
surveys, behavioral observation, and biomarker measurement. By focusing on multiple levels of modifiable
influence on maternal cannabis use, parenting and the maternal-infant relationship, including behavioral and
biological pathways, results from this research have the potential to provide unique opportunities to address
maternal and child health in the context of shifting social and legal norms surrounding adult cannabis use. This
research is designed to address the Objective 4.1 of NIDA’s strategic plan to determine the impact of drug use
and addiction on individuals, families, peers and society. The training plan is designed to prepare the
Candidate for a career as an interdisciplinary researcher in substance use by supplementing her background in
social epidemiology and secondary data analysis with training in stress research and primary data collection."
10791732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
How the intracellular membrane system of eukaryotic cells is configured and maintained is a fundamental
problem in cell biology. Deficiencies in this organization often lead to disease. The overarching goal of my
laboratory is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane dynamics, including vesicle
biogenesis, organelle trafficking, and protein sorting in the early secretory and endocytic pathways of metazoan
cells. We aim to determine how normal membrane transport contributes to cellular homeostasis and understand
the molecular basis for disease states that emerge when trafficking pathways are disrupted. Using a combination
of model systems, structural biology, biochemistry, genetics, and high-resolution subcellular imaging, our studies
focus on two essential trafficking pathways necessary for protein and lipid export from the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and protein turnover within lysosomes via a multivesicular endosome (MVE) intermediate. Mutations in
several factors that regulate these processes have been implicated in cancer, diabetes, immune dysfunction,
and neurodegeneration. Thus, deciphering the fundamental principles underlying the regulation of ER export
and MVE biogenesis should facilitate the future identification of therapeutic targets for disease intervention. One
major focus of my research has been elucidating how the early secretory pathway is organized. Our findings
revealed the existence of a conserved membrane interface, which links subdomains on the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) that produce COPII-coated transport carriers to juxtaposed ER-Golgi intermediate compartments
(ERGIC). We identified Trk-fused gene (TFG) as a key constituent of this interface and have shown that its
inhibition uncouples ER and ERGIC membranes and leads to the isotropic diffusion of COPII-coated carriers,
reducing the efficiency of cargo secretion. My second research focus is aimed at understanding the mechanisms
that direct the formation of MVEs, which bud intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) into their interior to sequester
membrane-associated cargoes from the cytoplasm. Eventual fusion of MVEs with lysosomes results in the
degradation of ILVs and their associated proteins, which plays a key role in tumor suppression by governing the
capture and sequestration of signaling receptors. Using C. elegans, we have developed a new, highly simplified,
and genetically tractable system to investigate how components of the endosomal sorting complex required for
transport (ESCRT) machinery enables the movement of endocytosed cargo to MVEs and ILVs in the context of
an intact, developing animal. Our future work will continue to capitalize on evolving methodologies to further
establish how COPII-mediated transport and ESCRT-mediated MVE biogenesis are properly regulated. A better
understanding of these processes will yield key insights into the homeostatic controls that sustain normal protein
trafficking in the secretory and endocytic pathways during cell proliferation and differentiation."

 A cure for HIV requires the elimination of the latently-infected pool of host cells harboring HIV provirus,
but this has proven quite difficult and remains a major obstacle in the field. Currently, several chemical latency
reversing agents have been described, however, their in vivo efficacy has not been demonstrated. Thus, the
need for new approaches to address this issue is urgently needed. One attractive method to combat HIV
latency, would be a self-sustaining curative to endlessly surveil the host rapidly killing newly activated reservoir
cells before the release of a significant amount of virus. Previously, T cells transduced to express CD4 on their
surface linked to activation signaling machinery, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, were employed to
target and kill infected host cells. But there were substantial drawbacks with this approach, including a novel
entry route for infection of CD8 T cells, shielding of the CD4-binding site, and lack of efficacy. Utilizing secreted
high-affinity anti-HIV bnAbs, which are remarkably effective across a wide swath of HIV strains, in conjunction
with superior CAR designs, we here propose to exploit both advancements to generate doubly
immunotherapeutic improved CAR T cells. These pioneering studies will provide new insights into how to
access and control the reservoir of latently HIV-infected cells and, in combination with ART, address the
exigent goal of functional control of HIV. Upon completion of this project, we expect to have several validated
CAR T cell constructs ready for future testing in SHIV non-human primate models and/or perhaps humans.
Since these studies utilize autologous T cells, we expect to see very few adverse events. Moreover, if
successful, life-long use of anti-retrovirals, which have been associated with toxicity, is likely to be reduced or
perhaps eliminated by this approach."

Calorie restriction (CR) has the potential to attenuate aging; however, the mechanisms by which CR enhances
longevity and reduces disease burden are not fully understood. Mitochondria have been in the limelight due to
their potential role in regulating the aging process. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity is of crucial
importance in mitochondrial function. Accumulation of mtDNA heteroplasmic mutations have been implicated in
cardiometabolic disease development and in aging. It is not clear whether CR promotes mtDNA integrity in
humans. CALERIE (the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy), the
two-year randomized controlled clinical trial of CR in humans, demonstrated that, compared to the ad libitum
(AL) control group, sustained moderate CR reduced markers of biological aging and improved cardiometabolic
profiles. The data and samples from the CALERIE study provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore the
potential effects of CR on mtDNA heteroplasmies. Using the existing whole blood samples collected by
CALERIE, the proposed project will measure mtDNA heteroplasmies at three time points over the two years.
The overarching goal of the proposed study is to understand whether CR attenuates mtDNA heteroplasmic
mutations. Our central hypothesis is that CR promotes mitochondrial integrity by reducing the accumulation of
mtDNA heteroplasmies, and that these changes are associated with improved biological aging and
cardiometabolic health. We propose the following Aims: 1) Examining the effect of CR on the changes in
mtDNA heteroplasmies in CALERIE, 2) Examining whether mtDNA heteroplasmies are associated with
markers of biological aging, and 3) Examining whether the mtDNA heteroplasmies are associated with
cardiometabolic risk factors. We also propose an exploratory aim to test whether the mtDNA heteroplasmies
potentially mediate the effects of CR on biological aging and cardiometabolic measures. The proposed study is
directly relevant to the NIH FOA PA-20-195 that supports exploratory analyses utilizing CALERIE data and
biospecimens to evaluate the mechanisms of CR. The proposed project has the potential to provide insights
into the molecular basis of CR-mitigated effects on aging and role of mtDNA in cardiometabolic diseases. Data
generated by the proposed study will inform the design for a larger scale study to facilitate the identification of
preventive and therapeutic targets for aging and age-associated cardiometabolic diseases."

Communicating in environments containing multiple talkers (restaurants, parties, etc.) is the biggest challenge
faced by listeners with hearing loss. Previous work has shown that this difficulty stems from both monaural and
binaural deficits. Current hearing aids do not fully compensate for these deficits and thus do not offer adequate
improvements in multitalker environments. In some cases they even introduce additional distortions that may be
particularly detrimental in such situations. The goal of the proposed project is to leverage our understanding of
these different issues to explore ways of improving speech perception for hearing-aid wearers in multitalker
environments. Aim 1 will focus on restoring audibility, which is the primary goal of a hearing aid. Since
amplification strategies are mostly optimized for restoring speech audibility in quiet, they may not be optimized
for speech presented in multitalker mixtures. In particular, the speech of interest in multitalker mixtures may only
be available in rather sparse regions of time and frequency (or “glimpses”). The experiments proposed in Aim 1
will compare the ability of different amplification strategies to restore the audibility and intelligibility of glimpsed
speech. This work will demonstrate the impact that even small variations in audibility can have on real-world
speech understanding, and reveal potentially important differences between current amplification strategies. Aim
2 is motivated by the fact that some listeners with hearing loss also demonstrate reduced sensitivity to binaural
cues, which weakens the perception of location and may hinder selective attention. The experiments in this aim
will investigate speech enhancement strategies that are designed to enhance the representation of speech in
noise to improve intelligibility. Because they operate by altering the speech envelope, a secondary benefit may
be to increase the salience of binaural cues carried in the envelope. Enhancement will be applied to speech
stimuli across a range of spatial tasks, to identify conditions under which a binaural benefit is observed. This
work will open up a new avenue for improving the representation of complex acoustic scenes in hearing-aid
wearers. Finally, while appropriate amplification and binaural enhancement have the potential to improve speech
perception in multitalker mixtures, it is vitally important that hearing devices do not offset these benefits by
introducing distortions that have the opposite effect. Aim 3 will focus on one such distortion that has been
identified. While empirical data is limited, there are many indications that hearing aids increase the tendency for
external sounds to be perceived close to or inside the head. This disorienting effect may have particularly serious
consequences in multitalker mixtures, where distinct spatial locations are critical for segregating competing
voices. The experiments proposed in Aim 3 will systematically examine the effect of hearing aids on sound
externalization, clarify the source(s) of this effect, and determine the impact on speech intelligibility. This work
will highlight the critical importance of maintaining natural sound images in hearing aids for optimizing speech
intelligibility in real-world listening situations."

Heart failure is a major cause for global mortality/morbidity characterized by the loss of cell surface beta-
adrenergic receptor (βAR) which are powerful regulators of cardiac function. Epinephrine/norepinephrine
activates βARs leading to cAMP generation and cardiac contraction. Activated βARs are phosphorylated by G-
protein coupled receptor kinases resulting in β-arrestin binding and desensitization. Phosphorylated βARs
undergo endocytosis, and are dephosphorylated (ie resensitized) in the endosomes by protein phosphatase 2A
(PP2A) before being recycled back to the plasma membrane as agonist ready naïve βARs. This reflects a
dynamic regulation of βAR function by desensitization (phosphorylation) and resensitization (dephosphorylation).
Despite this dynamic regulation, desensitization is well understood, while less is known about resensitization in
in heart failure. Our seminal studies identified that phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) phosphorylates an
endogenous inhibitor of PP2A (I2PPA) which robustly binds and inhibits PP2A activity thereby, impairing βAR
resensitization. In vivo studies using mouse models targeting I2PP2A showed that preservation of resensitization
results in maintenance of βAR function conferring cardiac protection. Consistently, βAR resensitization is
inhibited in end-stage human heart failure which is characterized by significant loss in PP2A activity compared
to non-failing hearts. These findings lay the rationale for the scientific premise that therapeutic approaches
to unlock the inhibition of PP2A activity leading to preservation of βAR resensitization would ameliorate cardiac
dysfunction. We came across a small molecule (TGI1002, TGI) in cancer space that maintains PP2A function
by targeting I2PP2A unlocking PP2A inhibition. As mechanistic basis for I2PP2A targeting by TGI is not known,
in silico docking, cellular and in vitro studies were performed which showed that TGI impaired I2PP2A binding to
PP2A resulting in sustained βAR-associated PP2A activity and preserved βAR resensitization. However, TGI
generates baseline cAMP, which is thought to be cardiotoxic. In recognition, our initial structure-design activity
studies led to analog like CCF002, which though not optimal has reduced baseline cAMP, improved in vitro
activity over TGI and importantly, mitigated cardiac dysfunction post-heart failure administration. Thus, the R61
phase is focused on understanding the pharmacophore to generate molecules that have minimal baseline
cAMP, higher in vitro efficacies through optimizing modifications on CCF002. This could lead to identification of
1-3 candidates with drug-like properties with higher efficacies and bioavailability preserving βAR resensitization.
The R33 phase is designed to comprehensively assess in vitro toxicity, off-target effects and efficacy on a
second hypertension-based model of heart failure in acknowledgement of the heart failure etiology. The studies
outlined in the grant application would allow us to translate early stage discovery to identify and characterize
potential therapeutic molecules for heart failure congruent with the Catalyze funding opportunity announcement
(FOA)."

10793525,"Project Summary
Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) occurs in up to 80% of patients received this therapy. PIPN
is characterized by distal limb neuropathic pain and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF). Currently there is
no effective treatment for this debilitating neuropathic pain syndrome. We recently found that complement, a
key component of innate immunity, plays a previously unknown yet pivotal role in the development of PIPN.
Complement activation leads to 1) release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a to mediate inflammation through their
receptors C3aR and C5aR, and 2) formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) to mediate cell damage.
Because rats are superior to mice for many behavioral tests, including pain measurement, we created the first-
ever complement knockout (KO) rats lacking C3, the central component of the complement activation cascade.
Our preliminary studies showed that Paclitaxel causes complement activation in vitro and in vivo. Paclitaxel-
induced mechanical allodynia (PIMA, a readout of pain), loss of IENF, deposition of MAC, and expression of
transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4, a key mechanosensory receptor for pain) in dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) are much less in C3 KO rats than in WT controls. Others have reported that macrophage infiltration by
CCL2/CCR2 chemoattractant signals into DRG and intracellular calcium influx in DRG neurons play essential
roles in PIPN. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that complement activation (i) stimulates DRG
neurons to produce CCL2 to subsequently recruit macrophages into DRG; (ii) upregulates TRPV4
expression and stimulates Ca2+ influx in DRG through C3aR/C5aR activation; and/or (iii) directly
damages DRG neurons through MAC formation. Thus, inhibiting complement should prevent/treat PIPN.
We will first determine the role of complement in paclitaxel-mediated CCL2/CCR2 activation, macrophage
infiltration into DRG, as well as the therapeutic effect of C3aR/C5aR antagonists on PIMA in PIPN (Aim 1). We
will then examine the role of complement in paclitaxel-mediated TRPV4 upregulation, intracellular Ca2+ influx,
and MAC formation in DRG neurons (Aim 2). Finally, we will correlate complement activation and loss of IENF
in patients developed PIPN (Aim 3). This project will, for the first time, elucidate the mechanisms by which
complement contributes to the development of PIPN. Our work might also provide a solid foundation for the
future development of complement-targeted therapeutics to manage PIPN that has no effective treatment yet.
Because other peripheral neuropathies (e.g., due to alcohol consumption, HIV infection or Diabetes Mellitus) are
also characterized by distal neuropathic pain and loss of IENF, findings of this study would have broad clinical
impact in managing these hard-to-treat pain syndromes."
10793526,"End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition characterized by a disproportionately high risk of premature
cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, due in part to low-grade chronic inflammation. Efforts to reduce the
inflammatory load in ESRD have been largely unsuccessful. Microbial translocation into the bloodstream can
occur via different routes in ESRD, including contaminated dialysate, dialysis catheter, and impaired intestinal
mucosa, and can be a potential cause of chronic inflammation. While bacterial endotoxins have been extensively
studied among microbial components identifiable in the blood, recent advances in microbial DNA sequencing
have allowed the identification of highly diverse microbial communities in the systemic circulation (a.k.a.
circulating microbiome), even in the absence of overt infection. In addition, both quantitative and qualitative
changes in circulating microbiome have been shown to be associated with conditions linked to chronic
inflammation, such as CV disease, potentially through their immunostimulatory, atherogenic, and cardiotoxic
properties. These results suggest that the circulating microbiome may contribute to the high rates of chronic
inflammation and premature mortality in ESRD. Nevertheless, no work to date has described the nature of the
circulating microbiome and its longitudinal relationships with clinical outcomes in ESRD. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and fungi are chronically present in the
systemic circulation of patients with ESRD and contribute to the excess risk of chronic inflammation and
premature mortality. The objective of this project is to characterize the circulating microbiome in ESRD and to
investigate its associations with premature mortality. The long-term goal is to elucidate the biological
mechanisms underlying the relationships between circulating microbiome and premature mortality in ESRD. To
test our hypothesis, we propose to analyze longitudinally collected blood samples from a nationwide prospective
cohort of 978 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients, with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the levels,
composition, and temporal changes of the circulating microbiome by applying metagenomic sequencing
techniques; 2) Examine the association of circulating microbiome with all-cause and CV mortality, and also
determine if inflammation acts as a mediator of this association; and 3) Identify clinical factors that are associated
with mortality-related circulating microbiome in HD patients by utilizing both traditional regression analyses and
innovative data-driven techniques to discover potentially modifiable risk factors. The findings of our proposed
study will enhance our understanding of the characteristics and roles of circulating microbiome in HD patients
and pave the way for the future development of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and target-driven
therapeutic strategies to reduce excess risk of mortality in ESRD."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is emerging as a powerful anti-cancer strategy that may offer
new opportunities to improve outcomes for patients with malignant gliomas (MG). Although CAR T cells have
demonstrated remarkable clinical responses against hematologic malignancies, success against solid tumors
remains an important therapeutic goal. The immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME) presents
obstacles to therapy that must be overcome in order to achieve therapeutic efficacy. City of Hope was the first
to clinically translate CAR T cells for the treatment of MG, and the lead CAR program targets the glioma-
associated antigen IL13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2). Initial findings have demonstrated that the treatment is well
tolerated and shows evidence of antitumor activity. One patient with recurrent multifocal glioblastoma (including
metastatic lesions in the spine) with characteristics of an inflamed TME, achieved a complete response (CR)
that was durable for more than 7 months. Importantly, this case provides evidence that CAR T cells can mediate
profound antitumor activity against one of the most lethal and difficult-to-treat solid tumors, and also provides
critical information on how the tumor landscape can modulate response to CAR T cell immunotherapy.
Our goal is to implement strategies to overcome the underlying causes of immunosuppression within the tumor
microenvironment that limit CAR T cell responses to MG. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has emerged as a critical
driver of immune suppression in solid tumors, including MG. We hypothesize that checkpoint blockade will
synergize with CAR T cells to create a tumor landscape more favorable to immunotherapy.
We propose to clinically evaluate IL13Rα2-CAR T cell therapy in combination with anti-PD1 (nivolumab) in
patients with IL13Rα2+ recurrent MG (Specific Aim 1). Interrogating correlative samples from this clinical trial,
we will assess tumor and TME changes that occur post T cell therapy with and without nivolumab, as well as
molecular pathways that dominantly correlate with response and/or resistance to therapy (Specific Aim 2). In
addition, we will preclinically evaluate in immunocompetent mice, the impact of an inflamed versus non-inflamed
TME on the efficacy of the combination therapy. These preclinical studies will aid in elucidating mechanisms of
response and resistance in the two immunological landscapes (Specific Aim 3).
This project builds upon our prior preclinical and clinical experience with IL13Rα2-CAR T cell therapy, as well as
our understanding of PD-1/PDL-1 biology and its impact on immunotherapy. We anticipate these experiments
will provide insights for improved MG therapies, which also may apply to other advanced cancers."
10793639,"The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC) has been a resource since 1989 for longitudinal
research on the risk factors, treatment and clinical outcomes of persons with HIV (PWH). The Baltimore
region has overlapping epidemics of HIV infection and substance use, predominantly heroin and cocaine
use, and much of our research has focused in this population, with the advantage of directly comparing
those who use substances with a non-use population from the same geographic and socioeconomic
catchment areas of the region. Our cohort is predominantly African-American with a high proportion of
women, providing a needed window into these epidemics in these often understudied populations.
Highly-effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly improved survival; the median age of the
JHHCC cohort is 54 years with an expected life-expectancy of 20-30 years. New federal initiatives have
a goal of >90% of PWH in HIV care, so that data to better understand and overcome the challenges to
long-term HIV care are particularly relevant to the contemporary epidemic. Our current Aims build upon
our strengths in longitudinal research, focusing on the chronically-infected patient population on long-
term ART. Non-communicable diseases (NCD) appear to be occurring at higher rates and at earlier
ages than expected, even in those who are virally suppressed. We and others have shown that
substance use is a barrier to achieving the outcomes of the HIV Care Continuum, and increases the risk
of comorbidity and mortality in HIV. Our first Aim is to characterize the extended clinical course of PWH
in contemporary HIV care, evaluating the associations of opioid and other substance use and its
treatment with the HIV Care Continuum, NCD morbidity and mortality in those aging with HIV. Another
focus of the JHHCC has been viral hepatitis co-infection, particularly hepatitis C (HCV), a comorbidity
that is prevalent in 40% of our patients, principally because of IDU. Although we are now effectively
treating HCV, challenges remain in curing those who use substances and in those who are treated, liver
fibrosis is common and the future risk of cirrhosis, steatosis and hepatic cancer is unclear, as well as
the risk of re-infection. Our second Aim will focus on HCV treatment and the rates and risks of these
adverse liver outcomes and re-infection in those who have been treated. Finally, the JHHCC has a
proven history of highly productive collaboration, with over 500 publications, half of which are with
multisite collaborations. These include not only observational research, but translational studies of
pathogenesis, implementation science and clinical trials. Our third Aim is to enhance collaboration with
investigators who would benefit from the resources of the JHHCC, and especially as part of the
Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO)."

Keloids are dermal lesions that grow beyond the margin of the original wound in a tumor-like manner. Keloids
can expand for several years, grow to large size and be painful, itchy and inflamed. Despite of the severe
physical, psychological and social impact on patients, keloids are understudied and the treatment is
unsatisfactory with high recurrence rates. Keloids also contribute to racial disparity in research and health care
because prevalence is highest in populations of African ancestry. There is strong evidence for a genetically
diverse basis for keloids. However, gene mutations that make patients susceptible and initiate keloids have not
been identified. Identifying such causative genetic variants is fundamental for the understanding of keloid
pathoetiology and for the identification of potential therapeutic targets. We previously identified several keloid
candidate variants by linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing in a large cohort of 103 ethnic Yoruba
families from Nigeria with heritable keloid formation. We prioritized four candidate genes variants that segregate
in families, are expressed in skin and associated with other fibroproliferative disorders or are involved in wound
healing.
In this application we aim to determine whether the downstream effects of these four candidate gene variants
induce a keloid-like phenotype in skin cells or in organotypic skin equivalents. We will investigate pathways by
which the candidate variants act on skin cells.
In Aim 1, we will study the roles of keloid candidate gene variants on individual skin cell types derived from
human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying the respective gene mutations. We minimize
background noise from biological variability by comparing isogenic mutant and wild type cells that differ only by
the variant to be investigated.
In Aim 2, we examine interactions between mutant fibroblasts, keratinocytes and macrophages that lead to
paracrine effects guiding epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis during wound healing, using co-cultures,
organotypic skin equivalents and xenotransplant mouse models.
We expect that investigating the role of genes that have not been investigated in keloids will bridge knowledge
gaps in keloid and wound healing research and will identify novel factors that put individuals at risk for keloid
development."

 Airway tuft cells (also known as “brush” or “solitary chemosensory” cells) are rare cells found in the
nose and trachea. Tuft cells are also found in the lung after injury and/or inflammation or in genetic diseases
like primary ciliary dyskinesia. Tuft cells regulate local antimicrobial peptide, acetylcholine (ACh), and IL-25
secretion. IL-25 is an important driver of Th2 inflammatory responses observed in airway disease like
chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps and asthma. Tuft cell ACh may activate sensory neurons
and/or local mucociliary or inflammatory responses.
 We know little about how to target tuft cells in airway diseases, because we know little about human
tuft cell function. Their rarity (≤1 in 100 cells in the nose) makes them difficult to study, though their
frequency increases significantly (up to 30% of the epithelium) in nasal polyps. We know that tuft cells
express a range of chemosensory G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) but know little about how they
signal and regulate cell responses. We previously showed that activation of T2R bitter taste GPCRs
stimulates Ca2+ -driven secretion of antimicrobial peptides from surrounding epithelial cells. This response is
inhibited by activation of cAMP downstream of T1R sweet taste GPCRs, which sense airway surface liquid
glucose or sweet bacterial D-amino acids. Other GPCRs (e.g., succinate, cholinergic receptors, adenosine
receptors, etc.) exist in tuft cells, but their functions are less clear. Many studies have been done in mice,
but our research revealed differences in how mouse vs human tuft cells signal. We need better methods for
studying human tuft cell function to complement and extend prior mouse studies.
 The goal here is to identify the signaling and downstream consequences of nasal tuft cell GPCRs,
which may be important therapeutic targets for respiratory infections, either to enhance antibacterial
immunity or reduce nasal/lung inflammation. We will utilize a novel genetic labeling strategy to express
fluorescent protein biosensors specifically in human tuft cells cultured from residual nasal surgical material.
This allows optical imaging of tuft cell function within an intact epithelial monolayer differentiated at air-liquid
interface. In Aim 1, we will use these methods to study how tuft cell GPCRs regulate Ca2+, cAMP, and other
pathways to fine tune antimicrobial peptide secretion. In Aim 2, we will study how these pathways regulate
electrical excitability of airway tuft cells and if/how membrane voltage changes contribute to tuft cell
responses. In Aim 3, we will elucidate mechanisms of how tuft cells secrete/release ACh and IL-25 in the
context of Th2 iairway disease. These data will clarify the regulation of intracellular signaling of human tuft
cells to better understand how to target them in airway diseases like CRS and possibly asthma."

There is scientific consensus that there are effective tools and strategies to control dengue, but program
failures are linked to improper implementation. This project brings together researchers with >23 years of
experience in community-based epidemiological dengue research in Iquitos, implementation science, and a
team that successfully developed and implemented a software platform DengueChat, in Nicaragua and
Paraguay, that mobilized communities to control mosquito producing containers in their own homes. Our
project directly addresses past implementation failures by using implementation science theories, models, and
frameworks (INSPIRE, CFIR), dengue epidemiology and entomology expertise, infrastructure and relationships
developed in Iquitos and Lima, and addresses three programmatic gaps identified in Iquitos and incorporates
key lessons learned from the Covid pandemic (differential response to changing risk level), to develop,
implement and evaluate “Proyecto Tariki” – an integrated dengue risk reduction program. Tariki will: (1)
mobilize community members to take control measures in their own homes, (2) enhance surveillance of
disease vectors and febrile case outbreaks, (3) improve triage and management of cases, (4) target and
deploy effective responses during periods of high transmission, (5) promote bi-directional data exchange
between community residents, health care providers and authorities, and other stakeholders, and (6) support
government programs through community engagement and training and implementation on pragmatic
evaluation protocols. We will conduct key-informant interviews and focus group discussions with health and
community stakeholders to understand the system problems and establish a fixed-group of stakeholders called
the ‘Tariki Champions’ (Aim 1). We will also adapt the proven DengueChat application to Iquitos and expand
the platform to include fever surveillance; DengueChat Plus will be the cornerstone of the Tariki program. Tariki
Champions will participate in group model building (GMB) workshops throughout the 5-year project to find
leverage within the system to plan, implement, and monitor and evaluate Tariki using mixed methods based on
RE-AIM metrics focused on epidemiological, entomological, and cost outcomes (Aims 1 and 2). In Year 3, after
reviewing all data using the CFIR domains (including program characteristics, costs, and processes), the
RMOH will take over management of Tariki and scale up program activities across the city of Iquitos (Aim 3),
continuing to monitor the program through RE-AIM metrics and pragmatic evaluations. We hypothesize that
Tariki will reduce risk for dengue by improving community mobilization for control, increasing community
surveillance for febrile illness and case management, and implementing pragmatic protocols for intervention
evaluation."

Diabetes-induced imbalance of autonomic efferent neuronal tone (reduced parasympathetic activity and
increased sympathetic activity) is involved in sudden cardiac death and is responsible for high mortality in
diabetic patients. Increasing cardiovascular vagal tone significantly reduces the mortality. Although
cardiovascular vagal function is severely damaged in diabetic patients, the potential mechanisms concerning
reduced cardiovascular vagal function in diabetes are poorly understood. Cardiovascular postganglionic vagal
neurons in intracardiac ganglia modulate the acetylcholine release via producing cell excitation and finally
regulate cardiovascular function. Our previous studies have shown that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
currents and cell excitability are reduced in vagal neurons, which contribute to cardiovascular vagal dysfunction
in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Based on our previous studies and preliminary data, we hypothesize that
leptin resistance-uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) signaling pathway and norepinephrine-
α1 adrenergic receptor-UCP2-H2O2 axis inactivate nAChR channels and further contribute to cardiovascular
vagal dysfunction in T2DM. Using multi-faceted technical approaches (from whole animals to cellular-molecular
levels) in sham and high-fat diet/low-dose streptozotocin-induced T2DM rats, we design in vivo and in vitro
studies to verify above hypotheses. In Specific Aim 1, we will measure if H2O2 overproduction in vagal
postganglionic neurons decreases nAChR currents and induces cardiovascular vagal dysfunction in T2DM. In
Specific Aim 2, we will test if leptin/leptin receptors influence nAChR currents and cardiovascular vagal function
in T2DM. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine if sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine-α1 adrenergic
receptor axis reduces nAChR currents and cardiovascular vagal function in T2DM. These studies will further our
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the impairment of vagal neuronal function
in T2DM and will discover potential therapeutic targets for improving cardiovascular vagal function and reducing
mortality in the T2DM state."

Infection with the common bacteria, Helicobacter pylori, is associated with a range of changes to the gastric
mucosa, resulting in conditions which can have significant effects on a patient’s morbidity and quality of life, in
addition to increasing risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. This proposal focuses on pre-malignant disease in the
stomach through clinically-relevant investigation of the synergy between H. pylori and host response in patients
with H. pylori infection and in gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM). In clinical practice, H. pylori is only considered
as present or absent. However, H. pylori strain-specific factors such as cytotoxin associated gene A, CagA,
interfere with the host adaptive immune system to allow H. pylori colonization in gastric mucosa. In addition, H.
pylori strains may carry antibiotic resistance genes that contribute to treatment failure and persistence of the H.
pylori infection, a known risk factor for gastric cancer development. In this proposal, the IMAGINE: Intestinal
Metaplasia And Gastritis INtErception Study, we aim to address major knowledge gaps relating to molecular
information about H. pylori heterogeneity and the relationship to gastric mucosal changes and outcomes.
Specifically, we will focus on generating new knowledge that will result in more effective H. pylori eradiation and
new approaches to cancer interception in premalignant gastric disease through identifying factors associated
with disease progression in patients with GIM. Our preliminary data suggest that in patients infected with H.
pylori, higher bacterial load and antibiotic resistance are associated with increased risk of persistence. The
combination of exposure to the CagA virulence factor with life stress exposures including current life-stress as
well as adverse childhood experiences may be associated with risk of progression. We hypothesize that the
combination of infection with virulent H. pylori strains and stress exposures synergistically contribute to the
development of premalignant disease in the stomach. A strength of our research program is the establishment
of proven recruitment strategies that have allowed us to build racially diverse cohorts, collecting detailed survey
information as well as biospecimens, to study premalignant disease in a high-risk population. Our goal is to build
knowledge of premalignant gastric disease that will help us address the starkly disparate outcomes related to H.
pylori-infection in the US, given both increased rates of gastric cancer incidence and survival in Black patients.
Through this work, we are also generating a large bank of gastric organoids including GIM from a diverse patient
population. Our work is particularly relevant as current clinical guidelines for GIM recognize the racial differences
but offer no guidance on how to incorporate this or knowledge of other risk factors into clinical Indeed,
surveillance of GIM among any patients is currently not recommended and strategies for risk-stratification are
lacking. Deeper understanding of the role of H. pylori-specific factors and host response may allow for
personalized, precision H. pylori treatment as well as better screening and surveillance strategies for GIM, and
ultimately gastric cancer interception."

 Global literature underscores that certain children and families are more likely to experience persistent
social and economic disadvantages often determined by their race, ethnicity, social group, or other socio-
demographic characteristics. Simultaneously, studies from diverse settings demonstrate unequal burdens of
disease and unequal access to timely, quality health services in early childhood, contributing to lifelong health
disparities. However, few studies have available data to examine the distinct ways that intergenerational
disadvantage contributes to disparities in illness burden and healthcare utilization among children under five
when morbidity and mortality risk are high. We address a critical gap in the research by estimating the
association of persistent intergenerational disadvantage and diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection
(ARI), with attention to the role of persistent disadvantage in determining the likelihood and type of healthcare
received, and potential modification by spatial remoteness.
 We use data from a longitudinal study of households that includes data on young children and their
parents, households, and communities. The availability of detailed, high-frequency measures of the incidence
and duration of diarrheal disease and ARI in combination with data on household and community context and
health services over time provides a unique opportunity to study these questions with three specific aims. The
first aim uses newly collected data about experiences of diarrheal disease and ARI among children under five
years of age to estimate the association between persistent disadvantage and children’s illness burden. The
second aim estimates the association between the burden of diarrheal disease and ARI and the likelihood and
characteristics of healthcare utilized. This aim also tests whether this association is modified by persistent
household disadvantage. The third aim investigates the roles of spatial remoteness, distance to health ser-
vices, and persistent household disadvantage as modifiers of the association between the burden of diarrheal
disease and ARI, and the likelihood and type of healthcare facility utilized. We will archive and disseminate all
data collected to facilitate innovative research on social and structural determinants of child health and
healthcare utilization outcomes, and inform child health and health equity programs globally.
 The effects of persistent, intergenerational social and economic disadvantage are increasingly important
considerations for providers and policymakers seeking to improve children’s health and health service
utilization, and to reduce health disparities that emerge in early childhood. This research will enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms through which exposure to persistent disadvantage shapes the health and
illness burden among young children; identify promising avenues for future research in this area; and generate
rigorous evidence for effective child health policies and interventions."
10798721,"Suicide represents a leading cause of maternal morbidity, with up to one in five maternal deaths in the United
States resulting from suicide or overdose. Suicidal ideation and self-harm (suicidality) in the peripartum period
are nearly 30 times more common than suicide death, and suicidality has steadily increased in the US. Perinatal
mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) affects at least one in five birthing individuals and often underlie suicidal
behaviors. Although mental health (MH) conditions predispose individuals for suicidality, environmental
influences, including health or economic stressors, may precipitate suicidal behavior. For instance, among
delivering women, an unintended or unwanted pregnancy represents a strong risk factor for both PMAD and
suicidal behavior. Macro-level stressors, such as restrictive state policies on marriage, divorce and reproductive
health services also increase suicide rates. But it remains unknown how state policies impact PMAD and MH
related maternal morbidity specifically. Restricted access to reproductive health services will disproportionately
affect subgroups of delivering individuals (low-income, geographically remote, or racial/ethnic groups) who are
already at risk for PMAD and its consequences because they are less able to overcome barriers. Consequently,
these policies may exacerbate existing disparities in maternal MH outcomes. The overarching goal of our
work seeks to characterize the consequences of restricting reproductive health service access on population
health. In this proposal, we will leverage the natural experiment created by the enactment of reproductive health
service restrictions on maternal health outcomes. We will assess the relationship between state policies and
PMAD rates (Aim 1), maternal morbidity (suicidality) (Aim 2), and mental health service utilization (Aim 3). We
will examine these relationships among Medicaid and commercially insured women within and across states with
and without state policies that restrict access to reproductive health services. This study directly responds to
NIMH High-Priority Areas for Research on Women’s Mental Health during the Perinatal Period (NOT-MH-
21-270), namely: research on perinatal depression and suicidal ideation and behaviors; research on perinatal
MH disorders in relation to engagement in medical care and clinical outcomes; research that identifies mutable
factors that impact utilization and outcomes, including disparities, which may serve as targets in future perinatal
MH care service delivery intervention development. It also addresses the Implementing a Maternal health and
PRegnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) initiative, which supports research on reducing
preventable causes of maternal deaths and improving health before, during, and after delivery."

This proposal describes experiments to investigate the role played by STRA6 in modulating transcription of
genetic pathways in the RPE. Mutations in human STRA6 are associated with Matthew-Wood syndrome, whose
symptoms include microphthalmia-anophthalmia, as well as pulmonary hypoplasia. STRA6 is found on the
surface of many blood-tissue barrier epithelia, including the RPE. Though almost exclusively described as a
retinoid transporter, STRA6 also is a cytokine signaling receptor, whose function in this role has only been
studied in non-ocular tissues. This provokes exciting speculation into its role in the RPE of the eye: what
molecular signaling is controlled by STRA6 in the RPE? How do the genes whose expression is
modulated by STRA6 contribute to RPE function or survival? Which pathway(s) are important to maintain
the health of the RPE, which sustains the photoreceptors? We will use zebrafish as a cone-rich model
system to address these questions. Our proposed research has three Specific Aims: (1) to uncover molecular
signaling important for RPE function whose expression is modulated by STRA6, (2) to dissect the contributions
from individual signaling pathways to the RPE by making precise pathway-specific amino acid changes to
STRA6, and (3) to inactivate genes whose expression is altered by STRA6 inactivation to understand their
contribution to RPE function and survival. We have used CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to inactivate both STRA6
and its ligand RBP4 to profile their contribution to transcriptional modulation in the whole animal eye and in
isolated human RPE culture. Together, our results will shed light on the under-appreciated role of STRA6 in RPE
homeostasis and maintenance, while providing novel opportunities to develop treatment strategies to aid survival
of RPE cells to prevent or combat retinal disease. This proposal directly addresses emerging needs outlined in
“NEI Strategic Plan – Vision for the Future 2021-2025”. Specifically, we will i) address gaps in animal models,
such as a model with a high density of cone photoreceptors; ii) explore strategies to treat complex disease such
as modulating the expression of specific genes or gene editing; iii) examine the roles of redox biology and
mitochondrial function in ocular health; and iv) identify ocular disease genes to develop new strategies, models,
and tools for elucidating genetic and environmental interactions at the cellular and systems level, and thereby
accelerate mechanistic understanding and therapy development."

The long-term goal of our research program is to develop chemistry that can facilitate the synergetic interaction
between biomolecules and small molecules to achieve site-selective transformations in a biological context. The
objective of this application is to develop the chemistry of N-oxides and integrate them into biological systems
that stand to benefit from reversible covalent modifications by prosthetic agents. N-oxides are versatile reagents
with a minimalist design that encapsulate both ligation and release properties. They are synthesized through a
rapid bioorthogonal hydroamination reaction and disassembled under similarly bioorthogonal conditions through
reduction. This chemistry allows the transient, yet controlled, attachment of small molecules to proteins or
proteins to small molecules and enables the temporary use of functional modules that are not normally present
in the active form of a protein or small molecule effector. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Development of
reactive species for target identification applications; 2) Development of proximity labeling tools for interactome
studies; 3) Development of biologically compatible directing group chemistry. In the first aim, we will develop
reactive chemical species that can functional proteins and use them to identify the molecular target of a bioactive
small molecule. In the second aim, we will develop new catalysts for proximity labeling. In the third aim, we will
develop chemical methods and reagents for the reversible covalent functionalization of proteins. We use the
chemistry to introduce small molecules or enzymes that can site-specifically modify proteins of interest with
native post-translational modifications. The approach we take is innovative because we make use of a unique
pair of chemical reactions that enables the rapid and complete bioorthogonal ligation and cleavage of two
components in either a single step or in two discrete and independent steps. This contrasts with existing
bioorthogonal tools designed either to ligate or to cleave but not to do both separately. The research we propose
is significant because it provides a new method for discovering proteins that interact in either an on-target or off-
target manner with a lead drug candidate, for studying the interactome of a protein complex, and for accessing
homogeneous preparations of native post-translationally modified proteins for biochemical and biophysical
studies. Most importantly, the fundamental chemistry we explore and the tools that we create will expand the
functional repertoire of chemistry that can be performed on biological systems and pave the way to new
discoveries."
10800075,"Stress and the resultant anxiety can provide motivation and prevent reckless behavior. However, when
experience in excess can be deleterious. This is particularly true when stressors occur during the peripubertal
period, when the brain is undergoing substantial plastic changes. In addition, there are significant male/female
differences in experience with stress. Thus, our studies in rats show that, although males and females show
similar impacts of peripubertal stress immediately after the stress, early stress preferentially impacts
cognitive/salience processes in males as adults and postpubertal stress impacting affective behaviors in females
as adults. Our preliminary results suggest that both male and female rats exposed to neurodevelopmental stress
show parvalbumin (PV) neuron loss in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) leading to a hyperdopaminergic state,
this occurs via different pathways and different periods within puberty depending on sex. Thus, prepubertal
(PreP) stress in males but not females leads to parvalbumin (PV) neuron loss in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and mesoassociative striatal dopamine hyperactivity, whereas postpubertal (PostP) stress in females but not
males leads to hyperactivity in the reuniens (RE) nucleus of the thalamus and medial mesolimbic dopamine
overdrive. We propose that this difference is due to a differential impact of medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC)
regulation, with infralimbic PFC (ilPFC) controlling RE activity and prelimbic PFC (plPFC) impacting the BLA.
Thus, our preliminary data suggest that stress has timing- and sex-specific impacts that elicit distinct pathologies
via different circuits in the adult. Our overarching hypothesis is that PreP stress causes males to be selectively
vulnerable to VTA-associative striatal DA hyperactivity in the adult via precocious maturation of the plPFC-
BLA pathway and loss of BLA PV interneurons. In contrast, PostP stress causes selective activation of the
RE, potentially via PV loss in the reticular thalamic nucleus innervated by the ilPFC, in females leading to
hyperactivation of the mesolimbic DA system in adults. We will examine this along three specific aims: 1)
Examine how PreP vs PostP stress impacts the BLA-vHipp projection in male and female rats. 2) Examine how
PreP vs PostP stress impacts the RE-vHipp projection in male and female rats, and 3) Examine how the plPFC
and ilPFC regulate BLA-vHIpp and RE-vHipp response to PreP and PostP stress. This will give substantial insight
into how early stress leads to circuit-wide disruptions that render an individual more susceptible to pathological
states as adults."

In Alaska (AK), smoking prevalence of Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people is more than double
that of non-Native adults (37% vs. 17%). Unlike other Indigenous populations, tobacco is not used in traditional
ceremony. Current cessation strategies have not reduced smoking prevalence among ANAI people. AK
geography (largely frontier and road-less) and climate further limit treatment access and reach. Based on
behavioral economic theory, financial incentives to promote cessation is a promising approach in other
populations, with smoking abstinence rates more than doubling one year after discontinued rewards compared
with no incentives. Community input for this study indicate family members are essential in supporting smoking
cessation; consistent with the ANAI cultural value of interdependence, defined as relationship-based,
collaborative, and reliance on family systems rather than individuals. Our research and others’ document the
influence of naturally occurring social support networks on smoking cessation. Family-based incentive
interventions have not been evaluated for smoking or other addictions. To fill this gap, the proposed study will
evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a culturally-adapted, ANAI family-based incentives
intervention for smoking cessation with the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt an effective 6-month financial
incentive intervention for ANAI people who smoke and family members; (2) Conduct a randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to evaluate reach and effectiveness of the intervention compared with the control condition on
confirmed, prolonged smoking abstinence at six and 12 months post-intervention; and (3) Evaluate key
process indicators relevant to intervention adoption, implementation, and maintenance, and conduct a cost-
effectiveness analysis to support further adaptation and dissemination. RCT-enrolled dyads (adult ANAI person
who smokes [index participant] and adult family member) will be stratified by index participant’s sex,
rural/urban location, residence with family member, and by family member’s smoking status, then randomized
to a no incentives control condition (n=328 dyads) or a 6-month incentive intervention (n=328 dyads). All dyads
will receive materials on evidence-based cessation resources, social support strategies, and family wellness.
We will measure index participant smoking status in both groups weekly for four weeks, and at three and six
months. Intervention index participants will receive rewards for verified smoking abstinence at each time point,
up to $750; and the family member will receive rewards (e.g., fuel or other needs) equal to the value earned by
the index participant. We will explore potential moderators (e.g., index participant sex) and mediators (e.g.,
interdependence) of intervention effects. To enhance reach, we will recruit participants statewide, primarily with
social media, and deliver the intervention virtually. If successful, our results will inform Tribal policy to adopt the
intervention within the AK Tribal Health System; and possibly, for use within ANAI communities beyond AK."
10828454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
I propose to investigate the neuronal control of orofacial behaviors in rodents. Orofacial behaviors in mature
rodents include ingestive behaviors such as licking and chewing, as well as exploratory behaviors, such as
sweeping movements of the facial whiskers, or “whisking”, sniffing, and directed nose and head movements.
Infants engage in suckling behavior, which involves both exploratory nipple-seeking movements and ingestive
sucking movements. The mammalian brainstem contains networks of neurons that control all of these orofacial
behaviors, and these networks are directed by other, more rostral parts of the brain that ensure that the
associated behaviors are executed in the appropriate context; that is, when the appropriate environmental and
internal sensory cues are present. I intend to investigate how these higher-order brain areas influence the
appropriate brainstem network modules to implement the animals’ decision to execute an appropriate orofacial
motor act.
 In the mentored phase of the project, I will focus on identifying the neuronal circuit mechanisms that
underlie suckling behavior in newborn mice, a topic which, despite its importance for mammalian survival, has
been largely ignored by neuroscientists in recent years. To identify neuronal cell-types that are active during
suckling, I have been measuring the co-expression of immediate-early-genes along with cell-type specific
molecular markers. I can then use the identified neuronal cell-type markers as genetic entry-points to trace the
neuronal circuits they comprise. At the same time, I have been developing new viral vector tools to rapidly
deliver modern molecular tracers and actuators to the early postnatal mouse brain to probe the mechanisms by
which these neuronal circuits code suckling behavior. During the award period, I will use these new tools to (1)
map the input/output connectivity of identified suckling-active neuronal populations, and (2) manipulate the
activity of these populations in-vivo to determine their roles in generating and maintaining suckling behavior. In
the independent phase I will extend my focus to the broader repertoire of ingestive and exploratory orofacial
behaviors in adult mice, with the goal of understanding (3) how forebrain inputs to brainstem orofacial pre-
motoneurons may gate the expression of these behaviors depending on the environmental and motivational
context. Investigating the brainstem modules for such innate motor acts represent an ideal model for studying
how networks of connected neurons in the brain control simple behaviors and how nervous systems make
decisions.
 The mentored phase of the project, conducted under the direction of Dr. Catherine Dulac at Harvard
University and Dr. Samuel Pfaff at the Salk Institute, outlines a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of a
unique combination of technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to an independent
research position."
10932871,"Subcellular organization of intracellular molecules regulates basic cell functions such as growth, division, proliferation, and differentiation. By regulating subcellular neighborhoods of RNAs and proteins, cells survive but also specialize in a multicellular system. While subcellular localization mechanisms are widely studied, the role of subcellular neighborhoods in determining the cellular response to stimuli and multiple drugs has been limited to a few low-throughput and low-sensitivity molecular studies. Little is known about how these highly coordinated subcellular neighborhoods give rise to tissue-specificity, tissue-sate, and how they regulate cell function in distinct subcellular volumes of tissue states and phenotypes. Image-based visualization of molecular neighborhoods has explored only a few target molecules, yielding evidence of the importance of subcellular localization of transcripts and protein factors. One bottleneck in subcellular regulation is the lack of models explaining neighborhood interactions of molecules that are driving cellular response in tissues from distinct abnormalities. Previous work established multiplexed gene expression measurements to model subcellular RNA neighborhoods and multiparameter protein analysis to quantify spatial signaling protein neighborhoods that are altered in response to perturbations. However, dominant signaling protein and RNA neighborhoods have not been established at a physically meaningful resolution in widely employed mesenchymal and epithelial cells as they respond to perturbations, experience differentiation events, or adapt to tissue environments of individuals treated with cell-based or small molecule interventions for correcting abnormalities due to genetic or molecular dysfunction. Thus, the long-term goal of this project is to leverage advanced high-throughput screening and spatially resolved genomic and protein measurements in single cells for modeling molecular neighborhoods in populations and tissue contexts. To achieve these tasks, using recent advances in sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplexed protein imaging, this proposal plans to 1) mechanistically dissect the molecular RNA and protein neighborhoods using proximity ligation assays, 2) enhance the spatial information capacity of molecular neighborhoods using 3D super-resolution microscopy and temporal evolution of molecular neighborhoods by pseudo-temporal differentiation models, 3) evaluate the outcome of subcellular neighborhood organization and tissue context of mesenchymal cells near vessels and epithelial cells near linings from human specimens isolated from health restoring interventions. Molecular benchmarking and normal tissue annotations will be performed in collaboration with signaling biology, bioinformatics, biomanufacturing, and pathology experts. Cross-scale molecular control from subcellular neighborhoods to tissue organization will reveal how a systemic response to treatments can be re-stratified by network variance of molecular neighborhoods. This MIRA proposal sheds light on the spatially resolved subcellular organization in health and disease, providing a predictive metric for deciphering tissue-state control and alterations in many disorders."
10801484,"Salmonella enterica serotypes are invasive enteric pathogens spread through fecal contamination of food
and water sources. It represents a constant public health threat in the U.S. and around the world. Impaired
intestinal barriers are associated with bacterial infection. Vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) levels are inversely
related to chronic inflammation in infectious diseases. The objective of this application is to study VDR regulation
of intestinal tight junctions (TJs) in response to Salmonella infection. Our publications and preliminary data have
shown that: (1) lack of VDR makes the host susceptible to Salmonella invasion; (2) Salmonella targets TJ
proteins (e.g., ZO-1, Claudin) and facilitates pathogenic enteric bacterial invasion. (3) We have identified the
sequence of functional vitamin D response element in Claudin- 5 and 15, two novel target genes of VDR; (4)
impaired VDR leads to reduced expression of TJ proteins Claudin- 5 and 15, increased “leaky” protein Claudin
2, and increased permeability in infection; and (5) probiotics and their products enhance VDR function and inhibit
Salmonella infection. Thus, we hypothesize that: “intestinal epithelial VDR regulation of barrier function is
aberrant or lost in infectious states and restoring VDR function will attenuate severe infection and chronic
inflammation.” We have now developed state-of-the-art transgenic models and cutting-edge methods, e.g.,
integrated three-dimensional microscopy for a spatial junction protein atlas and single-cell spatial proteomics for
geographic profiling of the TJ protein expressions. Our research team includes experts in the following areas:
epithelial biology, animal models, bioengineering, and microbiology. Two Specific Aims have been designed:
 Aim 1. Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which intestinal VDR regulates barrier
function that is essential for mucosal homeostasis. We will: A. Elucidate the mechanism for abnormal
epithelial TJs coregulated by Claudins and their interactions in the VDR-/- organoids in vitro. B. Study regional
and spatial Claudins, their interactions, and integrations with other barrier layers: microbiome and mucin. And C.
Determine the mechanism for abnormal epithelial TJs, including spatial and omics studies of TJs, in the intestine
of the VDRΔIEC and VDR overexpressed mice with or without infection. Aim 2. Investigate microbial
metabolites and TJs vs. VDR for therapeutic strategies in inflammation and infection. We will A. Evaluate
the roles and mechanisms of enhanced intestinal TJs vs. VDR expression by probiotic lactic acid bacterial
proteins and metabolites in infected mice. B. Engineer probiotic bacteria strains for better outcomes in treatment
of inflammation and infection. Our studies are innovative because they are focused on 1) understanding novel
regulatory roles of VDR in Claudins and their interactions in infection; 2) developing cutting edge technologies
and tools (organoids, transgenic mice, and spatial imaging) for studying intestinal biology; and 3) enhancing
intestinal VDR expression by probiotics and microbial metabolites. This knowledge can then be exploited for
strategies to prevent and treat digestive diseases by restoring VDR and enhancing barrier functions."

Importance of the proposed research. Prenatal cannabis use is increasingly common and could have
largescale negative impacts on maternal and fetal health. Legalization of cannabis has led to the proliferation
of new cannabis products with various modes of administration (e.g., vaping, edibles, dabbing blunts) that
differ by THC potency and secondary exposures (e.g., nicotine, chemicals from vaping). Yet, we know little
about how women use cannabis pre- and during pregnancy, whether modes vary with socio-demographics or
local cannabis policies, or how modes relate to cannabis use frequency, cannabis use disorder (CUD),
polysubstance use, quitting use in pregnancy, or adverse health outcomes. To fill this important gap in the
literature, we will conduct an innovative mixed-methods study of ~310,000 racially and ethnically diverse
pregnancies within Kaiser Permanente Northern CA (KPNC) from 2021 to 2026, where patients are universally
screened for substance use as part of standard prenatal care via self-report and urine toxicology testing. Using
rich electronic health record data and cannabis retailer and policy data, our study will examine socio-
demographic and policy correlates of modes of use pre- and during pregnancy and test how modes relate to
the risk of daily use, CUD, polysubstance use, substance use disorders (SUD), quitting pre- or during
pregnancy, addiction treatment, and cannabis-related psychiatric and medical outcomes. With a focus on
disparities, we will also examine differences in key associations by socio-demographic factors and test whether
socio-demographic differences in continued cannabis use during pregnancy are mediated by differences in
modes of administration. To gain further clinical insight and guide next steps, we will conduct interviews with
pregnant women who used cannabis before and/or during pregnancy to understand factors influencing mode
choice, perceived benefits/harms of different modes, changes in modes during pregnancy, and experiences
with quitting. Findings will have immediate public health and clinical implications, providing critical information
about the diverse ways in which women administer cannabis that could shift research and clinical practice
paradigms. Results will also provide important data on whether local regulatory practices (e.g., cannabis
retailer density, restrictiveness of local policies, warnings on prenatal use) are associated with variation in
patterns of modes of cannabis use, informing the development of future regulations throughout the US. Finally,
this unique study cohort will be a rich resource for future research on the impact of different modes of cannabis
administration on fetal and neonatal outcomes."
10803867,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens has been implicated in drug
seeking and reward since the 1950s, when it was shown to mediate the effects of cocaine and opiates. However,
our and other’s recent work has shown that DA also plays a role in another circuitry critical for drug dependence.
Within the rostral striatum (tail of the striatum: TS) – the central locus where auditory DA, cortical and thalamic
axons converge to control auditory learning – DA neurotransmission is necessary for learned association of a
sound with a behavior, such as drug self-administration. To address this role for DA, we have developed novel
technical approaches that allow us to measure activity and neuronal signaling during associative learning and
recall tests, and then to correlate changes in animal behavior and in vivo synaptic activity with detailed ex vivo
analysis after learning. These experiments have led to the identification of a new form of synaptic plasticity that
occurs at auditory thalamic inputs to the TS projection neurons, consisting of a simultaneous decrease in overall
activity with a concurrent increase in response to a specific sound cue. This form of enhanced signal-to-noise
response by specific synapses may provide a basis of sensory cue learning. This project tests i) the precise
physiological and molecular steps required for auditory sensory learning; ii) the role played by the TS dopamine
and glutamate neurotransmission in this form of learning and synaptic plasticity, and iii) a role of DA in “refining”
TS synaptic circuits in order to allow further learning. These experiments promise to unveil the molecular steps
responsible for the action of addictive drugs such as amphetamine and opiates that drive self-administration,
and will further be important for understanding language disorders, hallucinations and affective disorders
including ADHD and PTSD."

 Tissue stem cells are rare, undifferentiated cells that are capable of self-renewal and are essential for
fueling the homeostasis and regeneration of the tissue in which they reside. They are often quiescent, and
when activated, they proliferate and differentiate to produce mature cell types with specialized functions. Stem
cell activities are jointly controlled by the intrinsic gene expression program and the signals from the
surrounding tissue microenvironment. Dissecting the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern stem cell
quiescence and activation is important not only for gaining fundamental knowledge of tissue and stem cell
biology, but also for understanding how to manipulate cell fates in tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine. Myriad regenerative epithelial tissues, such as mammary gland, skin, and prostate, house stem cells
in their basal cell compartment. We use two mammalian tissues, mammary gland and skin, each with its
unique advantages and clinical relevance, as complimentary model systems to study both general and tissue-
specific mechanisms underlying the regulation of basal cell fate and stem cell activities. Our research has
elucidated the function of key transcription and chromatin factors in mammary and skin basal/stem cell gene
regulation, and how these factors interface with major signaling pathways to control the activation, proliferation,
differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of basal stem cells. The recent advent of single-cell
sequencing technology has enabled us to systematically probe the cellular and molecular heterogeneities of
mammary and skin basal cells, allowing a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of their
compositions and characteristics as well as providing novel insights into the sequence of events in stem cell
activation and differentiation. In the next five years, we will continue to employ a multi-disciplinary approach
combining single-cell genomics and spatial gene expression mapping with tissue-specific gene knockout and
lineage tracing, in vivo and ex vivo stem cell assays, as well as molecular studies to address two major
knowledge gaps regarding mammary basal stem cells: how their quiescence is maintained and active
expansion is achieved. Specifically, we will test the innovative hypothesis that a low level of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling and molecular cross-talks between basal cells and specific macrophage subsets are critical for
maintaining basal stem cell quiescence. We will also characterize the novel function and regulation of a newly
discovered subset of basal cells as transit amplifying progenitor cells that serve as workhorses to drive basal
cell expansion during mammary epithelial morphogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration. When and where
applicable, we will perform parallel analysis on skin in order to identify potentially general principles and
strategies underlying basal cell-macrophage cross-talks. Our findings will expose novel intrinsic and extrinsic
regulators of basal stem cell quiescence and active expansion. This knowledge is fundamental to preventing
stem cell depletion and regenerative diseases as well as to understanding cancer cell dormancy."
10803883,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Sleep-wake (S/W) disturbances are a common problem in neurodegenerative diseases, and often the main
reason for institutionalization. However, there are few effective treatments for S/W disruption specific to such
diseases and grounded on their underlying causes. Evidence suggests a bidirectional link between S/W disrup-tion and brain accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), but we and others have found evidence that specific phosphory-lated tau (p-tau) neuropathology is also involved in S/W problems. In our current funding cycle, we discovered
that both Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) involve tau accumulation, but
the patterns of their neuronal losses in S/W-regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei, and also their sleep
dysregulation, diverge markedly, pointing to distinct, selective, differential vulnerability to tauopathies. Based
on multiple breakthrough findings of divergent S/W behavior profiles of AD & PSP, and novel neuropathological
methods we developed, in the proposed renewal we aim to ascertain molecular and neurotransmitter activity
changes in vulnerable S/W disruption-driving neuromodulatory subcortical systems (NSS) regions in AD and
PSP, toward guiding selection of medications that modulate NSS function.
In AD, we found that tau-related neurodegeneration of wake-promoting (W) neurons of NSS contributes
strongly to sleep problems and correlates with AD's typical pattern of sleep fragmentation and excessive day-
time sleepiness. In contrast, we found that PSP features insomnia, short sleep duration, and deficient daytime
sleep recovery, with largely intact W neurons despite presence of tau, thus implicating selective vulnerability of
NSS sleep-promoting (S) neurons. In AD, we unexpectedly found tau-related loss of lateral hypothalamic (LH)
orexin (ORX) neurons, prior to any losses in the wake-promoting locus ceruleus. We also found an early
pattern of neuroinflammatory-related gene upregulation in both locus ceruleus and lateral hypothalamic area in
AD that differs from that seen in PSP. Such disease-specific compensatory responses in S/W-regulating nuclei
have been entirely unknown and are highly relevant to potential development of targeted drugs. There is thus
urgent need to map disease-specific NSS neurobiology beyond neuronal loss or tau/Aβ presence, to enable
rational, disease-specific therapies. We hypothesize that our innovative clinicopathogical paradigm can reveal
disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms of S/W disturbances, measured by deep antemortem phenotyping of
S/W macrostructure (e.g. sleep stages) and microstructure. We will analyze and compare clinical,
neurohistopathological and molecular correlates in our ongoing cohorts of antemortem & postmortem PSP,
AD, and healthy controls (HC). Our key hypothesis is that tau deposition and later neuronal loss and pan-
network compensatory effects on NSS neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter/peptide (NT) release, and NT
receptor gene expression mediate differential changes in sleep-wake physiology: 1) in AD, predominantly via
molecular changes in wake-promoting nuclei, but 2) in PSP, via changes in NREM-promoting nuclei."
10934568,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over the past several years, concerns have escalated across the globe regarding the lack of knowledge about
the long-term effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT; puberty suppression, estrogen,
testosterone) for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth, resulting in widespread legislation and policy
recommendations restricting TGD youth’s access to this treatment. Simultaneously, research demonstrating
short-term improvements in psychosocial functioning (e.g., mental health (MH) and quality of life (QoL)) among
TGD youth receiving GAHT has been steadily accumulating and standards of care continue to support their
use. Unfortunately, studies remain limited by short follow-up periods and small sample sizes. As the volume
and diversity of youth presenting for care is growing, concerns over the stability of TGD youth’s identities and
the likelihood they will regret treatment are also increasing. However, lack of research on within-group
differences in TGD youth’s psychosocial trajectories while receiving GAHT leaves providers with little guidance
on how to individualize care. More broadly, research is limited by poor measurement of gender dysphoria and
lack of inclusion of minority stress and resilience (MSR) factors, which are particularly pronounced in the
current sociopolitical climate. The functioning of parents of youth receiving GAHT has also been overlooked
despite the critical role parents play in the mental health of TGD youth. The proposed project leverages the
longest-running study of TGD youth receiving GAHT in the United States to address each of these critical gaps
in the literature. This study is being conducted at the first and largest multidisciplinary gender-affirming care
program for TGD youth in the Southwest US and has enrolled nearly 700 families since the program was
founded in 2014. The aims of the project are to (1) characterize the 5- and 8-year trajectories of psychosocial
functioning among TGD youth receiving GAHT (including gender dysphoria, MSR, MH, QoL) and their parents
(including MSR and QoL), including how these trajectories influence each other over time, (2) identify and
explore the characteristics of subgroups of individuals who share similar baseline and longitudinal experiences
of gender dysphoria (youth) and MSR (youth, parents), and (3) assess the temporal relationships between MH
(youth), QoL (youth and parents), and sociopolitical stress, including factors that moderate the impact of this
unique form of stress. We will also explore the characteristics and trajectories of youth who experience
changes in their gender and/or stop treatment. The project will be guided by a community-based participatory
approach that will collaborate with TGD youth and their parents throughout the research process, including in
the selection of additional measures to better capture gender dysphoria and sociopolitical stress. Given TGD
youth are at heightened risk of experiencing a broad range of adverse psychosocial outcomes, identifying
methods to relieve distress and promote healthy development is particularly urgent. The proposed project will
provide critical empirical guidance on how to do so."
10804175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mammalian hearing sensitivity depends on the amplification of sound-evoked cochlear vibrations by outer hair
cells (OHCs). How these cells provide amplification across the frequency range of mammalian hearing remains
unresolved. This limits our ability to rehabilitate and eventually restore what is missing in ears with OHC
damage, which is a common cause of hearing loss. While amplification has been proposed to result from the
OHCs’ ability to change length and generate force, multiple sources of low-pass filtering are thought to
attenuate this motile response at high frequencies. It is therefore uncertain if OHC motility can work fast
enough to provide high-frequency force generation on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Additionally, recent observations
of large, sustained OHC length changes during sound stimulation suggest that these tonic responses may
serve as an alternative mechanism for modulating high-frequency vibrations, possibly by altering OHC
stiffness. However, the functional relevance of such tonic responses has yet to be tested. To study cycle-by-
cycle and tonic OHC motility in vivo, we will use optical coherence tomography to measure vibrations of the
OHC region in the mouse cochlea. Preliminary data from the cochlear apex supports the central hypothesis
that OHC motility can indeed provide high-frequency, cycle-by-cycle amplification in spite of low-pass filtering,
and that slow or tonic OHC length changes do not play a significant mechanical role. Here, we will test this
hypothesis more definitively by examining vibrations from the base of the mouse cochlea, which responds to
very high frequencies. In Aim 1, we will determine whether sound elicits fast OHC length changes in the
cochlear base and assess how these responses are shaped by low-pass filtering. Our hypothesis predicts that
sound will cause large OHC length changes at the requisite high frequencies, even if the responses are low-
pass filtered. In Aim 2, we will test whether tonic OHC responses play a role in regulating high-frequency
cochlear vibrations. Since direct observation of tonic OHC length changes may be constrained by the stiffness
of the basal cochlear partition, the strength of tonic responses will be inferred from the presence of vibratory
distortions that are thought to be generated by the same underlying nonlinear processes. OHC length will then
be slowly, acoustically modulated in order to test whether slow and/or tonic length changes influence vibrations
at higher frequencies. Regardless of the strength of any observed or inferred tonic responses, our hypothesis
predicts that slowly modulating OHC length will have little effect on high-frequency vibrations. Pursuing these
aims will reveal how OHCs operate in their natural mechano-electrical environment and identify the
mechanisms underlying high-frequency hearing sensitivity. The knowledge gained may inform future efforts to
develop novel rehabilitative strategies and regenerate functional, amplifying OHCs."

Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is an autosomal-dominant disease that causes recurrent acute pancreatitis (AP)
and eventually progresses to chronic pancreatitis (CP). Unfortunately, HP patients also have a 44% cumulative
risk of pancreatic cancer by age 70. No targeted intervention is currently available. Lack of animal models poses
a big challenge to study the disease pathogenesis. Since the discovery of the gain-of-function mutant
PRSS1R122H as a major cause of human HP nearly 26 years ago, many attempts to develop HP animal models
have not been so successful. Recently, we were able to generate a novel mouse HP model by expressing both
human PRSS1R122H and PRSS2. Heterozygous PRSS1R122H-PRSS2 HP mice are more sensitive to various
stimuli in developing more severe AP than wild-type mice, while homozygous HP mice develop AP
spontaneously at ~20 days old after birth which gradually progress to CP. During the studies of our new HP
models, we observed that, in addition to the gain-of-function mutations, PRSS1 expression levels may also
control the initiation of HP. Furthermore, a lower dose of cerulein (7.5 ug/kg), which activates less trypsin than
high doses (100 ug/kg), paradoxically induced hemorrhagic AP, a more severe and often lethal form of AP. In
contrast, high doses of cerulein only cause edematous AP. With these new findings, we hypothesize that the
expression levels of trypsinogens and the location of active enzymes determine the spontaneous initiation and
severity of HP. In Specific Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanisms that upregulate the expression of pancreatic
trypsinogens during the spontaneous initiation of HP. Various diets, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and
intracellular signaling pathways in the regulations of PRSS1 expression and the initiation of HP will be studied
using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of active
trypsin location in the development of hemorrhagic AP. We will characterize the histopathologic features
including damage of pancreatic ducts and vasculature in the hemorrhagic models, determine the dose-
dependent effects of cerulein and bombesin on trypsin activation and localization, define the molecular
mechanisms through which trypsin damages the pancreatic duct and vasculature, and evaluate the therapeutic
effects of inhibiting extracellular trypsin on hemorrhagic AP. Impact: This study will provide novel insights into
the spontaneous initiation of HP and the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic AP. Some of the pathway inhibitors tested
in this study are FDA-approved drugs for other disease conditions. Therefore, they can be readily translated to
these diseases. Our study will also pave the ways for developing other novel effective preventive and therapeutic
interventions."

Periodontitis is a common, chronic, inflammatory disease, triggered by subgingival microbial agents, which can
lead to tooth loss and contribute to systemic inflammation. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an important systemic
modifier of periodontitis, associated with increased severity and progression of periodontal destruction in affected
individuals. Of note, there are large disparities in the prevalence of both periodontitis and T2DM, with minority
and low socio-economic status individuals, especially Blacks, being disproportionately affected.
Although pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory signaling have been described as mechanisms underlying
enhanced periodontal destruction, especially in the presence of T2DM, the specific, upstream events involving
innate immunity and immune cell recruitment are still not fully understood. Recent studies at the single-cell level
from our group revealed that: 1) there is heterogeneity in resident immune cells in gingival tissue and in
circulating monocytes/macrophages in periodontitis and T2DM; 2) there is a systemic pre-programming of
circulating monocytes towards a pro-inflammatory state in patients with periodontitis and T2DM; 3) there are
race-specific cellular changes in gingival tissue in periodontitis, including a decrease in immune tolerant PD-L1+
monocyte/macrophages in Blacks, associated with reduced anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype; and 4)
the epigenetic regulator JMJD3 can control macrophage polarization and function in periodontitis.
These preliminary findings strongly support the feasibility and significance of the three specific aims in the
present application. The proposed work is original and innovative as it seeks to shift current thinking in the field.
We plan to build upon our previous work and test our overarching hypothesis that periodontitis, on its own and
especially when complicated by T2DM, significantly affects the cellular composition, transcriptomic profile, and
monocyte/macrophage activation and function locally (gingival tissue) and systemically (circulation), and that
race plays an important role in this setting. First, we propose to dissect the single-cell transcriptomic signature
and functional network of myeloid-derived cells in periodontitis patients without or with T2DM. Using single-cell
RNA-sequencing, we will identify the transcriptional networks associated with immune cells in gingival tissue and
blood samples of periodontitis patients versus healthy controls, and the added burden conferred by T2DM. Then,
we propose to identify the effects of race on monocyte/macrophage signaling and function in periodontitis
patients without or with T2DM. We will explore the biological basis for the observed periodontal health disparities
in Blacks, namely differences in immune cellular composition, function, and signaling locally and systemically.
Lastly, we aim to identify the role of the epigenetic regulator JMJD3 in modulation of macrophage phenotype
and function in periodontitis. Taken together, several notable conceptual and methodological innovations have
been introduced in this application to move the field forward. The proposed studies, with a focus on health
disparities, will assist in increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis and its link with T2DM."

10803144,"ABSTRACT
Mechanical load is a fundamental regulator of cardiac function. The heart operates in a dynamically changing
mechanical environment, and alterations in intra-cardiac pressure and/or volume preload/afterload influence
cardiac performance to coordinate cardiac output with venous return and arterial blood supply. A crucial aspect
of this regulation is the modulation of heart rate, which is controlled by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary
pacemaker of the heart. The SAN anatomy and location within the heart enable it to detect fluctuations in both
coronary and atrial blood pressure, establishing a structural foundation for the regulation of heart rate through
SAN mechanosensitivity in response to hemodynamic changes. Although physiological stretch is an essential
component of the SAN autoregulatory feedback mechanism, chronically elevated stretch results in severe
myocardial remodeling and leads to SAN dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome. Conditions
associated with mechanical overload, such as hypertension, often exhibit SND, which manifests as bradycardia,
irregular atrial pauses, and sinus arrest/block. The upstream mechanisms of SND in the hypertensive heart are
unexplored and contribute to lack of preventative intervention. We will address this gap in knowledge by
employing a combination of several multi-level cutting-edge imaging modalities of cellular microarchitecture, Ca2+
and cAMP dynamics, electrophysiological measurements, biochemical studies, and computational modeling to
demonstrate an innovative concept that proposes a tight association between mechanical loading, SAN
pacemaking, and its regulation by the autonomic nervous system through a mechanosensitive caveolar
pacemaker signalosome. This caveolar domain provides the spatiotemporal foundation for mechano-
electrochemical signal transduction and heart rhythm regulation, which involves stretch-induced augmentation
of cAMP production and cAMP/PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ca2+ handling and sarcolemmal proteins as
well as activation of caveolar mechano-sensitive ion channels. We propose that prolonged (chronic) atrial
overload leads to the degradation of caveolae, causing SND and an altered response to both mechanical and
autonomic stimulation, which forms the molecular basis for chronotropic incompetence. Preventing caveolae
degradation or restoring caveolae structures could alleviate SND phenotype and improve the SAN ability to
adequately respond to emotional or physical stressors. This research holds significant potential impact as it will
provide mechanistic insights that can serve as a foundation for developing innovative therapeutic strategies
aimed at preventing SND in hypertensive individuals."

Adoptive cell transfers constitute a new paradigm in cell-based therapeutics with wide-ranging applications
from neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, autoimmune disorders as well as cancer. Autologous lymphocytes
from the patient are genetically engineered to express receptors to specific antigens on the cell surface of
target cells and reinfused back into the patient for therapeutic action. However, once administered the fate of
cells remains uncertain. In order to answer important questions regarding distribution, turnover and eventual
survival of the cells, techniques to non-invasively monitor these genome-edited cells is necessary. Molecular
imaging, particularly Positron emission tomography is advantageous over traditional diagnostic and imaging
tools because it enables diagnosis and tracking of radiotracers in real-time, is non-invasive and has the highest
sensitivity among clinical imaging modalities. We propose to develop analogues of Green fluorescent
protein/luciferase for nuclear imaging, thus combining the highly desirable elements from both these powerful
modalities towards a chemogenetic nuclear imaging modality. The metallophore-transporter complex found in
bacteria is genetically encoded in the prokaryotic DNA and offers the ideal chemical-biological pair that can be
expressed on mammalian cells to enable nuclear imaging and tracking of these cells. By engineering
mammalian cells to ectopically express the bacterial transporters, we will be able to selectively target and
image the genome -edited cells in vivo using metallophore-radionuclide probes. Bacterial metallophores have
evolved to serve as metal chelators for a wide variety of metals with the majority showing a high binding affinity
for iron. However, several pathogenic bacteria secrete metallophores with the highest binding affinity for
copper(II) (Cu). We, therefore, propose to use 64Cu, a popular radionuclide in Positron Emission Tomography
(PET) imaging to generate metallophore/64Cu complexes as contrast agents. We have identified metallophores
that are able to evade the innate immune system and avoid imminent sequestration. Combined with simple
and one-step processing techniques, they are attractive agents for depth-independent real-time imaging,
tracking and identifying genome-edited cells. Because the native or wild type cells do not express these
transporters, we expect minimal uptake in normal mammalian cells including native bacterial “commensal”
flora, as they remain exclusive to pathogenic bacteria. We hypothesize that through a combination of facile
coordinate complexation chemistry, high selectivity, immune evasiveness and non-endogenous nature,
bacterial metallophore/64Cu will serve as ideal nuclear imaging probes to identify and accurately detect GECs
in vivo. In the first phase we will develop and evaluate the bacteria transporter protein mammalian expression
vector and subsequently will be able to incorporate the vectors into CAR-T-Cells for in vivo reporting. In the
next phase we will determine the in vivo pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and PET imaging of the probes and
genome-edited cells in animal models. In summary this project we will use metallophores as dual role
compounds - as a chelator as well as a targeting ligand for imaging, which is novel and innovative. If
successful, this strategy will enable precise labeling of individual genome-edited cells non-invasively in vivo
and potentially avoiding the shortfall of previous PET reporters such as immunogenicity and low selectivity.
Due to the broad impact and transformative potential of this project we envision a quick and clear path to
clinical trials beyond project phase."
10803319,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this revised R01, we propose to use novel synthetic transcription factors (TFs) delivered to the mouse
nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, to uncover and manipulate the cell-type-specific brain
molecular processes that distinguish stimulant versus opioid addiction. This will enable us to generate
knowledge critical for the design of the next generation of drug-specific, anti-addiction medications. An existing
body of literature suggests that, in response to use of addictive drugs, the function of key TFs within the cells
that comprise brain reward regions drive transcriptional adaptations and lasting changes in drug use behaviors.
Preliminary and published data point to NAc ZFP189, a member of the KRAB-domain containing zinc-finger
(KZFP) TF family, as highly sensitive to cocaine use, and causal in worsening stimulant- but not opioid-related
behaviors. This suggests that the NAc ZFP189 TF is uniquely sensitive to, and contributes to, the brain
adaptations that worsen stimulant addiction. Here, we have reprogrammed ZFP189 to create synthetic TFs,
each possessing functional moieties that exert distinct forms of transcriptional control at in vivo target genes.
This enables us to uncover how the stimulant versus opioid use experience differentially primes the epigenetic
status of NAc cells to facilitate the function of drug-specific TFs. In Aim 1 we will virally deliver synthetic
ZFP189 TFs to the NAc of mice, dose with repeated stimulant or opioid treatments, and perform multiome
single nuclei ATAC and RNA sequencing. This will reveal the biological mechanisms through which stimulant
versus opioid exposure enables drug-specific TF function, the transcriptional adaptations that facilitate specific
drug addictions, and the NAc cell-types in which this occurs. In Aim 2, we will virally deliver synthetic ZFP189
TFs to mouse NAc and investigate their contribution to stimulant versus opioid conditioned and drug self-
administration reward-related behaviors. This will reveal how drug-specific transcriptional neuroadaptations
may differentially drive a worsening of stimulant- versus opioid-related behaviors. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
introduce novel synthetic TF co-factors, capable of re-programming the in vivo gene-regulatory function of the
entire KZFP TF family, to interrogate how distinct KZFP members are recruited to worsen stimulant- versus
opioid addiction. To accomplish this, we will virally deliver variants of the KZFP co-factor, TRIM28, to
simultaneously dysregulate members of the KZFP TF family within the NAc. We will perform self-administration
for stimulants and opioids and subject tissues to single nuclei RNA sequencing. This will uncover the collective
contribution of NAc KZFPs to the worsening of stimulant and opioid drug behaviors and reveal the KZFPs, and
their regulated genes, that most drive these damaging effects. Together, this research will provide new
approaches to identify the TF functions at the core of specific drug addictions and yield refined gene
candidates as targets for future drug-specific medications."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality
impacting individuals across all ethnic groups in the US. CVD and T2D are largely driven by the rising prevalence
of obesity, but also impacted by genetics and environmental exposures. Weight loss surgery (WLS) is a safe
effective treatment that can sustainably reduce CVD risk and T2D incidence, but the underlying mechanisms are
not well understood. Sleeve gastrectomy is currently more popular WLS procedure, but growing evidence shows
that sustained improvement of higher magnitude is achieved with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Hence,
RYGB is a useful model to study biomarkers and/or pathways of metabolic risk improvement in a high-risk
population. Although surgical changes are made to the gut anatomy, the body weight “set point” is lowered, long-
term weight and cardiometabolic disease risk are reduced, albeit with a range of success among individuals.
Human and animal studies have shown that changes in hormones, bile acids, diet, gut tissue expression and
the microbiome are conveyed to metabolically relevant organs and can provide clues on the pathways of
improved cardiometabolic health post-WLS. Because no single critical change has been identified so far, it is
possible that multiple parallel pathways convey the signals via the circulation. Metabolites are small molecules
determined by the integration of genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic variation, while being
responsive to environmental factors such as diet, gut microbiota, xenobiotics, and other exposures. Metabolites
such as branched-chain amino acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholines are known markers
of increased CVD risk and T2D, but markers of risk reduction are not yet well characterized. For Aim 1 of the
proposed project, we will identify the markers associated with CVD risk reduction and T2D resolution in a large
cohort (~1000) of individuals with RYGB from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study
1 year after RYGB. Integrated analysis of differentially expressed metabolites and genes from human gut
transcriptome before and after RYGB will identify gut specific changes. For Aim 2, we will assess the markers
of sustained CVD and T2D risk reduction at 1 and 5 years after surgery and validate them in subjects with
metabolite data before and after medical or surgical weight loss. For Aim 3, we will identify the causal role of
known and newly identified metabolites and/or associated pathways with cardiometabolic health by mendelian
randomization. This unprecedented integration of genetics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data in
WLS will lead to identification of biomarkers, pathways and causal links that may help devise novel non-surgical
methods to improve cardiometabolic health or preventive strategies with broad public health implications."
10803016,"SUMMARY
The three-dimensional organization of the genome regulates gene expression, impacting fundamental
biological processes in development, homeostasis and disease. Deep understanding of the relationship
between genome structure and function requires insight into 3D chromatin architecture at individual gene
loci, at high resolution and at genome-wide scale. Current approaches to visualize chromatin architecture
are limited by trade-offs between depth and breadth and cannot link 3D position with sequence information
with simultaneous profiling of transcription and epigenetic marks in single cells. Genomic methods such as
Hi-C typically analyze a population average of genomic contact information and imaging approaches such
as ChromEMT4 provide nucleosome level visualization with 1 nanometer resolution, but lack locus
identification and genome scale. Thus, there is a critical need for a broadly applicable method that
incorporates both sequence and nuclear position to reveal the spatial structure of the genome at nanometer
scale. Ideally such a method would have nucleosome resolution (~10 nm) at the single-cell level and
simultaneously provide functional readouts of epigenetic marks, transcription factors (TFs), and
transcriptional activity using multimodal labeling in the same cell. The goal of this proposal is to develop,
validate and benchmark such a method to provide genome-wide chromatin architecture analysis with
sequence information by combining iterative expansion microscopy (PanExM) with genome-wide barcoding.
This method will provide nucleosome resolution imaging of the genome with kilobase sequence resolution
while allowing multimodal protein labeling of the chromatin thanks to the protein retention during PanExM.
To achieve this: in Aim 1, we will adapt PanExM to visualize the chromatin (ChromExM), develop
multimodal labeling of DNA, RNA, TFs and epigenetic marks, develop benchmarking tools to test isotropic
expansion, structural perturbations and labeling efficiency and develop analytical and quantitative methods
to characterize how local chromatin structure regulates function. In Aim 2 we will adapt fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH)-based chromatin tracing to ChromExM using genome-wide barcodes as well as
specific probes to label sites of interest such as promoters and enhancers, we will develop approaches to
systematically examine enhancer-promoter interactions during transcription activation, and we will
benchmark ChromExM to established methods of super resolution microscopy, chromatin tracing and HiC.
The methods developed here will provide unprecedented resolution of the chromatin structure at the
single cell level and genome-wide, and will be broadly applicable by the research community. ChromExM
will provide much-needed tools to allow a large community of researchers to address the structural basis of
how epigenetic modifications, DNA-sequence, and chromatin proteins regulate gene expression."
10932982,"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers and ranks fourth in cancer-
related deaths in the United States. Therapies for pancreatic cancer are largely hindered by the lack of an
effective delivery system. Exosomes are emerging as a promising type of nanocarrier for drug/gene delivery due
to the unique properties of these naturally derived, nanoscale extracellular vesicles and their innate ability to
shuttle proteins, lipids and DNA/RNA between cells. However, major challenges exist, including their inability to
target tumor cells and their high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the
liver and spleen. Our long-term goal is to develop innovative nanocarriers with low immunogenicity, high
biocompatibility, increased stability, longer circulation times, and highly active tumor cell targeting. Using novel
exosomal engineering techniques, we recently found that (a) incorporation of a tumor-homing peptide (RGD)
onto exosomal surface marker CD9 (ExoCD9-RGD) results in specific binding to and uptake by integrin v3-
expressing cancer cells, and (b) exosomes overexpressing CD47, a “don’t eat me” signal, via its minimal self-
peptide (CD47p110-130), interact with signal regulatory proteins (SIRP, CD172A) on macrophages to significantly
reduce liver and spleen clearance of exosomes. These findings lead to our central hypothesis that displaying
RGD and CD47p110-130 on exosomes through CD9 engineering will permit exosomes to target PDAC in vivo while
allowing exosomes to evade MPS clearance. Toward this hypothesis, we have developed “smart exosomes” by
co-displaying RGD and CD47p110-130 on the exosome surface (ExoSmart). This results in enhanced receptor binding,
thereby increasing accumulation and cytotoxic therapeutic effects in 3D stroma-rich PDAC spheroid tumor
models. With these strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to characterize ExoSmart
and validate the application of ExoSmart in drug delivery. (1) To evaluate smart exosomes co-expressing CD9-
RGD and CD9-CD47p110-130 (ExoSmart) for exclusive active PDAC targeting therapy using human PDAC stroma-
rich 3D spheroid models, both in vitro and in vivo. (2) To validate the efficacy of ExoSmart PDAC targeting
chemotherapies in a genetically engineered mouse PDAC tumor model (KPC) and clinically relevant patient-
derived xenografted (PDX) pancreatic cancer mice models. (3) To extend ExoSmart to personalized PDAC
targeting by optimizing multiple insertion sites of CD9 and tumor-targeting peptides for optimal PDAC targeting.
Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by developing innovative nanocarriers with
optimized cargos and surfaces for precision PDAC targeting. This project holds great translational potential for
cancer therapy while providing a solid basis for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome
strategies."
10785979,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Language outcomes are highly heterogenous in autism and can impact long-term psychosocial,
educational, and vocational outcomes for children on the autism spectrum. Thus, there is a pressing need to
identify novel approaches to language intervention, ideally those that can be implemented in early stages of
development, when brain and behavior are most plastic. Many have begun to consider “pre-emptive”
interventions for infants with autistic older siblings (Baby Sibs), who are highly likely be diagnosed with autism
or developmental language disorder themselves.
 The Looking and Language Project (LoLa) seeks to (a) validate a theoretical model of language
development in Baby Sibs, whereby looking to the mouth of a speaker increases later language skill via
caregiver-child engagement and prelinguistic vocal complexity and to (b) systematically test the effects of a
novel intervention that encourages looking to audiovisual speech by moving the referent of interventionist talk
near the mouth (Milieu Teaching-AV).
 I will utilize the K99 portion to conduct a longitudinal correlational study with 52 Baby Sibs and follow them
from 6 months to 15 months. I will additionally use this period to evaluate the feasibility of Milieu Teaching-AV
with this population and assess parent attitudes towards and perceived barriers of “pre-emptive” interventions
for Baby Sibs. The training portion of the K99 will focus on (a) mastering strategies necessary to train coaches
to fidelity on intervention procedures, (b) developing expertise in implementation science methods, and (c)
mastering advanced methodological and statistical approaches to randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
 During the R00 phase, I will evaluate the effects of Milieu Teaching-AV compared to a business as
usual control in 60 Baby Sibs within the context of an RCT. This RCT will examine direct effects on (a) looking
to the mouth of a speaker, (b) caregiver-child engagement, (c) prelinguistic vocal complexity, and (d)
expressive and receptive language. The RCT will also allow for an exploratory look at moderated effects (i.e.,
determining for whom the intervention yields optimal outcomes) of the intervention on the basis of (a) language
ability and (b) caregiver-child engagement at study entry and (c) preliminary autism diagnosis at 15 months.
Additionally, I will evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and outcome measures for key interested
parties, including adolescent and adult siblings of autistic individuals (i.e., grown-up Baby Sibs), autistic-self
advocates, caregivers of autistic children, and community early intervention providers.
NOVELTY AND IMPACT: If my hypotheses are born out, the proposed project will provide empirical support
for a novel approach to preemptive intervention that is acceptable to key interested parties and motivated by
theory and a large extant literature involving autistic children. The results of the RCT will provide the
groundwork for my first R01 submission to further evaluate and establish the efficacy of this approach."
10789872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The transcription factor Cone-Rod Homeobox (CRX ) is a master regulator of photoreceptor cell fate. Sequence
variants in CRX can cause Retinitis Pigmentosa, Cone-Rod Dystrophy, and Leber Congenital Amaurosis, all
inherited causes of vision loss and blindness. CRX is the only gene implicated in the pathogenesis of all three of
these diseases, which present with both rod- and cone-centric phenotypes of varying age of onset and severity.
Several CRX variants have been reported to cause severe dominant disease through antimorphic genetic interac-
tions with wild-type CRX, and yet these mutations are adjacent to variants which are benign or only cause mild,
recessive disease. Determining which mutations in CRX are pathogenic and quantifying their effect on functional
activity is prerequisite to interpreting patient variation and predicting patient phenotypes.
However, most variants in CRX are “Variants of Uncertain Signiﬁcance” (VUS), meaning that insufﬁcient clinical
or functional evidence exists to determine their pathogenicity. Without a robust catalog of human genetic
variation, advances in patient sequencing cannot be translated into clinical guidance or therapies for patients with
uncharacterized variants. One potential solution to this challenge is Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS), which
uses massive libraries of variant sequences in multiplexed assays to simultaneously measure the functional
consequence of thousands of variants in a gene of interest in a single experiment. In DMS, each gene variant is
assigned a quantitative functional pathogenicity score based on its activity in a molecular assay.
This proposal will use DMS to simultaneously assay the transcriptional activity and abundance of all point
substitutions, truncations, and frameshifts in CRX. The direct product of this work will be a “look-up table” listing
the functional consequence of every CRX variant on protein activity and stability, which will be directly applicable
to clinical variant classiﬁcation and decision making. Given the retina's privileged location as a facile target for
gene therapy, a catalog of human variation in CRX could inform the clinical management of patients afﬂicted with
inherited retinopathies in the near term. Furthermore, this work will establish an extensible platform for additional
DMS studies of other retinal transcription factors, broadly expanding our understanding of inherited retinal disease."
10789878,"Typical institutional efforts to increase the number of racial/ethnic minority and disadvantaged college students (URMs) in the biomedical pipeline primarily focus on building research and professional development skills. Indeed, enhancing these skills will increase preparedness for graduate school. However, many URMs face additional barriers in pursuit of a neuroscience doctoral degree that are not addressed by conventional summer undergraduate research programs. To address this critical need, the goal of the Research Innovation in NeuroScience Education for Underserved Populations (RISE UP) summer research program at the University of Cincinnati is to provide a unique learning experience that combines both traditional and innovative approaches to inspire undergraduate URMs to pursue a career in neuroscience. We will accomplish this goal using the following methods: (1) an aggressive and focused effort to recruit 50 outstanding RISE UP summer scholars from around the country with an interest in neuroscience over the proposed funding period; (2) provide training in the essentials of research at the University of Cincinnati (e.g., responsible conduct of research/ethics training) and the fundamentals of neuroscience research; (3) create individualized research experiences in top-notch neuroscience laboratories that closely match their career interests; (4) design innovative seminars and workshops that strengthen academic and professional development to facilitate entry into neuroscience doctoral programs; (5) lead inspiring socio-emotional seminars and workshops that tap into and provide solutions for contemporary issues that URMs disproportionately face in pursuit of a neuroscience doctoral degree; (6) provide cultural competency and implicit bias training for the entire RISE UP community; (7) provide a two-pronged mentoring strategy that includes a RISE UP faculty mentor and a diversity ambassador; (8) ensure long-term investment in each RISE UP scholar that extends beyond the proposed summer funding period. Importantly, NINDS funding for the RISE UP program will supplement the strong financial support from the College of Medicine for diversity recruitment and inclusion in neuroscience education. Considering the current funding climate, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract, recruit, and retain students, especially URMs, in neuroscience, and innovative approaches are urgently needed to encourage and support historically underrepresented students to remain in the biomedical pipeline. Funding for the RISE UP program will allow us to do this by intervening early on in the educational pipeline to prepare our scholars for the academic and socio-emotional rigors of graduate school."
10784373,"Summary UNC-IMSD
The long-term goal of the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill (UNC IMSD) is to contribute to diversifying the leadership of biomedical science. We work towards
this goal through an integrated suite of synergistic junior scientist development programs focused on
biomedical PhD students from groups under-represented in the sciences due to historical exclusion. Our
approach is a comprehensive, personalized, start-to-finish program led by a team of expert PhD-trained
Directors and dedicated faculty who work to support the scientific, personal, and professional development of
UNC biomedical PhD students from under-represented groups (URGs). We provide activities targeted to
empower URG students and enhance both scientific identity and self-efficacy at key transition points in their
graduate training to increase the likelihood that they persist to degree completion and in their chosen scientific
careers. UNC IMSD is embedded in the UNC Office of Graduate Education, an institutionally-funded
administrative unit that coordinates development, recruitment, and extensive support for 15 PhD programs.
Leadership in this Office consists of multiple PhD-trained program Directors, including the two Directors of
IMSD, whose full-time roles are to facilitate student success and to inspire continual improvement in graduate
education practices in collaboration with the faculty PIs. The substantial resources devoted to graduate
education at UNC through this Office provide numerous advantages to IMSD participants and members: i)
ready access to expert advisors who have been through similar training , ii) a large and supportive community
of peers from similar backgrounds and experiences, iii) individual academic support at key transitions (e.g.
coursework, critical literature analysis, rotation and thesis lab selection, qualifying exams), and iv) customized
professional development opportunities. Since 2006 the IMSD has financially supported 196 participants; 60
are still enrolled and on track to graduate, and 107 have graduated with a PhD (>85% retention). Participants
published 308 peer-reviewed publications, 137 as first authors. Moreover, during this period an additional 64
graduate students were affiliated members of the IMSD community and benefitted from the program. As an
R25-supported program since 1996, we institutionalized and broadly disseminated multiple successful
innovations developed over many years. These elements benefit all graduate students – from under-
represented and well-represented groups – and include faculty mentor training and a dedicated wellness
counselor. We also engaged in scholarship of graduate admissions, graduate training, and workforce diversity;
our studies have been published and have had impacts beyond UNC. In the proposed next phase of UNC
IMSD as a T32, we have the following core Objectives: 1) develop and recruit high potential students from
URGs, 2) facilitate academic and degree progress to PhD completion, 3) foster a community of thriving future
scientific leaders, and 4) promote an inclusive training environment and cultural change."
10792937,"In many neurological diseases, specific subsets of neurons are more sensitive to dysfunction and degeneration
than others. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), excitatory (EX) neurons are preferentially vulnerable to tau pathology
which defines the pathogenesis and progression of dysfunction in AD. Understanding the molecular origins of
selective neuronal vulnerability is of fundamental importance for all of the neurodegenerative diseases including
AD. Using single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis of the
transcriptomic signatures of different cell types from non-AD cases, we identified novel subproteome gene
signatures in EX neurons that may serve as potential master regulators of selective neuronal and regional
vulnerability to tau pathology in early AD. The ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1) is one such potential master
regulator. Although the role of ENC1 in AD has not been thoroughly investigated, if it functions as a master
regulator as predicted by bioinformatics analysis, it may be possible to regulate ENC1 levels to control tau
pathology and thwart the onset or progression of AD. Preliminary analysis of human entorhinal cortex from AD
and control brain specimens has revealed that ENC1 is enriched in the nucleus of EX neurons in control brains,
while cytoplasmic ENC1 levels are elevated within neurons that show accumulated pathological tau species in
AD specimens. The interaction between ENC1 and tau correlates directly with levels of pathological tau.
Furthermore, forced overexpression of ENC1 mainly in the cytoplasm increases tau aggregation and seeding
activity, whereas knockdown of ENC1 reduces these pathological changes. ENC1 has been shown to increase
the neurotoxicity of mutant huntingtin under ER stress through the interaction with p62 and the inhibition of
autophagy flux. Our new data also show ENC1 overexpression increases pathological tau accumulation, p62
puncta formation and autophagy dysfunction, implicating impairment of p62-mediated autophagy as a
mechanism underlying the cytoplasmic accumulation of ENC1 and pathological tau in neurons. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that cytoplasmic ENC1 contributes to the vulnerability of EX neurons to
tau pathology, and that reducing ENC1 in EX neurons will enhance the autophagy pathway thereby
protecting these EX neurons from selective neurodegeneration in AD. To test this hypothesis, this proposal
will (1) determine the effect of ENC1 on tau aggregation and propagation in human cerebral organoids; (2)
investigate the role of ENC1 in autophagy pathway and if this pathway is involved in ENC1-induced tau
aggregation and propagation in vitro; and (3) determine if cell-type specific manipulation of ENC1 affects
neuronal autophagy, AD pathology and cognition in vivo. The proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight
into the role of ENC1 as a master regulator of tau homeostasis and will also provide greater insight for developing
novel therapeutics targeting ENC1-dependent pathways to prevent, treat or delay the neurodegeneration in AD.
Furthermore, this work will elucidate novel mechanisms underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in AD."
10792957,"Driver mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are present in 70-80% of grade II and III gliomas, with
the majority eventually progressing to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this molecularly distinct class of
malignant gliomas, mutant IDH1 enzyme produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite that inhibits
α-ketoglutarate dependent histone and DNA demethylases resulting in characteristic hypermethylation of
genomic DNA and suppression of cellular differentiation. We have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy and
mechanism of action of the approved DNA demethylating drug 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) and revealed combinations
that further enhance survival. In models with the native IDH1 mutation, 5-Aza administration reduces tumor
burden, extends survival and induce differentiation in vivo. Combination of 5-Aza with standard of care, use of
differentiation, and pro-apoptotic drugs all show further benefit. The focus of this revised grant is to optimize
treatment and validate mechanism tailored to either grade II or high grade IDH1 mutant gliomas.
 In Aim 1 we propose to demonstrate the mechanism of 5-Aza induced cell growth reduction and further
optimize 5-Aza with standard of care treatment for IDH1 mutant glioma. We have recently demonstrated
reduction in tumor burden and extend survival in our IDH1 mutant PDX model works better when using 5-aza in
combination with temozolomide regardless of the order of administration. In Aim 2 we will determine the impact
of DNA demethylating agent in combination with differentiation therapy using retinoic acid in IDH1 mutant glioma.
Our preliminary data shows that 5-Aza regulates retinoic acid signaling, and in IDH1 mutant PDX glioma model
the two work synergistically to slow tumor growth. In aim 3 we propose to combine 5-Aza with the proapoptotic
drug PAC-1 in IDH1 mutant glioma and explore the mechanism of response. Preliminary data indicate that
Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1), a novel brain penetrant procaspase 3 cleaving small molecule,
functions to increase apoptosis and survival in an intracranial model of IDH1 mutant glioma. Our unifying
hypothesis for each of these aims is that the combination of the mechanisms of reversing pathological
demethylation will enhance known anticancer mechanisms of DNA damage, cellular senescence and/or
apoptosis, and that interdependent mechanisms will combine to safely increase survival.
 Each of the small molecule therapies proposed show evidence of single agent efficacy in preclinical studies
for glioma. We propose to determine how the mechanisms of demethylation, differentiation therapy and caspase
3 activation best combine safely for a therapeutic response. Our major goal is to produce the preclinical data
that might support a new trial for patients with IDH1 mutant glioma. Those therapies with the possibility of causing
DNA damage will be reserved for high grade gliomas, while less toxic therapies are proposed for low grade
gliomas, where there is the possibility of a large impact on survival benefit."
10792859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in clinical practice has transformed the manage-
ment of HIV-1 infection, achieving complete suppression of viral replication. However, cART does not target
latent proviruses or the cells harboring them, and must be taken daily for life. The development of a cure for HIV-
1 infection would eliminate cART toxicities, and solve the economic and logistic burden of delivering cART to
over 30 million patients worldwide, most of them in the developing world. Despite significant efforts in that direc-
tion over the last decade, we are still far from an effective cure, underscoring the urgent need for new strategies.
We argue that cART-free HIV-1 remission is more likely achieved by constraining latent proviruses into a deeper
and permanent state of latency. Our long-term goal is to develop a “block and lock” approach via epigenetic
silencing of HIV-1 that is sequence-specific, safe, effective, and scalable throughout the world. This approach
should aim at inducing irreversible epigenetic inactivation of HIV-1, in a manner similar to permanent silencing
of tissue-specific genes and endogenous retroelements within our human genomes.
Our overall objective is to achieve robust, durable, sequence-specific silencing of latent HIV-1 proviruses that
leads to their permanent transcriptional inactivation. Our central hypothesis is that exogenous expression of a
naturally occurring HIV-1 antisense transcript (Ast) will lead to sequence-specific silencing of latent HIV-1. We
have reported that the Ast RNA naturally impairs HIV-1 expression by binding to homologous DNA sequences
in the proviral 5’LTR through base pairing and by recruiting the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), which
introduces the repressive epigenetic mark, H3K27me3 into the surrounding chromatin, turning off HIV-1 expres-
sion. In addition, our recent studies show that the Ast RNA binds additional repressive epigenetic and transcrip-
tional factors, suggesting that this transcript orchestrates multiple mechanisms of HIV-1 silencing.
We propose to achieve our goal through three Specific Aims (SA). SA1 will investigate modifications of the Ast
RNA, and additional epigenetic repressors that Ast recruits to the HIV-1 5’LTR. These studies will lead to devel-
oping Ast derivatives with improved potency. SA2 will evaluate the ability of the Ast RNA and its new derivatives
to induce sequence-specific silencing of HIV-1 in three in vitro and ex vivo biologically relevant primary cell
models. These studies represent the first level of testing for Ast and its derivatives, providing helpful feedback to
SA1 studies and selecting Ast derivatives for further testing. SA3 will evaluate the ability of Ast RNA and its
derivatives selected in SA2 to induce HIV-1 silencing in an in vivo humanized mouse model reconstituted with
CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 patients. These studies are a second and more complex level of testing for Ast RNA.
Completion of these studies will provide proof-of-concept that could propel the development of the Ast RNA into
a novel, potent and sequence-specific therapeutic for HIV-1 cure. While most silencing strategies have a broad
impact on gene expression that is likely accompanied by toxicity, the Ast RNA will allow to launch a targeted,
sequence-specific strike against latent proviruses, avoiding significant toxic off-target effects."

People living with chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, and other forms of chronic lung
disease frequently experience exacerbations requiring acute care hospitalizations. These severe exacerba-
tions requiring hospitalization are associated with decreased quality of life for patients, increased morbidity
and mortality, and increased burdens on health system resources. Through work funded by my K23 award, I
have identified actionable risk mechanisms that contribute to hospitalization risk in this population. Notably,
many of these mechanisms are present for months or even years among community-dwelling patients liv-
ing with chronic lung disease prior to a hospitalization. These findings suggest an opportunity to identify
patients with these actionable risks and refer them for appropriate interventions as early as possible. To
accomplish this, my K23 supported the development of two prediction models that can efficiently analyze
electronic health record data, including both structured (e.g. demographics, diagnoses, and laboratory tests)
and unstructured sources (e.g. the text of clinical encounter notes), of large populations to identify those who
may benefit from frailty-focused and depression-focused interventions. However, although the models I de-
veloped have good predictive performance overall, they were found to have unequal performance by patient
race and gender. Additionally, there is a large evidence gap around the feasibility and acceptability of using
such machine learning models to guide clinical care in this setting. Therefore, the work proposed in this R03
will fill these important knowledge gaps and pave the way for a future randomized clinical trial of a predictive
clinical decision support system to promote population health among people living with chronic lung disease.
First, I will use state-of-the-art methods to recalibrate the prediction models so that they perform equitably by
patient racial and gender subgroups. This aim is necessary, in light of known racial and disparities in care pro-
cesses and outcomes by patient race and gender, to meet minimum ethical standards prior to further model
deployment and testing. Second, I will conduct a pilot study of using these models in a real-world clinical
workflow to prompt referrals among community-dwelling patients with chronic lung disease. A pulmonologist
will review the predictions from these models, verify their clinical appropriateness, and make referrals if the
patient and their outpatient clinical team is agreeable. I will assess the feasibility and acceptability of this
workflow among patients, their caregivers, and outpatient clinicians. Additionally, I will measure several key
process measures related to the proposed protocol in anticipation of a future clinical trial. The findings from
these two aims will be sufficient to support a future, planned R01-level application for a clinical trial of this
predictive clinical decision support system. Finally, securing this funding, with the data produced through the
work outlined in this R03 proposal, will support my transition to an independent investigator."
10791820,"The mature central nervous system (CNS) is sculpted by the combined effects of intrinsic genetic programs and
dynamic environmental input, yet the precise manner by which these two processes collaborate to give rise to
the functional diversity of the mature nervous system remains to be fully explored. Using transgenic approaches
that allow for the purification of sparse neuronal subtypes, we find that lineage-committed cortical interneurons
undergo dynamic changes in gene expression in the early postnatal period, including the downregulation of
genes governing cell proliferation and migration as well as the concomitant upregulation of subtype-specific
genes important for mature neuronal function. We recently discovered that this postnatal transition in
transcription state is mediated by the licensing and decommissioning of thousands of cis-regulatory enhancer
elements across the genome. In the course of defining the regulatory elements that orchestrate these
transcriptional changes, we have uncovered a possible role for the AP-1 (Fos/Jun) family of stimulus-inducible
transcription factors (TFs) in promoting neuronal maturation through the de novo selection of sets of neuronal
subtype-specific enhancer elements, suggesting that external cues from the environment in early life have an
instructive role in shaping mature neuronal identities. To gain further insight into the mechanisms mediating
early postnatal enhancer selection and its contribution to neural circuit maturation and function, we propose (1)
to assess the role of sensory-driven activity in postnatal neuronal enhancer selection, (2) to characterize the
molecular mediators of postnatal enhancer selection, and (3) to test the contribution of enhancer remodeling to
postnatal neuronal maturation. It is our hope that the proposed experiments will yield a better understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying enhancer selection in the developing CNS, further illuminate how cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms coordinate to drive mature circuit function, and ultimately provide new
opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat a subset of neurodevelopmental disorders."
10791823,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Resistance training can improve fitness, clinical, and quality of life outcomes during cancer treatment.
Individuals with advanced upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers frequently present with skeletal muscle loss that
may worsen during chemotherapy. Resistance training may be beneficial in this context, but its feasibility and
effectiveness have not been established. Home-based exercise programs may be preferable for many cancer
survivors, including those who receive treatment near home and face barriers such as time, finances, and
disease pandemics that complicate participation in supervised programs at cancer centers or other fitness
facilities. Adherence to our resistance training recommendation in a previous, home-based exercise
intervention during pancreatic cancer treatment was poor. Participants cited factors such as lack of familiarity
and low social support as barriers to resistance training. The purpose of this project is to “bridge” the
convenience of and preference for home-based resistance training to the support and supervision of in-person
resistance training by developing a virtual, or “tele-resistance training” (“tele-RT”) approach. We also aim to
compare changes in muscular strength and endurance, skeletal muscle health, health-related quality of life,
fatigue, and physical functioning between individuals randomized to participate in tele-RT and individuals
randomized to receive usual care during first-line chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the intervention will be
feasible, safe, and acceptable and that participation will be associated with improvements in outcome
measures compared to usual care. Individuals undergoing first-line chemotherapy for advanced upper GI
cancer (N=100) will be randomized to receive usual care vs. engage in tele-resistance training supervised by
certified trainers using video conferencing software and tablet computers. Exercise prescriptions will be
individually-tailored and supervised to safely increase strength over time. Feasibility (enrollment, retention, and
adherence to exercise sessions and prescribed exercise volumes) and safety will be monitored by trainers.
Acceptability will be rated via questionnaire following participation. Participants will complete measures of
muscular strength and endurance, skeletal muscle health, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and physical
functioning prior to and following first-line chemotherapy (approximately 3 months). Resistance training has
important potential to improve health and well-being for individuals with advanced cancer, but these benefits
depend on adherence. In this project, we aim to evaluate a novel strategy to encourage resistance training
adherence by providing virtual supervision. This intervention has broad potential to encourage resistance
training and elicit benefits among individuals in various cancer survivorship contexts."
10791265,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Mechanism and functional consequences of dietary lipids in lineage
specification and tumor growth in oncohistone gliomas
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most aggressive brain tumors of childhood. Malignant growth of H3K27M
DMGs is linked to reduced activity of the histone methyltransferase polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and
diminished H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark. H3K27M-induced reconfiguration
of chromatin architecture suppresses differentiation of cycling glial progenitor cells in the developing brain. This
is further accompanied by increased PDGFRA signaling supporting the expansion of these progenitor cells.
Nevertheless, the tumor cells retain some latent differentiation potential. We and others have shown that this
potential can be unmasked by treatment with serum or pharmacologic remodeling of chromatin, which drive
differentiation of these tumor cells to more mature glial cell lineages and reduce their tumorigenic potential.
In preliminary studies, we have found that; (i) diet-derived lipids in the form of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-
PUFAs) are required for serum-induced differentiation of H3K27 DMGs, and (ii) n3-PUFAs’ effect in this setting
is associated with increased H3K27me3 marks, enrichment of more differentiated glial cell population, and
reduction of cycling glial progenitor cell population. This suggests a previously unappreciated link between these
dietary lipids and epigenetic modulation of cell lineage specification. Against this backdrop, our central
hypothesis is that the PUFA pathway (specifically n3-PUFA) modulates cell fate decisions and epigenetic
programs relevant for H3K27M-mediated gliomagenesis. We test this hypothesis by addressing three
fundamental questions. First, what is the functional role of n3-PUFAs in self-renewal and lineage-specific
differentiation of H3K27M glial progenitors? Aim 1 addresses this question by interrogating the causal link
between n3-PUFAs and H3K27M glioma cell state specification through a combination of loss- and gain-of-
function, nutrient rescue assays, and single-cell transcriptomic to rigorously examine the functional contribution
of these lipids to cell fate. Second, what is the biochemical mechanism whereby n3-PUFAs influence these cell
states? Aim 2 addresses this question by characterizing a mechanistic links between these lipids and the
H3K27M DMG chromatin landscape by examining chromatin accessibility of loci specific for distinct cell lineage,
and by interrogating PRC2 activity and PDGFRA signaling as biochemical targets of n3-PUFAs. Third, do PUFA
enrichment strategies have therapeutic potential in DMGs? Aim 3 addresses this question by testing the anti-
tumor effects of n3-PUFA diets or genetic activation of the PUFA pathway in H3K27M DMG PDX models.
These studies are aligned with PAR-23-051 in that they test n3-PUFAs as dietary variables that mechanistically
link epigenetic modifiers/programs to H3K27M DMG cell fate decisions and tumorigenic potential."
10790391,"Project Summary
The Mammarenavirus genus of the Arenavirus family contains multiple zoonotic pathogens with the potential to
cause hemorrhagic fever. These include the South American viruses Junin virus (JUNV; Argentinian
hemorrhagic fever) and Machupo virus (MACV; Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), and Lassa virus (LASV), which
causes thousands of cases of Lassa Fever in West Africa each year. The case fatality rate for these viruses is
20-70%. Lujo virus (LUJV) is the most recently identified African arenavirus. This virus was responsible for five
infections, of which four were fatal. Notably, this outbreak was characterized by human-to-human transmission
rather than transmission between rodent and human, as is most common for other arenaviruses. Arenaviruses
are genetically and geographically divided into New World (e.g. JUNV and MACV) and Old World (e.g. LASV)
groups. Its African location placed LUJV into the OW group. However, LUJV is genetically divergent from other
African arenaviruses and is phylogenetically equidistant between the NW and OW groups. Further, its
glycoprotein GPC recognizes a different receptor and is antigenically distinct from the other arenaviruses. As
the only protein expressed on the viral surface, GPC is responsible for receptor engagement, cell tropism and
entry, and is the primary target of antibodies. Understanding the unique structure and surface chemistry of
LUJV GPC in its native conformation is key to understanding receptor recognition in the native trimer context,
what antibody targets might be on this divergent virus, and how we might design vaccines and therapeutics
should the virus re-emerge. The premise of this proposal is that structures of the medically relevant LUJV GP
alone and in complex with its cell surface receptor will reveal reasons for its unique cell entry requirements and
any differences in its epitope landscape. We will use state-of-the-art biophysical techniques such as cryo
electron microscopy, surface plasmon resonance and composition-gradient multiangle light scattering, to
characterize the interaction of the prefusion-stabilized LUJV GP trimer (pfGP-TD) with its receptor NRP2. In
Aim 2, we will identify antibodies from mice immunized with LUJV pfGP-TD using the Berkeley Lights Beacon
platform. Results from the innovative research proposed here will launch multiple lines of inquiry for future
studies and will help guide development of vaccines against a diverse range of arenaviruses."
10791187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Single cell sequencing technologies have rapidly advanced over the past five years and have become
essential tools in a broad array of fields, ranging from developmental biology to human genetics. One major
advance was the development of high-throughput barcoding of RNA or DNA within droplets, which allowed for
preparation of sequencing libraries as a pool rather than in a laborious 96 well plate format. This advance
enabled sequencing analysis of thousands of cells in one batch. However, there has not been the same
breakthrough in scale when sequencing both DNA and RNA from the same cell as established techniques
involve sorting cells into plates or wells and ultimately separating DNA and RNA before library preparation. The
separation of RNA from DNA is necessary because conventional PCR amplification requires a 95oC melting
step, which degrades RNA. In this proposal, we will seek to optimize DNA amplification through recombination
polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal form of PCR which can be performed simultaneously with
reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA. In this way, both RNA and DNA can be captured into barcoded,
sequencing libraries within the same droplet. The technology could have impact in many different fields in
which genotype-phenotype correlation is needed, such as characterizing genetic polymorphisms or genetic
variants in cancer. In SA1, we will demonstrate proof-of-principle of same cell DNA amplicon and RNA
transcriptome technology via isothermal RPA and reverse transcription. In SA2, we will determine the
quantitative performance of the methodology in two use applications and test capability to genotype
heterozygous alleles. If successful, this methodology could be widely adopted by laboratories in diverse fields
to answer questions related to genotype-phenotype correlations."
10791084,"Asparagine-linked glycans are involved in complex regulation and signaling, and play a critical role in
disease. This is because small differences in this post translational modification dramatically change
the function of any biomolecule. To fully unravel and leverage the role of glycosylation in human health,
a wide array of glycan standards is required to facilitate this research. There is a critical need to
customize N-glycan standards, but the chemical structure of glycans makes this process challenging.
This is because glycans are defined by the variation in the type of monomeric saccharide unit, the
position of the linkage between adjacent saccharide monomers, and the chain branching. Even simple
glycan standards are costly, and this cost increases dramatically with increasing structural complexity.
The objective of this project is to bridge this technology gap by providing a tool to customize enzyme-
based N-glycan remodeling through an automated nanoscale and microscale approach. A capillary
electrophoresis method is adapted to trim and rebuild glycan structures within minutes using a single-
capillary or 8-capillary instrument. The heart of this system is a thermally reversible nanogel that
sustains and integrates enzyme conversion of a heterogeneous substrate into a standardized glycoform
product. Once synthesized, these glycans are easily conjugated to any biomolecule resulting in a
custom glycoform. The proposed technology is ideal for small scale processing because the small
volume of the 25-100 µm inner diameter fused silica electrophoresis capillary is compatible with the 0.5
to 100 µg quantities of each glycoform needed to create an experimental test set, or even a molecular
library. A major advantage to in-line enzyme reactions is that it reduces the volume of a bench top
process to the nanoliter regime. By scaling down the volume of the enzyme conversion, diffusion limited
processes are less significant. An attractive feature of nanogels is that an enzyme can be pseudo-
immobilized within the highly viscous gel without using covalent chemistry to anchor the enzyme. This
new strategy for processing of N-linked glycan structures is facilitated through two independent
approaches that differ in the quantity of product that is made. Aim 1 creates a discrete stepwise
modification through the successive use of trimming (exoglycosidase) and building (transferase)
enzymes. This enables automated production of microgram quantities of research grade N-glycans.
Aim 2 transfers and scales up the enzymatic processing using continuous feed and parallel reaction
capillaries. The proposed activities are significant because the speed and automation of the
electrophoresis-based foundry yield previously unattainable flexibility in chemical processing. This new
tool provides the standards needed for individual researchers to obtain direct information about the
relationship between complex variations in glycosylation and physiological effect."
10790972,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast reconstruction is a critical component of breast cancer treatment because it restores quality of life and
body image after mastectomy. It has become more common in the past 25 years, growing from 3 to 40% of
mastectomy cases. However, Spanish-speaking Latina women who undergo mastectomy are the least likely to
undergo reconstruction, meet with a reconstructive surgeon, or receive enough information about
reconstruction. Those who do not have reconstruction experience the highest rates of dissatisfaction and
regret about their decisions. Hispanic and Latino people are the largest minority population in the U.S. (19% of
the population). Most (73%) primarily speak Spanish at home, and many (15%) feel uncomfortable with
English. Persons diagnosed with cancer who primarily speak Spanish and identify as Latin American are less
likely to receive guideline-concordant cancer treatments. Shared decision making and decision support can
improve treatment decisions that are preference sensitive (the right choice depends on the person’s
preferences). They result in higher patient knowledge and greater concordance between preferences and
treatment. Unfortunately, most decision aids in the U.S. are in English and developed with few Latinx people.
We have developed a decision aid for breast reconstruction called BREASTChoice, with proven efficacy and
effectiveness in two randomized controlled trials. BREASTChoice was developed with extensive stakeholder
engagement and includes a risk prediction model for personalized estimation of complication risk. Patients and
clinicians are highly supportive of BREASTChoice and have asked for a Spanish language version that can be
shared easily. Aim 1. Adapt BREASTChoice for Spanish-speaking Latina breast cancer survivors. We will
interview Spanish-speaking Latina breast cancer survivors and other community-based key informants to
culturally adapt and translate BREASTChoice. Our community partners, Living Beyond Breast Cancer and
Latinas Contra Cancer, will help us identify participants. The adapted tool will be programmed as a mobile-
friendly website. Aim 2. Assess usability and efficacy of the adapted BREASTChoice among Spanish-speaking
Latina breast cancer survivors. We will conduct a pre-post evaluation among Spanish-speaking breast cancer
survivors (N=50), who will use the tool and complete surveys before and after using it. Surveys will assess
knowledge about breast reconstruction and the adapted tool’s usability. This study will result in the first
culturally and linguistically relevant decision aid for breast reconstruction for Spanish speaking Latina breast
cancer survivors. The decision aid’s format as a mobile friendly website will position it for wider dissemination
and implementation because it will be portable and adaptable. The approach we use in this study will be widely
applicable to other decision aids, so that decision support can reach Spanish-speaking Latinx populations."
10790973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible visual impairment in the
US, and restoring retinal function in AMD patients remains a big challenge. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
degeneration is the hallmark of advanced “dry” or non-neovascular AMD with no treatment available. The
implanted retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs) or a patch of RPE, generated from induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), provide great potential in the treatment of AMD. Autologous iPSCs possess therapeutic potential
with less immunogenicity and have less ethical controversy than human embryonic stem cells-based therapies.
Two phases are required from somatic cells to generate mature RPEs: iPSCs are reprogrammed from different
somatic cell sources located at peripheral blood, skin, or other epithelial tissues, and then iPSCs are guided to
differentiate to functional RPEs (RPEsiPSC). Despite current progress in generating RPEs from somatic cells,
several barriers remain in their clinical application, and there is an urgent need to develop an optimized
strategy with higher efficiency and rapid differentiation kinetics in the generation of RPEsiPSC. Human primary
USCs, as renal progenitors first discovered by the PI’s team, are easily accessible and possess robust cell
proliferation and renewal capacity for tissue regeneration. Our previous studies demonstrated that iPSCs
reprogrammed from USC (u-iPSCs) more efficiently and rapidly than iPSC from other cell sources. u-iPSC
efficiently differentiated into neurocytes, but RPEsu-iPSC have not been developed yet. The long-term goal of
this proposal is to use RPEs generated from autologous USC-derived iPSCs (RPEsu-iPSC) to reestablish the
interaction with photo‑receptors and prevent degeneration of the retina, restoring the vision function for
patients with AMD. The overall objective of this R21 study is to generate pure RPEs from u-iPSC (RPEsu-iPSC).
Our central hypothesis is that u-iPSC reprogrammed from USC (epithelial progentior cells) are more efficiently
and rapidly differentiated into mature RPEs (epithelalial lineage cell) with specific makers and durable tight
junction, compared to iPSC from mesenchymal cell lineages (i.e, skin fibroblasts and blood mononuclear cells).
Thus, the specific aim of this study is to develop and optimize a strategy for generating reliably archived human
RPEsu-iPSC. We will determine the efficiency of RPE differentiation from u-iPSCs and assess the function of
RPEsu-iPSC compared to that of iPSC from skin and blood cells, with adult human primary RPE as a control. We
expect that USC obtained non-invasively from AMD patients could be an optimal cell source for generating
mature RPEsu-iPSC in a cost-effective manner for personalized medicine in the treatment of AMD. This in vitro
differentiated human RPEsu-iPSC will be highly valuable and pave the ground for a future R01 proposal on an in
vivo study with autologous RPEsu-iPSC. The broader impact is that RPEsu-iPSC might be used for RPE research,
in vitro ocular disease modeling, and toxicity testing. An in vitro model of RPEsu-iPSC might provide a superior
platform for personalized drug discovery compared to existing human RPE cell lines or animal cell sources."
10800254,"Abstract. The goal of our project is to implement a novel scoring system for chronic lung disease of
prematurity previously known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants using
structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which identifies the primary cause of the
disease subtypes. Currently, there is no means in the clinic to identify the cause of BPD in each infant and
whether it has affected the large airways, lung parenchyma or pulmonary perfusion. Clinical care only
assesses the degree of respiratory support or oxygen that each infant needs and for what time period without
knowledge of the underlying cause of the disease. However, specific treatment would differ knowing that the
large airways or tracheal area was decreased in comparison with an infant having pulmonary hypertension and
perfusion abnormalities. Our preliminary data in 25 premature infants has shown that novel MRI techniques
can be used to non-invasively (without radiation) and without the need for sedation or administration of
Gadolinium based contrast agents to quantitate both lung structure and function in this vulnerable population.
Our overarching hypothesis is that we can use these sequences that measure both ventilation and perfusion
to quantify BPD-specific contributions of Airways, Lung Parenchyma and Perfusion. Specifically, in aim1 we
will implement a novel ALP scoring system for BPD phenotypes which identifies the relative contributions of
Airways, Lung parenchyma and Perfusion. We will enroll 95 premature infants with all grades of BPD (I, II & III)
in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our center is only one of three in the nation offering high-resolution
MRI to infants directly in the NICU. Specific MRI sequences will include anatomic sequences such as BLADE,
STARVIBE and PETRA to image the tracheal airway, lung volume and parenchymal structure. We will also use
a novel phase-resolved functional lung (PREFUL) sequence to measure both ventilation and perfusion defects
as well as pulmonary perfusion. One strength of this proposal is that the PREFUL MRI acquisition uses a
routine 2D fast gradient echo (GRE) multi-phase sequence that may be readily implemented using product
sequences on most if not all MRI scanners even those outside the NICU. The total scan time will only be
approximately 15 minutes. Our aim 2 will then investigate the association between the ALP score and patient
specific outcomes including death before discharge, length of time in the NICU, tracheostomy, need for
vasodilator or inhaled pulmonary medications. Our study is the first to add real-time function assessment of
lung perfusion and ventilation to structural MR markers of BPD in this vulnerable population of premature
infants in the NICU."
10800157,"ABSTRACT
Over 450 million people suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D), a disease defined by the failure of pancreatic β-cells.
In the first period of support, we showed that pharmacologic activators of pyruvate kinase (PK) potentiate insulin
secretion from mouse, rat, and human islets, as well as diabetic rats in vivo, identifying PK as a potential
therapeutic target for T2D. We further demonstrated that PK plays an important role in β-cell nutrient sensing.
We discovered a novel paradigm in which plasma-membrane associated PK closes KATP channels to initiate
insulin secretion, and that the PKm1 and PKm2 isoforms tune the amino acid sensitivity of KATP closure via the
mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle. The purpose of renewing this R01 is to ascertain the
mechanism by which PK amplifies insulin secretion. Our preliminary studies revealed that PK activators amplify
the insulinotropic actions of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) but not glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (GIP), indicating receptor-specific signaling through pyruvate kinase. Further observations
suggest a major unexplored contribution of PK to the kinetics of β-cell cAMP generation during nutrient
stimulation. Based on our preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that pyruvate kinase and GLP1 receptor
(GLP1R) signaling converge on cAMP production to amplify insulin release. We will: 1) Determine which PK
isoforms control β-cell cAMP levels, and whether the PEP cycle is required, 2) Define the mechanisms by which
β-cell GLP1R signaling recruits pyruvate kinase, and 3) Determine, under metabolic stress conditions, whether
PK contributes to the mechanism of existing and novel anti-diabetic drugs that target GLP1R and GIPR.
Completion of these aims will define the interplay between PK and β-cell GPCR signaling, and shed light on the
mechanisms underlying the efficacy of widely used incretin-based therapies for T2D, thus guiding the
development of next-generation incretin mimetics biased toward the compartmentalized signaling pathways
identified to be most effective for treating β-cell dysfunction at each stage of T2D progression."
10804594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The pathophysiological processes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) –– beta-
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles –– begin decades before objective cognitive impairment and
symptoms of clinical dementia are present. This “preclinical” disease stage offers a window to understand early
disease mechanisms as well as the contributions of AD pathology to cognitive aging. Although work across
different research programs highlights the utility of amyloid and tau measurements in aging cohorts as important
predictors of future decline, it remains difficult to predict risk at the individual subject level and mechanisms
associated with the initial consequences of AD pathology in aging remain unclear. Our research program
involves cutting-edge neuroimaging (MRI, PET) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis to understand the neuronal
correlates of memory decline. Specifically, we propose to leverage a pre-existing baseline cohort of 199 older
clinically unimpaired (CU) older adults from the Stanford Memory and Aging Study (SAMS), and additionally
improve the generalizability of this cohort with 30 new participants that self-identify in an ethnoracial group that
is not non-Hispanic White. SAMS participants previously completed lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), high-resolution functional MRI (at 3T) during a visual associative memory paradigm, ultra high-
resolution structural MRI (at 7T) to assess medial temporal lobe subregion integrity, and extensive cognitive
assessment including multiple measurements of hippocampal-dependent memory. This proposal will extend
SAMS to include a longitudinal visit 7 years after baseline (Wave 2) that repeats baseline modalities, and
incorporates tau PET with a next generation ligand 18F-PI-2620. In addition to enriching the baseline sample, we
anticipate data collection on 150 of the 199 eligible participants that completed the baseline visits for SAMS. A
strength of our program is the emphasis on hippocampal-dependent memory processes, given that neurofibrillary
tangle pathology is common in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, and the initial sites of cortical tau deposition
are in cortical areas critical for visual associative memory recollection (angular gyrus and ventral temporal
cortex). Thus, we are well positioned to understand how structural and functional measures that quantify (a)
entorhinal and hippocampal integrity as well as (b) hippocampal-dependent mechanisms of memory (cortical
reinstatement) predict memory decline (Aim 1) and relate to regional tau PET (Aim 2). Given that all MRI and
biofluid measures previously collected at baseline will be repeated during the longitudinal Wave 2 visit proposed
in this application, we will also examine regional structural and functional change in these innovative imaging
measures over time (Aim 3). This proposed research program will yield critical insights regarding the specific
mechanisms underlying memory failure and decline in aging and preclinical AD. The ultimate goal is to formulate
comprehensive multivariate models that will combine our deep phenotyping metrics to determine the set of
predictors most relevant for individual differences in memory in aging and the transition to pathological aging."

Students from under-represented populations and/or disadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately fail to
enter biomedical research at a PhD level, potentially because they lack research experience or self-identity as
scientists. The long-term goal of PREP at UC Davis (PREP@UCD) is to prepare young scholars from these
groups to succeed as academics and leaders in research. Specifically, we aim to provide PREP scholars with
the research, communication, analytical, and life skills required to excel in doctoral programs in the biomedical
sciences. We have reached our benchmark; 12 of 14 PREP@UCD alumni have been accepted to top
biomedical PhD programs, with four alumni awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowships to fund PhD study.
Thus, PREP@UCD is significant because we successfully foster an inclusive scientific training culture that has
led to retaining students from historically marginalized groups in biomedical science at the bachelors-to-
graduate school interface and in PhD programs. The University of California, Davis, is an innovative setting for
a PREP program because it combines high research funding from the NIH (over $250 million last year),
high academic ranking (11th best public university in the country), and commitment to serving
underrepresented (27% of undergraduates and 20% of biomedical PhD students) and first-generation
students (42%). Six PREP scholars annually will participate in research (75%) and career development
activities (25%) under the close guidance of a mentorship team consisting of research supervisors, a faculty
advisor, the PI, and the program coordinator. Three specific aims are proposed to prepare PREP@UCD
scholars for biomedical graduate programs. First, PREP will provide a mentored research environment where
scholars can gain experience in performing individual, hypothesis-driven research. This will help to develop
their self-images as scientists and thus foster success in graduate school. Second, PREP@UCD scholars will
be trained in experimental skills to prepare them for graduate school and a career in biomedical research.
Laboratory activities will develop skills in gathering scientific information, formulating and testing hypotheses,
working in a team, solving problems critically, assessing research ethics and values, and learning technical
skills. Third, PREP@UCD scholars will be empowered with strong professional skills. Each scholar will spend
25% of their effort in career development through communication exercises, grant writing, journal clubs,
participation in research conferences, and workshops in professional skills, careers in biomedical science,
ethics, rigor, and reproducibility. The skills and scientific self-identity fostered during PREP@UCD will provide
the scholars with a better chance of excelling in biomedical PhD programs. The combination of the research
expertise and mentoring experience of the trainers, and a focus on self-identity as a scientist in the
laboratory, coupled with broad professional development activities in a supportive environment, makes the
overall approach of PREP@UCD significant and innovative."
10804598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is the prototype flavivirus and is historically the most important arthropod-borne viral
pathogen of humans worldwide with ~200,000 infections annually and a mortality of ~50% in those who develop
severe symptoms. YFV is endemic throughout Africa and South America and had been largely controlled through
mass vaccination. The YFV vaccine 17D is considered one of the most effective live-attenuated virus (LAV)
vaccines ever developed. Even so, every 10-year boosts have been recommended to maintain immunity.
However, falling vaccination rates have led to a dramatic resurgence of disease in both Africa and South
America, and subsequent vaccination campaigns have depleted the global supply of 17D. In response to these
vaccine shortages, the WHO and CDC revised the 10-year boost to a once-in-a-lifetime vaccination
recommendation, despite limited supporting data: although serosurveys find that ~90% of vaccinees have
detectable neutralizing antibodies to YFV, careful review of these surveys finds that among individuals living in
YFV non-endemic settings, at least 20% of YFV vaccinees lack detectable neutralizing antibodies at >10 years
post-vaccination. While this finding must be critically evaluated in the context of ongoing outbreaks and vaccine
shortages, it also represents a unique opportunity to study how 17D induces and maintains neutralizing
antibodies in some vaccinees but not in others. Our central premise is that long-term YFV immunity is established
by host immune activation in response to vaccine viremia at the time of vaccination: downstream effects of
detectable differences in duration and magnitude of vaccine viremia at vaccination determine whether or not a
vaccinee develops life-long immunity. We propose to evaluate this premise and its broader implications in three
separate Aims: Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that vaccine viremia correlates with the long-term durability of of YFV
neutralizing antibodies. We will enroll YFV pre-vaccinees and prospectively characterize acute vaccine viremia,
acute innate immune and adaptive immune responses, and neutralizing antibody titers up to 5 years thereafter.
Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that at least 20% of 17D vaccinated subjects will lose YFV immunity between 3- and
7-years post vaccination. We will recruit and prospectively follow a cohort of 17D vaccinees vaccinated 2-3 years
prior to enrollment, comparing changes in YFV neutralizing antibodies and other immune markers over time and
characterizing individual and cohort antibody decay kinetics. In Aim 3 we use 17D revaccination as a live-virus
challenge to test the hypothesis that neutralizing antibody titers correlate with YFV protection. We will
prospectively characterize pre-boost antibodies titers, vaccine viremia, acute immune responses and post-boost
titers in vaccinees receiving boost 17D vaccinations. We expect to identify neutralizing antibody titers above
which sterilizing immunity is conferred and titers below which it is not. These Aims will set a foundation for future
studies to further dissect determinants of 17D and other LAV induced immunity and establish metrics that could
allow efficient prioritization of 17D vaccination and optimize 17D use in the face of current and future outbreaks."
10804599,"Emerging evidence indicates that dysfunction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which precedes
neuronal degeneration during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), underlies the hallmark
cognitive impairment. Although there are currently no effective disease modifying treatments for
AD, recent preclinical studies in animal models of AD have suggested that repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) promotes hippocampal synaptic plasticity and, ultimately, improves
learning and memory abilities. In this application, we will utilize MRI-based neuronal connectivity
maps as a guide to precisely propagate the neuronal excitation elicited by the superficial rTMS
pulse to the hippocampus. The premise of this image-guided approach is supported by both
previously published research in healthy adults and our pilot data in individuals with amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our preliminary findings demonstrate that applying a single dose of
rTMS over a superficial brain region that is structurally connected to the hippocampus can
transiently modulate hippocampal activity and enhance associative memory function. The specific
aims of this project are to 1) determine the behavioral effect of hippocampal rTMS on memory
function, 2) verify MRI-guided rTMS effects on hippocampal functional connectivity; and 3)
develop a personalized, image-guided hippocampal rTMS protocol. Sixty individuals with aMCI
will be enrolled in the double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study with three
rTMS conditions: excitatory stimulation, inhibitory stimulation, and sham stimulation. Each
participant will complete 10 stimulation sessions for each condition with a 4-week interval between
conditions to avoid potential carry-over effects. Building on preliminary data, here we will
rigorously test our hypothesis that active rTMS protocols have a stronger modulation effect on
both memory function and hippocampal functional connectivity, compared with sham rTMS in
individuals with aMCI. Furthermore, data acquired from aims 1 and 2 will be used to develop
statistical models to predict responses to rTMS intervention. The proposed research uses
interventions grounded in precision medicine to provide an innovative platform that integrates MRI
(including functional MRI and diffusion-tensor imaging) and rTMS to improve memory function in
individuals with aMCI. This project represents a critical step in developing a non-invasive
hippocampal stimulation protocol that should greatly benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease."
10799827,"Background: Anti-EGFR agents have been shown to benefit colorectal cancer patients, except for patients
whose tumor includes a KRAS mutation. Data from multiple clinical trials suggest this may be incorrect.
Colorectal cancer patients with KRAS G13D appear to benefit from anti-EGFR agents. Controversy surrounds
this observation because it contradicts the well-established mechanisms of EGFR signaling and Ras mutations.
We have investigated the problem with a novel experimental-systems approach of Ras signaling, revealing a
non-intuitive dependency on EGFR that follows from differences in how KRAS mutants interact with tumor
suppressor neurofibromin (NF1) to influence wild-type RAS activation thereby.
Moreover, we have identified an additional 10 mutants that so not bind NF1 and confer sensitivity to EGFR
inhibition. Here we propose to study the remaining mutants that makeup over 90% of the RAS mutations in
CRC. Furthermore, we have devised a strategy to selectively target WT RAS in the resistant RAS alleles to
sensitize CRC to EGFR inhibitors.
Overarching Hypothesis:
We plan to characterize these mutants with hypothesis driven independent aims:
Aim 1 Functional mechanistic studies will test RAS candidates determined by their ability to bind NF1 for EGFR
inhibitor sensitivity.
Aim 2 Pharmacologically target WT-RAS in CRC cells that harbor mutant KRAS alleles that confer intrinsic
resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
Aim 3 Leverage dominant/negative effects of cytosolic NRAS mutants with EGFR inhibition.
Long term goal: It is increasingly believed that combining experimental and computational methods will be
required to match patients with treatments. Our work demonstrates how systems approaches enable
mechanism-based inference concerning how mutations influence the response to treatment. Our current findings
suggest that we can identify more candidates and sensitize resistant alleles by targeting WT-RAS processing.
This potentially could increase the number of patients with EGFR inhibitors that currently cannot receive this
therapy."
10800870,"Prosthetic electrical stimulation of inner retinal neurons can restore a sense of vision in patients with outer retinal
degeneration, but implant patients to date report artificial vision to be low quality. Clinical studies of retinal
prostheses show that long-term implantation and stimulation is safe, and that implant patients can detect large
objects and recognize simple forms. But visual acuity is 20/438 at best, and functional vision is limited by rapid
(within seconds) fading of electrically elicited percepts. Numerous clinical and animal studies demonstrate that
current approaches for retinal stimulation cannot activate the retina with adequate spatial specificity to produce
high quality vision. Thus, the research team proposes to advance several innovative technical approaches that
will have the combined effect of substantially improving both spatial resolution and temporal control of evoked
responses. When implemented clinically, a retinal prosthesis incorporating the proposed technology is expected
to achieve 20/160 vision. Current retinal prostheses have numerous drawbacks. Epiretinal implants have planar
electrodes on the retinal surface, which often activate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons-of-passage.
Consequently, RGC axons with receptive fields far from the stimulation sites are unintentionally excited, resulting
in elongated percepts. Epiretinal electrodes tend to gradually separate from the retina, which also increases the
charge threshold. Suprachoroidal implants likewise have limited resolution due to the large currents needed to
bridge the distance across the choroid separating the electrode array and retina. Subretinal implants reduce the
electrode-retina distance and preferentially stimulate bipolar cells, avoiding RGC axons, thus achieving better
visual acuity than epiretinal implants. But photovoltaic subretinal implants that lack pulse timing circuitry use
simultaneous stimulation, resulting in overlapping electronic receptive fields and reduced spatial resolution.
Subretinal implants with extraocular cables can interleave stimulation to avoid simultaneous stimulation, but such
cables complicate surgery. In practice, subretinal implants can only be applied to a small part of the visual field
since implantation requires retinal detachment, thus limiting their effectiveness in treating retinitis pigmentosa,
which causes wide-field vision loss. The research team’s overarching hypothesis is that intraretinal electrodes
positioned within the inner nuclear layer can overcome all the above limitations. To test this hypothesis, the team
will define the mechanism of intraretinal stimulation by measuring RGC responses, optimize the
resolution of multichannel intraretinal stimulation using computational approaches to parameter
selection and tuning, and verify long-term functionality and biocompatibility of a high-density carbon
fiber array. With expertise in neural engineering, retinal neurobiology, and retinal surgery, the project team will
work collaboratively to design an innovative high-density retinal interface. The long-term impact of this project
will be artificial vision of higher fidelity that will improve the vision-related quality of life for people with retinitis
pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration."
10800925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Agitation is defined as excessive psychomotor activity leading to aggressive and violent behavior in patients
and is often due to exacerbation of underlying serious mental illnesses. Those presenting with agitation in the
emergency setting represent the most marginalized populations. Coercive measures like physical restraints are
currently used routinely on agitated individuals, but are associated with physical trauma, apnea, and death.
Recent studies have shown disproportionate use of physical restraint on Black patients, those who are
homeless, and those with public or no insurance. At the same time, healthcare workers experience stress and
burnout from episodes of workplace violence by agitated patients, leading to reinforcement of negative
attitudes and bias towards marginalized individuals. Interventions to address disparities during psychiatric
crises have been hindered by increased boarding, overcrowding, and other system-based challenges. System
dynamics modeling is a rigorous method that uses advanced mathematical equations and simulations to study
complex systems and identify causal structures that evolve over time. This approach allows us to measure,
predict, and improve health equity and value during agitation care. Our overall objective is to apply systems
dynamics modeling to identify and quantify modifiable targets for reducing disparities in agitation management
and assess benefits and costs of potential interventions addressing those targets across diverse populations
and marginalized groups. To achieve this objective, we will use group model building focus groups (Aim 1) to
adapt our existing qualitative model of agitation care and merge key insights from clinicians, administrators,
security/police, minority patients, and prehospital services to focus on health equity. We will then create a
mathematical model and incorporate existing datasets of patient records, staff injuries, and survey responses
into the model, calibrating quantitative outcomes of restraint use and staff assault and validating parameters of
the relationships established in the qualitative model (Aim 2). Finally, this expanded and validated model will
guide participatory design sessions with stakeholders in an iterative process where computational simulations
for outcomes on equity can be created and predicted in real-time on proposed interventions across three sites
(Aim 3). This will allow us to translate research findings from the model into practice to assist hospital
leadership in deciding if implementing potential interventions is warranted.
This proposed work will make a positive contribution to mental health research by describing, measuring, and
predicting bias and discrimination against minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with
psychiatric emergencies. Our study is highly innovative as it will be the first to address staff safety and patient
advocacy as one unified issue and applies simulation modeling and systems science methods to address the
understudied topic of agitation management and reduce health disparities in psychiatric emergency care."
10801561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Failure to achieve accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is a leading cause of miscarriages,
infertility, and birth defects such as Down syndrome. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying
accurate meiotic chromosome segregation is of paramount importance to human health. The synaptonemal
complex (SC) is a zipper-like structure present from yeast to humans during meiosis that assembles between
homologous chromosomes, stabilizing homologous pairing interactions and promoting interhomolog crossover
formation. However, despite its importance for achieving accurate meiotic chromosome segregation, the
mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how the SC interfaces with recombination and chromosome
remodeling is not well understood in any organism. Our goal is to identify mechanisms regulating the SC and to
determine how SC regulation is linked to DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair progression and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling to ensure accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. We study this in the nematode
C. elegans because it shares a high degree of gene conservation with humans and affords ease of genetic,
cytological, molecular, and biochemical analysis for germline studies. Our progress during the previous funding
period, coupled with new data and molecular targets, place us in an ideal position to understand the regulation
and roles of chromosome synapsis during meiosis. Here we propose two integrated aims to address these critical
issues. Aim 1 will determine how HIM-22, a protein which shares sequence conservation with yeast Set3 and
human ASH1L, regulates SC formation. HIM-22 promotes protein deacetylation in the germline, interacts with a
structural component of the SC, and is required for regulating SC assembly, crossover levels, and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling; this will define a previously unknown meiotic role for this protein modifier in a
metazoan and a new mode of SC regulation. Aim 2 will determine how NatF-mediated N-terminal acetylation of
meiotic proteins regulates the SC. Our studies show that NatF is required for protein acetylation in the germline,
and regulates SC assembly/disassembly, DSB repair progression, crossover distribution, and late prophase I
chromosome remodeling. We previously found that NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of a structural
component of the SC promotes SC assembly. Our past studies on NatB and our current discovery of NatF as a
potential regulator of the SC suggest there is a conserved yet poorly understood regulatory network of different
N-acetyltransferases acting on chromosome synapsis. These studies will shed new light on our understanding
of the mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how these link the SC to DSB repair and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling. Our studies will impact multiple fields of tremendous relevance to human health
including chromosome dynamics, the study of post-translational modifications, and regulation of macromolecular
structures. Taken together, this application will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating
accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis."

Cyclic GMP and calcium (Ca2+) are effectors of phototransduction and maintenance of their homeostasis is
critical for photoreceptor cell health and function. Indeed, perturbance of this homeostasis is thought to be a
primary driver of cell death in different forms of retinal degenerations. For example, mutations affecting
phototransduction genes leading to elevated cGMP is expected to cause toxic Ca2+ influx into the outer segment
via the cGMP-gated channels. Although a reasonable hypothesis, it is difficult to reconcile with 1) the cell death
machinery is localized in the inner segment, and 2) the current dogma that the outer and inner segments Ca2+
are compartmentalized and insulated from each other. This raises an important and unanswered question: how
does [Ca2+] buildup in the outer segment alter [Ca2+] in the inner segment to activate cell death? Our central
hypothesis is that altered Ca2+ homeostasis at the outer segment leads to mitochondrial stress at the inner
segment. This, in turn, allows Ca2+ to equilibrate with the proximal cell compartments where the cell death
machinery resides. To test this hypothesis, we will use mouse models that express genetically encoded,
ratiometric Ca2+ indicators in retinal rods and cones. To prevent activating the photoreceptor cells, we will use 1)
a multiphoton microscope equipped with a super-sensitive HyD detector that images under extremely low photon
flux and 2) mouse models with attenuated phototransduction to reduce Ca2+ feedback. Using retinae obtained
from both male and female mice, we will image [Ca2+]i from different cellular compartments simultaneously, in
both dark adapted and light exposed conditions, in healthy and degenerating photoreceptors, to visualize how
changes in [Ca2+] in one cellular compartment may affect [Ca2+] in another compartment. The proposed
experiments should provide a better understanding of the role of Ca2+ homeostasis in health and disease."

Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum is the causative agents of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection with an
estimated worldwide incidence of 16-32 million new cases per year. The incidence of syphilis in the United States
has increased 6-fold over the past two decades. Although this important human pathogen was identified over
100 years ago, the inability to grow T. pallidum in vitro had greatly hampered research into its biology and
mechanisms of pathogenesis. In 2018, our group reported continuous long-term multiplication of T. pallidum in
co-culture with rabbit epithelial cells and a complex medium. We now have T. pallidum cultures that have been
maintained over five years. The in vitro cultivation system provides an excellent animal-free model system as
the in vitro cultured organisms fully retain “wild-type” motility, morphology, virulence and generation times.
Transcriptional profiles of T. pallidum grown in vitro are quite similar to organisms harvested from infected rabbits.
We have successfully used this in vitro culture system to isolate clonal populations of T. pallidum, to conduct
systematic nutritional analysis of nutrients required for growth in vitro, and to analyze patterns of peptidoglycan
synthesis and division sites. In recent studies, conditions have been identified that supported limited
multiplication of T. pallidum under axenic conditions (i.e. without the presence of mammalian cells). In the
continuation of this project, we propose to extend and expand the study of factors and genes affecting T. pallidum
multiplication using both metabolomic and mutational approaches. The specific aims are to 1) define T.
pallidum nutritional requirements and develop an empirically validated metabolic map with the goal of
achieving axenic growth; and 2) perform a global mutational analysis of T. pallidum genes involved in in
vitro growth and pathogenesis through transposon mutagenesis and other genetic approaches. The
further development of the T. pallidum in vitro culture system and the creation of a publicly available library of T.
pallidum mutants will likely facilitate many aspects of T. pallidum research, including studies of physiology,
structure, antimicrobial susceptibility, pathogenesis, and host immunity."

 The long-term goal of this project is to understand how type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1 receptors)
regulate synaptic plasticity and learning in the cerebellar circuit. Long-term changes in synaptic strength are a
primary cellular mechanism by which neuronal circuits learn, adapt, and store information. However, synaptic
plasticity itself must be regulated to provide a balance between response acquisition/adaptation and memory
storage/circuit stability. We hypothesize that long-term synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar circuit is
regulated by activity-dependent changes in CB1 receptor expression.
 CB1 receptors are highly expressed at presynaptic terminals of many brain circuits involved in learning and
motor coordination, including the cerebellum. At parallel fiber synapses, CB1 receptors are required for
induction of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), process that are widely
believed to be a cellular correlate of behavioral learning in the cerebellum. Our recent work and preliminary
data have shown that CB1 receptors at parallel fiber synapses are down-regulated following physiological
patterns of activity, demonstrating that CB1 receptor expression is a plastic property of the synapses. We will
show that activity-dependent down-regulation of presynaptic CB1 receptors reduces the magnitude and/or
probability of both LTP and LTD at parallel fiber synapses. We propose that down-regulation of CB1 receptors
is a critical step in cerebellar learning that reduces future plasticity at modified synapses and allows for fine-
tuning or storage of motor responses.
 This work will lay the groundwork of basic cellular physiology for understanding changes in CB1 receptor
expression in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that
presynaptic CB1 receptors control the gain of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum. This work will be critical for
understanding how synaptic plasticity is regulated in neuronal circuits and potentially dysregulated in
conditions that alter the endocannabinoid system, including epilepsy, depression, and spinocerebellar ataxia.
 Aim 1: Investigate whether CB1 receptor expression determines LTP/LTD amplitude. Hypothesis: The
 magnitude of long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses is directly related to CB1R activity.
 Aim 2: Determine the effects of cerebellar learning on CB1 receptor expression.
 Hypothesis: Reduction of CB1R expression at PF synapses during cerebellar learning or synaptic plasticity is
 necessary for proper memory formation and retention.
 Aim3: Determine the mechanisms and signaling pathways required for CB1 receptor plasticity.
 Hypothesis: CB1R activity is reduced by GRK-mediated internalization and increased 2AG metabolism."

Senescence is the process by which a cell permanently stops proliferating due to cellular aging
or damage but does not die. Induction of senescence is often desirable during cancer treatment
to prevent the proliferation of aberrant cells, but it also impedes cellular function and
regenerative capacity as we age. The study of cellular senescence is hindered by the fact that
senescence is difficult to distinguish from other states of cell-cycle withdrawal such as
quiescence, a transient cellular resting state. This is because quiescence and senescence are
defined by overlapping molecular markers and because these cell-cycle transitions occur
heterogeneously from cell to cell. Despite obvious medical relevance, it is unclear whether
senescence and quiescence are truly distinct states. Here we propose to test the hypothesis
that senescence and quiescence exist on a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal where the
probability of cell-cycle re-entry steadily declines toward zero as cells become senescent.
We will leverage our unique expertise in long-term, time-lapse microscopy, automated single-
cell tracking, and the development of sensors for cell-cycle progression and cell-cycle
withdrawal to unveil gradations of cell-cycle withdrawal that are invisible by standard bulk
approaches. Our specific aims are 1) To determine the predictive power of prevailing
senescence markers as binary markers of senescence and as graded markers of quiescence
depth, 2) To determine at the transcriptomic level whether quiescence and senescence are
distinct states or part of a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal, and 3) To the identify the DNA
damage and telomere features that predict permanent cell-cycle withdrawal as cells age toward
replicative senescence.
If successful, this work will improve our ability to define molecularly the state of senescence and
will generate new fundamental knowledge about the onset of senescence. Our work could
improve the ability to predict tumor relapse after cancer therapy, help quantify a cell’s
physiological age and reproductive potential, identify ways to rejuvenate aged cells, and
improve the safety of senolytic drugs that eliminate senescent cells."
10804460,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related motor neuron degenerative diseases affect more than 30,000
people in the US, and 90% of patients die within five years of diagnosis. Although ALS and ALS-like disease
manifestation varies, all forms are characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. These disorders have a
strong genetic component, and although more than 50 genes involved in ALS have been identified, much still
remains to be learned about the genes and mechanisms that contribute to ALS susceptibility and protection.
Aberrant RNA metabolism and processing plays an important mechanistic role in neurodegeneration, and
mutations in genes encoding RNA-binding proteins underscore several of the more common causes of ALS.
The general idea that altered RNA metabolism and processing leads to neurodegenerative disease suggests
that additional genes encoding RNA-binding or RNA processing factors are likely to be involved in the genetics
of ALS and related neurodegenerative disorders. The ZNF106 gene encodes an RNA binding protein and maps
to human chromosome 15q15.1, the site of an incompletely described rare form of juvenile onset ALS. Genetic
inactivation of Zfp106, the mouse ortholog of ZNF106, results in an early onset, profound ALS-like
neurodegenerative phenotype with a corresponding loss of motor neurons, suggesting that this factor plays a
neuroprotective role in vivo and that its loss-of-function could be involved in ALS in humans. Zfp106 is expressed
in the nucleolus and nuclear speckles in both motor neurons and skeletal muscle and its function is essential for
maintenance of neuromuscular junctions in vivo. Zfp106 binds selectively to G-quadruplex-forming RNA
molecules and strongly associates biochemically with other RNA binding proteins, including several with strong
causative roles in ALS, further suggesting the possibility that Zfp106/ZNF106 might play a role in ALS. Consistent
with this notion, unpublished work has identified two unrelated patients with a rare, homozygous variant in
ZNF106 that is associated with adolescent onset ALS-like neurodegenerative disease. Introduction of the human
disease-associated ZNF106 variant into mouse Zfp106 also results in profound juvenile onset ALS-like
neurodegeneration similar to the disease observed in the patients and in Zfp106-null mice. This proposal will
test the hypotheses that mutations in human ZNF106 cause or contribute to ALS-like neurodegeneration and
that Zfp106 plays a protective role in maintaining neuromuscular junctions through its RNA binding function and
its autonomous functions in either motor neurons or skeletal muscle. Studies proposed in this application will
define the functional consequences ALS0associated ZNF106 variants by characterizing the ALS-like
neurodegenerative phenotype in mice harboring knock-in of the variant and by determining the effect of the
variant in cell culture-based and in vitro assays of ZNF106/Zfp106 protein function. These studies will also
determine the cell autonomous requirement for Zfp106 in motor neurons and skeletal muscle using conditional
genetic approaches in mice."
10804256,"Project Summary / Abstract
Delirium is an acute disturbance of attention and awareness that afflicts >20% of hospitalized older adults and
costs up to $152 billion each year due to associations with prolonged hospitalization, cognitive decline, and an
accelerated course of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Delirium is especially challenging to evaluate and
treat because it is dynamic: patients fluctuate between severe symptoms one hour to minimal the next,
exposing a knowledge gap: we do not know which factors mediate those fluctuations. Many delirium risk
factors, such as age, are irreversible and do not explain delirium’s dynamic course. In contrast, sleep-wake
activity and circadian rhythms are highly dynamic and potentially modifiable. While the incidences of sleep
disturbance and delirium are generally associated, whether and how they interact remains unclear, and clinical
trials targeting sleep do not consistently improve delirium. There is a critical need to determine the sequence of
events through which specific disturbances of sleep-wake activity impact delirium’s trajectory. These efforts
have been limited by a lack of tools to measure delirium and sleep-wake activity continuously. The long-term
goal of this project is to identify new delirium treatments by understanding the characteristics, causes, and
effects of delirium fluctuations. The current objective is to apply novel continuous monitoring to test the central
hypothesis that specific sleep-wake and circadian features predict acute delirium fluctuations, which in turn
forecast long-term cognitive decline. The rationale for the proposed work is that continuous monitoring of
delirium and sleep-wake activity will identify specific disturbances in sleep-wake and circadian activity that
impact delirium’s trajectory, sharpening focus on those specific disturbances to manage delirium acutely. This
project utilizes an innovative approach that integrates recently developed measures of physiologic delirium
severity, sleep-wake activity, and circadian rhythms with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to quantify the
course of delirium rigorously. These measures will be used to study the acute course and long-term trajectory
of delirium in 400 hospitalized, non-intubated adults aged 65 years or older, admitted to the hospital with
pneumonia, one of the most common causes of delirium in older adults. Aim 1 will establish the temporal
characteristics of delirium using EEG in hospitalized older adults. Aim 2 will determine which features of sleep-
wake activity affect the subsequent course of delirium. Aim 3 will identify the features of acute delirium
trajectories that predict long-term cognitive impairment. The proposed research is significant because it will
lead to the following expected outcomes: (1) new methods to quantify and track delirium severity at the
bedside, (2) identification of specific sleep, circadian biology, and environmental factors as therapeutic targets
to improve delirium, and (3) improved ability to identify patients with elevated risk of poor cognitive outcome
during the therapeutic window. These outcomes will establish a firm physiologic foundation, objective
biomarkers, and critical targets to understand and ameliorate delirium’s acute and long-term impacts."

cardiovascular disease prevention, screening, and treatment. For example, this application’s co-Investigator

medication protocols and adherence counseling 3. Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, and 4. Electronic
health record (EHR) support tools, to be compared with generic prevention education. Each component has a
“dose”, e.g. number of days/week home BP should be recorded and reported, and number and duration of
adherence counseling sessions. Implementation scientists, such as those conducting this trial, discuss the
tension between fidelity to the original intervention protocol, and the need for tailoring, tweaking and
adaptation, perhaps contextually driven, i.e. varying by facility size, composition of the provider workforce, or
health status of the patient population served. Under our innovative Learn-As-you-GO (LAGO) design, as the
trial evolves, the doses of these intervention components are adapted at pre-specified stages to maximize
cost-effectiveness and reduce the ultimate risk of trial failure by achieving pre-specified statistical power, while
at the same time preserving the nominal size of the hypothesis test for the overall intervention package effect
and attaining a pre-planned study outcome goal, such as attainment of 80% of patients under blood pressure
control. Because each intervention component is associated with different costs and effectiveness, it is difficult
to specify the optimal intervention package, that is, the optimal intervention component “doses” along with the
components themselves, before launching a trial, as standard methods require. LAGO designs for continuous
outcomes, such as changes in blood pressure (mmHg) or cholesterol levels (mg/dL) as in XCVD; for repeated
binary outcomes, such as per visit hypertension control; and which account for clustering of outcome rates
within centers are not available. In this project, following on our 2021 Annals of Statistics publication
establishing fundaments for logistic regression analysis of a single binary outcome in non-clustered data, we
will derive the mathematical theory for LAGO designs for clustered binary and continuous repeated measures
data, and compare the LAGO design to its standard non-adaptive factorial and two-armed alternatives where
the intervention is fixed before the study commences. Once a LAGO study concludes, LAGO provides a
means to design interventions for new centers, scaling up and out, subject to the same class of goals, perhaps
contextually dependent. Methods will be applied to XCVD and PULESA-Uganda, another active CMCI trial led
by co-Investigator Longenecker for which contact PI Spiegelman serves as study statistician, allowing for this
trial to serve as a living laboratory for LAGO methods development. User-friendly, publicly available software

10803494,"This is a year -30 renewal request that addresses a major challenge in medicinal chemistry, namely reducing
the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutics. In prior work, we showed that conjugation of a Pt(IV) center to a
water solubilized texaphyrin core called motexfin gadolinium (MGd) allowed for near-complete tumor regrowth
suppression in a patient-derived xenograft ovarian cancer mouse model. We now propose to build on this
success by creating metallotexaphyrin conjugates bearing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) inhibitors
and Au(I) payloads. Advantage will be taken of the fact that the properties of metallotexaphyrins vary with the
metal. This, we suggest, will allow us to create tumor-targeting systems with functional features that include an
ability to act as so-called PARASHIFT and 19-F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes, as well as promoting
photo-induced thermal and pyroptosis effects. The net result should be systems that not only allow for imaging,
but also give rise to therapeutic benefits that are enhanced relative to the active payload alone. To test this
hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims:
 1. Explore paramagnetic water solubilized lanthanide texaphyrins as a new class of potential
 PARASHIFT probes. Prepare new paramagnetic water soluble texaphyrin complexes and confirm that
 these complexes produce large downfield or upfield paramagnetic shifts of key 1-H signals (e.g., methyl
 resonances). Extend these studies to include fluorinated derivatives to allow concurrent 1H- and 19F-NMR
 based signaling.
 2. Prepare and study In vitro texaphyrin conjugates based on PARP inhibitors and Au(I) centers.
 Synthesize texaphyrin conjugates based on PARP inhibitors and Au(I) centers. Study in platinum
 sensitive/resistant ovarian, BRCA1 normal/mutated triple negative breast and lung cancer cell lines. Test
 whether improvements are seen with easier-to-cleave linkers.
 3. Test whether cell killing synergies with the conjugated payload are seen under conditions of red-
 light photo-irradiation in vitro. Test whether damage associated molecular patterns characteristic of
 pyroptosis or the increases in temperature expected for photothermal effects are seen for key texaphyrin
 conjugates upon photo-irradiation.
 4. Carry the most promising systems on into in vivo studies using murine models. Treat tumor bearing
 mice with most promising conjugates for desired application i.e., MR imaging, photothermal and pyroptosis.

10803742,"Acquired mutations in splicing factors, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1, are prevalent in about half of all
patients with the clonal myeloid disorder myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a disease associated with aging.
Since their initial description in 2011, we have learned that these mutations are non-synonymous, mutually
exclusive, and function as disease drivers. Changes in alternative splicing effected by these mutant
spliceosomes have been extensively studied but are quite modest, and common patterns of splicing
dysregulation that can explain the disease phenotype have not emerged. These studies have focused on the
mature transcriptome (RNA-seq of polyadenylated mRNA) and discount the additional roles splicing factors play
in RNA processing, such as 5’ end capping, splicing, editing and modification, 3’ end cleavage, polyadenylation,
nucleocytoplasmic export, and mRNA decay and stability. Given that RNA transcription and splicing are closely
coordinated (co-transcriptional splicing), we determined the changes in transcription kinetics in isogenic cells
harboring the K700E mutation of SF3B1, the most mutated splicing factor in MDS. We found that elongation of
RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) leads to increased transcription-replication conflicts (TRC) and increased R-loops
(three-stranded structures of newly synthesized RNA within a DNA-helix). Changes in transcription also induce
changes in histone marks (H3K4me3) and chromatin organization. Using a short hairpin RNA library, we
identified epigenetic regulators (in the Sin3/HDAC complex), which when knocked down reverses the
transcription elongation defects and replication stress. SF3B1K700E expression also leads to a paradoxical RNA
processing event: transcripts with retained introns are decreased in mutant cells compared to wild-type cells.
Taken together, we hypothesize that SF3B1K700E-induced changes in RNA transcription, its subsequent
processing, and chromatin organization could have disease-causing effects that are distinct from alternative
splicing. The application is organized into three aims that address the following fundamental questions that arise
from our preliminary data: (1) How does SF3B1K700E change RNA transcription? (2) How does SF3B1K700E impact
co-transcriptional splicing and intron retention? (3) How does chromatin organization change in response to
RNAPII, and how can we target them for therapeutic benefit? State-of-the art approaches to be implemented
include long read sequencing (LRS) of nascent RNA to define coordination of RNA processing and splicing at
the single RNA molecule level (pioneered by the Neugebauer Lab), metabolic labeling and sequencing to
determine kinetics of IR-RNA decay, and multiplexed imaging of RNA (MERFISH). The results will be confirmed
in primary CD34+ cultures from MDS patient samples and in a mouse model of heterozygous Sf3b1K700E
mutation. Our studies will explore a novel paradigm in human disease pathogenesis: disruption of functional
coupling between transcription and splicing. It will also inform ways to therapeutically target epigenetic pathways
in splicing factor-mutant clonal myeloid disorders."
10802836,"Project Summary/Abstract
Infection of the olfactory epithelium in COVID-19 patients is thought to underlie loss of smell (anosmia), a
pathognomonic symptom that can be long-term in some patients, significantly affecting quality of life. The
olfactory epithelium is also believed to be a major entry point for systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can
result in neurological as well as respiratory symptoms. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 cannot bind the mouse ACE2
receptor, and existing human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing mouse models either do not permit conditional
analysis or do not confer severe illness after infection. Due to the lack of genetically manipulable models that
display severe disease, the infected cell types responsible for acute and long-term anosmia, and the route(s)
by which the virus penetrates the brain, have not been definitively identified. To address these gaps in
knowledge and test cell type-specific requirements for COVID-19-related pathologies we generated conditional
hACE2fl knockin mice that express hACE2 in similar cell types to humans. hACE2fl mice nasally inoculated with
a high dose of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 display initial infection of olfactory epithelium and rapidly develop
anosmia. This is followed by infection of neurons in the olfactory bulb and brain, which is associated with
lethality and requires neuronal hACE2 expression. Importantly, specific destruction of olfactory epithelium via
methimazole treatment prevents olfactory bulb and brain infection and lethality, identifying the olfactory
epithelium as an essential gateway to CNS infection. hACE2fl mice inoculated with a low dose of wild-type
SARS-CoV-2 show reversible disease and survive, but a subset displays a long-term decrease in odor
sensitivity (hyposmia) like that observed in humans. We propose to use hACE2fl mice to provide definitive
genetic evidence for cellular mechanisms of short- and long-term loss of smell and identify the pathways for
brain infection during COVID-19. These studies are expected to complement existing descriptive human
studies to identify causal pathogenic mechanisms and preventative and therapeutic targets. Three specific
aims will be pursued: (i) define the cellular requirements for acute loss of smell; (ii) determine the mechanisms
of long-term hyposmia; and (iii) uncover the cellular mechanisms of olfactory bulb and brain infection."

candidates, or predict treatment outcomes after laser vision correction (LVC) or corneal cross-linking (CXL). To
address this need, in the initial funding period of our research program we developed a highly sensitive clinical
instrument based on Motion-Tracking (MT) Brillouin microscopy; measured Brillouin corneal maps in over 200
eyes; provided the first demonstration of superior performance of biomechanical vs morphologic imaging in
identifying early-stage and subclinical keratoconus; and, characterized biomechanical alterations after LVC and
CXL. Our goal for this proposal is to realize the clinical potential of MT-Brillouin microscopy: on the clinical side,
in Aim 1, we are going to address the most relevant clinical task that continues to elude clinicians, i.e. predict
keratoconus progression risk; in Aim 2, we are going to improve the predictive power of Finite Element Modeling
(FEM) to a point where it becomes a clinically useful tool by combining it with Brillouin mechanical measurement
of the cornea; on the technology side, in Aim 3, we will develop and validate rapid/automatic MT-Brillouin
microscopy to enable a mechanical imaging session within 2 minutes and thus facilitate integration in the existing
clinical workflow. This research is significant because accurate and nonperturbative elasticity-based metrics will
drive a paradigm shift in how keratoconus is identified and managed as well as in how LVC and CXL treatments
are ultimately individualized using patient-specific localized corneal biomechanical information to improve
procedure safety and efficacy."

 The major goals of neuroscience are to understand how the central nervous system (CNS) processes
information, generates emotions, stores memories, and drives behavior. Considerable effort has been devoted
to the study of neurons, yet neurons do not act alone in the brain. Thus, much is to be gained from understanding
the interplay between neurons and other non-neuronal cells, particularly glial cells. Astrocytes are the most
numerous glial cells and are present throughout the entire CNS. Their existence and close proximity to neurons
were recognized more than a century ago. However, our understanding of astrocytes is still in its infancy. Unlike
neurons, astrocytes do not transmit electrical action potentials, but instead utilize complex intracellular Ca2+
signaling to communicate with each other and mediate their effects on neurons and other cells. These astrocytic
Ca2+ signals occur throughout the entire cell, both spontaneously and in response to neuronal activity. Mounting
evidence has implicated astrocytic Ca2+ signaling as essential to modulating neuronal function and animal
behaviors. Importantly, abnormalities of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling are implicated in numerous neurological and
psychiatric disorders. However, despite progress, the physiological significance of astrocyte Ca2+-dependent
signaling for the function(s) of neural microcircuits in vivo, for animal behavior, and for brain diseases remains
incompletely understood. In this proposal, we aim to determine the roles of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in regulating
the prefrontal neural circuit activity as well as avoidance behavior by addressing a series of fundamental
questions: What is the physiological relevance of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling from the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) in avoidance behavior and does astrocyte Ca2+ signaling display subregional heterogeneity (Aim 1)?
Whether and how attenuated astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in the mPFC affect the prefrontal neuronal activity and
avoidance behavior (Aim 2)? Whether and how enhanced astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in the mPFC affect the
prefrontal neuronal activity and avoidance behavior (Aim 3)? Our proposed research will integrate state-of-the-
art techniques for genetic/chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC astrocytes and in vivo Ca2+ imaging of activity
dynamics of astrocytes and defined neuronal populations in freely-behaving mice to reveal the fundamental
mechanisms of astrocytes in mediating behavior. This investigation will yield novel, critical insights into the
intercellular communications between astrocytes and neurons. These insights will have a great potential to
inspire the development of new therapies to treat a wide range of brain disorders."

The continuing emergence and rapid dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens are becoming a major threat
to public health. Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant
Acinetobacter, which are difficult to treat, were recognized as one of the urgent threats among patients in medical
facilities. Serious infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens are associated with higher rates of morbidity
and mortality and contribute to significant economic costs. Cefiderocol, which received FDA approval in 2019, is
a novel siderophore-conjugated cephalosporin with expanded activity against carbapenem-resistant Gram-
negative pathogens including strains that produce serine carbapenemases and metallo-β-lactamases.
Cefiderocol-nonsusceptible isolates were reported in surveillance studies but the resistance mechanisms are
largely unknown on many occasions. Antimicrobial heteroresistance describes a phenomenon where
subpopulations of genetically homogeneous bacteria exhibit a range of susceptibilities to a particular antibiotic.
Heteroresistance has considerable clinical relevance because antibiotic treatment may select more resistant
populations. It is considered an important factor contributing to unexplained antibiotic treatment failure.
Heteroresistance has been reported in various bacterial species to many classes of antibiotics. However, there
is a lack of thorough research studying cefiderocol heteroresistance, the underlying mechanisms, and its clinical
relevance. The overall goal of the proposed project is to study preexisting cefiderocol resistance and
heteroresistance without prior cefiderocol exposure and the evolution of cefiderocol resistance after cefiderocol
exposure in vitro and in patients. In Aim 1, we will investigate preexisting cefiderocol resistance and
heteroresistance mechanisms in clinically isolated carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. In Aim 2,
we will study in vitro and clinical evolution of cefiderocol resistance following cefiderocol exposure, and
characterize isolates with reduced cefiderocol susceptibility."

This project explores how immigrant legal status exposures impact the health and wellbeing of older (50+)
Latino immigrants. The unauthorized Latino foreign-born population in the US is currently aging in place,
leading to a growing number of older Latinos who experienced years of hardship throughout their adult lives
and, as older adults, are excluded from the US social safety net system. The aging of the Latino population is
thus likely accompanied by two related trends: (1) dramatic increases in the share of older Latinos without full
access to the public programs that have been shown to considerably reduce poverty and increase access to
health care among older American citizens, and (2) increased reliance by older Latinos on kinship networks –
chiefly their middle-aged children – for daily financial and health care needs. Our goal is to document these
trends and explore how they impact the health and wellbeing of older Latinos. The project has three specific
aims.
First, we will investigate how immigrant legal status exposures are related to older Latino immigrants’ health
and their access and utilization of health care. Our key innovation is to use longitudinal Health and Retirement
Survey (HRS) data that is linked to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Medicare/Medicaid files. We
will use information from linkages to these administrative data to measure immigrants’ legal status and time
spent in each status and then model the relationship between legal status exposures and levels and
trajectories in both physical (e.g. functional limitations, allostatic load, mortality risk) and mental health (e.g.
depression, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease), and access/utilization of health care.
Second, we will investigate the availability and effectiveness of kinship networks of older Latinos. We will use
HRS data to explore questions related to (1) the characteristics of older Latinos' kinship networks by immigrant
legal status, and (2) the relationship between the size/characteristics of older Latino's kinship networks and
their unmet need for assistance, as well as their health and access/utilization of health care.
Third, we will develop a microsimulation model to project the size and composition of older Latino immigrants
and their kinship networks. The microsimulation will enable us to model health outcomes and the level of
kinship support for Latinos as this population ages in place over the next decade. Additionally, we will use the
model to compare the “status quo” scenario to multiple potential policy changes that would alter the level of
support for older immigrants or offer a pathway to legalization and citizenship, and impact older Latinos.
The proposed research will inform science and policy about access to care and contribute to building evidence-
based interventions for promoting health and wellbeing among the aging Latino immigrant community."

Reproducible assembly of protein molecules from free amino acids requires external information stored
in DNA/RNA (genome). In contrast, assembly of higher-order structures from individual protein molecules
is thought to occur de novo, relying on information intrinsic to each protein component. How higher-order
complexity emerges efficiently without error using only the scattered information in each building block
remains a question hindering core understandings of life. Here we address this question using the
biogenesis of the centriole organelle as the example. We found that a proteinaceous structure called the
cartwheel is grown inside existing centrioles, which is then split, shed and used as structural templates
(or guidance) for reproducing a copy of the centriole with the same size/shape. Uncontrolled cartwheel
shedding was further found to underly a human disease called Alström syndrome. By erasing the old
guidance, we showed that new/naive centrioles varying widely in size and shape arise, which can
propagate reproducibly thereafter in cells otherwise genetically identical. The simplest model explaining
our results is that one or more steps of centriole biogenesis are template-based, instructed by information
stored and transmitted outside of the genome. This model on which the current proposal is based on will
shed light on how cellular complexity emerges reproducibly from components randomly distributed in the
cell, redefining the scope of biological information as we currently understood."
10803208,"Obesity and diabetes are major public health issues that affect quality of life and also have high social and
economic costs. According to the CDC, approximately 10% of U.S. adults have diabetes now and 33% are
expected to have diabetes by 2050. At the same time, obesity has reached epidemic proportions, with over 60%
of the U.S. population being overweight or obese. Therefore, there is a serious demand for the development of
new therapeutics to combat obesity and diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone
that ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in a number of obese animal models and humans. Extended
administration of FGF21 causes weight loss in rodents, and administration of FGF21 analogs to obese humans
increases weight loss and improves metabolic profiles. Recently, we discovered that FGF21 functions
physiologically and pharmacologically to suppress carbohydrate intake and sweet taste preference. Importantly,
we and others have found that many of the beneficial effects of FGF21 are mediated through its actions on the
central nervous system. However, the mechanism of FGF21 action in the brain and the neuronal target(s) for
these effects has not been determined. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neural circuit(s)
regulating FGF21-mediated suppression of carbohydrate intake. The aims of this grant are to 1) determine the
contribution of KLB+ glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) to regulate sugar intake and
sweet taste preference, 2) determine whether KLB+ NTS glutamatergic neurons are glucose sensitive and how
FGF21 modulates their activity, and 3) determine the independent and coordinated effect of FGF21 signaling in
the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and NTS to regulate sugar intake and sweet taste preference. To
accomplish these aims, we have generated novel animal models and tools to examine these experimental aims.
These studies will provide new fundamental insights into the regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis and
food-related reward by peripheral endocrine signals acting on the central nervous system. In addition, these
studies may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes and obesity."

HIV-exposed infants experience high rates of adverse birth outcomes, including stillbirth, preterm birth, small
for gestational age, and neonatal death. These birth outcomes carry substantial morbidity and mortality in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) where access to neonatal intensive care services is limited. Chlamydia and gonorrhea
are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are highly prevalent among women with HIV in SSA. These STIs
are associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes if untreated in pregnancy. While antenatal
screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea is recommended in pregnancy in some high-income settings, including
the US, it is not yet a part of routine care in SSA. Syndromic management, the current standard of care in SSA,
consists of empiric, symptom-driven treatment of STIs. However, this approach misses up to 70% of STIs,
while exposing 75% of symptomatic pregnant women to inappropriate treatment and promoting antibiotic
resistance. The clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of antenatal chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among
pregnant women with HIV has not been well-studied in resource-limited settings. I am an infectious disease
physician and clinician-investigator with experience in simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness research. I
am committed to using model-based research to improve the health of women and children in resource-limited
settings. To become an independent investigator, I require further training and mentorship in: 1) advanced
modeling techniques, 2) costing and model input derivation, and 3) principles of implementing maternal, child,
and reproductive health interventions. I have outlined a didactic plan, assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship
team, and established a new collaboration with investigators focused on maternal-child health in Botswana. My
primary mentor is Dr. Andrea Ciaranello, an expert in modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis related to
maternal-child health. My mentorship team additionally includes experts in advanced modeling methods (Dr.
David Paltiel), adverse birth outcomes among children in Botswana (Dr. Roger Shapiro), and obstetrical care in
sub-Saharan Africa (Dr. Blair Wylie). With their guidance, I will address two Specific Aims:
 1. To develop a detailed microsimulation model of women with HIV and their infants through
 pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period that incorporates clinical and economic details of
 maternal and infant HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea infection, as well as adverse birth outcomes
 2. To evaluate the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of chlamydia and gonorrhea
 screening strategies in pregnancy, incorporating outcomes for women with HIV and their infants
 in Botswana
The proposed training and research aims will inform efforts to improve maternal-child health outcomes in
Botswana and will provide a foundation for a career as an independent investigator who can apply modeling to
address critical questions at the intersection of HIV, maternal-child health, and global healthcare policy."
10789996,"L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) play a fundamental role in brain neurons as mediators of diverse Ca2+ signaling
events. LTCCs on neuronal somata play a unique and crucial role in regulating Ca2+-dependent gene expression.
A salient feature of LTCCs is that their activity is regulated by clustering through cooperative gating of clustered
channels. Their clustering also localizes them to specialized Ca2+ signaling microdomains within which they
functionally couple to Ca2+-dependent proteins that transduce the impact of LTCC-mediated Ca2+ entry to specific
Ca2+ signaling pathways. Through their canonical function as K+ conducting voltage-gated channels, somatic
Kv2.1 channels play critical roles in the regulation of action potentials, with a subsequent impact on LTCC activity.
The general consensus is that the functions of LTCCs and Kv2.1 channels in neurons are otherwise largely
independent from one another. Our recent work challenges this view. We discovered a novel and unexpected
nonconducting role for Kv2.1 in physically regulating the organization of neuronal LTCCs, enhancing their activity
and impacting their localization in specific microdomains. These exciting new results lead to a novel model that
in brain neurons, Kv2.1 plays dual roles, one as a canonical K+ channel shaping the intrinsic membrane
properties of neurons, and the other a nonconducting physical role to cluster LTCCs to enhance their activity
and localize them in Ca2+ signaling microdomains. The combination of the complementary backgrounds and skill
sets of the Timmer and Santana labs allows us to implement a multi-scale systems approach that involves the
use of cellular, molecular, biophysical, imaging, gene editing and whole-animal approaches to rigorously
investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby Kv2.1 impacts LTCC organization, and the consequences to
LTCC function and neuronal signaling. The project has three specific aims, which are to determine how
selectively eliminating 1) Kv2.1 expression, 2) Kv2.1 clustering, and 3) the ability of Kv2.1 to enhance LTCC
clustering impacts somatic LTCC localization and function, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release or sparks, and LTCC-dependent transcript factor activation. The proposed studies have the potential of transforming our
understanding of how neuronal ion channels are regulated and how this impacts Ca2+ signaling in health and
when altered in disease."

In response to RFA-HD-20-015 for the Population Dynamics Research Infrastructure Program
FY 2020 (P2C), the University of Colorado Population Center (CUPC) requests renewal of
infrastructure support for the five- year project period 2020–2025. With strategic investment of
15 years of center support from NICHD, CUPC has become a leading research institution in
several areas of population science that include health disparities and behaviors, reproductive
health, demography and genetics, migration and population distribution, and environmental
demography. CUPC was an innovative leader in the emergence of demography and genetics,
as well as environmental demography, as important areas of population science. It has gained
substantial momentum over the past five years, and exciting new collaborative possibilities have
emerged including ties with the University of Colorado’s (CU) Natural Hazards Center and new
Earth Lab. NICHD support has also been leveraged to garner generous new investments from
CU Boulder, and an agreement with CU Denver further solidifies CUPC as the hub of population
science along the Front Range. Three specific aims guide the Center’s activities in the next five
years: to (1) accelerate population science that matters; (2) fuel innovation in population
science; and (3) continue and increase support for junior scientists. To reach these aims, we
propose two cores. The Administrative Core maximizes affiliates’ research time by reducing
administrative burdens as well as by providing experienced, specialized assistance with grant
preparation and submission. The Development Core undertakes a wide variety of activities to
facilitate innovative scholarship, including offering a seed grant program, strong mentoring,
working groups, speaker series, mini-conferences, and workshops. Important changes have
been made in response to past successes, lessons learned, and new research opportunities.
These changes include higher limits for seed funding, an annual grant writing workshop, and
restructuring the center’s research leadership to further energize working groups and increase
faculty leadership opportunities. Overall, the proposal outlines a research plan firmly grounded
on a strong intellectual foundation that includes energetic new affiliates, several areas of high-
impact emerging scholarship, and new commitments from home institutions. The next five years
will build on CUPC’s critical momentum."

In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death, affects 11% of the population over age
65, and costs $355 billion each year. One of the first impairments in AD is spatial memory, which involves the
hippocampal area CA1. CA1 encodes new information, driven by inputs from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC),
and retrieves and consolidates old information, driven by inputs from hippocampal area CA3. Hippocampal
inhibitory neurons, which are lost early in AD, can reduce the influence of, or gate, these inputs. However, we
do not understand how loss or dysfunction of inhibitory neurons in AD affects inputs to CA1 and how this
subsequently disrupts spatial representations and thus memory. This proposal will explore the dynamics of inputs
to CA1, as gated by inhibitory neurons, and its effects on spatial memory, as an avenue for AD treatment. My
central hypothesis is that loss of CA1 somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons ungates MEC inputs to CA1
during retrieval and consolidation, destabilizing spatial maps and impairing memory in AD. I will examine this
hypothesis using a chronic recoverable implant design I have developed which enables simultaneous recording
from dozens of neurons in CA1, CA3, and MEC. I will record neural activity while wild type and AD model mice
encode, consolidate, and retrieve memories in a spatial alternation task and spatial contexts. During these three
memory phases, I will measure: CA3 and MEC input drive to CA1 and its dynamics over learning (Aim 1), the
relationship between CA1, CA3, and MEC spatial maps (Aim 2), and the firing patterns of CA1 somatostatin-
expressing and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (Aim 3.1). I will then stimulate each inhibitory neuron
type in aged AD model mice during each of the three memory phases to rescue the deficits identified in Aims 1,
2, and 3.1 (Aim 3.2). This research will advance our understanding of how the hippocampus dynamically
encodes, retrieves, and consolidates information, how it goes awry in AD, and how it can be treated, advancing
Goal 1B of the National Plan to Address AD. My expertise in spatial memory, in vivo electrophysiology, and AD
makes me uniquely qualified to pursue this novel line of research at the intersection of basic and translational
neuroscience. These aims will be supported by an exceptional mentoring team of Drs. Lisa Giocomo, Tony
Wyss-Coray, and Scott Linderman, advisory team of Drs. John Huguenard, Ivan Soltesz, and Gareth Howell,
and training environment of Stanford University. This research will provide me with crucial training in neural data
statistics, mechanisms of neurodegeneration, evidenced-based inclusive mentorship, and lab management. This
project and the training it provides will open new lines of inquiry about the role of hippocampal inhibitory neurons
in healthy, aged, and AD conditions and facilitate my transition to an independent faculty position."

The influence of context on behavior is a major topic in contemporary learning theory and neuroscience and the
ability to transfer or generalize learning from one context to another is necessary for navigating the world. Deficits
in generalization, or inappropriate generalization, are hallmarks of many disorders, including autism, schizophre-
nia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The hippocampus (HPC) and downstream regions, such as the lateral
septum (LS), are important structures for learning, memory, and navigation. Damage to either region can disrupt
the way in which context influences behavior. However, little is known about how the HPC and related structures
encode tasks or information across varying contexts.
This proposal leverages cutting edge approaches from theoretical, computational, systems, and behavioral neu-
roscience, as well as learning theory, to address the involvement of the HPC in the representation of context and
the way in which context interacts with learning. This proposal addresses three major open questions: 1) how
HPC representations of discrete associated stimuli are affected by context manipulation, 2) how disruptions in
HPC activity during contextual change affects learning generalization, and 3) how representations of behavioral
responses are integrated with representations of context during REM sleep. To answer these questions, in Aim
1, I will use calcium imaging (CaImg) to investigate how neuronal firing in the HPC that occurs during a classically
conditioned response is altered by shifts in spatial context. I will supplement traditional analytic techniques by
analyzing population level cellular activity using low dimensional neuronal manifold analysis. In Aim 2, I will use
optogenetics to disrupt periods of high HPC activity (sharp wave ripples) to determine how these periods con-
tribute to task generalization. Finally, in Aim 3, I will use a combination of CaImg, electrophysiology, and opto-
genetic manipulations to test the hypothesis that, during REM, HPC-derived spatial information is combined with
movement information in the LS to inform task-relevant decisions across different contexts. These studies have
the potential to lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of how cellular and behavioral correlates of learning
are affected by and interact with context, and of the role of sharp wave ripples and REM sleep in influencing
these interactions.
My goal is to become the principal investigator of a research laboratory where I combine cutting-edge electro-
physiology, imaging, and optogenetic techniques to answer questions about the role of circuit dynamics at the
single cell and population level in tasks involving high level sensorimotor integration. The K99 period will include
training on additional advanced mathematical, behavioral, and optogenetic techniques and prepare me to be a
highly competitive candidate for tenure-track faculty positions."

San Diego State University’s Advancing Cancer Careers for ExceLlence (ACCEL) Program, in partnership with
University of California San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center, will provide 70 SDSU postdoctoral fellows
and graduate students each year with a coordinated and innovative array of resources to support excellence,
inclusion and transformation of the cancer research science force. ACCEL will leverage existing infrastructure
and develop new programming to a) expand and strengthen the pipeline of underrepresented (UR) scholars
pursuing cancer research; and b) broaden SDSU’s capacity to support and advance UR pre- and postdoctoral
cancer research scholars.
Three distinct and complimentary aims have been developed to meet these larger objectives. Led by a
Training Champion (TC) team with diverse areas of expertise, the ACCEL program will a) implement mentoring
activities and community-building engagement that reduce feelings of isolation and increase sense of
belonging to increase doctoral student and postdoctoral scholar participation and retention in cancer research;
b) provide structured support services including skills development courses for doctoral students and
postdoctoral scholars to broaden advancement in cancer research and promote diversity in the scientific
workforce; and c) build tailored and sustainable linkages for SDSU students and scholars to existing support
and resources through the National Cancer Institute and other partners.
While ACCEL program development and implementation will benefit greatly from strong integration with
existing partners and programs including the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, SDSU-UCSD CREATE
Cancer Partnership, and the NCI Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) training navigation,
ACCEL will also introduce innovative methodologies to address isolation and build community and belonging in
tandem with skills building."
10786461,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Our long-term goal is to define general principles that connect neuronal activity to unconstrained behaviors in
natural sensory environments. Achieving this goal will require the development of new tools to quantitatively
compare behavior across species in complex environments and to monitor neural activity in freely moving an-
imals. Here we propose to bring together a diverse, multi-disciplinary team of five labs with a track record of
productively measuring and modeling neural activity and behavior. We will use two parallel approaches to make
progress towards imaging neural activity from freely moving small genetic model organisms as they navigate
complex sensory environments. In Aim 1 we will develop behavioral apparatus that allows for experimenter
control of sensory stimuli (mechanosensory flow, odor, and visual stimuli) while monitoring unconstrained be-
havior at two resolutions. Low resolution measurements allow for quantification of stimulus-guided navigation,
while high resolution measurements allow for detailed quantification of body posture and limb kinematics, and
will eventually permit imaging of neural activity. In Aim 2, we will develop bioluminescence-based transgenic
animals and techniques for imaging neural activity in freely moving flies and fish. Optimization of these reagents
and protocols will allow for eventual simultaneous measurements of neural activity and behavior in larger and
more complex environments. This work draws on our collective expertise in quantitative behavior, biolumines-
cent indicators, real-time tracking of animal behavior at high resolution, and physical modeling of animal behav-
ior. This work will advance technologies for studying neural activity in unconstrained animals and establish a
collaborative team to pursue this work."

Cilia are surface-exposed organelles found on most eukaryotic cells, needed to sense and transduce varied
sensory stimuli. Not surprisingly, mutations in genes that disrupt cilia growth or function result in 'Ciliopathies'
that comprise a wide range of developmental syndromes and multi-system disorders. Cohesins represent a
second and independent pathway that is critical for development. Cohesins are required inside the nucleus for
high-fidelity chromosome segregation, gene transcription, and chromatin organization. Mutations in genes that
disrupt cohesin function result in ‘Cohesinopathies,’ which are also multi-syndrome and multi-system disorders.
Both ciliopathies and cohesinopathies are characterized by phenotypes including hearing loss, skeletal
abnormalities, and cardiac defects. Remarkably, prior and emerging research implicates cohesins in cilia
structure and/or function. For example, the cohesin protein Smc3 localizes to kinocilia in hair cells in the
zebrafish embryonic otic vesicle (OV) (i.e. kinocilia are specialized cilia specific to hair cells). Further, Smc3-
knockdown leads to otolith defects in the OV, and to reduced kinocilia length in the hair cells of the lateral line
(LL). These knockdown results are the first functional evidence connecting cohesins with cilia. Thus, the long-
term goal of this research is to provide mechanistic insights into how cohesins and cilia functionally interact.
The central hypothesis is that overlapping phenotypes in cohesinopathies and ciliopathies are the result of
unknown shared functions between cohesins and cilia. The overall goal of this proposal is to collect preliminary
data supporting the model that cohesin proteins contribute to cilia structure and function. The rationale for the
proposed research is that revealing such connections would lay the foundation for new insights and therapies
that will impact future clinical applications. The hypothesis will be tested using two specific aims: 1) determine
how cohesin contributes to cilia function, and 2) determine how cohesin associates with cilia. In the first aim,
null mutations in cohesin genes will be generated. Mutants will be monitored for established cilia phenotypes
and for defects in kinocilia length. In the second aim, an mCherry-Smc3 transgenic line will be generated to
monitor Smc3 localization in kinocilia. Additionally, proximity labeling will be completed to identify putative
binding partners in cilia. This approach is innovative because this research has the potential to fundamentally
alter our understanding of underlying causes of cohesinopathies and ciliopathies, which would in turn influence
the future development of therapeutic approaches. The proposed research is significant because connections
between cohesins and cilia are largely unknown, yet are fundamental to our understanding of disease
phenotypes that underly a broad group of developmental syndromes."

Project Summary Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ youth experience disproportionately high rates of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, and suicidality as well as related issues such as alcohol and drug initiation/use and dating and sexual violence. Our preliminary research also shows that Lakota LGBTQ2S+ youth and their adult caretakers perceived the Family Acceptance Project (FAP)—a family support approach that seeks to reduce family rejecting behaviors and increase family accepting behaviors in the context of the family’s cultural world—as highly acceptable and likely to be impactful in reducing mental health and related problems of Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ youth. To date, despite its promise for reducing mental health and related problems among LGBTQ2S+ youth, FAP has not been rigorously evaluated. The purpose of the proposed study is to culturally adapt and pilot evaluate FAP for Lakota youth (ages 13 to 18) and their families. We will specifically compare outcomes across three conditions: traditional FAP (T-FAP), Indigenized FAP (I-FAP), and a control condition. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts and Elders/Traditional Knowledge Keepers (TKKs), and the team will be comprised of ~10 Lakota LGBTQ2S+ youth on a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) and ~10 caregivers to Lakota LGBTQ2S+ youth on a Caregiver Advisory Board (CAB). Aim 1 (Adaptation) includes using an Indigenized ADAPT-ITT Model to refine the FAP into the Indigenized FAP (I- FAP) via ongoing feedback from the YAB and CAB and Topical Experts/TKKs (Aim 1a), theatre testing I-FAP (Aim 1b), and an open pilot trial of the I-FAP with 14 families (7 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and 7 in Rapid City) to further refine the I-FAP and evaluate the feasibility of research procedures and program implementation (Aim 1c). Aim 2 (Evaluation) will include via a pilot RCT of 60 families of Lakota LGBTQ2S+ youth and caregivers in Rapid City, SD (30 families [10 T-FAP; 10 I-FAP; 10 wait-list control]]) and on the nearby Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in SD 30 families [10 T-FAP; 10 I-FAP; 10 wait-list control]), assess the acceptability and feasibility of the I-FAP (Aim 2a) via program observations, post-session surveys (n=40 families in the treatment condition), and exit interviews (n=12 participants in the treatment condition [6 youth; 6 caregivers] or until data are saturated) with Lakota LGBTQ2S+ youth and their caregivers. We will test the hypotheses that I-FAP will lead to changes in targets, specifically increases in caregiver accepting behaviors, youth and caregiver connection to Lakota culture, family bonding, and youth future orientation and decreases in caregiver rejecting behaviors, caregiver harsh parenting, and youth internalized homo/bi/transphobia compared to the control condition (Aim 2b). We will also examine the hypotheses that there will be reductions in deleterious primary outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, suicidality; Aim 2c) and secondary outcomes (alcohol and drug use/initiation and dating and sexual violence victimization and perpetration; Aim 2d) among youth in the treatment conditions compared to the control condition."

SUMMARY
______________________________________________________________________
Community firearm violence (CFV), defined as fatal and non-fatal shootings that result from interpersonal
violence, disproportionately impacts people from structurally marginalized racial groups and occurs
predominantly in communities where racist policies have resulted in systemic disinvestment. News media play
a crucial role in shaping how the public and policy makers understand and respond to health threats, including
firearm violence. Media typically present CFV through episodic crime reports, focused on single shooting events
that depict violence as a “crime” issue, which can lead audiences to blame victims, reinforce racist stereotypes,
and undermine public health responses. Our preliminary study with firearm-injured people identified that episodic
crime narratives of their shootings felt dehumanizing to them and added to their trauma. Despite emerging
research indicating that harmful reporting on CFV is a threat to public health that may further marginalize
impacted people and communities, there is no consensus definition of harmful reporting on CFV, no instruments
to measure harmful reporting on CFV, and no existing research on racial and spatial disparities in harmful
reporting on CFV. These disparities are important to uncover, because if present, then modifying media
approaches to limit harmful reporting is a potential target for mitigating structural racism, minimizing disparities
in CFV incidence, and for CFV prevention. Past experience with suicide reporting indicates that when evidence-
based journalistic guidelines are implemented, they can reduce harmful reporting, prevent suicide, and have a
positive impact on public health. The proposed research will reduce existing gaps in scientific knowledge and
contribute evidence to inform development of journalistic guidelines for reporting on CFV through the following
specific aims: (1) Define harmful reporting on CFV. We will identify media approaches that are potentially harmful
using the Delphi technique to achieve consensus among stakeholders identified in collaboration with partners at
a community-based organization. (2) Develop and pilot a novel instrument to measure harmful reporting on CFV.
We will measure the frequency and severity of harmful reporting elements identified in Aim 1 through iterative
codebook development and content analysis of an existing dataset of Philadelphia television (TV) news coverage
of CFV. (3) Evaluate racial and spatial disparities in harmful reporting on CFV. We will examine associations
between shooting victim demographics, shooting location characteristics, and measures of harmful reporting.
We hypothesize that TV news reports of firearm-injured young Black men who are shot in census block groups
with more disadvantaged residents will contain more harmful elements than reports of other firearm-injured
people and places. Consistent with the strategic goals of the NIMHD, this study will be the first to define and
measure disparities in harmful reporting on CFV. We will establish the groundwork for a future R01 multi-city
study to examine direct associations between harmful reporting and the incidence of CFV and to develop and
test media approaches that minimize disparities in reporting and support public health responses to CFV."

The Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) is the sole comprehensive repository and distribution center for the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a premier model organism for biomedical research studies. The overall
objective of this animal resource is to promote research on C. elegans by acquiring, maintaining, and distributing
genetically characterized nematode stocks. Researchers in all 50 states and throughout the world use genetic
stocks obtained from the CGC in diverse basic and applied research endeavors, as well as for hands-on teaching
of experimental science. Studies using C. elegans have led to fundamental insights into basic biological
mechanisms, including the genetic basis of programmed cell death, the discovery of microRNAs, and the
mechanism of RNA interference in animals. The nematode has also provided key insights into the cell signaling
mechanisms, cancer progression, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, C. elegans serves as a key
model for illuminating our understanding of parasitic nematodes with relevance to human and livestock health.
As the only general stock center for C. elegans, the CGC is an extremely important international research
resource, supporting research in these diverse areas and in educational endeavors. The CGC provides about
30,000 strains per year to thousands of laboratories; with a collection of 23,000 unique strains, a number still
increasing in proportion to the growth of the field, the CGC not only facilitates research, but also ensures that
valuable strains are preserved. Strains are distributed upon request through an on-line ordering system with a
scheme of user fees in place to help defray costs and support CGC activities. The CGC closely monitors user
needs and devises small research projects to support the community. Because essentially every lab uses
fluorescent proteins, and there is demand for brighter, more photostable fluorescent proteins, in more colors to
allow multi-plexing, the CGC will develop a pipeline to quantitatively evaluate the in vivo properties of a new set
of fluorescent proteins in worm, enabling scientists to choose the optimal versions for their applications."
10791750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The intestinal epithelium relies on extensive cell-cell signaling to maintain a tight balance between absorptive
and secretory activity, but the intricacies of this signaling remain uncharacterized. We recently discovered that
cells infected with rotavirus, the most common cause of life-threatening diarrhea worldwide, release hundreds of
pulses of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) causing intercellular calcium waves that dysregulate uninfected cells.
Blocking the ADP receptor P2Y1 significantly reduces diarrhea severity in rotavirus-infected mice, suggesting
that this signaling is integral in regulating secretory activity. While the mechanism through which rotavirus triggers
the release of ADP has not been confirmed, our preliminary data show it relies on activation of the volume-
regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is increasingly recognized as a conduit for paracrine signals
associated with a variety of intracellular stressors, but it has yet to be studied within the epithelium. Further, the
mechanisms regulating its activation in any context remain poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this
proposal is to use rotavirus as a tool to study the role and activation of VRAC in the intestinal epithelium. Given
that rotavirus-induced intercellular calcium waves are inhibited by knock down of rotavirus non-structural protein
4 (NSP4), a Ca2+-conducting channel, my central hypothesis is that NSP4-induced elevations of cytosolic
Ca2+ activate host pathways that trigger ADP release through VRAC, amplifying secretory activity
throughout the epithelium. I will test this hypothesis by using long-term live calcium imaging in conjunction
with novel fluorescent Rho biosensors and CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing to [Aim 1] determine the
intracellular pathway mediating VRAC activation in RV-infected cells. Given ADP release is reduced upon
pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase or knockdown of the calcium-augmenting rotavirus protein NSP4, we
expect both calcium and Rho are involved in VRAC activation. Using both human intestinal enteroids and the
mouse model of rotavirus diarrhea, I will [Aim 2] determine the effect of VRAC activation on secretory activity in
the intestinal epithelium. This work will identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of secretory diarrhea,
a leading cause of mortality among children worldwide. Furthermore, our findings will address gaps in knowledge
surrounding VRAC activation and its role in paracrine signaling. Given that VRAC has been implicated in an
increasing variety of pathological processes, using this clinically relevant approach will yield information
translatable to both human health and other scientific disciplines."
10791832,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Codon usage is a specific feature of each gene and each genome and impacts the fitness of each organism. In
the degeneracy of the genetic code, proteins can be coded in multiple ways using different sets of synonymous
codons, which are not translated equally in speed or quality. Each codon choice between the synonyms makes
a demand for the supply of the tRNA with the matching anticodon. The quality of a codon-anticodon pairing
interaction is determined not only by the level of the tRNA for the codon, but also by the epigenetic
modifications to the tRNA that are synthesized post-transcriptionally. While most studies have focused on the
abundance of tRNA as a determinant of codon usage and cell fitness, less is known about post-transcriptional
modifications. In the past 5 years, my lab has focused on the N1-methylation of the guanine at position 37 that
synthesizes m1G37 in tRNAs, which is required for reading-frame maintenance during protein synthesis. Loss
of m1G37-tRNAs leads to accumulation of ribosomal +1-shifts, resulting in pre-mature termination of protein
synthesis and ultimately cell death. A key finding of our work is that, while m1G37 is required for translation of
all four codons for proline (Pro), it is essential for translation of CC[C/U] codons. Because Pro is a unique
amino acid in protein synthesis, this finding offers interesting and important new biology, in which m1G37-
tRNAs provide a global mechanism to control the expression of CC[C/U]-enriched genes. In the next frontier of
research, we will focus on the m1G37-dependent differential translation of CC[CU] as a model to elucidate the
principles by which the supply-to-demand ratio of tRNAs governs cell fitness. We will start by analysis of the
balanced growth of E. coli as a reporter for genome-wide protein synthesis. We will test the predictive power of
the elucidated principles in determining the human proteome. We will also address the role of m1G
methylation, when placed at position 9 of a pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA), in the development of
the mitochondrial disorder. By exploring the unique methodologies and conceptual frameworks that we have
developed, we will address these key gaps in the field and advance our understanding of codon usage in
human health and disease."
10791836,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
tremendous clinical heterogeneity. PD with dementia is considered one of the Alzheimer disease related
dementias. Dementia, afflicting up to 80% of PD patients and gait impairment cause significant morbidity and
mortality, and tremendously amplify the socioeconomic burden as effective treatments are lacking. Both these
impairments are refractory to dopaminergics suggesting involvement of other neurotransmitter systems or brain
regions beyond nigrostriatal pathways. Most neuroimaging studies have focused on striatal dopaminergic deficits
and fail to adequately explain gait and cognitive impairments in PD. The midbrain pedunculopontine nucleus
(PPN) sends cholinergic input to the cerebellar vermis, which has much greater cholinergic innervation in
humans than the cerebellar hemispheres. Degeneration of PPN, known to occur in PD could lead to cholinergic
denervation of vermis. Vermis modulates gait and cognition, but little is known about its role in PD. Recent
cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analysis demonstrates altered vermal FC with sensorimotor
and association cortices in PD and their respective gait and cognitive correlates. This proposed study utilizing a
multimodal approach will extend the prior work and investigate whether longitudinal changes in vermal FC reflect
decline in gait and cognition in PD and whether cholinergic denervation of the vermis, as measured by vesicular
cholinergic transporter activity (VAChT) PET imaging, underlie these deficits in FC and behavior. The long term
goal is to investigate whether vermal FC and cholinergic PET measures can serve as antecedent markers of
dementia and falls in PD. The proposed study serves three major objectives. The first objective is to investigate
cholinergic denervation of vermis and two important aspects of vermal FC in PD: its ability to objectively reflect
progression of gait and cognitive impairment and its ties to underlying cholinergic pathology as measured by
VAChT PET, the two key attributes of a reliable imaging biomarker. The second objective is to leverage the
highly conducive and supportive environment, access to wealth of cross-sectional and longitudinal multimodal
imaging data and comprehensive, sophisticated behavioral measures, and an excellent diverse team of mentors
to provide the candidate with training in a) PET analysis and b) conducting longitudinal studies with special
emphasis on multivariate, longitudinal statistics to ensure a timely transition to independence. The final objective
for the candidate is to continue to author manuscripts especially involving PET and generate preliminary data
towards a R01 application. Although with independent research aims, this study is privileged to use the data
collected as a part of large scale longitudinal study with established funding. The proposed study could have
substantial clinical impact by elucidating pathophysiologic bases of dementia and falls in PD, identifying potential
therapeutic targets and possible metrics of target engagement, stratifying at risk patients before these disabling
symptoms progress irreversibly, potentially leading to individually tailored therapeutic options in the future."

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a significant public health problem resulting in over 200,000 annual trips to
the Emergency Department (ED) in the United States with as many as 3.8 million SRCs occurring annually. From
a biomechanical standpoint, the concussion mechanism includes head impact resulting in high magnitude head
rotational accelerations. Human studies measuring the accelerations associated with concussive head impacts
developed injury risk curves that can be extremely useful from the clinical and safety perspectives. However,
recent literature has shown that acceleration magnitudes associated with concussive impacts are extremely
variable and not necessarily distinct from the routinely sustained head impact magnitudes. Mounting evidence
from human studies has demonstrated that repetitive head impact exposure (HIE) may contribute to decreased
SRC tolerance in contact sport athletes.
Studies focused on quantifying the relationship between the HIE and incident concussion have been
underpowered, as there were limited number of concussions occurring during the observation period. We will
utilize the data from the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium (CARE)
Head Impact Measurement Core, the largest and most comprehensive study of SRC and repetitive HIE to date,
and data from Project Head-to-Head 2 (PHTH2), a large-scale study of SRC and HIE in both collegiate and high
school athletes to: (1) determine the association of HIE to SRC occurrence and post-SRC recovery based on
the frequency, number, recency, and severity of head impacts sustained in football activities; and (2) build a
dynamic predictive algorithm of the SRC risk based on the HIE time series data obtained from the HIT System
and other factors, including demographics, concussion history, impact characteristics, and network measures."

Breast cancer affects many women in their lifetime. A major challenge remains how to reduce breast cancer risk
as well as to understand what causes breast cancer. Two-thirds of breast cancer diagnosed in patients belong
to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Many chemicals, with similar structure to estrogen, have been
suggested to mimic the biological functions of estrogen, potentially contributing to the initiation or progression of
breast cancer. Environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptor contaminants, such as bisphenols, phthalates and
zeranols, have been known to have estrogenic activity in cell culture and animal models. However, the impact
of endocrine disruptors on breast cancer development in humans remains unclear. We hypothesize that
endocrine disruptors, by increasing breast cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism, promote the
development of breast cancer. The objectives of this project are to determine impact of endocrine disruptors in
breast cancer development and to understand mechanisms of endocrine disruptors in alteration of cancer stem
cells and metabolome leading to accelerating ER-positive breast cancer. We propose two Specific Aims as
follows. In Aim 1, using the estrogen sensitive ACI strain, we will investigate the impact of endocrine disruptors
on the mammary gland proliferation in vivo. We will test three representative classes of common environmental
endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols for this Aim. In Aim 2, we will determine endocrine
disruptors-induced alteration of breast cancer stem cells and cell metabolism in the ER-positive breast cancer
model. MCF-7 mammosphere culture and MCF-7 xenografted tumor models will be utilized to investigate the
role of endocrine disruptors in enhancing cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
We will test three representative classes of endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols in vitro.
Selected endocrine disruptors will be further evaluated for in vivo tumor studies. Endocrine disruptors have long
been suggested for its potential role in promoting cancer development and progression. This project seeks to
understand the mechanism of endocrine disruptors in the mammary tumorigenesis by focusing on cancer stem
cells and metabolism shift. Environmental factors and lifestyle have led to significant changes in breast cancer
risks. Our study with endocrine disruptors could provide the valuable link between environmental exposures and
human health."

This joint application by biosynthetic chemist Bradley Moore (UCSD/SIO) and neuroscientist Jerold Chun (SBP)
is in response to the Notice of Special Interest: Promoting Mechanistic Research on Therapeutic and Other
Biological Properties of Minor Cannabinoids and Terpenes recently issued by NCCIH (NOT-AT-22-027). The
Moore and Chun laboratories have synergized their complimentary research efforts to address a mounting
national health concern and opportunity surrounding the legalization and increased use of cannabis by millions
of Americans both medicinally and recreationally. They aim to expand their new biocatalytic methods to construct
rare and minor cannabinoids and analogs and to evaluate their potential therapeutic benefits in murine and
human receptor assays and animal models. The successful development of new cannabinoid therapeutics
depends on comprehensive pharmacological data, especially for the >110 minor phytocannabinoids. Given the
paucity of functional information on them, the significance of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation and
control of many critical bodily functions, and the relevant crosstalk between cannabinoid (CB) and
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) systems, we hypothesize that
phytocannabinoids and/or their metabolic derivatives similarly modulate non-classical LPA receptors. Our
preliminary work indicates that CBC phosphate (CBCp) engages the receptor LPA1, thereby opening new vistas
for phytocannabinoid GPCR receptor biology, physiology and pathophysiology. We will test the hypothesis that
phytocannabinoids and/or their metabolites modulate non-classical LPA as well as classical CB receptors to
impact physiology and disease through two specific aims over the next five years.
Specific aim 1 will discover, characterize, and engineer biocatalysts for the construction of structurally diverse
minor cannabinoids and analogues. We will expand our preliminary results that bacterial enzymes can be used
to chemoenzymatically synthesize cannabinoid molecules. Biochemical, genetic, and engineering approaches
using diverse enzyme and substrate libraries will expand our ability to produce diverse cannabinoid molecules
for biological evaluation. Specific aim 2 will interrogate non-classical and classical cannabinoid receptor
interactions through the use of backscattering interferometry and cell-based receptor assays; and animal studies
using wildtype and receptor-knockout mice that will assess normal physiological effects and pathophysiological
effects previously linked to LPA signaling, including neuropathic pain (partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL)) and
multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)). These studies will reveal new insights
into the minor cannabinoids and their cross-talk to lysophopholipids, which have genuine therapeutic potential."
10791480,"Project title: Impact of mechanical stretch on the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin model of young and old mice
Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aging-associated disease. The main histological pattern of IPF is usual interstitial
pneumonia with advanced scarring and microscopic honeycombing, which are predominantly found in immediate subpleural
parenchyma of peripheral and lower lung, but relatively spared in the central and upper lobule. Our recently published study of
IPF lung show that the central lung tissues display massive deregulated gene expressions associated with IPF signaling pathway,
indicating that central region are also subjected to the injuries for IPF initiation. These findings raise a critical question for IPF
development: why only the peripheral and lower lobs undergo continuing progression to massive architecture abnormities and
scar formation, while the central and upper regions remain histologically stable upon activation of IPF signaling pathway.
Intriguingly, radiology report of healthy subject has shown that the degree of lung expansion (DLE) during inspiration and
expiration circle also demonstrates spatial imbalance, with much larger DLE in peripheral and lower lung than in central and
upper lung. The perpetual mechanical stretching associated with the DLE has been reported to exert profound influence in the
repair of lung epithelial cells and remodeling of cancer associated fibroblasts. We hypothesize that the diaphragmatic
breathing-associated mechanical tension may stimulate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in the lower lung
with preexisting injury. Accordingly, we propose a novel animal model to investigate the impact of unilateral diaphragmatic
paralysis (UDP) on PF progression after bleomycin induction, in order to unveil the hidden intrinsic mechanisms underpinning
PF progression.
Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells convert mechanical signals, such as physical forces or movements, into
biochemical signals that can affect cell behavior. This process is important for many cellular functions, including tissue
development and remodeling after injury. Our previous studies indicate thatThy-1 mediates mechanotransduction by interacting
with integrins to conciliate cellular responses to mechanical cues. Aging is associated with increased susceptibility of IPF. Thy-1
expression in the lung decreases with age. Loss of Thy-1 expression on lung cells led to increased fibrosis in response to lung
injury. Other studies have suggested that targeting Thy-1 may be a potential strategy for treating lung fibrosis. Therefore, we will
compare the impact of mechanical stretch on PF model in young and old mice.
IPF is a progressive disease, which can further reduce patient's life quality over time. Our proposal will lead to a novel PF model
that can better elucidate the spatial disparity of pathological progression in IPF patients. We will evaluate whether the reduced
mechanical stretch associated with the compromised diaphragm contraction can impede the abnormal tissue remodeling in
peripheral and lower lobs after initial injury. We will investigate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism. The candidate
genes in specific cell types can serve as potential targets to prevent the progression of lung fibrosis and clinical exacerbation.
This preclinical model will also render an innovative in vivo platform benefiting PF research community."
10791304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mortality rates for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are 15-40%, depending on the treatment.
Moreover, the quality of life for surviving patients remains severely reduced. Limb revascularization focused on
limb rescue is critical to saving lives and life quality. Cell therapy strategies currently under investigation inject a
variety of progenitor cells into ischemic tissue with varying levels of success. However, no one has examined
the ability of angiogenic tip-specific endothelial cells (ECs) to promote revascularization in an ischemic limb. We
hypothesize that angiogenic ECs that contain tip ECs will more robustly revascularize ischemic limbs compared
with nonangiogenic ECs. The proposed studies will use highly expandable pluripotent stem cells as the starting
cell source and derive tip and non-tip cell-containing ECs from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We
will then compare the ability of tip ECs versus non-tip ECs to rescue the muscle in a hind-limb ischemic mouse
model. For delivery, we employ spatially nanopatterned collagen biomaterial scaffolds to enhance cell survival
after transplantation into the ischemic limb. Lastly, we will incorporate placental growth factor (PIGF) mRNA
delivery from aligned nanopatterned collagen biomaterials to support the release of PlGF protein for maintaining
the angiogenic phenotype of tip ECs, and/or directing in vivo the differentiation of stalk-to-tip ECs. We expect
these studies to show that angiogenic tip-specific ECs, not only integrate into and support current vasculature in
the ischemic limb, but also initiate the growth of new blood vessels, faster re-establishment of tissue perfusion,
and reproducibly rescue the ischemic limb."

10801100,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the scope and key drivers of racial
and ethnic disparities in opioid management across the cancer care trajectory, and to use this understanding to
design a multi-level cancer pain equity intervention for future testing. Pain is a common and disabling symptom
of cancer, affecting half of patients on treatment, one third of survivors, and over two thirds of those with
advanced disease. Despite their risks, opioids remain a cornerstone of managing cancer pain. Cancer patients
of color receive less potent analgesics than White patients, and consequently experience more severe and
debilitating pain. Yet, there have been few population-based studies of opioid inequities among cancer
populations and much remains unknown about its magnitude and scope, the patients and communities most
affected, and the relative influence of physician, practice, health system, and neighborhood factors.
In preliminary work examining over 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries with poor prognosis cancers, we found that
Black and Hispanic patients received fewer and less potent opioids than White patients, and Black patients
were more likely to undergo urine drug screening near the end-of-life. Disparities disproportionately affected
Black men and those living in urban areas, underscoring the need to better understand the neighborhood
factors and subpopulations most impacted. Here we propose a comprehensive analysis of inequities in opioid
management among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and non-Hispanic White Medicare and Medicaid-insured patients
across the post-operative, active treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life phases of cancer care. By linking
administrative data to comprehensive information about physicians, practices, health systems, and
neighborhoods, we will examine racial variation across versus within these levels, elucidating key mechanisms
by which racism undermines equitable pain management. The project will be informed by an explicitly anti-
racism framework, led by a team with expertise in multilevel analyses of healthcare quality and equity, and
guided by longitudinal engagement of patient stakeholders belonging to communities of color.
After identifying the populations and settings at greatest risk, and the chief drivers of opioid inequities, we will
use a rigorous 4-phase research process to design a multi-level cancer pain equity intervention targeting the
most potent and mutable drivers, and the clinical settings with greatest need. This process will be grounded in
a multilevel model based upon the Racism as a Fundamental Cause of Inequalities in Health and guided by
qualitative feedback from cancer patients and caregivers of color, and from clinicians, staff and organizational
leaders from diverse cancer care systems. This proposal will yield a comprehensive understanding of the
scope and root causes of racial inequities in cancer pain management, and a trial-ready intervention that
addresses strategic sources of inequities at multiple levels. Our findings will also have clear implications for
policy makers, insurers, and health systems leaders committed to providing equitable care for cancer patients."
10801104,"Infantile nystagmus syndrome is an involuntary oscillatory movement of the eyes that begins in infancy and
persists throughout life. It is visually and socially debilitating. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly
understood, and no effective treatments exist. More than half of infantile nystagmus patients have an associated
retinal or optic nerve disorder. Nystagmus is thus thought to develop secondary to poor vision, suggesting that
proper development of the oculomotor system is dependent on visual input, particularly in the first two months
of life. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms in nystagmus
and identify potential new therapeutic targets. Extraocular muscles (EOMs) from patients with infantile
nystagmus display a number of abnormalities, including decreased innervation, small neuromuscular junctions,
and an increased proportion of slow myofibers. We have recently shown that these changes are also present
in a mouse model of nystagmus—albino mice—and that the first changes are present as early as P10, before
eye opening. The human samples also show central nucleation of muscle fibers and an increase in expression
of the immature form of acetylcholine receptor on the fast myofibers. These changes suggest that there is
continuous remodeling of the EOM innervation in nystagmus. Different EOM myofiber types are innervated by
different subtypes of oculomotor neurons (OMNs), which in turn receive different premotor inputs. The “fast”
and “slow” OMNs, which innervate fast and slow myofibers, respectively, have different roles in different types
of eye movements. EOMs, OMNs, and premotor inputs are all dependent on each other for survival. This leads
to the hypothesis that nystagmus results from improper development of the oculomotor circuitry. This proposal
aims to test this hypothesis in a mouse model of infantile nystagmus syndrome by (1) determining whether
OMN survival and subtype distribution are altered and how the developmental timing of any changes relate to
changes in EOM innervation and nystagmus onset and (2) determining whether the premotor synaptic inputs to
the OMNs develop abnormally in mice with nystagmus. Albino mice, which display spontaneous nystagmus,
will be assessed for changes in EOM innervation and myofiber subtypes and corresponding differences in
OMN survival and subtype distribution. Age of onset of nystagmus will be determined. Viral transsynaptic
tracing will delineate the first-order synaptic connections onto the ocular motor nuclei. In all experiments, albino
mice will be compared to wild-type littermates, obtained from heterozygous matings, to control for genetic
background. Multiple developmental timepoints will be assessed to determine the point in development when
changes associated with nystagmus occur; whether changes in the EOMs, OMNs, or premotor inputs occur
first; and which changes precede nystagmus onset. This research will provide fundamental knowledge into the
mechanisms of infantile nystagmus. Understanding where and when the abnormalities in infantile nystagmus
first arise is the first step in identifying potential therapeutic targets or preventative interventions."
10801359,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect, affecting ~1% of all newborns, with 1
in 4 children requiring cardiac surgery. Children who require surgery for CHD are at an increased risk for long-
term hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease, and mortality. An excess burden of
hypertension, CKD and death has also been reported in adults with CHD suggesting that pre-disease pathways
and incident kidney disease may begin in childhood and progress into adulthood. These elevated risks, along
with the dramatically improved survival of children after cardiac surgery, require urgent focus on long-term health
in the rapidly growing population of pediatric and adult patients with CHD. Improved phenotyping of the
relationship between CHD with hypertension and CKD is needed to better understand the epidemiology and risk
factors of these outcomes in CHD. The objective in this application is to recruit and retain children with CHD in
a cohort entitled the Congenital Heart disease In Children: Kidney-AssociateD Conditions with Epidemiologic
Endpoints (CHICKADEE) study. We propose enrolling 350 children 4-8 years after their first cardiac surgery for
CHD at 4 U.S. children’s hospitals. This cohort will be target enriched enrollment for hypoplastic left heart
syndrome (HLHS) and other single-ventricle cardiac lesions, as well as those with a history of severe cardiac
defects associated with the highest risk of kidney disease. In-person visits with ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring, kidney function assessment, and cardiac and kidney biomarker measurement will be conducted at
enrollment and then annually for at least 3 total visits. The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize ambulatory
hypertension, albuminuria, and CKD in children with CHD and compare to non-CHD forms of CKD using a well-
phenotyped and established external cohort of pediatric CKD. This aim will include the entire cohort, but
particularly focus on children with HLHS and their blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate trajectories. We
will also extract clinical genetic data and samples for future genetic analyses; 2) Identify perioperative factors
and clinical characteristics associated with increased risk of hypertension, albuminuria, and CKD. Retrospective
and prospective data collection will be combined to assess associations between the number of lifetime acute
kidney injury events, medication exposures, and specific echocardiographic features with increased risk of
hypertension and CKD; and, 3) Develop panels of urine and plasma glomerular, tubular, and inflammatory
biomarkers to quantify the impact of CHD on kidney health. This aim will yield a clinical panel for early detection
of kidney injury. A biorepository will be established as a resource for current and future investigations. These
studies are critical for identifying children at the highest risk for hypertension, albuminuria, and CKD. In the future,
the developed biomarker panel will be used for prompt diagnostic and therapeutic actions. The findings will also
be applied to create consensus guidelines for kidney follow-up after cardiac surgery and data to directly support
the development of novel interventions and improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for children with CHD."
10805415,"There is an urgent need to identify new and effective drugs for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a tumor
characterized by aggressive growth, early metastases, and a 5-year survival rate of less than 2%. While it is
initially chemosensitive, with 70% response rates to first-line therapy of cisplatin plus etoposide, most patients
relapse after initial therapy with drug-resistant tumors. Dozens of new drugs have been tested for activity in
SCLC over the decades, including more than 40 agents that have failed in phase III trials. None of the targeted
drugs used in non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors are effective in SCLC.
 An outstanding feature of SCLC is the near uniform bi-allelic genetic inactivation of RB1 and TP53.
However, since genetically inactivated RB1 and TP53 cannot be reactivated nor is it clinically feasible to
reintroduce them into SCLC cells, this defining genetic feature has not led to treatment strategies for SCLC. In
this grant, we will test the hypothesis that inhibiting a downstream target of Rb1 can re-establish the tumor
suppressor and pro-apoptotic actions that were lost when Rb1 was inactivated.
 In preliminary studies, we found that modulation of only one downstream target of Rb1, the E3 ubiquitin
ligase SCFSkp2/Cks1 (Skp2), can dramatically block the pro-tumorigenic consequences of the loss of Rb1, and
induce Rb1-Skp2 synthetic lethal apoptosis in SCLC. This is due to the role Rb1 and Skp2 play in the
regulation of p27 (CDKN1B), whereby the loss of Rb1 leads to the Skp2-mediated ubiquitination and
degradation of p27 and the subsequent loss of cell cycle regulation. Most critically, we have identified active,
small molecule Skp2 inhibitors to specifically target this vulnerability.
 The specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of the Cks1-Skp2 interaction in Rb1 and p53 deletion-
induced SCLC. If the role is found to be essential, we will have identified another target to inhibit Skp2-medited
p27 ubiquitination. Since some human SCLCs with p53 missense mutations may have gained new oncogenic
functions (GOF), in addition to the loss of classic p53 functions, we will determine if these p53 GOF mutations
affects the sensitivity to Skp2 inhibition. 2) To determine effects of Skp2 inactivation using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches. Four different small molecule Skp2 inhibitors, with distinct molecular targets, will
be used in several novel in vitro and in vivo models. Particular focus will be on SCLC liver metastasis, and on
comparisons between chemotherapy-naïve and chemo-resistant SCLC cells. 3) To determine the antitumor
effects of Skp2 inhibitors in a more clinically relevant mouse tumor model using a large panel of SCLC PDXs
(patient-derived xenografts). Comparisons will be made between PDXs derived from chemotherapy-naïve and
chemo-resistant SCLC tumors, including “isogenic” PDXs derived from serial specimens from the same patient
pre- and post-chemotherapy. When completed, research in this proposal will potentially benefit most SCLC
patients since bi-allelic inactivation of RB1 and TP53 is nearly uniform in SCLC."

 Abnormality of the brachial plexus (BP), i.e. brachial plexopathy, can result in profound functional,
psychological and economic consequences. Dedicated peripheral nerve MRI, or MR neurography (MRN), is an
important adjunct to the physical exam and electrodiagnostic testing to evaluate brachial plexopathies, and
influences clinically decision making, including surgical planning, and outcomes. MRN affords direct visualization
of individual nerves and their relationship to osseus and soft tissue structures but suffers from insufficient spatial
resolution (~1.0mm-isotropic) resulting from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is largely due to the inherently
concave anatomy of the neck-shoulder junction that precludes close proximity of conventional MRI coils to the
skin. The inherent, complex branching and intertwining anatomy of the BP requires higher spatial resolution
(~0.5 mm-isotropic) than possible with current radiofrequency (RF) coils. Current RF coils are either rigid or not
adequately flexible, and do not conform to the curvatures of the neck, shoulder and axillary regions.
 We will develop novel, non-toxic, robust liquid metal RF coil technology to enable the design of a
conformal and flexible neck-BP array. This design will ensure that coil elements conform to the body contour (to
maximize SNR) in their entirety and with the arm in different positions. The characteristics of bendability and
form-fitting stretchability are feasible with liquid metal technology, but this technology has not been previously
implemented commercially. This project proposes the design and construction of a dedicated RF coil array for
brachial plexus MRN, to enable higher spatial-resolution and 3D imaging, with unprecedented detail, in patients
with clinically suspected thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). We will systematically evaluate liquid metal coils
against standard coils for BP MRN. We hypothesize that the achievable spatial resolution will be ~0.5 mm
isotropic, greater than the ~1 mm isotropic currently achieved with commercial coils, and will therefore better
depict regional anatomy and pathology.
Impact: The proposed research will not only address TOS but will also facilitate evaluation of (1) other brachial
plexopathies and more peripheral neuropathies (of traumatic, inflammatory, iatrogenic etiologies, e.g.), and (2)
other complex/curved anatomies including the breast/chest wall region, perineal/groin region, and digits. This
technology would also facilitate dynamic imaging of the extremities to elucidate pathology such as
femoroacetabular impingement (hip), ligamentous laxity (multiple joints), and meniscal incompetence (knee), not
borne out with conventional, static MRI."
10805418,"Project Abstract
 Cell migration is a fundamental cellular process necessary for development and coopted in diseases like
cancer metastasis. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the signals that control migration and cancer invasion, so
that treatment strategies to reduce pathological migration and cancer metastasis can be improved. Fluctuations
in cell migration forces control leading edge protrusion-retraction cycles, but we do not know what controls the
force fluctuations. The overall objective here is to understand the signaling mechanisms that control and integrate
the fluctuating molecular forces of cell migration. Signaling pathways can act by directing spatially-localized and
coordinated fluctuations in actin, adhesion, and membrane tension paramters (instructive). Alternatively,
signaling pathways may instruct some processes and act without spatiotemporal precision (permissive) in others.
We will elucidate the cell migration control mechanisms by dissecting the temporal and spatial regulation of the
protein kinase ERK and its signaling outputs in untransformed and cancer cells. ERK acts on multiple steps in
the protrusion-retraction cycle. The disease-relevant cancer cells model a high-activity state, in which ERK
activity is upregulated due to onocogenic mutations. Our central hypothesis is that ERK instructs spatially-
localized synergistic fluctuations in actin assembly, adhesion lifetime, and membrane tension for edge motion
and cell migration. For the first aim, we will measure the temporal fluctuations in ERK activity during edge
protrusion and retraction using modified ERK biosensors. We will incorporate the experimentally-observed
activity fluctuations into a computational model and experimental tests to determine which patterns dictate
protrusion velocity and persistence. For the second aim, we will determine if spatiatially-organized ERK activity
controls edge motion. We will test membrane and adhesion-activated ERK for the ability to induce protrusion
experimentally and computationally. We will also test how the pattern of ERK retention in the membrane and
adhesion domains contributes to protrusion power and width. For the third aim, we will test if ERK is controls
membrane tension and adhesion lifetime for protrusion velocity. We will test signaling through Zyxin and Ezrin
to actin as possible mechanisms by which ERK controls these additional for molecular forces. The proposed
research is conceptually innovative because it tests the role of fluctuating ERK signals in the regulation of cell
migration. It is technically innovative in the development and use of new optogenetics tools and computational
models. The research is significant because it has the potential to reveal a new principle about how molecular
forces are integrated to bring about motion. It will also identify scaffolds and signals that control local ERK activity
fluctuations that could be adapted for new therapeutic strategies to control cell adhesion and migration."
10805419,"Amblyopia is a common disorder of visual system development, resulting in poor visual acuity in one eye.
Though there has been much research to understand the pathophysiology of the disorder, treating older
children and adults with amblyopia remains a challenge. Interestingly, there have been clinical reports
suggesting gains in the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye may be possible in adults following removal of the
normal eye due to injury or disease. Motivated by these clinical reports, our lab recently discovered that
temporarily silencing the retina of the normal eye via intravitreal injection of the sodium channel blocker
tetrodotoxin (TTX) is effective at promoting a recovery in visual acuity in both cat and mouse models of
amblyopia. Amazingly, this treatment is effective in older, more treatment resistant animals and does not cause
any penalty to the injected eye. By elucidating the mechanism by which retinal inactivation is promoting
recovery from a period of amblyopic rearing in animal models, we have the potential to determine how to best
exploit this mechanism for the treatment of human amblyopia. It was initially hypothesized that silencing the
retina via TTX injection would result in reduced activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN),
because the dLGN relays activity from retina to cortex. Surprisingly, this turned out to be incorrect; in actuality,
neurons in the dLGN exhibit more spontaneous bursting activity following retinal inactivation. The proposed
project will focus on investigating the hypothesis that this increase in dLGN burst mode firing is the mechanism
by which retinal inactivation drives recovery from amblyopic rearing. To investigate this hypothesis, we will first
describe dLGN activity following retinal inactivation via TTX with the use of chronic unit recordings. dLGN
bursting will then be pharmacologically blocked to determine whether dLGN bursting is necessary for TTX
mediated recovery from amblyopic rearing. Finally, dLGN burst-like activity will be imposed via optogenetic
manipulation in order to determine whether bursting is sufficient to drive recovery from a period of amblyopic
rearing. By enhancing our understanding of the role of dLGN activity in retinal inactivation induced recovery
from amblyopic rearing, this project has the potential to inform our future research and suggest novel clinical
approaches for treating amblyopia. This project will be carried out in the lab of Dr. Mark Bear in the Brain and
Cognitive Sciences Department (BCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The Bear lab
contains all required equipment for the proposed project. All necessary training regarding required laboratory
techniques will be provided by senior lab members or through collaboration with other labs in BCS. The Bear
lab, BCS, and MIT will offer quality scientific and professional development resources to facilitate a successful
transition into the next stage of the applicant’s research career."
10806172,"ABSTRACT: The one-carbon metabolism pathway is strongly implicated in the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The incidence of HCC has
increased in the US, and about a third of all HCC cases diagnosed in the US do not have a history of viral
hepatitis or alcohol abuse, but these cases of HCC often have clinical or biochemical features of NAFLD.
Indeed, NAFLD-related HCC cases are expected to increase further in the US. Functionally, the one-carbon
metabolism pathway regulates DNA methylation through metabolism of one-carbon nutrients, such as choline,
methionine and folate, to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the universal methyl donor used for DNA
methylation; the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Following the transfer of methyl groups from SAM for
methylation, SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a potent inhibitor of the activities of
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and thus suppresses DNA methylation. Hence, while SAM promotes
methylation, SAH inhibits methylation, and the SAM/SAH ratio reflects a “hepatic methylation index” because
both SAM and SAH are formed primarily in the liver. Additionally, recent data show that 5mC is not a static
DNA mark, it is converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by TET enzymes. 5hmC is now recognized as a
unique epigenetic modification to DNA that is distinct from 5mC. However, both 5mC and 5hmC are involved in
gene regulation and both have been implicated in the progression of established HCC, but it is unclear which
of these DNA marks is most relevant to HCC development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
individual differences in hepatic methylation index or epigenetic modifications to DNA influence susceptibility to
HCC in isolation or in concert with genetic variants in one-carbon, DNMT or TET genes. The Specific Aims are:
(1) to identify common and rare genetic risk variants in the one-carbon metabolism pathway associated with
HCC risk. (2) To assess the association between hepatic methylation index (SAM/SAH ratio) and HCC risk,
and identify one-carbon gene modifiers of the association. (3) To assess the association between epigenetic
modifications to DNA (5mC and 5hmC) and HCC risk, and evaluate interaction by one-carbon, DNMT, and
TET genes. Findings from this research are expected to yield novel insights into the one-carbon metabolism
pathway as a previously under-recognized, potentially modifiable contributor to HCC and improve strategies for
the prevention, risk stratification, and early detection of HCC. The activities outlined in this application are
designed to extend the applicant’s expertise in genetic and molecular epidemiology, and acquire new skills in
epigenetics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics. Members of the mentoring team have complementary expertise
that spans these disciplines. Overall, the cross-disciplinary, integrative molecular epidemiologic approach of
this proposal and the career development activities that include formal coursework and “hands-on” workshops
will enable the applicant to acquire the needed competencies to foster his transition to independence."
10804347,"Elevated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) mediates the increased risk for hypertension and heart failure
in obesity. Yet the mechanisms that contribute to obesity-induced increases in SNA remain unclear. Our lab has
previously demonstrated a critical role for oxidative stress in the RVLM, a key brainstem region that regulates
sympathetic outflow, in obesity-induced sympathetic overactivity. Although RVLM neurons responsible for
sympathetic control of cardiovascular activities have been studied extensively, little or no attention has been paid
to their non-neuronal neighbours, astrocytes and microglia. Exciting preliminary studies from our lab suggest
that astrocytes and microglia in the RVLM display distinct phenotypical changes in response to chronic oxidative
stress in obesity. We provide novel evidence that microglia in the RVLM are most vulnerable to undergo
senescence, a stress response that significantly alters cellular phenotypes and potentially contributes to
inflammation through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). On the other hand, obesity impairs
astrocytic glutamate reuptake transporter activity (EAAT2) and enhances extrasynaptic glutamate excitatory tone
in the RVLM. In addition to these cell-autonomous mechanisms, our exciting preliminary studies indicate that
soluble factors secreted from senescent microglia negatively regulate astrocytic EAAT2 expression, indicating
potential crosstalk between senescent microglia and astrocytes in the RVLM as another likely mechanism for
obesity-induced sympathoexcitation and hypertension. Guided by strong preliminary data and published studies,
we will test the following hypothesis that obesity causes glial dysfunction in the RVLM marked by microglial
senescence and impaired astrocytic glutamate reuptake transporter activity. The resulting neuroinflammation
and increased glutamate excitatory tone in the RVLM contribute to increases in blood pressure and SNA in
obesity. In aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic role of senescent microglial cells and their secretory
phenotype on SNS overactivity and hypertension in obesity. In aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which
astrocytic dysfunction in the RVLM contributes to sympathoexcitation and hypertension in obesity. In aim 3, we
will determine the role of microglia-astrocyte interaction in obesity-induced sympathoexcitation. We will use an
array of novel transgenic mice models (targeted senescence induction and elimination), cell-type-specific gene
delivery techniques, state-of-the-art radiotelemetry for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters in
conscious mice, cutting-edge proteomics, lipidomics and single-cell sequencing approaches to accomplish the
proposed aims. Overall, our studies will shed light on the often-overlooked glial mechanisms and offer new
therapeutic targets (senolytics and EAAT2 activators) for the prevention or treatment of hypertension in obese
individuals"
10804350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Insomnia is prevalent among middle and older age adults, with detrimental effects on daytime function as well
as adverse health outcomes, including increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). Yet,
the mechanisms underlying the relationship between insomnia and cognitive function are not well understood.
The autonomic nervous system (ANS), and more specifically noradrenergic (NA) activity, plays an important
role in the regulation of sleep, wake, and cognitive function. It is biologically plausible that age-related decline
in NA activity contributes to poor sleep-wake quality and risk for cognitive impairment in older adults with
insomnia. Therefore, an improved understanding of the relationship between the NA system, sleep and
cognition has the potential to provide novel insights into the mechanism linking insomnia with cognitive function.
Based on the published evidence and data of older adults with insomnia from our own laboratory, we
hypothesize that in insomnia patients, reduced 24-h NA activity (particularly during the wake period) will be
associated with reduced subjective and objective measures of sleep quality (i.e. electroencephalographic slow
oscillatory activity: 0.5-1Hz and duration of wake after sleep onset). In addition, we hypothesize that lower 24-
h NA activity and objective sleep quality in older adults with insomnia will be associated with poorer cognitive
function. In this project, we propose a systematic characterization of both central and peripheral measures of
the NA system and their relationship with sleep quality and cognitive function in older adults with insomnia and
good sleeper controls. Measures of NA activity include 24-h plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) and of 3-
methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the main NE metabolite in the brain, and levels of NE and MHPG in
response to clonidine suppression test (a presynaptic α2 adrenoreceptor agonist that reduces central NA
system activity). To further elucidate the mechanistic dynamics between NA system activity with sleep quality
and cognition in insomnia, we will use daytime bright light (BL) exposure as a probe to potentially increase NA
activity during wake and improve nocturnal sleep quality and daytime performance. Participants with insomnia
will be instructed on healthy sleep habits and randomized to either a 4-week bright light (BL) or dim red-light
(RL, control condition) intervention. Measures of ANS, sleep and cognitive function will be assessed during a
three-day in laboratory visit for both the insomnia and good sleeper control groups, a similar assessment will
be repeated after completion of the 4-week intervention in participants with insomnia. The findings from this
study will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of ANS dysregulation in the pathophysiology of insomnia
in older adults and will create the basis for the identification of novel biological targets and approaches to
enhance sleep and cognitive function in older adults with insomnia who are at higher risk for medical and
neuropsychological comorbidities and ADRD."
10802637,"SUMMARY: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a highly prevalent disease that inflicts a severe quality-of-
life (QOL) impairment. QOL-measures have ranked CRS among severe ailments such as congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal disease. Its high prevalence, chronic
duration, and extensive antibiotic use, result in a large personal and societal burden that places it among
the top ten most costly medical conditions. Although often considered an infectious disease, many now view
CRS as a chronic inflammatory disorder where host-microbial interactions play a role. Current data
suggest that microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) exist in CRS, and that loss of protective organisms with
acquisition of pathogens may contribute to the refractory nature of the disease.
 Our long-term goal is to determine the functional role(s) of the sinus microbiome in health and disease,
and to translate these novel insights into the CRS management algorithm with new therapeutic
objectives and targets for intervention. Our central hypothesis is that dysbiosis in CRS promotes
chronic mucosal inflammation and compromises response to therapy. This hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of publications and preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and
clinical practice, and will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the functional capacity of
microbiome alterations observed in CRS using an integrative multi-`omics approach; 2) Determine the
relationship between microbiome alterations and CRS disease severity and therapeutic outcomes in a
longitudinal multi-institutional human intervention study; 3) Determine how CRS-associated microbes alter
sinonasal mucosal core functions to drive disease chronicity, through in vitro experimentation.
 We will use innovative technologic and analytic approaches to examine sinus biospecimens and
health outcomes, seeking to transform current clinical and research understanding of the role of microbes
in CRS. This study moves beyond prior small, cross-sectional, observational human CRS microbiome
association studies by defining molecular, cellular, and immunological processes using a multi-`omics
approach. Our study is unique in its examination of both control and CRS subjects, longitudinal sampling from
an intervention study, well-defined clinical outcomes, and delineation of mechanisms of host-microbial
crosstalk in the airway. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance
understanding of how the microbiome, including specific microbial species, impacts mucosal immunity and
barrier function in CRS. Ultimately, such knowledge will change the current treatment paradigm in CRS,
decrease antibiotic overuse, and direct development of new therapeutic goals and treatment strategies for
CRS patients."
10803749,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) have become widespread
in recent years, posing a serious threat to the treatment of common bacterial infections. Increased use of ""last
resort"" carbapenem antibiotics to treat ESBL-PE infections has fueled the emergence of carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacterales. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based prediction of antibiotic resistance phenotypes may
enable early initiation of appropriate treatment options for ESBL-PE infections, including selection of
carbapenem-sparing beta-lactam regimens. However, existing genomic prediction models have had relatively
poor accuracy for predicting resistance to beta-lactams in ESBL-PE. The genetic environment of ESBL genes,
including their location in the bacterial genome and association with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), is
unaccounted for in these models. These structural factors may contribute to beta-lactam resistance by providing
promotors modulating the expression of ESBL genes and enabling their duplication and mobilization within and
between Gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesize that including MGEs in genomic prediction models will
improve detection of beta-lactam resistance phenotypes in ESBL-PE. The objectives of this proposal are to 1)
determine how MGEs modulate beta-lactam minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in ESBL-PE and 2)
develop and optimize multivariate regression models for predicting beta-lactam resistance from WGS data in
ESBL-PE. Our multidisciplinary research team has the necessary expertise in bacterial genomics, molecular
biology, infectious diseases epidemiology, and biostatistics to ensure successful completion of the proposed
studies. To characterize the genetic environment of ESBL genes, we will take advantage of the ability of
nanopore WGS to resolve structurally complex genomic regions including MGEs and plasmids. We will test our
hypothesis through the following three aims: 1) we will comprehensively genotype and phenotype a large
collection of clinical ESBL-PE isolates (n=450) to test the association between specific MGE genotypes and
beta-lactam MICs; 2) we will evaluate potential mechanisms whereby MGEs may affect beta-lactam resistance
phenotypes, focusing on the role that MGE-associated promotors play in modulating ESBL gene expression and
the impact of ESBL gene copy number on beta-lactam MICs; 3) we will use machine learning to build and
optimize multivariate regression models incorporating MGE genotypes and other genetic factors to predict beta-
lactam resistance phenotypes and validate our resulting models in a prospective collection of 200 ESBL-PE
isolated from urine cultures. The development of rapid diagnostic methods that predict antibiotic treatment
options to ESBL-PE should be a research priority. In addition to determining how MGEs contribute to ESBL-PE
resistance phenotypes, the proposed research will help enable integration of nanopore WGS into surveillance
and diagnostic approaches to detect beta-lactam resistance in ESBL-PE and facilitate the selection of
appropriate carbapenem-sparing regimens for ESBL-PE infections using genomic prediction models."
10803245,"in vivo MR characterization of pathological changes in liver microstructures
Summary
Liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosing and evaluating the extent of most liver diseases, but it
is an invasive procedure that carries risks such as sampling errors, rare complications, intra/inter-observer
variability, and significant patient anxiety. Noninvasive tests and imaging techniques for the diagnosis and
management of liver diseases have gained significant interest due to the limitations of liver biopsy, particularly
for identifying nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most severe form of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). Due to the obesity pandemic and type 2 diabetes, an increased number of NASH patients (~ 27
million NASH patients by 2030 in the US alone) is expected in the near future. The ability to differentiate NASH
from simple steatosis is critically important for the clinical management of NAFLD patients. Currently, NASH is
exclusively diagnosed invasively through liver biopsy to assess steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis.
While MRI-based PDFF and elastography have been shown to reliably quantify steatosis and fibrosis,
respectively, the lack of a non-invasive tool to assess inflammation in NASH remains a significant gap in the
daily clinical care of this common disease.
Our lab has developed a novel concept that cell size and cell density could serve as indicators of hepatic
inflammation and has developed a multi-compartment diffusion MRI-based method called in vivo quantitative
Temporal Diffusion Spectroscopy (qTDS), which quantifies cell size and cell density by fitting multi-b value-
multi-diffusion time fat-suppressed diffusion-weighted MRI signals to a three-compartment (blood, intra and
extracellular water) signal model. Recently, qTDS has shown promising results in in vivo NASH patients and
ex vivo human liver specimens with different pathologies, including normal liver tissues, cirrhosis, steatosis,
and cirrhotic regenerative nodules (CRN).
This grant proposal aims to establish the relationship between qTDS-derived parameters and histology values
in a mouse model of NASH, optimize a clinical qTDS protocol for reliable in vivo quantification of cell size and
cell density in human livers within a short period (less than 12 minutes), and demonstrate the efficacy of qTDS
in characterizing hepatic inflammation, a key diagnostic component for differentiating NASH from simple
steatosis. Successful completion of these aims will provide a solid foundation for a large-scale clinical trial to
develop a noninvasive diagnostic metric for NASH, offer a standard qTDS imaging protocol that can be
implemented on clinical 3T MR scanners, and provide a qTDS data processing toolbox that can be
downloaded online. These outcomes will advance the use of noninvasive microstructure imaging in the
diagnosis and management of liver diseases."
10803316,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) are devastating diseases with no cure resulting in loss
of ambulation, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and premature death. Dystrophin associated
cardiomyopathy (defined here as CM) is the leading cause of death in DMD/BMD, and an under-studied
concern in DMD and BMD mutation carriers (MDC). CM progression is variable and poorly described in the
current era. There are no blood or imaging biomarkers that can predict the pace of progression or the risk of
early mortality. More importantly, there are no established cardiac outcome measures. Novel, targeted
therapeutics are necessary to treat CM, but these significant knowledge gaps make clinical trials challenging. A
better understanding of DMD/BMD/MDC cardiovascular disease progression and the identification of surrogate
outcome measures are critical for the field to advance. To address these obstacles, we propose to leverage
the Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiac care consortium (DMDCCC). Created with grants from the NHLBI
and the FDA, this consortium consists of eight high-volume sites with similar DMD/BMD/MDC cardiovascular
treatment and diagnostic protocols, including surveillance CMR imaging every 1-2 years. This proposal will
create a comprehensive prospective registry of DMD/BMD/MDC patients with meticulously collected clinical
data and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images; we anticipate enrollment of 950 patients with over 4000
CMR studies. This cohort will be used to better define the progression of CM and to determine associations
with mortality. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that integrated statistical modeling based on advanced
imaging can improve prediction of CM progression and mortality. Aim 1 will create a comprehensive cohort of
DMD/BMD/MDC patients and model the progression of CM. Aim 2 will determine cardiovascular measures that
are associated with CM mortality or rapid progression using novel, data-driven, personalized machine learning
models. Aim 3 will create a portal for DMD/BMD/MDC centers to determine patient risk. This multi-PI proposal
leverages expertise in clinical care, cardiac imaging, biomedical engineering, complex image analysis, and
neural networks. To our knowledge, this study will create the largest cohort of DMD/BMD/MDC patients with
CMR images, allowing for a better understanding of CM progression and identifying biomarkers that associate
with poor outcomes. The resulting risk portal will provide clinicians all over the world with a method to assess
their patient’s risk in real time, allowing intensification of therapy for those deemed high risk. By building on
prior productive collaborations, particularly that of the DMDCCC, this proposal will expand our understanding of
CM, improving clinical care and future cardiac-specific therapeutic trials."
10803320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of mortality in the world. Genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with CVD. However, most
variants do not necessarily cause the observed phenotypes, but rather are in linkage disequilibrium with the truly
causal variants that influence disease pathophysiology via largely unknown molecular and cellular mechanisms.
Thus, three central challenges for CVD GWAS are: 1) Identifying causal variants, 2) Understanding which cell
types are most relevant for specific variants, and 3) Identifying the cis- and trans-regulatory target genes whose
expression is modulated by CVD variants. Currently, there is no consensus on how best to identify relevant cell
types and target genes. Furthermore, efforts to connect specific noncoding variants to target genes, such as
CRISPR-based insertion of specific variants coupled with phenotypic assays have been hampered by low
throughput. Here, we seek to develop scalable methods to address all three central challenges for CVD disease
GWAS, while leveraging the considerable benefits of population-scale, multi-ancestry GWAS — namely,
improved discovery of novel GWAS loci and increased resolution for causal variants at already known loci. Of
the many cell types and organ systems underlying CVD pathophysiology, we will focus on blood-related
mechanisms, which are currently understudied despite the importance of e.g., immune response and coagulation
in CVD, demonstrated by prior work and our preliminary data. In Aim 1, we will perform colocalization of CVD
and blood cell trait GWASes (as blood cells traits are naturally cell-type-specific) and produce a reference atlas
of 3D enhancer maps for 13 blood cell types and 2 endothelial cell types in donors of diverse ancestries. In Aim
2, we will combine CRISPR screens and single-cell multiomics (STING-seq) in blood and endothelial cells to
identify causal variants and target genes for CVD. We will further extend it by developing BeeSTING-seq, which
combines cytosine and adenine base editors with a more flexible CRISPR enzyme to insert precise SNPs. For
both STING methods, we will use a thoroughly-validated computational approach to identify cis and trans target
genes and regulatory networks. Further, we will deeply validate top variants using key functional assays
(electrical impedance, migration and stress response). This proposal takes an interdisciplinary approach with a
team of experts in noncoding biology and high-throughput single-cell CRISPR screens (Sanjana), in genetics
and systems biology (Lappalainen) and in CVD GWAS, cardiology and endothelial cell function (Gupta). Our
integrated experimental and computational approach will not only reveal how genomic variation shapes CVD
risk, but also develop a generalizable toolkit that leverages cutting-edge 3D genome mapping, gene editing and
single-cell profiling to map gene regulatory elements, specific variants and target genes to inform future CVD
therapeutics."
10802755,"ABSTRACT
The cellular basis of the central nervous system (CNS) consists of neurons and glial cells. Although
glial cells massively outnumber neurons in the CNS across species, only neurons are specially
endowed with the ability to communicate precisely and rapidly with other cells at distant sites in the
body. Unfortunately, unlike glial cells, the adult spinal cord is incapable of generating new neurons. In
addition, the axons also fail to regenerate after the damage, even their neuron somas are survived.
Thus, after the adult spinal cord injury (SCI), the irreversible loss of neurons and disruption of axons
lead a permanent functional deficit. The intrinsic reduced regenerative capacity of adult neurons and
the extrinsic inhibitory glial scar formation cause the regeneration failure after spinal cord injury. An
ideal spinal repair strategy should 1) replenish neurons for circuit reconstruction, 2) modulate the
inhibitory glial scar, to allow resident neural regeneration, and 3) establish new functional neural circuits
for electrical and chemical signal conduction. Our recent study has confirmed that the spinal cord fails
to generate new mature neurons after injury. The critical stem cell factor SOX2 was discovered to be
the key modulator of endogenous reprogramming. We demonstrated that our SOX2-mediated
reprogramming strategy successfully converted the NG2 glia into a great number of new neurons in the
lesioned spinal cord, and simultaneously reduced the astrocytic glial scar. Furthermore, the converted
neurons were able to make synaptic connections to the resident neurons in various areas of the CNS,
indicating the integration of the converted neurons into the h(1, 2)post neural circuits. Importantly, it
also promoted forelimb functional recovery. Surprisingly, our pilot study demonstrated a robust
corticospinal axonal regeneration after SCI. Together, we hypothesized that our reprogramming
strategy significantly modulates the inhibitory glial scar and activates pro-regenerative factors,
allowing for axonal regeneration, which will restore the signal transduction in the injured spinal
cord. We aim to characterize the alteration of the glial scar and pyramidal neurons during the
reprogramming process and relate it to axonal outgrowth and circuitry establishment. The
finding from this proposal is expected to sharpen our understanding of the reprogramming-mediated
axonal regeneration and neural circuits reorganization for the development of an optimized
reprogramming strategy to treat SCI."
10801910,"The neural crest is a versatile cell population that holds great promise for the purposes of regenerative
medicine due to its ability to form a multitude of diverse progeny ranging from the peripheral nervous system to
the craniofacial skeleton and portions of the heart. The “cardiac neural crest” arises from the dorsal hindbrain
and has the unique potential to form ectomesenchymal derivatives of the heart like the outflow tract septum
and a subpopulation of ventricular cardiomyocytes Our preliminary data have uncovered a cardiac crest
specific gene regulatory circuit that can reprogram other neural crest populations to cardiac crest fates and
have revealed a requirement for cardiac crest-derived cells in adult heart regeneration in zebrafish. Here, we
propose to elucidate the role of cardiac-specific subcircuit genes and their targets in acquisition of
particular cell fates in the embryonic heart. To extend this to adult stages, we will examine gene
regulatory changes that accompany loss of regenerative in mammals and examine the possible role of
TGFβ and downstream genes in cardiac neural crest-derived cells therein. As the cardiac crest is a
critically important embryonic cell population for normal formation and function of the heart, these studies hold
the promise of uncovering novel potential target genes involved in cardiovascular birth defects and repair.
Aim 1: Effects of “reprogramming” trunk neural crest identity to a cardiac crest fate. We will use single
cell RNA-seq and single cell (sc) ATAC-seq to characterize transcriptional and epigenetic changes that occur
in reprogrammed embryonic trunk crest cells over time and trace the fates of reprogrammed cells compared to
endogenous cardiac neural crest cells.
Aim 2: Role of Tgif1 and co-expressed putative downstream genes in outflow tract development. By
coupling loss of function analysis with single cell RNA-seq, we will examine gene expression differences after
depletion of Tgif1 as well as other co-expressed genes, including Twist1, FoxC2, and FoxP1. We will test their
order of expression and whether they are downstream effectors of Tgif1 by testing the regulatory relationships
between these genes. Finally, we will examine the long term effects of their loss of function on development of
the cardiovascular system to identify key genes involved in cardiac neural crest fate acquisition.
Aim 3: Exploring the role of cardiac neural crest-derived cells in mammalian heart regeneration.
Newborn mice can regenerate their hearts after damage from post-natal (P) days 1 – 7. Our preliminary RNA-
seq data suggest that there are profound gene regulatory changes that occur in cardiac neural crest derived
cells between P1 and P7/8, including an upregulation of genes associated with the TGFβ pathway. Using
scRNA-seq coupled with scATAC-seq, we will prepare a careful time course of changes in postnatal cardiac
neural crest-derived heart cells under control and cryo-damage conditions and test whether genetic ablation of
the neural crest blocks regenerative ability and if inhibition of the TGFβ pathway promotes heart regeneration."
10803337,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Histology is the current standard for diagnosis and predicting long-term disease outcomes in lupus nephritis
(LN). However, diagnosis and prognosis are challenging due to significant inter-pathologist variance and multiple
pitfalls in histopathology. We propose combining conventional histology with independent information from two
complementary optical imaging modalities that provide additional morphological, biochemical and molecular
context to LN, thus overcoming current diagnostic challenges. We will utilize milling with ultraviolet surface
excitation (MUSE) to provide protein-specific histology and mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging (MIRSI) for label-
free biochemical identification of small molecules and metabolites. Acquiring co-registered imaging data with
high speed and good resolution from these imaging modalities is challenging, and we propose a new
experimental platform for comprehensive biopsy imaging that addresses this challenge. We will identify new
structural and molecular features across these modalities that are decisive for LN diagnosis. A deep learning
architecture will be used to combine information from across all modalities, optimize feature selection and
quantification. We present extensive preliminary data from kidneys of wildtype and LN murine models
demonstrating the efficacy of our techniques. We will validate the efficacy of LN diagnostic metrics from murine
models using archival human kidney biopsy samples. We also present data from human subjects with Class II
LN (non-proliferative), Class IV LN (proliferative) and minimal change disease (control) and demonstrate
statistically significant metrics derived from our imaging modalities that enable improved LN diagnosis."
10803783,"Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in the US. The advent of new treatments such as immunotherapy and
targeted therapies have revolutionized the fight against cancer, and when combined with surgery, often result in
significant positive therapeutic responses. Unfortunately, some tumor cells gain the ability to resist drug- and
immune- therapies, which is often linked to their ability to metastasize. Indeed, metastasis ultimately underlies
the majority of patient mortality by cancer. A major unmet need in oncology is the prediction and prevention of
metastatic progression. Thus, understanding how tumor cells acquire metastatic potential and develop drug
resistance is critical to identifying novel therapeutic options and improving patient outcomes. It is of critical
importance to define the signaling mechanisms that contribute to altered growth, metabolism, motility and
survival associated with metastasis. Our long-standing goal is to uncover the molecular consequences of
Ras/ERK-MAP kinase signaling using biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches in vitro and in vivo.
We have provided the foundational studies revealing how subtle differences in ERK signal strength, location and
duration are critical determinants of cellular outcomes. More recently, we demonstrated that different ERK
isoforms promote different cell fates. Specifically, we found that different docking domains within ERK2, the CD
domain and the DEF binding pocket (DBP), regulate different cellular outcomes, with ERK2 playing a major role
in promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through DBP signaling. Additionally, this EMT-like
phenotype was associated with increased motility, survival and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Understanding
these mechanisms are part of the long-term goal of our basic research efforts to discover new potential targets
and identify new biomarkers, and to help resolve this currently unmet clinical need of targeting the metastatic
process. Thus, this grant application proposes to mechanistically investigate underexplored areas associated
with EMT and metastatic progression, taking advantage of discoveries made during the previous 30+ years
investigating the ERK pathway in my laboratory. Our goals include an investigation into: (i) the regulation and
role of H3.3 histone chaperones and H3.3 modifications, (ii) the role SP1/EGR1-downregulated genes and their
characterization as new metastasis suppressors, such as CHAF1b and MCEE; (iii) the function of massive
reorganization of endomembrane trafficking, lysosome and autophagosome function and the unexplored
regulation and function of various plasma and lysosome membrane transporters in the maintenance of cancer
stem cell properties, invasion, survival and chemoresistance during cancer progression and metastasis. In
conclusion, there is an essential need for greater understanding of the mechanisms associated with metastatic
behavior. Our expectations are that successful completion of the proposed work will impact cancer therapies
through identification of new biomarkers and novel drug targets that will yield small molecules that target the
invasiveness and survival of aggressive cancers."
10784477,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Social attachments play a central role in every level of human interaction, from
relationships between parents and children to enduring partnerships with mates. A major barrier to understanding
the neural basis of this behavior is that mice and other traditional model organisms do not exhibit complex
attachments. In contrast, prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) form social attachments and demonstrate enduring
social monogamy between mates. Such attachments result in a preference for bonded partners and the robust
rejection of novel conspecifics, both of which require social memory of specific individuals. This suggests that
key regions such as the hippocampus contribute to the affective and behavioral responses to a given individual.
Hippocampal areas CA2 and CA3, specifically, are implicated in social memory and the display of agonistic
behaviors towards novel intruders in mice. Importantly, hippocampal CA2/3 is modulated by oxytocin, a key
neuroendocrine mediator of attachment behaviors. However, how CA2/3 and oxytocin receptor (OxtR) signaling
therein contribute to pair bonding is unknown. This proposal will delineate the molecular, cellular, and functional
mechanisms by which neuroendocrine signaling in the hippocampus contributes to social attachment in the
socially monogamous prairie vole. In the mentored phase of this research plan, we will identify sex- and species-
specific spatial distributions of cell types and neuroendocrine receptors in the vole hippocampus. To do this, we
will conduct single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus in combination with multiplexed error robust
fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). In the independent phase, we will test the hypothesis that CA2/3
and OxtR signaling therein mediate the rejection of novel, potential mates in the prairie vole. First, we will
determine the hippocampal neuroendocrine cell types activated by exposure to a partner vs. a novel stranger
using MERFISH with immediate early gene imaging in bonded prairie voles. Second, we will test CA2/3 ensemble
responses to social interactions with partners and strangers across pair bonding using miniscope imaging. Third,
we will test whether CA2/3 activity and CA2/3 OxtR function are necessary for pair bond maintenance by a)
chemogenetically inhibiting CA2/3 or b) locally delivering an OxtR antagonist prior to assays for stranger rejection
in pair bonded voles. These studies will provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms governing social
attachment and their modulation by oxytocin, ultimately contributing to the BRAIN Initiative priority areas of
identifying cell types, monitoring neural activity, and using interventional tools to understand the neural basis of
complex social cognition. This work will be conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, a premier
research institution with ample research and career development resources. I will receive training in
transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and professional development. For this, I have assembled a mentorship team
that will provide expertise for every aspect of my training and will help me to accomplish my goal of becoming
faculty at a top institution."
10803017,"Abstract
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) misperceive specific aspects of their appearance to be
conspicuously flawed or defective, despite these being unnoticeable or appearing miniscule to others. With
convictions of disfigurement and ugliness, they typically have poor insight or delusional beliefs, obsessive
thoughts and compulsive behaviors, anxiety, and depression. These result in significant difficulties in
functioning, depression, suicide attempts (25%), and psychiatric hospitalization (50%). Despite this, relatively
few studies of the neurobiology, and few treatment studies, have been conducted. This underscores a critical
need for research to identify novel targets for intervention based on a comprehensive understanding of the
pathophysiological mechanisms. While preoccupation with misperceived appearance features of the face and
head are common in BDD, additional concerns about the body (from the neck down) are also highly prevalent.
Yet, misperceptions of the body are often of a different nature than face concerns; these typically pertain to the
size and shape of body parts rather than specific details. Common examples are that one’s thighs are too large
or small, or that one’s chest is too large or small. Face concerns, on the other hand, typically involve
misperception of small details, e.g. skin blemishes. Size/shape misperceptions may have different causes
related to brain functioning and behaviors than those involving details. Further, distortions of one’s internal self-
body image (one’s imagined body in the absence of a stimuli such as a mirror) may contribute to appearance
preoccupations. We plan to uncover mechanisms of body misperception in the context of self-body
representations by determining own-body size estimation accuracy while also measuring brain function and
eye behaviors. The additional experimental procedures will use a digital avatar tool, Somatomap 3D, to
quantify body size estimation, while simultaneously obtaining fMRI and eye-tracking data. With data collected
in the overall study, the results promise to provide valuable information to help develop new targeted
behavioral, perceptual, and/or brain stimulation treatments to address body image distortion that involve
appearance aspects of the body or face."

The BSL-3 Practices core is critical for meeting George Mason University (GMU)’s Biomedical
Research Lab (BRL)’s mission to perform groundbreaking research on emerging infectious
diseases, contribute meaningfully to pandemic preparedness, and be poised to respond timely
to a bioterrorist attack or other national and global emergencies caused by infectious
pathogens. The BRL serves as a center for scientific collaboration to 1) generate advanced
knowledge of pathogen biology and host interaction mechanisms, and 2) evaluate diagnostics,
therapeutics and vaccines. To meet the mission, GMU must have an adequately sized and
trained workforce who can conduct high quality work safely and in compliance with federal

faster transition of new discoveries to the market.
It is critical that the BRL has a strong BSL-3 Practices core to ensure continued safe conduct of
research in a high containment environment that complies with National Institutes of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Center for Disease Control (CDC), and US Department of
Agriculture (USDA)/Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) regulations.
Creating and sustaining a compliant work environment for pathogen and select agent research
is critical for the health and safety of laboratory operators and to prevent environmental
exposure. The implementation strategies for GMU’s BSL-3 Practices core focus on 1)
enhancing safety training by delivering a consistent, personalized curriculum, 2) implementing
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to advance research quality and reproducibility, and 3)
ensuring the BSL-3 research community can effectively utilize advanced research

10793548,"Project Summary
This misregulation of gene expression underlies several human diseases, including many cancers, diabetes,
obesity, and multiple developmental disorders. Genome-wide studies and next-generation sequencing have
revealed that sequence variants in enhancers, cis-regulatory DNA sequences that control spaciotemporal gene
expression programs, contribute to the development of these diseases. These mutations often affect enhancer
activity, which must be tightly controlled since enhancers drive tissue and cell-type specific gene expression
patterns. One way that enhancer activity is controlled is through the regulation of enhancer accessibility by the
nucleosome: the structural unit of chromatin comprised of 147 bp of DNA and a histone octamer. Enhancers
are characterized by an intrinsically strong nucleosome barrier that prevents the binding of transcription factors
(TFs), the proteins that activate enhancers, until the proper context for activation is reached, at which point TFs
must overcome the nucleosome barrier and bind to the DNA. While nucleosome depletion is a key early step in
enhancer activation, we do not yet understand how the nucleosome barrier is overcome and how enhancers
are made accessible for gene activation, despite accessibility being a major regulator of enhancer activity.
Current models suggest that specialized TFs called pioneer factors can access their motifs in the presence of
nucleosomes and foment nucleosome depletion through cooperativity with additional TFs. Even still, how
pioneer and non-pioneer TFs cooperate to generate chromatin accessibility at enhancers is not yet known.
Furthermore, how pioneer factors perturb the nucleosomal landscape to facilitate chromatin accessibility and
cooperative TF binding is unclear.
This study seeks to identify how TFs overcome the nucleosome barrier at enhancers using high-resolution
experimental and computational genomics techniques to map TF binding, chromatin accessibility, and
nucleosome positioning. Aim 1 will characterize how pioneer and non-pioneer TFs cooperate for binding to the
DNA and for establishing chromatin accessibility. This aim will combine high-resolution TF binding (ChIP-
nexus) and temporally resolved chromatin accessibility (time-course ATAC-seq) information with deep learning
models (BPNet) that will reveal the sequences and sequence constraints that are important for and predictive
of TF cooperativity. Aim 2 will profile genome-wide nucleosome positional changes over developmental time at
unprecedented resolution, using a chemical mapping of nucleosome centers approach. This aim will uncover
how the nucleosome state at enhancers is altered over time to generate accessibility and how nucleosomes
are positioned with respect to the underlying regulatory DNA sequences. Taken together, these aims will
illuminate how TFs pioneer the chromatin landscape for enhancer activation, thereby deepening the field’s
understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation and how misregulation contributes to human disease."
10786248,"Activation of wild-type (wt) p53 tumor suppressor is sufficient to kill tumor cells, even if other gene
defects are present. Cisplatin is a p53-dependent drug that is heavily used in treating cancer. However, in
several cancers harboring predominantly wt-p53, its benefit, if any, is short-lived. For instance, response rate
to cisplatin in the Clear Cell ovarian cancer (OvCa) sub-type is a low 25%, resulting in an overall survival of
only 10%. Thus, cisplatin resistance is a significant impediment, and this has created an unmet need to identify
novel strategies that would lead to targeted therapeutic options for rational development against the refractory
OvCa disease. A major factor in resistance is the loss of p53 function, and not necessarily through mutation.
This proposal is focused on wt-p53 since there is now acute awareness from our work and those of others that
this genotype is ubiquitous in many advanced clinically resistant cancers, such as mesothelioma and osteo-
sarcoma. In this proposal, our focus is on refractory OvCa harboring wt-p53, which is the genotype present
predominantly (~90%) in the rare OvCa sub-types, constituting 30% of all ovarian cancers. Importantly, these
sub-types occur at an earlier age and, therefore, death is observed in younger women. But, current therapy of
these sub-types remains empirical, due largely to profound knowledge gaps that exist in this disease.
 We have established that tumor cells become resistant to cisplatin when this drug fails to activate wt-
p53 due to silencing of the specific kinase that is vital for p53 phosphorylation and, thereby, p53-dependent
transactivation function. Normally, wt-p53 is maintained in an inactive state by its endogenous natural
inhibitors. The activity of partially released p53 through pharmacological targeting of such inhibitors, however,
is insufficient to exceed the critical threshold for apoptotic function. Since p53 phosphorylation is vital for fully
functionalizing p53 for its apoptotic function, we propose a novel hypothesis that targeted reduction in MDM4
will fully release p53 and allow access of the critical p53-site to endogenous active kinase(s) and induce
phosphorylation. We will test this hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) Establish basal phosphorylation of
p53 by targeting MDM4 in refractory OvCa sub-type tumor models in vitro and in vivo; 2) Identify the active
kinase that phosphorylates p53 and assess its potential role for therapy. We will utilize pharmacologic tools to
define tumor sensitivity following MDM4 modulation, biochemical and molecular tools to identify and modulate
the kinase and delineate the basis for reversal of cisplatin resistance, and graphically model antitumor effects
of rational combinations to establish synergy. This high-risk project has the potential to establish a conceptual
foundation for therapeutic activation of wt-p53 in rare OvCa that will enable follow-up studies and likely change
the trajectory of treatment outcomes for large numbers of patients diagnosed with cisplatin-resistant OvCa sub-
types. Importantly, there is a high potential that the outcome from the proposed studies will likely be tumor
agnostic and, thereby, substantially impact a wider spectrum of wt-p53 cancers resistant to other drugs."
10913489,"Project Summary/ Abstract
In the field of biopharmaceutics, virtual bioequivalence (VBE) trial simulations have the potential to
increase the speed of drug development, lower its cost and reduce exposure of human volunteers
and patients to unneeded therapies. VBE is based on the proven ability of mechanistic
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to simulate realistic virtual cohorts of patients
which can replace full clinical trials. However, well-defined and verified workflows and examples of
VBE applications are not yet fully established. Having well-defined workflows in a seamless, user-
friendly, and widely accessible modeling platform tested with multiple case studies will ensure a
wider adoption VBE by industry and regulatory bodies. This project proposes to develop an
integrated VBE platform yielding optimal decisions for a matter directly related to the health and
safety of patients, and their optimal and cost-effective treatment. The capacity to integrate various
streams of data (in vitro information on drug and formulations, physiological knowledge of what
conditions the ability of a drug to reach its site of action, variability physiology and metabolism
across patients) is not just a software production exercise but requires deep knowledge of each area
and expertise in the field. This needs to be complemented by rigorous statistical analyses, as applied
to real clinical data, of the VBE simulations. Our overall objectives are to
 • Develop a software platform allowing for flexible, fit-for-purpose, VBE workflows taking
 advantage of existing tools and adding user-defined modules.
 • Provide guidance on VBE workflow design (how to solve particular questions, pitfalls to avoid,
 help with the design of supporting experiments and trials) for regulatory agencies/industries.
 • Make maximum use of the capabilities of existing in vitro data analysis and modeling tools to
 extract key parameters values relevant to formulation differences for selected routes of
 administration (e.g., oral, intra-muscular injection).
 • Conduct six in-depth VBE case studies, very close to real life cases, where individualized BE
 clinical data are available to the team through literature reports or internal investigations;
 Experimental in vitro data is already available or will be generated as required.
 • Create automated default reporting templates that clearly document the workflow and its
 results and are easily understood by non-users for assessment purpose (with flexibility to
 modify default templates when needed).
Our specific aims are divided in workflow design, software implementation and case studies. We
anticipate that the proposed research will result in a wider patient centric application of population
PBPK models in generic drug development and regulatory reviews, but also for innovators’ drugs,
enhancing drug efficacy, availability and safety for all the world’s population."
10931677,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is successful to block active replication of HIV, it does not completely
eradicate the infection. HIV remains persistently infected and viral load can rebound after ART withdrawal,
presenting a major obstacle for cure of HIV/AIDS. Investigation of host machineries that regulate HIV replication
will help to improve the understanding of the mechanisms supporting HIV persistent infection. It will also provide
new strategies to perturb host regulatory factors for eliminating residual HIV. This topic is especially relevant for
the HIV-infected drug users, since drug abuse creates a profound impact on HIV infection, increasing the difficulty
to manage HIV viral reservoirs. Our earlier effort includes the identification of novel host restriction factors
specifically associated with a rare subset of HIV-infected individuals (<1%), termed elite controllers (ECs), who
can maintain long-term control over HIV replication in the absence of ART. In a preliminary study, we performed
RNA sequencing analysis and identified alternative splicing variants in cells from ECs, HIV-infected individuals
undergoing suppressive ART, ART-naive HIV-infected individuals, and healthy controls. Differential gene
expression patterns that are specific to ECs and may influence HIV resistance were identified, including
alternative RNA splicing and exon usage variants of the CREM/ICER gene (cAMP-responsive element
modulator/inducible cAMP early repressors). The knockout and knockdown of specific ICER exons resulted in
significantly increased HIV infection. Overexpression of ICER isoforms decreased HIV infection. We also
preliminarily showed that ICER isoforms are dysregulated in cocaine users. Together, these earlier studies
confirm that CREM/ICER is a unique and novel host restriction factor suppressing HIV replication. We propose
to comprehensively investigate their roles in regulating HIV infection, particularly for cocaine users. Furthermore,
we also propose to identify other host gene isoforms that are dysregulated by cocaine use, which overall promote
HIV persistent infection. Our central hypothesis is that certain host genes, including CREM/ICER, undergo
profound RNA splicing to generate distinct isoforms in HIV-infected cocaine users and thus support HIV
persistent infection in this population, which can be targeted to benefit HIV functional cure and mitigate HIV-
induced inflammation. These studies include three related but independent aims. In Aim 1, we will determine
correlations of CREM/ICER, HIV infection, inflammation, and cocaine use parameters. In Aim 2, we will
investigate roles of CREM/ICER in mediating cocaine’s effect on HIV infection and inflammation. In Aim 3, we
will identify novel gene isoforms in CD4+ T cells and monocytes dysregulated by cocaine use."
10786468,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
When the airways of children dependent on ventilators become infected with multi-drug resistant (MDR)
organisms, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), their risk of acute deterioration and even death increases.
Difficult to eradicate, MDR KP have been identified as a major threat to human respiratory health. Therefore,
studying the mechanisms of how the lung is affected by MDR bacteria is very important for this high-risk
patient population. One hypothesis for their success is that the change in the inflammatory milieu is a direct
result of the altered metabolic environment, dictated by the MDR KP utilization of glucose and other energy-
generating substrates. How the preferred metabolic pathways of selected bacteria determine inflammatory
signaling is poorly understood. In our previous studies, we have found that the enhanced use of glucose by our
representative MDR KP isolates gave the bacteria a fitness advantage in vivo, leading to persistence in the
host lung. The long-term goal of this application is to understand how host immunity in the lung is influenced by
the availability of scarce metabolites, as determined by both bacterial and host factors, resulting in bacterial
persistence and/or impaired lung function. The central hypothesis of this application is that the availability of
glucose in the lung dictates the inflammatory state of the lung in MDR KP infection and colonization. To
address these questions, we propose to study the inflammatory cells and effectors, alongside the metabolic
environment, in an in vivo model of pneumonia and airway washings of critically ill children dependent on
ventilators. Our study design will allow us to execute the following aims: 1) We will determine how glucose
utilization affects the immunometabolome in MDR KP pneumonia in vivo and 2) We will characterize the
immunometabolome of airway washings from children with tracheostomies in baseline health and acute illness
requiring admission to the PICU. Our multi-disciplinary approach is innovative in studying the mechanisms that
drive the colonization of the airways by these opportunistic pathogens independent of antimicrobial resistance
elements. The data acquired from this proposal will generate preliminary data for future more comprehensive
funding mechanisms. In the future, this research will have a direct translational impact in determining the
consequences of bacterial and immune cell metabolism on bacterial persistence in the airways, potentially
improving ventilator-dependent children's lives."
10789285,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal and progressive disease with unknown etiology and poor
survival rate. Pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling and occlusive intimal lesion are the major causes
for the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in PAH. A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is
a trigger for pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) contraction (and vasoconstriction) and a stimulus
for PASMC proliferation/migration (and vascular remodeling). In addition, the contractile-to-proliferative
phenotypic transition (CPPT) in PASMC and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in pulmonary
arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) are implicated in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and
obliterative intimal lesion in PAH. We recently found that Piezo1, a mechanosensitive cation channel, and
CALHM1 (calcium homeostasis modulator 1), a voltage-gated cation and ATP channel, are upregulated during
CPPT and involved in vascular remodeling in PAH/PH. Upregulated Piezo1 in PAEC enhances EndMT via the
Ca2+/AKT/mTOR-Jagged1 (Jag-1) signaling axis and is involved in the development of occlusive vascular lesion
and concentric vascular remodeling in animals with experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH). In addition, we
identified GPR91 (a succinate-activated GPCR) and GPR68 (a mechanosensitive GPCR) that are involved in
the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH/PH. The central hypothesis is that ionic (channel)
remodeling is required for phenotypic transition of PASMC/PAEC. Upregulated channels (Piezo1/CALHM1) and
receptors (GPR68/91) are required for causing pathogenic overgrowth of PASMC/EC through activation of Ca2+-
sensitive signaling and compartmentation of AKT/mTORC1 signaling, and contribute to vascular remodeling and
occlusive intimal lesion in PAH. The overall goals of this study are to examine: 1) gene expression profile
associated with the phenotypic transition of PASMC (CPPT) and PAEC (EndMT), 2) cellular and molecular
mechanisms involved in CPPT in human PASMC, 3) whether Piezo1 and mechanosensitive Ca2+ signaling
contribute to inducing and regulating EndMT in PAEC and whether endothelial Piezo1 is involved in the
development of PH, 4) how compartmentalized AKT/mTORC1 signaling and spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling are
involved in EndMT in PAEC and enhanced PAEC proliferation in PAH/PH, 5) whether viroporins (e.g., SARS-
CoV-2 E protein) form non-selective cation channels to promote Ca2+ influx and stimulate PASMC/EC
proliferation, and 6) whether and how Ca2+ influx through upregulated cation channels and activation of selected
receptors contribute to regulation of inflammasome in PASMC/EC. The importance of this research program is
in its integrative design and translational potential in which we will define the pathogenic mechanism, identify
new therapeutic targets, and develop novel therapies for PAH/PH based on our studies on mechanosensitive
channels/receptors and Ca2+ signaling in PASMC and PAEC."
10791857,"This proposal's long-term objective is to provide a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the
role of nucleus vs. mitochondria in the activation of the senescence program. Senescence is a
central cellular defense mechanism that removes damaged cells to maintain tissue integrity and
prevent tumorigenesis. The accumulation of senescent cells, which express a copious amount of
inflammatory cytokines, termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), is a
significant contributing factor to organismal aging. In the last decade, studies have identified the
disruption of nuclear membrane (lamina) integrity and subsequent release of nuclear DNA (nDNA)
to the cytosol as the primary trigger of senescence and premature aging, progeria. On the other
hand, experimental evidence has long implied mitochondria in senescence and aging. However,
the exact role of mitochondria in senescence remains unknown. We have found that during
senescence, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents were elevated significantly and mitochondria
undergo elaborate fusion. Gene expression analysis of senescent cells revealed coordinated
upregulation of ABAT and RRM2B, two genes that are required for mtDNA synthesis and
maintenance. These genes are also elevated in mice of old age. We found that pharmacological
inhibition of mtDNA synthesis suppressed SASP but did affect senescence-associated growth
arrest. These findings uncover a unique signaling role of mtDNA in SASP and coordinated
mitochondrial remodeling during senescence. This proposal aims to delineate the functional
significance of the nuclear and mitochondrial pathway in SASP associated with senescence and
aging and investigate the regulation and roles of mitochondrial dynamics in the activation of
SASP."
10791858,"1  Project Abstract: Although the number of people developing breast cancer (BC) each year has remained the 
2  same, 5-­year survival rates for late stage disease are still an abysmal 17-­26%. However, one positive indicator 
3  of survival is how well the patient’s immune system is able to recognize the tumor and attack it, using immune 
 4  cells  like  tumor-­associated  macrophages  (TAMs).  Basal-­like,  triple  negative  BC  (TNBC)  is  a  uniquely  deadly 
5  type of BC and accounts for about 20% of BC cases. TNBC does not grow because of hormone and growth 
6  factors, but instead frequently activates other pro-­growth signals like the expression of secreted WNT proteins 
7  that act as messengers to nearby cells. In addition, TNBC is more likely to manipulate the immune system into 
 8  a  tumor-­promoting  mechanism  instead  of  a  tumor-­fighting  one.  This  is  accomplished  by  inducing  TAMs  to 
9  program into a tumor-­promoting M2 state, which helps create an environment for tumors to thrive by promoting 
10  blood vessel growth, instead of a tumor-­fighting M1 state. We have identified the DEK protein as a key driver of 
11  BC growth and disease progression. DEK is highly expressed – meaning too much protein is made compared 
12  to  normal  cells  -­  in  about  60%  of  all  breast  cancers,  especially  TNBC.  DEK  is  over-­expressed  in  all  types  of 
13  cancer studied so far, meaning that understanding how DEK functions to promote cancer growth and disease 
14  progression could have a far-­reaching impact in understanding cancer biology. We have previously used cultured 
15  cells to discover that DEK promotes the proliferation of cancer cells by increasing the expression of several WNT 
16  genes that then get secreted to act on neighboring cells, but have not yet investigated this in animal models. 
17  Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that the WNT proteins produced by DEK-­expressing cancer cells may 
18  signal  to  TAMs  to  enter  an  M2-­like  state  to  further  promote  tumor  growth.  We  hypothesize  that  DEK  over-­
19  expression  in  BC  promotes  tumor  formation  via  elevated  WNT  expression,  which  acts  both  on  neighboring 
20  epithelial cells and on macrophages. We will use three-­dimensional cell culture of human cells, patient samples, 
21  and new mouse models of BC to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will use a new DEK over-­expression model 
22  in  the  mammary  epithelium  of  mice  to  Determine  when  and  how  DEK  promotes  tumor  growth.  We  will  also 
23  determine the necessity for continued DEK expression to maintain tumor growth, which will inform the feasibility 
24  of creating DEK-­targeting therapies in the future. Aim 2 will investigate how important WNT proteins are for the

10791452,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Relapsed pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is often refractory to conventional therapy and
is associated with a dismal survival rate of less than 25%. Thus, the development of novel therapies for relapsed
T-ALL represents an urgent unmet medical need in children. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1)
mediates the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in the mammalian transcriptome. Malignant ADAR1
activation and over-editing was reported in extensively reported in adult cancer type. As a result, there is an
intense interest to understand the mechanisms by which ADAR1-directed A-to-I RNA editing regulates gene
expression, and how these editing events influence tumorigenesis. However, the global landscape of A-to-I RNA
editing in pediatric cancer has not been systematically characterized. Fulfilling this knowledge gap will allow
mechanistic and functional studies of these RNA editing modifications that can ultimately aid in formulating new
therapeutic and preventive strategies. We discovered that 70% of T-ALL patients exhibit high expression of
ADAR1, and this is associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome. Our RNA editing analysis of over 260
T-ALL patients revealed wide-spread A-to-I RNA mutations in the relapsed T-ALL cohort. Strikingly, we found
that inhibiting ADAR1 impairs malignant T-ALL progenitor propogation. These discoveries need to be validated
in a large cohort of T-ALL patients to further delineate the critical RNA editing “mutations” associated with
relapse. The overall objective of this study is to leverage on the large sample size in Kids First Program to fully
understand the heterogenous RNA editing landscape in T-ALL pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis that ADAR1
promotes unique A-to-I RNA editing changes in T-ALL which drives disease relapse and therapeutic resistance.
In this proposal, we will 1) define the ADAR1-controlled A-to-I RNA editing landscape in 1,304 T-ALL patients by
combining the Kids First and NCI TARGET datasets, 2) identify novel RNA editing events that predict disease
outcome, and 3) compare the RNA editing landscapes in various molecular subtypes to reveal any critical link
between RNA editing and genetic background. Our preliminary studies and the proposed work together will
provide the first complete A-to-I RNA editing landscape in T-ALL that will be shared within the pediatric
research community. In addition, we will provide new insights into the mechanisms and functions of ADAR1 in
T-ALL pathogenesis and will substantially advance our understanding of the epitranscriptomic regulation in
pediatric malignancies. The success of this work will reveal a comprehensive evaluation of the RNA editing
network that provides advantages for leukemia expansion, and RNA hyper-editing events which may serve as
an attractive therapeutic target."
10791541,"The purpose of this project is to address health disparities in the care of patients with post-acute COVID
syndrome (PACS) due to the rural nature of northern New England and its shortage of medical services. We
will develop useful, understandable and relatable information for patients and providers, in partnership with
rural and biomedical libraries. The foundation for our project is the Dartmouth-Hitchcock PACS Clinic, an
established, comprehensive clinic serving patients in Vermont and New Hampshire.
 The rural nature of northern New England poses a challenge to delivery of comprehensive care to PACS
patients. Most parts of VT and NH are characterized as being “small town/isolated rural” or “large rural
town.” The debilitating nature of PACS threatens job security, financial stability, and the ability to function
normally, and there is limited access to primary care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and mental
health services that can accept and are familiar with the complex nature of PACS. Furthermore, the Area
Deprivation Index (ADI), based on a measure created by HRSA, shows that at least half of the two states have
ADI scores of >50, indicating that they are “disadvantaged” in relation to national standards. A large
percentage of the 1300 patients referred to our PACS clinic report difficulties in accessing reliable information
about managing their condition and finding locally based services. Affordable, high-speed internet service is
often limited in rural settings, and many rely on local libraries to meet those needs. Above all, patients express
a sense of isolation, both physical and emotional. Our experience has taught us that bridging that sense of
isolation is often the greatest service we can provide.
 Our goal is to “reach more people in more ways through enhanced engagement pathways.” Our aims are:
  To improve the care of patients with PACS in rural VT and NH by disseminating useful, usable, and
 understandable information to this health-disparity population.
  To promote a better understanding of PACS for patients and providers by means of new, appropriately
 targeted resources. We will create an online archive of “digital stories” that highlight lived experiences
 of patients with PACS and create an independent website and monthly newsletter with content about
 PACS that is responsive to the emerging science and meets the needs of our patients and providers.
  To raise awareness about PACS in rural communities and promote community access to information
 about PACS and post-COVID care.
 We will partner with rural libraries, which are often a primary hub of information-sharing in rural
communities, to assist in deploying computer and information technology that is otherwise unavailable or
difficult to use for many of our patients. We will tailor information to meet the needs of our population. Our
efforts should be generalizable to other rural communities in the US."
10791348,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Metabolism is a well-established regulator of innate immune responses. Previous literature examined
metabolic changes upon activation of dendritic cells (DCs) by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
from planktonic (free-living) bacteria, like the LPS, while little is still known about the metabolic reprogramming
induced by bacterial biofilms. Most bacterial pathogens thrive in biofilms, multicellular communities of bacteria.
Biofilms are potent virulence factors associated to recurrent and chronic infections and are resistant to DNAses,
proteases and even to antibiotics, providing a formidable challenge for clinical treatment. We have recently
reported that a bacterial amyloid termed curli, a dominant component in E. coli and Salmonella biofilms, forms a
natural complex with bacterial DNA and is a potent PAMP, activating DCs and macrophages.
 The objective of this exploratory project is to determine whether DCs acquire a specific metabolic profile
upon recognition of biofilm-specific PAMPs vs. PAMPs expressed also by planktonic (free-living) bacteria, with
the long-term goals of 1) understanding whether DCs mount distinct responses during biofilm-driven infections
vs. planktonic infections, 2) discovering new therapeutics to improve host defense. We hypothesize that
curli/DNA induce in inflammatory DCs a specific reprogramming that promotes innate and adaptive immune
responses against biofilms. This project will provide the foundation to study murine and human innate responses
to biofilms. In Aim 1, we will perform high resolution mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the metabolic
changes that occur in DCs upon recognition of bacterial amyloid curli/DNA. We will compare these results with
better-known PAMPs LPS, CpG and Pam3CSK4, the latter two triggering the same TLR2/TLR9 that recognize
curli/DNA. We will test murine GM-CSF-monocyte-like DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs, as models of
inflammatory DCs. To confirm the metabolomics results, changes in the main metabolic pathways will be followed
using stable isotope tracing, the Seahorse Flux Analyzer, and biochemistry assays. In Aim 2, we will analyze the
transcriptome and cytokine secretome to identify the molecular pathways associated with the metabolic
reprogramming stimulated in DCs by bacterial amyloids and characterize the induced innate response. We will
compare these results with those from DCs exposed in vitro to bacterial biofilms. To start dissecting in depth the
underlying molecular mechanisms, we will study the purine salvage pathway, a metabolic pathway novel in DC
biology that was suggested by our Preliminary studies.
 This project will explore the innate immune response against bacterial biofilms through the recognition of the
most stimulatory component, the bacterial amyloids. It will indicate which metabolic pathways are candidates as
therapeutic targets to modulate immune responses to biofilms, starting with the purine salvage pathway, an
understudied pathway in DC biology, to strengthen innate responses against biofilm-driven infections."
10793530,"It is estimated that, globally, a lower extremity amputation takes place every 30 seconds, and that 85% of
these amputations are the result of diabetic foot ulcers. Plantar foot ulcers develop, in part, due to high
loading and mechanical stress to the soft tissues of the foot. Custom standard of care insoles aim to reduce
regions of the foot that experience excessive plantar pressures by redistributing pressure to other areas.
Limitations in the effectiveness of standard of care insoles, however, result in rates of ulceration that remain
unacceptably high. Meanwhile, a revolution in 3D printing technologies, material properties, and digital
manufacturing pipelines are enabling a wave of innovative solutions that are improving outcomes in many
areas of medicine. We aim to leverage these techniques to create novel patient-specific 3D printed insoles
with personalized metamaterials which we believe will demonstrate superior offloading performance.
Personalized metamaterials are 3D printed materials formed from lattice patterns derived from patient-
specific characteristics, resulting in insoles that are uniquely matched to the patient’s needs. The aim of
this study is to determine if 3D printed insoles with personalized metamaterials reduce plantar pressures
for at-risk areas of the foot better than standard of care insoles. We will manufacture three different insoles,
namely the standard of care (SC), 3D printed pressure based (3DP-PB), and finite element optimized
(3DP-FE) insoles. 3DP-PB insoles will be designed from plantar foot shape and dynamic plantar pressure
while the 3DP-FE insoles will be designed from simulations of participant’s feet interacting with different
insole designs to optimize the insole shape and metamaterial properties. In a repeated measures study,
we will measure peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral for each type of insole with a group of
25 participants who have diabetes and elevated forefoot pressure. We hypothesize that the 3D printed
insoles comprised of personalized metamaterials derived from plantar measurements (3DP-PB) will have
greater reductions in the peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral than the SC insoles (H1).
Additionally, we hypothesize that, relative to the other two insoles, insoles optimized through patient-
specific finite element simulations (3DP-FE) will have the greatest reduction in peak plantar pressure and
pressure time integral (H2). To facilitate the clinical translation of the novel 3D printed insoles we will carry
out focus groups with patients and clinicians to gain their early feedback and insights. Results from these
focus groups will be qualitatively synthesized into actionable improvements to the insoles. Novel insoles
that utilize 3D printing fabrication may provide enhanced protection from foot ulcers that frequently
progress to amputation. Moreover, digital manufacturing technologies and 3D fabrication methods have
relatively low barriers to mass production, which can greatly expedite translation into clinics. The VA is
widely recognized as a leader in health care innovation. The development of custom 3D printed insoles
that may reduce risk for amputation is well-aligned with VA’s spirit of innovation and is supported by the
VA mission “To care for him who shall have borne the battle.” Reducing rates of ulceration in our Veteran
population has the potential to greatly reduce incidence of lower-limb amputations and improve the quality
of life for our Veterans."

Over the past 20 years, the scope of Vision Science has expanded enormously and in multiple directions. New
methods from different scientific disciplines were pioneered in the visual system (e.g., single-cell RNA
sequencing to characterize neuronal diversity, large-scale electrophysiological recordings to characterize visual
processing, screens of adeno-associated virus serotypes and promoters to deliver genes to specific cell types).
These advances have transformed our understanding of the biology of the visual system and the pathogenesis
of its diseases. Despite these advances, many blinding diseases remain without effective treatments. In the face
of this remarkable expansion, graduate education faces three challenges. First, although the body of knowledge
relevant to Vision Science has increased in breadth and depth, students also face increased pressure to conduct
research, publish, and get independent funding early in their careers. Second, Vision Science is conducted in
multiple Departments and Ph.D. programs. Yet, students coming from different disciplines often do not speak
each other’s language. Third, a successful career in science requires a broad portfolio of professional skills –
writing papers and grant proposals, collaborating with colleagues with different scientific backgrounds,
presenting results in scientific venues and to wider audiences, navigating the academic job market – that exceed
the normal coursework. We overhauled the Interdisciplinary Training in Vision Science (ITVS) program in
response to these challenges. The new ITVS is an elite program available for graduate students in Training
Years 3-4, with eligibility from multiple Ph.D. programs relevant to Vision Science broadly defined. The emphasis
of the ITVS program is on interdisciplinary training and professional skills development. To access the program,
students must complete (in Training Years 1-2) pre-requisite foundational courses of their parent Ph.D.
programs. In Training Years 3-4, ITVS students take three additional courses: one providing foundational
knowledge about the biology of the visual system and its diseases, one combining theory and practice of the
advanced methods that drove recent breakthroughs in Vision Science, and one that introduces challenges and
opportunities to translating research findings into benefits to patients and connects students to clinicians treating
disease relevant to the student’s research. In addition, ITVS students participate in Project Building, where they
develop an interdisciplinary grant proposal – that could become an NRSA application – shaped by peer,
instructor, and committee feedback. Throughout the ITVS program, students participate in multiple Career
Development activities, including mentoring junior students, organizing scientific events, interacting with external
speakers, participating in informal dinners with ITVS faculty, and participating in community outreach. The ITVS
program has existed for > 20 years and has a demonstrated history of remarkable success. We believe that the
recent program overhaul will enhance this success. Here, we request funds for 6 fellowships (3 per Training
Year)."
10793534,"ABSTRACT
In 2021, approximately 76,080 individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with kidney cancer, with renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) accounting for >90% of all cases. Approximately 25% of patients with RCC present with
metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis and up to 20-30% of patients develop recurrent disease after
nephrectomy. Immunotherapy is a new standard-of-care option for the first-line treatment of intermediate-risk
or poor-risk patients with advanced RCC. However, the immunotherapy outcomes are heterogeneous, with
some patients achieving a complete remission, and others having no benefit at all. Therefore, it is important to
identify modifiable factors and biomarkers that could help with patient selection and risk stratification, and to
detect patients who will experience treatment-related adverse events and disease progression. Growing
evidence supports that the gut microbiome contributes to cancer therapy toxicities and may modulate response
to cancer therapy. Therefore, we propose to 1) identify and validate pre-treatment gut microbiome profiles,
specific bacterial species, and bacterial functional pathways associated with circulating T-cell activation, cancer
immunotherapy response, adverse events, and progression-free survival among patients with advanced RCC;
2) identify and validate cancer immunotherapy-associated changes in the gut microbiome profiles and bacterial
functional pathways, and their association with circulating T-cell activation, cancer immunotherapy response,
adverse events, and progression-free survival among patients with advanced RCC, 3) explore the role of
bacterial metabolites and related biomarkers in cancer immunotherapy response, and 4) obtain preliminary
data on the gut microbiome profiles and bacterial functional pathways and outcomes by sex and race. The
study results will contribute considerably to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in cancer
immunotherapy response, efficacy, and adverse events, and will be relevant not only for advanced RCC
patients, but also for a larger group of cancer patients treated with cancer immunotherapy, which is considered
to be most promising recent development in cancer therapy."
10793535,"New antifungal drugs are needed to address the emergence of pan-drug resistant fungal pathogens that threaten
a growing immunocompromised patient population. Underscoring this urgency is the recent global spread of
Candida auris, which is resistant to all three of the available antifungal classes. Natural products from bacteria
have served as an important source of anti-infectives, including antifungals. We leveraged new sources of
bacteria harvested from marine invertebrate microbiomes to generate natural product screening libraries and
identified turbinmicin, a novel antifungal targeting multidrug resistant (MDR) fungal pathogens. Turbinmicin
displays potent in vitro and in vivo efficacy toward multiple MDR-fungal pathogens, exhibits a wide safety index,
and functions through a fungal-specific mode of action, targeting the vesicular trafficking pathway. We
subsequently synthesized turbinmicin analogs to modulate the pharmaceutical properties including solubility.
Based on our promising results, our premise is that turbinmicin analogs represent the next generation of safe
and effective antifungal targeting drug resistant fungal infections. In this project, the Wisconsin Drug
Discovery and Development Center will use lead optimization to develop turbinmicin, a novel natural
product representative from a new class of broad-spectrum and non-toxic antifungals. The aims are
focused on efficacy (specific aim 1), safety (specific aim 2), and production/formulation (specific aim 3). We
divide each of the three aims into two sequential Stages. Stage 1 will identify the most promising lead analog
based upon efficacy, safety, and solubility screens. Stage 2 will delineate IND-enabling PK/PD efficacy and
safety in established murine models and rat models, respectively.
Impact: As there are no effective therapies for emerging pan-drug resistant fungal pathogens, our work fills a
critical unmet need. Our studies will provide several IND-enabling datasets for clinical development of a new
class of antifungal targeting high threat drug-resistant fungi. The investigations use complementary, cutting-edge
technologies to test the efficacy and safety of the turbinmicin compound series, and optimize drug production.
The research will be performed in outstanding environments by a cohesive group of PIs and industry partners,
with complementary expertise in preclinical and clinical antimicrobial pharmacology and natural product
chemistry."

Immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of patients with metastatic cancer.
However, despite remarkable outcomes in some patients, only a minority achieves complete and durable clinical
response. To overcome this, combination of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade has gained
popularity to turn up the heat on cold tumors. While tumor irradiation can elicit an immunogenic cell death
triggering tumor antigen presentation and T-cell priming, immune checkpoint blockade can enhance the
expansion of tumor-reactive T cells which culminates with regression of distant non-irradiated metastases,
referred as “abscopal effect”. The synergy of radiotherapy and current immune checkpoint blockade has shown
to improve oncological outcomes in some patients but rates of abscopal effect remain scarce. Our long-term
goals are to develop new effective therapeutic combinations to boost abscopal response and improve clinical
outcome of patients with advanced cancers. To that end, there is a critical need to shed the light on the underlying
mechanisms of poor response to radiotherapy. Our group has generated compelling functional evidence
implicating the immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3 as a key mediator of tumor immune evasion that may act
both locally by impairing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and systemically through release of immunomodulatory
tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tdEVs). The overall objectives in this application are to gain a better
understanding of the role of B7-H3 In local and systemic antitumor immunity and evaluate the therapeutic
potential of targeting B7-H3 function with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In line with this, our central hypothesis
is that tumor B7-H3 acts as a “don’t touch me” signal which inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells. We will
test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms of B7-H3-induced CD8 T cell
dysfunction. To that end, we will use proximity labeling technologies and time-lapse imaging of T-cell mediated
cytotoxicity. We will also employ immunocompetent mouse models humanized for B7-H3 to evaluate the safety
and therapeutic efficacy of a newly developed B7-H3 inhibitor. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms of
systemic immunosuppression mediated by B7-H3+ tdEVs in response to radiotherapy using genetically
engineered mouse tumor cells and in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation. We have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team with complementary expertise in extracellular vesicle biology, radiation oncology, tumor
immunology and proteomics to validate B7-H3 as a therapeutic target to boost abscopal response in patients
with advanced cancers treated with radiotherapy."
10800657,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Melanoma is an extremely aggressive cancer with high mortality. Its phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity
enable it to adapt to diverse physiological settings and defeat treatment approaches. Targeted therapies and
check point inhibitors became available in the past decade; however, these drugs work in only a subset of
patients and drug resistance eventually emerges, even in initial responders. Therefore, new targets and clinical
approaches for melanoma are an unmet medical need. We identified glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) as
one such target. GCDH expression correlates with aggressive cancers and low survival in melanoma patients.
Our data demonstrates that GCDH knockdown results in apoptotic cell death in melanoma cells. Melanomas
seem uniquely sensitive to toxic glutarate metabolites resulting from GCDH deficiencies, since suppression of
the Dehydrogenase E1 and Transketolase Domain Containing 1 (DHTKD1) enzyme, catalyzing the preceding
reaction in the catabolic pathway and converting 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, rescues melanoma cells from
apoptosis. Pancreatic cancer cells, but not other cancers nor normal cells, share this overreliance on GCDH and
undergo apoptosis upon GCDH knockdown. We hypothesize that small-molecules interferring with GCDH will
result in the obliteration of melanoma cells through apoptosis. We propose to identify chemical probes of GCDH
to further validate the enzyme as a molecular target for melanoma. In a pilot screen, we established and validated
all of the assays proposed herein. We will perform large-scale HTS, hit confirmation and optimization, and
validate the identified hits in a panel of diverse cell lines for melanoma and other cancers. Compounds identified
will provide desirable pharmacological tools to study the pathophysiology of GCDH in melanoma and other
cancers, and the molecular mechanisms of lysine metabolism liability in melanoma, as well as provide potential
starting points for future therapeutic treatments. This 4-year project will pursue the following Specific Aims,
consistent with the expectations in PAR-20-271: AIM 1 Generate GCDH protein, optimize conditions and perform
screening to identify compounds targeting GCDH. Optimize tertiary assays for hit validation. Primary assays will
target binding activity and inhibition, and tertiary assays will monitor cellular target engagement and protein level.
AIM 2 Perform hit selection, confirmation and profiling using a panel of secondary assays. Functional hit profiles
will be established using inhibition assays for a representative of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and mechanism of
action studies by using protein thermal shift with substrate analogs and enzyme kinetic studies to establish
competition profiles with the substrates. AIM 3 Perform hit validation and scaffold prioritization using biochemical
and cellular assays. GCDH target engagement will be confirmed in an in-cell protein stability assay. Effects on
cellular protein levels will be evaluated using endogenous-tagged GCDH in melanoma cells. Best scaffolds will
be validated in cellular assays to monitor apoptosis, cell viability, and specificity towards melanoma and
pancreatic cancer."
10800788,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Aging-related diseases are associated with disruptions in protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. A major
disruptor of proteostasis is infection with intracellular pathogens, but it is poorly understood how responses to
these infections may promote proteostasis. Our long-term goal is to dissect how responses to infection and
other proteotoxic stressors can protect overall organismal health and lifespan through characterizing a novel
proteostasis response we discovered in the nematode C. elegans called the Intracellular Pathogen Response
or IPR. Our previous work demonstrated how upregulation of IPR genes that encode components of a cullin
ring ubiquitin ligase promote improved proteostasis, including increased thermotolerance. The objective of this
proposal is to determine how this multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase is assembled, to identify its target(s), and to
elucidate the fate of those targets and how they impact thermotolerance. The central hypothesis is that
intracellular infection and other specific proteotoxic stressors induce mRNA expression of ubiquitin ligase
subunits including: 1) the Cullin CUL-6, 2) the RING domain protein RCS-1, 3) a Skp-Related Protein SKR-3, 4
or 5, and 4) F-Box Proteins FBXA-75 or FBXA-158; and that redox-dependent dimerization of this CUL-6-
containing ubiquitin ligase tetramer (to create an enzyme complex of eight subunits total) leads to its activation,
and that this enzyme complex ubiquitylates a yet-to-be identified target that is then degraded by the lysosome
to regulate proteostasis. The rationale is based on our published genetic and biochemical data about the
assembly and function of RCS-1/CUL-6/SKR-3,4,5/FBXA-75/158, and our unpublished in vitro and in vivo data
about redox-dependent dimerization of SKR-3, together with our unpublished genetic and pharmacological
data indicating that the increased thermotolerance mediated by the CUL-6 ubiquitin ligase is dependent on the
lysosome. Our work is innovative because we are pursuing the IPR, which is a recently described proteostasis
response acting independently of canonical proteostasis pathways like the heat shock response and unfolded
protein responses.
 We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims including Aim 1) Determine the dimerization,
interactions and function of SKR-3, SKR-4, SKR-5, FBXA-75 and FBXA-158, both in vitro and in vivo; Aim 2)
Identify the target(s) of the CUL-6 ubiquitin ligase; and Aim 3) Characterize the downstream fate of these
targets, including possible degradation by the lysosome. The expected outcome is to determine which SKR
proteins heterodimerize, which SKR protein interacts with which F-box protein, which proteins are targeted by
this ubiquitin ligase complex, and which autophagy factors and other cellular components are involved in
directing targets to the lysosome. The proposed research is significant, because it could lead to new
treatments for aging-related diseases associated with disruptions in proteostasis."
10800792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is estimated to affect 13% of young adults and is associated with
considerable burden, including significant role impairment in daily life, increased risk of developing a mental
health disorder, hospitalization, permanent scarring. Repeated NSSI is also associated with high lifetime risk of
suicide. Timely interventions aimed at NSSI reduction could have a significant impact on improving mental
health and suicide prevention. However, around 50% of young adults never disclose their NSSI to anyone, and
far fewer ever seek professional help. Despite these low rates of disclosure and engagement with formal
mental healthcare, young people with NSSI report interest in, and receptivity to, digital mental health
interventions (DMHIs). Research has shown the effectiveness of DMHIs when applied to treat common mental
health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Given NSSI’s prevalence, the potential for the behavior to
result in severe and lethal outcomes, and young adults’ openness to DMHIs, an effective and usable DMHI for
NSSI could provide a unique, accessible, and scalable treatment option. We aim to design, develop, and
conduct a feasibility trial for a low-intensity DMHI for young adults with repeated NSSI, which can meet the
need to provide services to individuals unlikely to engage in formal treatment.
 Two key challenges for DMHIs are maintaining participant engagement and supporting skill implementation
in critical moments of distress. Our DMHI will address challenges with engagement through the use of a highly
interactive conversational agent and by evaluating the added benefit of a coach. Our DMHI will also tailor
content and interactions to the user’s current state, by using ecological momentary assessment to assess
NSSI risk and initiate relevant in-the-moment interventions to support users in implementing new coping
strategies.
 The primary goals of the project are to: (1) design and develop a DMHI for young adults with repeated
NSSI, in close collaboration with potential users from this population; (2) examine the feasibility of conducting a
3-arm randomized control trial of the self-guided DMHI treatment and the DMHI treatment with low-intensity
coaching, compared to a wait-list control, with frequency of NSSI behaviors and urges as the primary
outcomes, and suicidal ideation and depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder symptom severity
as secondary outcomes; and (3) explore the mediational effects of psychological targets (emotional, cognitive,
and behavioral regulation; self-efficacy to resist NSSI) and engagement targets (app use and subjective
engagement) on NSSI frequency and urges. This program of research aims to produce a scalable DMHI for
NSSI, based on validated psychological strategies."
10804601,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of late mortality (death ≥5 yrs from diagnosis) in early
breast cancer (EBC). Effective treatment strategies that improve function across multiple systems are a major
clinical need to reduce CVD in EBC. Aerobic exercise therapy (AT) is a pleiotropic intervention demonstrated in
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), a strong, independent predictor
of CVD and all-cause mortality in BC and other malignancies. However, virtually all AT RCTs in oncology
report the mean CRF change for the overall cohort; presentation of the mean result masks variability in
responses. To directly address this gap, our group explored response variability in our recently completed RCT
among 174 EBC patients (2.8 yrs. post-adjuvant therapy) who were allocated to 150 min/wk of: (1) linear AT
(70% CRF); (2) nonlinear AT (55% to 100% CRF); or (3) stretching (attention control) for 16 consecutive wks.
Despite high AT adherence, we found that: (1) CRF change ranged from -10% to +24%, and (2) ~60% were
classified as CRF non-responders based on the CRF technical error (TE; a robust measure of biological
variability and measurement error). These findings indicate that AT following the conventional volume (~150
min/wk) and / or length (~16 wks) is insufficient for improving CRF in a substantial proportion of EBC survivors.
AT-induced improvement in CRF is associated with corresponding reductions in CVD risk; thus, there is a
critical need to test the efficacy of alternative AT approaches that can optimize CRF response rate. Preliminary
findings from our group, and others, indicate that in order to augment CRF, increased AT volume and / or
length is required to allow for multisystem adaptation (i.e., across all components of the cardiopulmonary-
vascular-muscular axis). There have been no RCTs directly assessing AT length and volume on CRF
response rate in any cancer population. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of AT
program length and volume on CRF response rate and other pertinent outcomes in EBC. AIM 1: Compare the
effects of nonlinear AT program length and volume on CRF response rates. AIM 2: Evaluate the effects on
physiological determinants of CRF. AIM 3: Ascertain the difference in patient-reported outcomes, feasibility,
and safety. Using a 4-arm RCT design, we will randomly allocate 152 (n=38/group) EBC survivors following
completion of adjuvant therapy to: Arm A: volume only (300 min/wk for 16 weeks), Arm B: length only (150
min/wk for 32 weeks), Arm C: length and volume (300 min/wk for 32 weeks), or Arm D: control (150 min/wk for
16 weeks). IMPACT: Results from this investigation will identify the AT regimen that maximizes CRF response
rate and other clinically relevant endpoints in EBC. Ultimately, these findings will inform policy, evidence-based
guidelines, and standard clinical care."
10800981,"The power systems for powered mobility devices (power wheelchairs and scooters) have largely remained
unchanged for decades. They all revolved around Lead-Acid batteries, but some more recently have started to
use Lithium-Ion batteries for their lighter weight and higher energy density. However, there are still limitations
to both of these current battery technologies related to charge rate, range, fire and explosion safety, and
environmental concerns.
Studies have shown that power wheelchair users travel can travel over 10 kms/day and that the distance
travelled is impacted by the accessibility of the environment and the type of activities in which the user is
participating. However, current battery technology largely restricts the power mobility device users to the
distance that the device can travel on a single charge, no matter how accessible the environment is. This is
because the current batteries used require 5-8 hours to recharge. Because of this, most power mobility device
users will charge their device overnight and then use the device the next day on that single charge. While this
appears to be sufficient for most users on most typical days, there are some underlying factors. Firstly, power
mobility device users have become familiar with the range that their device can go and have planned their days
around that range. Secondly, there are many times when power mobility device users may want to go farther
than they do on a typical day, such as vacations and other leisure activities (e.g., sporting events, tours,
concerts, etc.). Powered mobility device users have reported that they need to plan daily activities around the
distance that their chairs can go and at times have had to change plans based on the charge status of their
batteries. Powered mobility device users have also expressed a strong desire for more research on the
development of new and alternative power sources for powered mobility devices. This is primarily due to the
limited range and long charge times.
Nickel-Zinc batteries may provide many advantages over the current Lead-Acid batteries including: higher
energy and power density, higher cycle life, higher charge rate, more recyclable, safer, and less susceptibility to
extreme temperatures. Many of these characteristics are superior to Lithium-Ion batteries as well. The
limitation with the Nickel-Zinc batteries that are most similar to the Lead-Acid and Lithium-Ion batteries is
that they need to be discharged at a rate of more than 40 amps or their life-cycle is significantly reduced. This
makes them not suitable for a direct application in powered mobility devices as typical powered mobility
devices use 0-20 amps during use. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, can be repeatedly charged and
discharged at any rate for millions of cycles, but have low energy density (meaning they can’t hold much energy
in a small package).
The goal of this project is to develop a new power system for powered mobility devices using a combination of
Nickel-Zinc batteries and supercapacitors. The supercapacitors will be used to power the wheelchair motors
and actuators and the Nickel-Zinc batteries will be used to frequently recharge the supercapacitors (at a rate of
over 40 amps). This takes advantage of the higher energy of the Nickel-Zinc batteries while bypassing the
limitation of the need for high discharge rates. The development activities will include developing the battery
management system, which will trigger and control the transfer of energy from the Nickel-zinc batteries to the
supercapacitors. The new system will also be bench and laboratory tested for safety and performance viability.
The range that the new system will be able to travel will also be compared to the ranges of currently available
Lead-Acid and Lithium-Ion batteries using the ISO-7176 Section 4 range calculation, a flat test track, and a
community test track."

 Injuries to the growth plate (GP) remain a major cause of morbidity in children, often leading to angular
limb deformities and even complete growth arrest. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE), a transverse
Salter-Harris type 1 (SH1) fracture, where the spherical femoral head of the hip joint slips backwards off the
femoral neck, is a common and debilitating disorder, affecting the hip in children and adolescents and often
culminating in painful arthritis in adults. A vertical Salter Harris type 2-4 (SH2-4) fracture, in which the fissure
plane extends in the metaphysis or epiphysis, leads to an osseous bridge formation in lieu of cartilage, and
angular deformities. This highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent bone formation
at the injury site and to allow epiphyseal cartilage to resume growth. One avenue to promote local
cartilage repair, would be through mobilization of resident stem cells in response to injury. Current literature
describes the GP-RZ as a stem cell-rich region, which give rise to the GP appositionally. We recently
discovered that a population of FoxA2+ long-term stem cells (LTSSC) is located in the top compartment of the
RZ. FoxA2+LTSSC have higher longevity, clonogenicity, and are mutually exclusive with the previously
characterized PTHrP+ short-term stem cells (STSSC), located at the bottom of the RZ.
 A horizontal SH1 injury successfully heals with hyaline cartilage and involves the expansion of FoxA2+
LTSSC. A large vertical SH4 fracture heals through a ""bony bar"", while a small SH4 lesion heals with hyaline
cartilage. FoxA2+ LTSSC line the outside of a large SH4 wound, but infiltrate the small SH4 lesion. This
suggests other cell types (e.g osteoprogenitors) may create a physical barrier or a signaling niche, which
hinders FoxA2+ LTSSC healing of large defects. In both injuries, a transient pulse of TGFβ signaling, induced
in cartilage remnants at D1, precedes FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion at D3. This indicates a potential role for
TGFβ, in promoting FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion and differentiation into chondrogenic progeny, for cartilage
repair. These findings will allow us to investigate, for the first time, whether FoxA2+LTSSC contribute to GP
cartilage repair following SH1 and SH4 injuries.
 To test this premise, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if FoxA2+ cells can contribute
to the repair of a small SH4 lesion, but fail to contribute to the repair of a large SH4 lesion. In Aim 2, we will
determine if TGFβ signaling drives FoxA2+LTSSC migration and differentiation into progeny to accommodate
cartilage repair after SH1 injury. In Aim 3, we will determine if FoxA2+cells transplantation in a large SH4
lesion can prevent formation of a bony bar. Altogether, these results will provide a strong basis for
development of bioengineering strategies for GP cartilage regeneration."

This project seeks to develop the CAMERA (Context-Aware Multimodal Ecological Research
and Assessment) platform, a state-of-the-art open multimodal hardware/software system for
measuring human brain–behavior relationships. CAMERA will record neural, physiological,
behavioral, and environmental signals, as well as measurements from ecological momentary
assessments (EMAs), to develop a continuous high-resolution prediction of a person’s level of
anxiety and cognitive performance. CAMERA will provide a significant advance over current
methods for human behavioral measurement because it leverages the complementary features
of multimodal data sources and combines them with interpretable machine learning to predict
human behavior. A further distinctive aspect of CAMERA is that it incorporates context-aware,
adaptive EMA, where the timing of assessments depend on the subject’s physiology and
behavior to improve response rates and model learning. Our initial work on CAMERA focuses
on predicting anxiety state and concurrent memory performance, but the platform is flexible for
use in various domains.
Our work on CAMERA consists of two phases. First, in the R61 phase, we will develop the
CAMERA hardware/software framework, which includes methods for recording continuous
neural, physiologic, audiovisual, and smartphone-usage data (Aim 1) and synchronizing these
signals with intermittent EMAs (Aim 2). After demonstrating that CAMERA can successfully
combine multimodal features to predict a subject’s anxiety state and memory efficiency (Aim 3),
we will proceed to the R33 phase of the project. In the R33, we will use CAMERA in conjunction
with closed-loop neurostimulation to modulate the subject’s anxiety state and associated
memory performance (Aim 1), and to characterize the causal effect of modulation on neural,
physiologic, and behavioral biomarkers (Aim 2). Beyond our initial work in the domain of anxiety
and memory, we anticipate that CAMERA will have widespread impact by providing a general
platform for exploratory and hypothesis-driven research on various aspects of complex human
internal states, behavior, and cognition in real-world environments while minimizing burden on
subjects."
10806176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Based on genetic and cellular discoveries made in the PI lab and his collaborators, this proposal focuses on
novel mechanisms that are critical for formation of heart valves. Data presented in the proposal are an evolution
of our studies presented in the first round of funding and show that mutations in the DZIP1 gene cause a very
common heart valve disease (i.e., mitral valve prolapse) and can be caused by errors in how valve tissue forms
during development. These discoveries have led to a novel concept that cilia are involved in valve development.
While the function of DZIP1 is a focus of our studies in this proposal, we will also define new mechanisms by
which the cardiac valves establish a trilaminar ECM organization and how this can feed back to the cells to
suppress ciliogenesis in specific regions of the valve. Our studies will provide unique opportunities to answer
questions about heart-valve diseases that heretofore have been impossible to answer using even state-of-the-
art biological and genetic approaches.
Valvular heart disease is a serious clinical problem, affecting 5-7% of the human population. Its complications
include congestive heart failure, endocarditis, atrial arrhythmias, and sudden death. There are no known non-
surgical cures for this group of disease. The proposed work capitalizes on previously unrecognized genetic data
collected from heart valve disease patients; studies in the mouse show that this class of genes is an important
and previously unrecognized contributor to valve structural development and disease pathogenesis. The
uncovering of this particular disease gene and the processes it regulates holds great potential for future remedial
or therapeutic insight towards regeneration or formation of mechanically stable valve tissue that will be beneficial
to valvular heart disease patients."
10804462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than half of the elderly population suffer from age-related eye disorders that compromise their ability to
perform daily activities. Aging is a significant risk factor for such disorders, and dietary restriction (DR) is a
robust intervention that can slow aging and extend healthspan. Nutrient restriction increases circadian clock
amplitude, while overnutrition and obesity dampen circadian rhythms, increasing the risk of eye diseases.
However, the role of DR and circadian clocks in slowing age-related decline in visual function is not well
understood. Therefore, it is imperative to address this gap in the field. The goal of this proposal is to determine
the molecular mechanisms that slow age-related loss of the visual system, depending on aging and diet. We
hypothesize that DR enhances circadian clock gene expression, promoting photoreceptor homeostasis, and
modulating lifespan. Our recent circadian transcriptome profiling upon DR showed enhancement of genes
involved in photoreceptor homeostasis and delayed visual senescence. Prior results suggest that aging leads to
a gradual decline in circadian rhythms; however, DR can slow this decline. Inhibition of the circadian transcription
factor, clock (clk), accelerates the age-related decline in visual function, and photoreceptor degeneration results
in systemic inflammation and shortened lifespan, which DR protects against. We hypothesize that clk prevents
light-induced damage to the photoreceptors, thus supporting the 'escape the light hypothesis' for the evolution
of circadian clocks.
In this study, we aim to determine the cellular processes in photoreceptors that protect them from damage due
to age and diet, revealing novel targets for age-related eye diseases and associated morbidities. We propose
three specific aims to achieve this goal. First, we will determine downstream effectors of the core circadian clock
gene, clk, altering the age-related decline in visual system function upon modulation of diet and light. Second,
we will determine diet-dependent transcriptional networks of rhythmic phototransduction genes and their impact
on age-related changes in visual system function. Third, we will study fly orthologs of genes from our human
GWAS study that influence retinal eye aging for their interactions with diet, aging, and circadian clocks using the
fly. Expected outcomes of this study include delineating the diet and aging-dependent genes including circadian
transcriptional networks and their outputs involved in phototransduction homeostasis to mediate changes in
visual senescence in flies and humans. By determining cellular processes under circadian control in the
photoreceptor that protect it from damage due to age, diet, and light, this study will reveal novel genetic targets
and lifestyle interventions modulating the effect of diet and age on eye function, providing potential treatment
options for age-related eye diseases and associated morbidities."
10804463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death in Western
societies. Individuals with CAD are typically asymptomatic, with the first manifestations often being major
adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as MI, stroke, or sudden death due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic
plaque. However, despite the clinical significance of these thrombotic events, our understanding of the genetic
and molecular basis of MI remains incomplete. Furthermore, even though most patients with MI have CAD,
not all patients with CAD develop MI. This observation suggests that some of the mechanisms that predispose
to MI may be distinct from those that establish and promote atherosclerosis. This concept is supported by the
results of our recent multi-national genetics collaboration with >830,000 subjects, which identified several novel
loci that were associated specifically or more strongly with MI than CAD. Genomics and bioinformatic analyses
implicated SLC44A3 as the causal gene at a previously unrecognized MI-specific locus on chromosome 1p21.
In recent follow-up studies, we used a more direct comparative genetics strategy among CAD patients with and
without MI (CAD+/MI+ vs CAD+/MI-). These efforts revealed additional genetic factors that were strongly
associated with MI but not CAD itself, as well as provided confirmatory evidence for SLC44A3 being a novel
MI-specific locus. To our knowledge, SLC44A3 and the other newly identified loci represent the only genetic
factors that exhibit this MI-specific association pattern. However, independent replication, prioritization, and
functional validation of these observations is still required in order to classify their association signals as being
specific for MI and not CAD. Our overall hypothesis, which is supported by substantial preliminary data, is that
SLC44A3 and other newly identified positional candidate genes represent genetic risk factors that specifically
or more strongly predispose to MI than CAD per se. To validate this hypothesis, we propose a series of
integrative genetics, bioinformatics, and functional analyses in humans and mouse models. In Specific Aim 1,
we will comprehensively elucidate the genetic landscape of MI in patients with CAD through a combination of
large-scale meta-analyses and whole-exome rare variant analyses with multi-ancestry cohorts. Candidate
causal genes for MI among CAD patients will be prioritized through integration of robust bioinformatics, fine-
mapping, and functional genomics analyses. In Specific Aim 2, we will use a translational in vivo mouse model
of plaque rupture to experimentally validate Slc44a3 as an MI-specific susceptibility gene. Taken together, the
proposed studies will use innovative and complementary approaches to elucidate the genetic basis of MI
among CAD patients, provide functional validation of high probability candidate causal genes in mouse
models, and help prioritize novel targets for therapeutic development."
10931638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer mortality among men. The majority of these deaths
are due to resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). New generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) that target the AR signaling axis
have been used in the CRPC setting; however, the majority of patients still develop resistance. Recently,
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has become a promising target for positron-emission tomography
imaging (PSMA-PET) and targeted therapies, such as the recently FDA-approved radioligand (PSMA-RL) for
CRPC patients who progressed on ARSI treatment. Despite a survival benefit for PSMA-RL therapy, the
improved outcome is modest and only half the patients show favorable responses. The emergence of resistance
to ARSI and PSMA-RL may arise through changes in tumor phenotype, such as trans-differentiation from
prostate adenocarcinoma (ARPC) into treatment-related small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and
other phenotypes with loss of AR activity. Current methods require a biopsy to diagnose tumor histology, which
can be challenging due to invasive procedures accompanied by morbidity and some tumors are not accessible
or have poor sample quality. Furthermore, tumor heterogeneity is a major contributor to therapy resistance and
is particularly challenging to identify using a biopsy of a single metastatic site. These challenges exemplify major
limitations of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for men with CRPC.
 Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a non-
invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical
efforts have focused on the detection of genetic mutations from ctDNA sequencing as potential biomarkers;
however, these do not fully explain why treatments fail. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate
innovative methods for classifying aggressive CRPC genotypes and phenotypes from ctDNA, overcoming
challenges of tumor heterogeneity. The investigators hypothesize that ctDNA can be used to classify tumor
subtypes in CRPC and that this can be used to predict treatment outcomes. In Aim 1, they will study tumor
heterogeneity in men who have undergone rapid autopsy to evaluate the ctDNA classifiers for predicting
heterogeneous phenotypes from post-mortem plasma. In Aim 2, they will determine the utility of ctDNA for
predicting prostate cancer treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients treated with ARSI and a subset
of patients screened by PSMA-PET and treated with PSMA-RL therapy. They will evaluate the ctDNA classifiers
as biomarker tools to aid in the initial allocation of PSMA-RL therapy and inform early indications of treatment
resistance. In Aim 3, they will develop extensions to ctDNA methods that infer gene expression and tumor
aggressiveness in prostate cancer phenotypes using preclinical mouse PDX models, including in vivo
engineering of phenotype mixtures."
10802717,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are amongst the most functionally versatile biomolecules found in nature,
accomplishing diverse biological tasks including carrying genetic information (mRNA, viral genomes),
catalyzing reactions (rRNA, RNase P, telomerase, group I/II introns), acting as molecular adaptors
(tRNA), and regulating gene expression (riboswitches, lncRNA, miRNA). Alterations in the structure and
dynamics of RNA molecules are linked to bacterial pathogenesis, cardiovascular conditions, neurological
disorders, mitochondrial diseases, and cancers. Despite the biological importance of RNA, our
understanding of fundamental aspects of RNA structure, function and biochemical properties lags far
behind that of proteins. My research program studies how the structure and dynamics of mitochondrial
transfer RNAs (mt-tRNAs) impact their maturation and function. Our work will fill long-standing
knowledge gaps in RNA biology–including identifying molecular level consequences of disease causing
mt-tRNA mutations (Aim 3), establishing the impact of discrete tRNA post-transcriptional modifications
(Aims 1&2), and determining the high-resolution structures of a broad set of RNAs and the proteins
involved in their maturation (Aims 1-3). Additionally, we will develop broadly applicable chemical tools
for studying mitochondrial RNA biology (Aim 3). Our preliminary work suggests that mt-tRNAs have
unique structural and biophysical properties, are often more dynamic and unstable prior to processing and
modification, and, therefore, have unique maturation pathways. We posit that disease-causing mutations
destabilize mt-tRNA structure and alter its ability to be recognized as a substrate by processing and
modification enzymes, therefore affecting mt-tRNA biogenesis and therefore mitochondrial function. In
this work we propose a combination of biochemistry (kinetic and binding assays), structural biology
(Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography), innovative bio-analytical characterization (IM-MS), biophysical
tools (smFRET, NMR), chemical biology (high-throughput assays) and cellular biology to take on
questions regarding how mt-RNA structure and mt-PRORP function contribute to mitochondrial health
and pathology. These studies will reveal how tRNAs are recognized and processed by mt-PRORP and
help rationalize how patient-derived mt-tRNA mutations alter mt-tRNA stability and processing,
improving our understanding of fundamental aspects of mt-tRNA molecular biology and opening new
avenues of exploration into the role of mitochondrial post-transcriptional RNA modification in
mitochondrial diseases."
10802475,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains an incurable disease once progression to the metastatic castration-resistant
(mCRPC) state occurs; killing >30,000 U.S. men/yr. Unfortunately, each of the FDA-approved agents for mCRPC
produces only modest increases in overall survival followed by the emergence of a resistant and more aggressive
phenotype. Thus, there urgent unmet need for innovative therapies with novel mechanisms of action that allow
discrimination between normal and PCa cells.
 Herein, we put forward an innovative strategy to selectively exploit selective vulnerabilities in neuroendocrine
prostate cancer (NEPC), a highly aggressive variant of mCRPC with poor prognosis, using an orally-dosed and
highly specific lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, bomedemstat, in clinical development for unrelated
indications to maximize near-term patient benefit. The prevalence of NEPC is increasing in mCRPC patients
following prolonged treatment with potent androgen receptor (AR) axis-targeted therapies (e.g., abiraterone,
enzalutamide) as an adaptive mechanism of resistance. Comprehensive genome-scale analyses integrated with
pharmacogenomics pipelines will provide a rich mechanistic understanding of the genetic and epigenetic
features underlying the sensitivity differential between NEPC and AR+ prostate cancer (ARPC) subtypes to LSD1
inhibition (LSD1i). It should be noted that although NEPC is more sensitive, LSD1i also has significant activity
against ARPC tumors, which has important clinical implications for the growing number of advanced mCRPC
patients with heterogeneous lesions encompassing mixed molecular and pathological subtypes. LSD1-depedent
vulnerabilities are identified that will guide patient selection for a precision medicine approach. Additionally,
combination therapy targeting LSD1-induced synthetic lethal susceptibilities are rationally designed to provide
more potent and durable responses to extend the clinical utility of these well-tolerated clinically-tested agents
with favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.
 Our proposed work has both conceptual and technical innovations. We will 1) validate LSD1 as a target in
NE+ and AR+ tumors via comprehensive mechanistic interrogation using unique patient-derived xenograft and
organoid (PDX/O) models; 2) compare responders vs. non-responders across subtypes to inform patient
selection in future biomarker-driven clinical trials using state-of-the-art genome-wide profiling technologies; 3)
dissect the functional effects of LSD1i in advanced preclinical model systems using these same advanced
profiling strategies; 4) identify rational combination therapies based on LSD1i-induced synthetic lethal
vulnerabilities to produce durable responses using a high-throughput PDO screening platform; and 5) use
clinical-grade drugs to maximize near-term therapeutic potential against this highly aggressive lethal mCRPC
variant emerging as a resistance mechanism to standard-of-care therapies with increasing frequency."

Leukodystrophies (LD) are a group of rare genetic disorders preferentially affecting cerebral white matter (myelin)
in previously healthy children and is associated with extremely poor prognosis. Some subtypes of LD including
hypomyelinating (HLD) have high DNA diagnostic rate (70%) whereas more complex forms mostly remain
unsolved even after standard short-read genome sequencing (srGS). We hypothesize that complex genetic
variants such as repeat expansions and other structural variants (SVs) mapping to blind spots of srGS account
for missed molecular diagnoses in LD. We have shown that human genomes accessed by long-read GS using
PacBio Sequel IIe (HiFi-GS) can reveal small nucleotide variants (SNVs) in difficult-to-map regions, expansions,
and SVs throughout the genome. More specifically, using our large HiFi-GS dataset (N=1191 individuals)
developed for understanding pediatric rare disease in the context of the Genomic Answers for Kids (GA4K)
program, we showed that HiFi-GS yielded increased discovery rate with >4-fold more rare coding SVs than srGS.
Our goal here is to first utilize AI/ML assisted srGS analyses on LD cases to define 125 cases of unsolved LD.
Then, using the GA4K HiFi-GS resource as reference we will explore the utility of expanded long-read capabilities
(SV detection, methylation, personal haploid assemblies) to allow fine definition of underexplored genomic
features in unsolved pediatric LD. By studying contiguous haploid assemblies, we aim to provide full assessment
of maternal and paternal DNA even in complex repetitive regions of the genome. In parallel, we will study DNA
methylation signatures obtained by 5mC-HiFi-GS runs and establish function of variation in non-coding spaces
and indirect effects of repeat expansions. Finally, we will validate the findings in functional data (patient derived
induced pluripotent stem cells ,iPSCs) to systematically study impact in RNA and for a subset in myelination
(oligodendrocytes derived from iPSCs). We will also exploit zebrafish model organism to functionally study new
LD disease genes and variants in vivo. We anticipate that HiFi-GS platform combined with distinct clinical
endophenotype among rare neurological disease will maximize potential for discovering new mechanisms for
“vanishing white matter” and more generally accelerate the development of 3rd generation tools for unsolved
genetic disease."
10802756,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even before the onset of the COVID pandemic, adolescent depression has been increasing, and health dispar-
ities and disparities in access to treatment have continued to widen. Thus, there is a clear need for innovative,
accessible treatments for depressed adolescents, including treatments that do not rely on a limited pool of child
and adolescent health providers. Yoga-based interventions (YBIs) have shown promise for adult depression.
Several attractive aspects of yoga include its: 1) availability throughout the U.S.; 2) accessibility via online clas-
ses; 3) independence from an overburdened mental health care system; and 4) generalizability--yoga students
state that they use mindfulness and breathing practices to cope with stress in everyday life. Funded by a
NCCIH R34, we developed a YBI for depressed adolescents, and demonstrated that this in-person program
was acceptable and feasible in a small sample (n=11) of depressed adolescents as well as in a pilot RCT
(n=42) of YBI vs. an existing evidence-based treatment, group cognitive-behavioral therapy (gCBT). The RCT
classes were initially in-person, but we migrated to synchronous online classes due to COVID-19. In the RCT,
participants within each study arm showed decreased depression symptoms and increased self-compassion
over time. Most a priori feasibility and acceptability targets were met (e.g., recruitment, retention, expectancy,
satisfaction, credibility, attendance, and adherence). However, participants did not engage in home (outside-of-
class) practice at the targeted rate. Thus, in the present proposal we have modified our protocol to provide an
opportunity for twice-weekly supervised yoga practice (one in-person class on the weekend, and one virtual
class midweek). Our prior pilot trial was based at only one site (Providence RI) with one primary YBI instructor
and two gCBT leaders. Multiple sites and instructors/leaders, and recruitment of a more racially and ethnically
diverse sample, will be important to demonstrate generalizability and to enhance effectiveness. We now pro-
pose to conduct a two-phase multi-site feasibility trial. Phase 1 (n=20) will focus on increasing accessibility and
feasibility of YBI for particular groups of adolescents. We will conduct individual interviews with teens who were
less represented in our pilot trial (African-American/Black, Asian American, and male adolescents) to gain their
feedback on yoga based interventions, with a focus on increasing accessibility and feasibility for adolescents
with these identities. Phase 2 (n=128) will be a pilot RCT of YBI vs. gCBT at two geographically distinct sites:
Boston, MA and Columbus, OH. Given the rising prevalence of adolescent depression and the existence of
established, efficacious group treatment for depression (i.e., group CBT), we determined that a non-inferiority
trial represented the most ethical way to proceed. We will incorporate lessons learned from this study to further
refine study materials and create a template for onboarding multiple future sites. This project will prepare us to
conduct a multisite, adequately powered, non-inferiority RCT of YBI vs. gCBT in depressed adolescents."
10802961,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Across the state of Maryland, communities of color and low wealth populations are
differentially burdened by environmental hazards and the cumulative impacts of chemical and non-chemical
stressors and structural factors (including pathogenic infrastructure) that produce environmental health
disparities. This phenomenon is known as environmental injustice. To better identify and characterize
environmental justice (EJ) communities, the Center for Community Engagement, Environmental Justice, and
Health (CEEJH) has worked with its partners to develop Maryland Environmental Justice Screen (MD
EJSCREEN), an environmental justice screening and mapping (EJSM) tool. The current version of MD
EJSCREEN (3.0) has features similar to other national and state-screening tools including
CALENVIROSCREEN and USEPA EJSCREEN, and also some of the same gaps limitations. These gaps
include inadequate or missing indicators to capture factors such as economic justice, energy burdens, social
progress, vulnerability, resilience, distributive justice, and assessment of cumulative impact over time. EJSM
tools do not adequately account for the differential impacts of climate change on EJ communities. Additionally,
these tools fail to acknowledge and characterize the effects of structural racism and discrimination (SRD) –
particularly environmental racism – on exposures and cumulative impacts. Other limitations include outdated,
disaggregated data or data that exists at too coarse of a geographic level to identify communities experiencing
cumulative impacts and to micro-target interventions. This particularly relates to air quality data, with infrequent
data updates leading to non-representative characterization of air quality conditions and thus inaccurate
assessment of related cumulative impacts. Therefore, this MD EJSCREEN 4.0 proposal aims to close these
gaps through the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1: Apply novel monitoring and modeling approaches
to assess inequities in exposure to air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, PM1, O3, NO2) and health outcomes. Specific
Aim #2: Utilize advanced statistical analyses and iterative stakeholder engagement (focus groups and
interviews) to better characterize and capture drivers of environmental injustice and cumulative impacts within
MD EJSCREEN. Specific Aim #3: Assess the association between drivers of environmental injustice,
cumulative impacts, environmental health disparities through MD EJSCREEN 4.0 and MD EJSCREEN 3.0.
This MD EJSCREEN 4.0 project is aligned with the NIEHS's strategic plan to advance innovative development
of new measures, and validate and adapt existing measures and approaches to address exposome-related
factors that contribute to or exacerbate environmental health disparities. The proposed project is innovative
because we will include the use of mixed methods approaches, real-time air quality data, SRD measures,
climate indicators, and advanced biostatistical and geostatistical approaches in building MD EJSCREEN 4.0.
We expect that this updated tool to act as a model for other national and state-level EJSM tools."
10803341,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Normal retinal function and vision depends upon generation of multiple classes of retinal cells during
development. A central challenge is to define molecular mechanisms that enable a diversity of neurons and
glia to be generated from progenitors in correct proportions during development. Prior studies have shown that
progenitors undergo changes in competence to generate retinal cell types, but knowledge is incomplete
regarding factors that function to regulate temporal patterning of progenitors to drive changes in competence.
We thus hypothesize that Foxp1 functions as an early temporal transcription factor, and that temporally
regulated Foxp1 gene expression governs the formation of retinal cell types generated during early retinal
development, such as retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, cone photoreceptors and early-born amacrine
cells. To test this in developing mouse retina, we will use genetic approaches to achieve loss or gain of Foxp1
to: 1) Define Foxp1 targets and changes in chromatin accessibility, 2) Determine whether Foxp1 can reactivate
competence to generate early-born retinal cell types in late RPCs, and 3) Determine whether Dicer regulates
regulates temporal expression of Foxp1. This study will provide mechanistic insight into how Foxp1 functions in
progenitors to regulate the genesis of early-born retinal neurons, and may facilitate strategies to generate early
retinal cell types lost to disease or injury, such as retinal ganglion cells and cones."
10803729,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel mechanistic framework to understand how post-stroke
rehabilitative training modulates neural reorganization in sensorimotor brain regions, and whether such
reorganization is associated with recovery of motor function. In a non-human primate model of capsular stroke,
we will describe the time course of changes in task-related motor encoding and mesoscale cortico-cortical
connectivity that occur in sensorimotor brain regions, and the time course of these changes in relation to motor
recovery. These neurophysiological changes will be compared to those occurring in animals undergoing
intensive rehabilitation initiated in the sub-acute stage after injury. Post-stroke neural plasticity has been
demonstrated repeatedly in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Animal studies have provided key information
regarding the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and focal cortical stroke models have demonstrated
that alterations in neuronal connectivity are correlated with functional recovery. However, most studies are cross-
sectional and cannot address the complex temporal relationships between neural plasticity and behavioral
recovery; conclusions about the impact of rehabilitation on recovery mechanisms, and ultimately on clinical
recovery, are largely correlative. As a result, it is currently unknown whether plasticity mechanisms demonstrated
in most clinical and preclinical studies are associated with the initiation of recovery processes or are the result
of behavioral recovery. Further, when longitudinal studies in clinical populations have been done, relationships
between plasticity and motor recovery have been equivocal, in part because fMRI-based approaches lack the
temporal specificity to resolve the intricate patterns of communication among brain regions that are essential for
normal sensorimotor function. Using chronic microelectrode arrays in a longitudinal experimental design, we will
address three specific aims that examine neural activity (extracellular spikes) simultaneously recorded from
multiple cortical sensorimotor areas and motor thalamus before and after capsular infarct. This will allow us to
examine how stroke-like injuries disrupt task-related motor encoding in somatosensory and motor cortical areas
using traditional dynamical structure models (Aim 1). Further, we will characterize the impact of capsular infarcts
on mesoscale effective connectivity using a novel neurophysiological approach that we recently developed (Aim
2). Finally, we will determine whether rehabilitative training procedures initiated in the sub-acute period after
neural injury influence recovery by modulating task-related activity, altering effective connectivity, or both (Aim
3). The novelty and potential impact of this project stems from the unique longitudinal design, providing us with
the ability to plot the precise temporal profile of local and networked changes to determine if a particular
biomarker precedes rehabilitation-aided recovery, and thus, is more likely to have a direct causal relationship
with functional restoration. Achieving these goals ultimately will inform clinical studies aimed at personalizing
post-stroke rehabilitation based on neurophysiological biomarkers of recovery potential."
10785777,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 13% of pregnant individuals in the US experience depression perinatally (in pregnancy and/or up
to 1 year postpartum), making depression one of the largest contributors to maternal morbidity. Perinatal
depression is associated with adverse effects for both the perinatal person and their child. Risk of perinatal
depression is inequitably distributed, disproportionately impacting low-income, racial minority individuals and
those who have had adverse life experiences.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently endorsed counseling interventions as moderately
effective at preventing perinatal depression and recommended referral of all at-risk individuals to cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy. However, there remain significant barriers to accessing
facility-based interventions for at-risk individuals, including lack of financial resources, time, transportation,
or social support to attend in-person services. These barriers may be especially heightened in those individuals
at highest risk of perinatal depression.
Some access barriers may be overcome by using mobile technology to deliver evidence-based interventions
remotely. We previously developed and pilot-tested a digital group adaptation of the evidence-based CBT
intervention, the Mothers and Babies course. This digital intervention, named IMAGINE, was developed
based on formative input from perinatal individuals and their healthcare providers. IMAGINE is a manualized 10-
to 12-week intervention delivered to groups of 6-10 individuals, using asynchronous, interactive, multimedia
messaging and an optional weekly synchronous group video call. IMAGINE’s strengths include its fidelity to an
evidence-based intervention and inclusion of facilitator guidance and peer support to maximize efficacy.
In this pilot effectiveness trial application, we propose to engage a broad range of stakeholders including perinatal
individuals at risk of perinatal depression as well as service providers, administrators and payers to complete
the following specific aims. In Aim 1 we will use a human-centered design approach to refine IMAGINE and
prepare for its delivery as part of routine perinatal mental health services. We will then conduct a pilot randomized
trial to (Aim 2) obtain preliminary data on IMAGINE’s engagement of CBT mechanistic targets and effectiveness
in preventing perinatal depression, and (Aim 3) obtain preliminary data on implementation outcomes
(acceptability, appropriateness, usability, feasibility) and their drivers.
This proposal addresses an urgent need to improve access to evidence-based interventions to prevent
perinatal depression among those at highest risk. Completion of these aims will generate preliminary data,
study tools, and a participatory group of stakeholder advisers to enable pragmatic evaluation of IMAGINE’s
impact on perinatal mental health in a future R01."

Child maltreatment is among the most devastating of childhood adversities and increases vulnerability for
deleterious outcomes across a number of domains of functioning. However, not all who experience child
maltreatment develop problems and those with similar maltreatment experiences may show very different
outcomes. Differential biological embedding of maltreatment likely explains this heterogeneity in outcomes.
Epigenetics, or the processes that influence gene expression, are crucial to our understanding of how child
maltreatment influences later development. DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most well-studied epigenetic
mechanism and has been proposed to link early life experiences to alterations in gene expression and mental
health symptoms. Only a few studies have used a genome-wide approach to examine these associations and
importantly have shown different DNAm patterns for maltreated youth within genes linked with mental health,
but did not actually assess outcomes. No longitudinal investigations have tested genome-wide differences in
DNAm that emerge after maltreatment and predict the emergence of, or change in, mental health symptoms. A
relatively new measure of biological vulnerability, DNAm age, has emerged as an indicator of biological aging
that is associated with life stress and has initial support for predicting risk for poor mental health functioning.
Although maltreatment is linked with advanced biological aging using other indices (e.g., telomere length),
there have been no longitudinal studies testing the effect of maltreatment on DNAm age, nor testing DNAm
age as a mediator between maltreatment and later mental health symptoms. To address these gaps, we will
use an existing longitudinal sample of maltreated and comparison children (n=454) followed for 10 years with 4
waves of archived samples and a myriad of psychosocial data. This data is optimal to assess the timing of
maltreatment effects on genome-wide DNAm, DNAm patterns associated with subsequent mental health, and
the potential resolution of problematic DNAm patterns across adolescence (ages 9-23). This is an
unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on existing data from a well-designed longitudinal study of maltreated
youth with a matched comparison group, which allows us to separate maltreatment effects from other aspects
of early life stress and adversity, including neighborhood and socioeconomic factors. This study will contribute
important new evidence crucial to our understanding of how maltreatment affects genome-wide epigenetic
patterns of vulnerability that result in mental health problems. This will further the development of clinical risk
assessment and prevention approaches for maltreated youth which will be of substantial benefit to population
health."

The focus of this study is to identify meaningful genetic and genomic factors that predict cleft
outcomes in families in the African population, translate findings to other populations in order to
design strategies towards reducing the outcome and prevention of CLP. We plan to replicate
African GWAS significant loci in 1000 CL/P cases, 400 CP and 2000 controls by genotyping 172
single nucleotide polymorphisms. We also plan to conduct whole genome sequencing of 300
triads (proband with bilateral complete cleft lip and palate) and analyses whole genome
sequencing (WGS) data of 150 CL/P triads. Finally, we plan to determine the functional
consequences of GWAS non-coding variants by systematically testing SNPs with strongest
disease association. This study will be led by Dr Butali at the University of Iowa in collaboration
with Dr Cornell, Dr Murray and Dr Cao at the University of Iowa, Dr Adeyemo at the NHGRI and
Dr Taub at the John Hopkins University."

There are currently limited medicinal interventions demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute
severe non-autoimmune pancreatitis, a highly morbid and potentially fatal condition which is estimated to afflict
up to 275,000 patients annually in the US.[1] Early-stage mild pancreatitis often self-resolves; however 15-20%
of cases [2] progress to a severe form characterized by a potentially lethal systemic inflammatory response
syndrome with injury to multiple organs and (frequently) respiratory failure. Further clinical deterioration can lead
to necrotizing pancreatitis, which is clinically similar to sepsis and has a reported mortality of up to 30%. [3–6]
Although inflammation is known to be a key driver of disease progression, no anti-inflammatory therapy
investigated to date has shown sufficient efficacy to become part of routine clinical practice. Identification
of a viable medicinal therapy for severe acute pancreatitis thus remains a significant unmet need. In this
application, we propose this need can be met via early delivery of a short course of physiologic-dose
corticosteroids. This commonly used anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to provide a clear patient
benefit with other diseases which trigger systemic inflammation, multi-organ injury, and respiratory failure (e.g.
sepsis, Acute Respiratory Distress Disorder (ARDS), and most recently COVID-19), but has been poorly studied
in pancreatitis. The few published pilot trials of this therapy for severe acute pancreatitis have shown
corticosteroids shorten the duration of shock and may improve mortality, but these results must be validated in
a series of increasingly large, rigorous clinical trials before this therapy is widely accepted by clinicians. Here we
propose the logical first step Phase II trial: a blinded, randomized clinical trial of an early physiological dose
of hydrocortisone vs. placebo in 86 ICU patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The trial will be conducted
by the nationally recognized critical care research team at the Center for Resuscitation Science. We hypothesize
that corticosteroids will attenuate the inflammatory response from pancreatitis resulting in mitigated disease severity
and organ injury. We secondarily hypothesize there will be a concomitant reduction in mortality, though this hypothesis
will be the focus of a follow-up Phase III trial. After baseline assessments, enrollees will receive either 100 mgs of
hydrocortisone or matching placebo intravenously in a blinded fashion every 8 hours for 72 hours (300 mg/day).
The primary trial outcome will be the change in SOFA disease severity score over 72 hours, and from these data
we will conduct a novel sub-study to determine if corticosteroid efficacy is better in specific subgroups whose
clinical outcomes may be the most uncertain. Secondary outcomes will include progression to ARDS, ventilator-
free days, ICU- and hospital-free days, inflammatory biomarker profiles, biomarkers for pancreatic injury, and
adverse events. Overall, this study will provide an initial assessment of a commonly used, and effective anti-
inflammatory therapy as a treatment for a critical illness which generally lacks medicinal therapeutic options."

Hypertension (HTN) prevalence increases with aging and is a leading risk factor for several chronic illnesses
including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and several
cancers, as well as mortality. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEIs) are two of the most commonly prescribed anti-HTN classes, used by ~40 million US adults.
ARBs and ACEIs and have distinctive beneficial downstream effects on physiologic abnormalities in HTN,
including vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress, which in turn may result in different
long-term risks of ADRD and multimorbidity associated with aging. However, current HTN guidelines
recommend prescribing ARBs and ACEIs interchangeably due to presumed equivalent benefit and safety. Our
goal is to optimize initial anti-HTN medication prescribing by clarifying the optimal first choice RAS-blocker
between ARBs vs. ACEIs. Because ~23 million US adults are currently taking an ACEI and physiologic
evidence supports differences in downstream effects of these medications, even if ARBs are only 15% more
effective, the long-term population health impact of switching first-line RAS-blockade from ACEI to ARB would
be enormous. We will leverage data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Kaiser Permanente
Southern California (KP SoCal) to evaluate the effects of ARBs vs. ACEIs on the risk of ADRD, multimorbidity,
frailty, and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE; the amount of time one can expect to live accounting for
one's cumulative morbidity burden). The VHA and KP SoCal are ideal data sources to perform this research
because they include comprehensive healthcare information for >10 million patients, collect detailed
information on medication use and health outcomes, and have high patient retention with >10 years of follow-
up. The specific aims are to determine long-term comparative effects, including duration of use, of ARB- vs.
ACEI-based anti-HTN medication regimens on (Aim 1) the incidence of ADRD, CVD (stroke, myocardial
infarction, coronary revascularization, or heart failure), and cancers, separately and (Aim 2) the patient-
centered outcome of frailty and the population-centered outcome of HALE. We will use an active comparator,
new-user design accounting for medication adherence, as well as natural language processing to ascertain
ADRD more accurately in the electronic health record over using administrative codes alone. Our team is well-
suited to perform the study given considerable prior experience analyzing VHA and KP data, including
pharmacoepidemiologic analyses of anti-HTN medication use; assessment of ADRD, CVD incidence, cancer
incidence, and multimorbidity; and application of causal inference methods. Our project could support a
paradigm shift of first-choice RAS-blockade. Current projections indicate that ADRD will affect >115 million
people by 2050 and cancer incidence will be 27 million per year by 2040. The potential public health benefit of
addressing these knowledge gaps and, thereby, improving the quality and length of life is enormous."

More than 75% of suicide deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and almost 90% of
adolescents who die by suicide live in LMICs. Globally, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death for youth
aged 15-29. Six of the top 10 countries by suicide rates in the world are in the African region. Despite this, there
are few to no evidence-based youth suicide prevention packages specifically developed for, and tested in, the
African context. This is an urgent need to safeguard the well-being of youth and young adults globally.
 Data from our team suggest that 15-25% of high school students in Mozambique are experiencing current
suicidal ideation, ~40% of those with ideation have past month suicidal behavior, and 9% have had a lifetime
suicide attempt. To address this problem, we aim to test effectiveness and implementation outcomes for a novel
suicide prevention package organized around the Suicide Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) and a
Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Suicide Prevention (TCBT-S) to be delivered by
non-specialists in Mozambican secondary schools. We believe that these two evidence-based practices, both
with demonstrated feasibility in Mozambique, have the potential to be powerful interventions to prevent
adolescent suicidal behavior. Yet, a recent meta-analysis found lower comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and
suicidal behavior in LMICs (~50%) compared to high-income countries (~90%). Therefore, it is possible that
applying TCBT-S to address psychiatric symptoms may not lead to significant decreases in suicidal behavior
above and beyond SPI alone. Therefore, we aim to evaluate whether the gains in effectiveness for youth suicide
prevention justify the addition of a much more resource intensive TCBT-S versus the brief SPI alone. The present
study aims to fill this knowledge gap by testing the following specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of SPI and TCBT-S for decreasing suicidal behaviors. Using a three-
arm parallel cluster randomized trial we will randomize 7 secondary schools each to Enhanced Usual Care
(EUC), SPI alone, and TCBT-S (21 schools total) to evaluate effects on suicidal behaviors (primary) and suicidal
ideation/depressive symptoms (secondary). Exploratory analyses will examine mechanisms of intervention
effects. Specific Aim 2: Assess implementation outcomes, barriers, and facilitators to EUC, SPI, and TCBT-S
implementation using the RE-AIM evaluation and CFIR determinant frameworks. Specific Aim 3: Estimate the
costs and cost-effectiveness of SPI and TCBT-S compared to EUC.
In response to the NOSI for Youth Suicide in LMICs (NOT-MH-21-090), this project proposes to test
“prevention strategies to reduce suicide risk and promote resilience among young people aged 10-24 years in
LMICs”. Specifically, this study “integrates suicide prevention strategies within existing community-level
platforms such as school/university-based programs”. If effective, SPI or TCBT-S have a large potential to be
rapidly scaled up for youth mental health globally."

Children and adolescents exposed to tuberculosis (TB) in their homes (i.e. household contacts) are at high risk
for developing active TB disease if they do not receive TB preventive treatment (TPT). The management of child
and adolescent household contacts is hampered by the low sensitivity of bacteriological diagnostic tools and
limited accessibility of chest-x ray (CXR) in primary care settings of low- and middle-income countries. Primary
care physicians, who typically manage household contacts, will not prescribe TPT if they cannot decide whether
a contact has TB disease. There is a need for tools to help primary care physicians distinguish between child
and adolescent household contacts who require further evaluation for active TB disease and those who can
safely initiate TPT immediately. CXR is important for detecting incipient lesions of TB disease, but capacity for
CXR is limited in primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries. Even in those places where CXR
can be accessed, there is not enough capacity among primary care physicians to correctly interpret the
radiological findings. Our proposal will (1) derive a risk score to predict CXR abnormalities among child and
adolescent household contacts and (2) evaluate the performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) software
for detecting CXR abnormalities in children and adolescents contacts. The risk score, meant to aid clinicians in
places with limited CXR capacity, will be derived using data from a previous cohort study of 6001 contacts 0-19
years old. We will consider 21 candidate predictors that can be collected easily during a simple clinical evaluation.
Primary care physicians will be able to use this risk score to identify children and adolescents who should be
referred for further evaluation with CXR, and can prescribe TPT to the rest. For settings that have access to CXR
but where primary care physicians lack expertise in reading CXRs for TB, we will evaluate the performance of
three CAD software systems among children and adolescents: CAD4TB version 7 (Delft Imaging), qXR version
3.0 (qure.ai), and INSIGHT CXR version 3.1.0.0 (Lunit Inc). These systems have largely been validated in adults
but not children and younger adolescents. Using 1600 stored radiographs from a large-scale community
screening program, we will perform a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each CAD software using a
pulmonologist’s decision of CXR abnormality as the reference standard. We will compare performance among
systems and between children and adolescents. This research will contribute to the development of simple tools
that facilitate the clinical decision-making of primary care physicians to prescribe TPT. Increasing the prescription
of TPT to child and adolescent household contacts will reduce the incidence of TB and TB-associated mortality
among children and adolescents worldwide, helping to achieve the goals of End TB Strategy."

 Many neurobehavioral diseases affect females and males differently, and emerge at different
stages of life, leading to the conclusion that one sex is protected from diseases by inherent sex factors,
such as gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes. The sites and timing of these effects on brain
development are unknown. The method of high-throughput high-precision whole-brain MRI imaging has
the power to detect such changes with great sensitivity, in both animal models and humans. This
project will exploit these powerful methods to separate gonadal hormonal and sex chromosome effects
in the mouse model “Sex Chromosome Trisomy” (SCT), at 9 different ages of development, to discover
where and when these factors cause sex differences in brain development (Aim 1). The SCT model
compares mice with different numbers and types of sex chromosomes (XX, XY, XXY, XYY), each genotype
present in gonadal males or females. Then, a novel pipeline of analysis will compare mouse and human
brain development at many stages and in informative groups (differing by age, sex, hormonal status, and
sex chromosome complement) to determine which changes in mouse brain are also found in humans, in
specific brain regions related to different diseases (Aim 2). The analysis will point to changes in mouse
brain that model human brain development. These studies will also pinpoint new sex-biasing effects of
hormones and sex chromosomes at localized brain regions at specific developmental stages in mice,
leading to further investigation of cellular and molecular changes caused by sex at those sites (Aim 3).
Cellular effects (cell size, number, density of defined cell populations) of sex-biasing factors will be
measured using CLARITY (Clear Lipid-exchanged Acrylamide-hybridized Rigid Imaging-compatible Tissue-
hYdrogel). Gene pathways responding to hormonal and sex chromosome effects in individual cell types
in specific brain regions will be measured using single cell RNA-seq. These studies, combining high-
resolution neuroimaging, CLARITY, and single cell sequencing, will provide a foundation of concepts
about where in the brain, and when during development, specific cell populations respond to sex
factors, as a prelude for hypothesizing which sex differences underlie the protective effects of sex-
biased factors in cells."
10788300,"Using annual chest CTs to screen for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, can
reduce mortality by up to 20%; however, fewer than 4% of eligible Americans are screened. The US Preventive
Services Task Force endorses lung cancer screening (LCS) for high risk current and former smokers. At the
same time, LCS poses significant risks, such as false positives and invasive procedures. Accordingly,
guidelines recommend and Medicare requires that patients engage in a shared decision making visit prior to
screening. Unfortunately, primary care providers rarely discuss, and consequently patients rarely receive, LCS.
Patient, provider, and system barriers contribute to low LCS rates. Many patients are unaware that LCS exists,
that it is effective, or that they qualify for screening. The risks and benefits of LCS vary substantially according
to patients’ risk factors making general education about LCS difficult. Healthcare providers have poor
understanding of the screening criteria and lack the time and personalized information needed for shared
decision making discussions. Decision aids for LCS are a partial solution; they can increase patient
awareness, deliver personalized information, and help patients make a screening decision. However, they fail
to address many provider and system barriers. Our team has developed an innovative digital outreach strategy
called mPATH-Lung (mobile Patient Technology for Health – Lung) based on Social Ecological Theory and the
Integrative Model of Behavior. mPATH-Lung has multilevel functionality: it (a) queries the electronic health
record to identify potential screening candidates, (b) sends those individuals electronic invitations to visit a
web-based LCS decision aid that helps them make a screening decision concordant with their values, and (c)
empowers patients to electronically request an LCS clinic appointment for the mandated shared decision
making and subsequent screening. Electronic program summaries are sent to patients and providers, ensuring
shared decision making visits occur with informed participants. This project will determine the impact of
mPATH-Lung on patient decision making and receipt of LCS in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial using a
mixed methods design. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) Determine the effect of mPATH-Lung on
receipt of LCS in a pragmatic randomized-controlled trial of 1318 primary care patients in two large health
networks with a catchment area extending to 5 states; 2) Elucidate the drivers of patients’ LCS decisions and
screening behavior using a values clarification exercise and semi-structured interviews with at least 60 patients
selected to represent the spectrum of decision-behavior concordance; and 3) Explore implementation
outcomes that will impact the sustainability and dissemination of mPATH-Lung using program data, surveys,
and interviews. This project could decrease lung cancer morbidity and mortality by broadening the use of LCS
while simultaneously supporting patient-centered care. Importantly, our digital outreach design could have
broad applicability to other health conditions, expanding the impact of this proposal beyond LCS."

 Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury after perinatal asphyxia causes neurological disability,
morbidity, and even death in infants. To develop therapeutic strategies, we need a better
mechanistic understanding of the metabolic changes in cerebral tissue during IR and IR-driven
oxidative stress. IR-associated disruptions in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, amino acid and
nucleotide metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance
lead to oxidative stress and contribute to cerebral tissue injury. The initial acute injury occurs via
ROS elevation whose origin is not yet completely known. Recently, we found that oxygen
deprivation in the brain results in so-called reverse electron transfer in mitochondrial Complex I
leading to high ROS production and dissociation of its natural cofactor, flavin (FMN). The
oxygen deprivation also degrades amino acids and purine nucleotides, which causes
accumulation of ammonia. Ammonia increases ROS generation by dihydrolipoamide
dehydrogenase (DLD), a component of ketoacids dehydrogenases of Krebs cycle. This
contributes to a cell-type specific increase of ROS during reoxygenation and redox imbalance.
Our preliminary results prompt further study of this metabolic pathway in the brain IR.
 Our overarching objective is to determine the main contributors to redox balance of ROS
during brain IR. We hypothesize that ROS imbalance in brain IR is tissue-specific and involves
at least two metabolic mechanisms: 1) a ROS decrease due to mitochondrial FMN release, and
2) a ROS increase due to ammonia-dependent activation of TCA cycle DLD. We will use
advanced mass spectrometry imaging to determine the spatial distribution of small molecules in
brain sections obtained after IR for simultaneous visualization of various metabolites (Aim 1). In
Aim 2 we will establish the role of succinate and glycerol 3-phosphate-induced RET as
modulators of ROS production in brain using transgenic mouse model expressing alternative
oxidase. Mitochondria from these mice do not catalyze RET and do not produce ROS at the CxI
level. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the relative contribution of neurons and astrocytes to ammonia
accumulation and ROS balance. We will use freshly isolated, primary cultures of neurons and
astrocytes to analyze their ammonia-generating capabilities in response to lack of oxygen
 These new, unrecognized, and unexplored mechanisms for the regulation of ROS production
in IR explain published observations showing the transient peak of ROS during brain IR.
Knowledge of the molecular details and regulation of mitochondrial ROS production is vital to
clarify the fundamental principles behind brain IR injury."

 The devastating effects of illicit substance use during pregnancy on mothers and children is widespread,
affecting more than 500,000 births between 2017 and 2018. Adverse birth outcomes can include fetal growth
restriction, neonatal abstinence syndrome, prematurity, and death. Illicit drug use during pregnancy puts
women at risk of activities that expose them to sexually transmitted infections and legal consequences
including loss of child custody and incarceration. Long-term negative consequences for children exposed to
substances in-utero range from growing up in an environment where one or both parents have substance use
disorders (SUD) to increased risk of depression, developing SUD themselves, and suffering from abuse.
 While the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommends reproductive planning education be
incorporated into SUD treatment programs, interventions have primarily focused on increasing access to birth
control and treatment strategies for women already pregnant. A proactive approach to address substance use
prior to pregnancy, in the preconception period, is needed. Preconception interventions that address alcohol
and tobacco cessation have been found effective. However, to our knowledge, there are no interventions to
address preconception illicit substance use. The prevalence of SUD among women in jail is as high as 63%
and this population is at risk of both drug relapse and pregnancy after release. There is an optimal period of
time (prior to release) when preconception SUD interventions are feasible and ideal for this population. Using a
proactive approach for women in jail and before pregnancy will reduce the risk of substance exposed
pregnancies (SEPs) and mitigate the numerous negative consequences for mothers, newborns, and families.
 The proposed study will be the first to adapt an evidence-based preconception intervention, CHOICES, for
use among incarcerated women with illicit SUD. CHOICES was developed to reduce the risk of alcohol-
exposed pregnancies by targeting both risky drinking and effective contraceptive use.1 The proposed study will
adapt CHOICES for use among incarcerated women with illicit SUD who are at risk for an SEP when they are
released. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) adapt CHOICES for use among incarcerated women with
illicit drug-related SUD to create a manualized intervention, CHOICES-PLEAS (Pregnancy Liberated from
Exposure to Alcohol and Substances) and (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CHOICES-
PLEAS at reducing the risk of SEPs (continued drug abstinence and/or reduction in risky sexual behavior)
among women in a court-mandated SUD treatment program.
 Through completion of these aims and additional training in behavioral intervention design, advanced
statistical methods, and SUD treatment for reproductive-age women, the trainee, Dr. Bello, will gain the
expertise necessary to be an independent investigator. Her long-term goal is to establish herself as an
independent investigator with expertise in addressing the reproductive health needs of women with SUD."

Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term

She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis
of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at
Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level
coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep

it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging,
machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The
mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and
Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will
provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research:
This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc
photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies
neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output
provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease
according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In
Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs
acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability
of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In
Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening
teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL
algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold
standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application
of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology."

Exposure to alcohol during gestation can lead to a constellation of mild to severe cognitive and behavioral
deficits referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), having a US prevalence as high as ~4.8%.
Although clinical studies on long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are sparse, high
prevalence of substance use (e.g., alcohol, opioids) is observed in adult FASD populations which may stem
from aberrant neuroimmune interactions following exposure to alcohol or opioids. This proposal examines
whether PAE induces susceptibility to neuroimmune dysfunction following opioid pain therapy in animal
models. In PAE animal models, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is observed. Our recent work in animal models suggest that
PAE is a risk factor for developing CNS pathology such as pathological pain (allodynia) through the actions of
spinal astrocyte and macrophage activation by their release of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). A
critical innate immune receptor underlying increased IL-1β and TNF-α is Toll Like Receptor (TLR4), that upon
its activation, produces downstream NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and consequent IL-1β. Curiously,
morphine, a standard pain therapeutic acting on the μ-opioid receptor, also activates proinflammatory TLR4
signaling resulting in opponent processes; µ-opioid cellular actions to blunt pain and immune TLR4 cellular
actions that cause pain. Consequently, higher doses of morphine may be required to achieve pain alleviation in
some populations. Based on this background, we speculate that PAE may generate biological vulnerability to
CNS pathology by sensitizing TLR4 responses to endogenous factors and morphine that readily interact with
TLR4. Thus, one goal of this proposal is to identify if morphine treatment in mice unmasks the insidious effects
of PAE on neuroimmune function resulting in chronic CNS pathological consequences. Preliminary data show
morphine exposure paradoxically prolongs the course of allodynia in minor nerve-injured adult PAE mice. The
potential convergence of PAE and opioid-induced TLR4 actions is entirely unexplored. Therefore, our
hypothesis is: PAE primes the TLR4-NLRP3-IL-1β pathway that is unmasked by endogenous pain-enhancing
factors and morphine interacting with TLR4 resulting in chronic pathological neuroimmune function. The Aims
of the proposal will determine if : (I) PAE augments morphine-mediated TLR4 &/or NLRP3 activation in minor
nerve-injured mice causing prolonged allodynia, (II) PAE sensitizes the effects of morphine on TLR4/NLRP3
responses in spinal astrocytes and peripheral macrophages, and (III) the contribution of non-coding circ-Vopp1
dysregulation in PAE-primed TLR4 signaling in response to morphine. Results will provide new evidence for
PAE as a risk factor for adverse opioid responses and will identify novel targets to mitigate the risk of
neuroimmune dysfunction from adverse TLR4 actions in individuals with FASD."

 Phototransduction is a fundamental biological process involving a set of biochemical reactions in
photoreceptor cells initiating vision. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying the biochemical events in phototransduction under normal and diseased states.
Rhodopsin and cone opsins are the light receptors in photoreceptors cells that initiate vision upon stimulation
by light. The primary focus here is on rhodopsin structure, function and dysfunction. Rhodopsin plays a central
role in phototransduction as the initiator of signaling and also plays an important role in maintaining the health
of photoreceptor cells. The rhodopsin gene is a hot spot for mutations causing inherited retinal diseases such
as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), which currently have no cure or
effective treatment. Rhodopsin is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor and therefore findings here can
provide insights on other members of this superfamily of proteins that share commonalities in structure and
mechanisms of action. Despite the wealth of knowledge available for rhodopsin, gaps in our structural and
molecular understanding of the receptor still exist and a mechanistic description on the effect of mutations in
the light receptor causing vision disorders is incomplete. Less is known about the structure, function, and
dysfunction of cone opsins, a secondary focus here in one aim. Three aspects of rhodopsin structure and
function will be examined in this proposal. Opsins must adopt a proper three-dimensional structure for proper
function in photoreceptor cells. In aim 1, the misfolding and aggregation of a set of mutants that cause RP and
a mutant in a cone opsin causing blue cone monochromacy will be characterized, and the resulting
consequences in the retina of mouse models examined. Rhodopsin forms a supramolecular structure at its site
of action in the rod outer segment of photoreceptor cells to carry out its function under scotopic conditions. In
aim 2, the dynamics of this supramolecular structure will be visualized and the impact of diseased states on
this membrane organization will be examined. The structure of rhodopsin is finely tuned to prevent activation of
the receptor in the absence of light stimulation. Constitutive activity of rhodopsin can lead to a variety of
phenotypes causing CSNB or RP. In aim 3, the molecular origin of the different phenotypes caused by
mutations causing constitutive activity in rhodopsin will be examined. The proposal combines the study of a
variety of genetically modified mice with innovative biophysical and biochemical methods to answer questions
raised in each aim. Results from our studies will lead to a more accurate mechanistic framework to understand
the function of the system under normal conditions and dysfunctions in inherited retinal diseases, which will
provide new avenues for scientific inquiry. The long-term impact in studying fundamental aspects of rhodopsin

To understand mental health and disease, we need to understand the function of the brain at the level
of genes, gene regulatory networks, neurons, circuit structure, and physiology. Drosophila has
emerged as one of the most powerful model systems for these questions, given the range of tools and
the tractability of analyzing complex behaviors at all these levels. This proposal seeks to understand
Drosophila reproductive behaviors. One reason Drosophila is such a powerful system is that the sex-
specific master regulatory transcription factors that direct reproductive behaviors are known. This has
provided a powerful molecular inroad into identifying and manipulating the neurons that underlie these
behaviors. These tools can also be used to perform neuron-specific mutational studies to discover the
functions of genes that direct behaviors, which leverages one of the biggest strengths of the Drosophila
model system. In addition, this system affords an unparalleled model to both examine the sex-specific
development of these neurons and how they are modified by adult experiences. Research using the
Drosophila model has continued to uncover biologically important processes that have informed on
human health and disease, including studies of the nervous system and behavior. The work will build
off of my laboratories 15-year NIGMS funded research program. We will continue to address these
behavioral questions using cutting-edge molecular-genetic, genomic, proteomic, behavioral and
microscopy tools to gain insights into complex behaviors."

Changes in the healthcare delivery system brought about nationally by the Affordable Care Act and the Mental
Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act have expanded substance use disorder (SUD) treatment beyond
specialty care, and integrated it into primary care and acute care medical settings where SUD prevalence rates
are high. There is an increased need for future research to develop and test the effectiveness of SUD
interventions implemented in healthcare settings and linked to specialty SUD treatment programs. The NIDA
National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) has prioritized this need, as it faces an opioid
epidemic, resurgence of methamphetamine, and co-occurring substance use and mental health and physical
disorders. In order to contribute to the CTN's expanded objectives and research priorities, the Pacific
Northwest (PNW) Node proposes the following Specific Aims: (1) Increase the capacity of the PNW Node
research team by adding investigators with demonstrated practical and research expertise addressing opioid
use dependence, other substances of abuse, co-use of substances, implementation of novel behavioral and
pharmacological treatments, primary care practice-based research networks, collaborative care models,
integration of behavioral health and SUD treatment components into primary and acute care settings, and
harmonizing electronic medical record systems across multiple health care systems; (2) Expand the scope,
population, diversity, and focus of the PNW Node’s roster of research, clinical practice, and dissemination
settings by including a number of large state-wide and regional practice-based primary care clinical and
research networks involved in integrated behavioral health collaborative care; (3) Design and conduct
pragmatic, comparative effectiveness, registry, and other types of innovative studies, informed bidirectionally
by SUD researchers, clinicians, primary and acute care providers, and enhanced by use of electronic health
records (EHRs), that implement and evaluate integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatments for illicit-
and misused prescription opioids, methamphetamine, and alcohol; (4) Provide information dissemination,
training and technical assistance to affiliated health care and SUD providers, researchers, and the public about
opioid use disorders, other SUDs, collaborative care and chronic disease management models, the integration
process, and linkage between primary care and specialty SUD programs through the CTN National
Dissemination Library, the Northwest Addiction Technology Transfer Center, the UW Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Institute, the WSU Rural Mental Health and Substance Abuse Center of Excellence, and the Center for Rural
Opioid Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery."
10792485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the inner workings of the cochlea are responsible for the most fundamental aspects of hearing, including hearing
sensitivity and frequency tuning, our direct knowledge of human cochlear mechanics is limited. This lack of information
has forced researchers to rely on animal experiments to make inferences about cochlear behavior in humans, under the
assumption that the motions of the cochlear partition (CP), including the basilar membrane (BM) and the organ of Corti
(OoC), are similar between humans and laboratory animals. However, we have recently found surprising differences in
human CP anatomy and motion as compared to laboratory animals. The BM in animals is attached to a narrow fixed bony
structure, the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), and accounts for almost all of the CP motion. In contrast, the OSL in humans
is much wider, is mobile, and connects to the BM via a newly identified soft-tissue structure that we have named the CP
“bridge”. The bridge, which is non-existent in laboratory animals, is as wide as and vibrates as much as the BM.
Combined with the fact that the OSL itself is mobile, the BM therefore only accounts for a fraction of total CP motion in
humans. These newly discovered aspects of human CP anatomy and motion challenge the long-held assumption that
cochlear mechanics can be regarded as similar across mammals.
 Because CP structures such as the OSL, bridge, and location where the tectorial membrane (TM) attaches to the
limbus are all mobile in humans but not in laboratory animals, we hypothesize that the motions of the OoC structures,
including the reticular lamina and TM, are different in humans, thereby altering the input driving the transduction process
at the hair bundles of the inner and outer hair cells. To test this, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will allow us to
determine the anatomy and relative motion of various CP structures in situ in very fresh human cadaveric specimens. We
will also investigate and elucidate the relationships between mechanics and anatomy in the human CP using a variety of
techniques to characterize the morphometry, structural architecture, and material composition of the CP.
 We will further test our hypothesis by developing finite-element models of the human cochlea that incorporate the
measured anatomy and CP mechanics. As our measurements are from postmortem ears, they cannot reveal the effects of
active processes. However, our models can approximate active behavior based on live-animal results, which are predicted
to be functionally similar to human given the similar anatomies of these structures. The resulting models will be tested
and validated against known human tuning capabilities from psychoacoustic data, opening the door to future applications
in which human cochlear pathologies, manipulations, and treatments can be simulated with unprecedented fidelity.
 This research will greatly advance our understanding of how the structures of the human CP work together to define
the inputs to the transducers formed by the hair cells. It will also enable us to better understand the applicability and
limitations of animal experiments in the study of human hearing, and to better utilize animal models for scientific inquiry.
Moreover, the proposed computational models will be valuable both for scientific investigation of hearing phenomena and
for future improvements in the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of hearing disease."

 The long-term goals of this project are to establish germline stem cell (GSC)-based gene editing to
generate large animal models of human diseases and for regenerative medicine (PAR-16-093), and to provide
accessible systems to study the GSC niche in non-rodent animals. The testis stem cell is unique; it is the only
cell type in an adult male that divides and contributes genes to future generations, making it an ideal target for
genetic modification. Pigs are important models for pre-clinical research because they are phylogenetically and
physiologically more similar to humans than rodents. Gene editing through GSCs rather than embryos will
shorten the time necessary to produce germline gene edited animal models. It is also more broadly applicable
to disease models where gene dosage and epigenetics have a role and smaller strains of pigs are required. The
aims of this renewal project are 1) to establish a culture system that promotes porcine germ cell expansion
in vitro; 2) to explore the role of testicular somatic cells in formation of a functional GSC niche; and 3) to
develop a precise approach for targeted gene editing in porcine GSCs. While germline transmission of a
genetic modification is possible with transplantation of primary pGSCs, efficiency of the approach would benefit
from a robust in vitro system for expansion of edited cells prior to transplantation. To accomplish this goal, we
will define the metabolic phenotype of pGSCs to inform design of appropriate culture conditions. Grafting to
mouse hosts and transplantation to recipient pigs will monitor the ability of cultured cells to support
spermatogenesis as functional endpoint. Germ cell function is controlled by interaction with the niche
microenvironment. Our novel testicular organoid system and xenografting of testis cells will enable introduction
of cell type-specific modifications and characterize stem cell-niche interactions. We will test the hypothesis that
primary cilia on testicular somatic cells are essential for niche formation, and that the somatic environment
modulates germ cell differentiation and supports germ lineage differentiation of porcine induced pluripotent stem
cells (piPSCs). Finally, we will test the hypothesis that CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated
homology directed repair (HDR) will allow efficient targeted genome editing in GSCs for precise replication of
human disease alleles. As HDR is limited to small DNA alterations (~1-50 bp), we will also explore Precise
Integration into Target Chromosome (PITCh) for targeted gene editing to enable introduction of large transgenes
and/or humanizing parts of the pig genome for regenerative medicine. Introduction of a mutant porcine insulin
gene (INSC94Y) that matches the human INSC96Y mutation present in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus will
provide proof-of-principle that our novel strategies are feasible and efficient. Overall, this work will establish
precise targeted germline gene editing in pigs, and further define stem cell-niche interactions."

Adolescent overweight/obesity affects (AOB) 14 million adolescents in the United States, increasing their risk
of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Unfortunately, adolescents show suboptimal response
to behavioral pediatric obesity interventions, with a modal weight loss of less than one BMI point. One potential
explanation is that standard behavioral interventions do not target the key mechanisms of AOB. One such
mechanism of AOB not adequately targeted by existing interventions is sleep disturbance, which refers to too
little, poor quality, poorly timed, or inconsistent sleep, which affects over 80% of adolescents with obesity.
Recent models posit that sleep disturbance produces aberrations in decision-making that result in excess
energy intake. As per the candidate’s K23 award, these aberrations in decision-making drive engagement in
problematic eating behaviors that result in excess weight gain, and likely, poorer response to standard
behavioral obesity interventions. Integrating behavioral sleep interventions with AOB interventions is
compelling for three reasons: (1) the strong theoretical and empirical links of sleep disturbance with poor
weight outcomes, (2) the high rates of sleep disturbance in adolescents, and (3) the fact that behavioral sleep
interventions are amongst the most effective of any psychological treatment. Yet, few studies have attempted
to formally integrate behavioral sleep interventions in treatment for obesity in youth, and none have done so in
adolescents. An intervention that is a particularly good fit is the evidence-based Transdiagnostic Sleep and
Circadian Intervention (TSCI), which is designed specifically to address the sleep challenges faced by
adolescents (e.g., school schedules, screen time, social needs). In the current study, we will develop, refine
and test a 16-session group lifestyle modification (LM) intervention for AOB augmented with TSCI (i.e.,
LM+Sleep). In Phase I, we will develop the LM+Sleep manual and pilot the intervention in an initial set of
adolescents (n=10). We will collect feedback from adolescents, parents, and clinicians, which will inform
manual refinements. In Phase II, we will complete an open trial (n=40) of the refined LM+Sleep manual. We
will recruit adolescents (ages 14-18) with overweight or obesity who endorse at least 1 type of sleep
disturbance. Assessments of sleep (via sleep diaries and accelerometry), decision-making, problematic eating
behaviors, and weight will occur at baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 6), and post-treatment (week 12).
Our primary aims are to (1) Create and refine an LM+Sleep manual; (2) Estimate the effects of LM+Sleep on
weight loss, sleep, decision-making, and eating behaviors/dietary intake; and (3) Examine whether changes in
sleep and decision-making are associated with weight loss outcomes. This R03 award, in concert with Dr.
Manasse’s K23, will provide ideal pilot data for a fully-powered R01 trial testing the efficacy of LM+Sleep vs LM
alone and accelerate the candidate’s trajectory into her independent research career."
10788831,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapeutics targeting the central nervous system (CNS) have a less than 10% likelihood of approval through
the entire clinical trial process. This very low approval rating is a significant problem for both pharmaceutical
companies (lost investment) and patients (fewer advanced treatment options), and it has often been tied to the
difficulty of penetrating the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). It is generally reported that 98% of small molecules and all
macromolecules and proteins are prevented from crossing the BBB. As a result, several key strategies have
been developed in order to increase the likelihood of CNS entry. These range from chemical modification to
increase lipophilicity (e.g. esterification), modulating the physical properties of the BBB, and to mimicking or
conjugating to non-specific transporter substrates (e.g. nutrients such as sugars or amino acids). While these
methods have shown promise in some cases, they all have significant drawbacks including a potential loss of
activity, significant or severe side effects, and a lack of BBB targeting specificity resulting in possible systemic
side effects, respectively. A fourth and more specific approach has therefore been developed, in which specific
receptors on the BBB are targeted. One notable example has been the use of the transferrin receptor (TfR),
which is responsible for iron uptake and transport. Conjugation of drugs such as chemotherapeutics to TfR
targeting agents has been demonstrated to significantly increase CNS uptake and tumor targeting. However,
targeting TfR, can also result in significant off-target localization and toxicity as it has been found with other
widely distributed receptors (e.g. insulin receptor).
 We have therefore devised a new modification strategy by which large macromolecules and proteins may
be modified to target the α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) in order to efficiently cross
the BBB. Our preliminary data demonstrates that through our modification strategy, we could successfully alter
enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) without affecting its fluorescent properties and without degrading its
stability. Furthermore, this fluorescent acetylcholine receptor binding eGFP (FARB, Swiss German for color)
localizes in primary neuronal cells through α7nAChR, is non-toxic, and localizes in mice brains (preliminary data).
 In this project, we therefore seek to confirm the efficiency of our FARB protein in crossing the BBB in vivo
with both wild-type and α7nAChR knockout mice. This will be accomplished by tracking the distribution and
fluorescent signals from both FARB and eGFP over time with an IVIS imaging system and then quantifying the
concentration of both proteins in major organs (brain, heart, lungs, etc.), blood, and urine at various time points.
Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of brain slices will allow us to determine the brain region(s) that are most
targeted by FARB. Completing this project will demonstrate a new modification strategy that may be used to
significantly increase the efficiency with which the CNS can be targeted by macromolecules and/or proteins."

Brain tumors are the most common form of cancer in children between 0-19 years of age in the United States,
and are the largest cause of cancer-related deaths. Our long term goal is to improve the outcomes of children
diagnosed with brain tumors by characterizing the germline and somatic events driving tumorigenesis so that
rational, evidence-based therapies can be developed. Our objective here is to perform an integrative germline-
tumor analysis of the Gabriela Miller Kids First (GMKF) X01 CA267587 pediatric brain tumor cohort to identify
both inherited and de novo pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P-LP) genetic variants that may be exploitable for
subtyping, risk prediction, and/or therapeutic intervention. Data from the GMKF cohort will be combined with
extant sequencing data from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA) to yield 3,849 germline DNA and 4,438
tumor DNA/RNA sequences. The combined cohort spans seventeen broad histologies and includes robustly-
annotated patient-parent triads/dyads (n=771). Our central hypothesis is that both inherited and de novo P-LP
germline variants influence the initiation and progression of pediatric brain tumors. Here, we will test our
hypothesis and accomplish our objective in two specific aims: Aim 1) Identify and assess heritability of rare
P-LP variants in pediatric brain tumor triads and dyads. Rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion-
deletions (INDELS) will be investigated through a well-developed computational pipeline. Pathogenicity will be
assessed using our American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)-guided approach. Triad/dyads will be studied
to assess whether variants are inherited or acquired de novo. Rare variant burden testing will be performed
through comparison to multiple cancer-free cohorts. Clinical and tumor-biological correlative studies and survival
analyses will be undertaken. Aim 2) Perform integrative tumor-normal analyses to elucidate functional
relevance of germline P-LP variants. Somatic second hits at the gene and pathway level will be assessed for
the entire cohort (N=2,558). Next, using pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) as a model, an expanded integrative
in silico evaluation of recurrent or aggregate germline events using matched tumor DNA and RNA sequencing
will be performed (N=367 pHGGs). Germline copy number variants (CNVs) will be identified and heritability
assessed. Tumor sequencing data will be processed through OpenPBTA somatic workflows designed to
evaluate SNV, INDELS, structural variants (SVs), and mutational signatures in DNA and account for expression
profiles, isoforms, fusions and other novel transcripts in RNA. Through integration of the X01 CA267587 pediatric
brain tumor cohort with extant childhood cancer and structural birth defect data, we expect to advance our
understanding of the genetic basis of a diverse array of pediatric brain tumors, with insights here being applicable
to the genetic basis of other childhood conditions. Moreover, we will address, for the first time, whether pediatric
brain tumor genetic risk factors are inherited or acquired de novo. Completion of this project will have a sustained
and positive impact on the field by identifying clinically actionable genetic alterations in these important cancers."

 Telomeres are evolutionarily conserved protein-DNA complexes at the physical ends of
linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres shorten with age in most human somatic cells, and
their initial length pre-determines cellular lifespan. Mutations in telomere maintenance genes
lead to cancer, premature aging and a number of age-related disorders. While mean telomere
length in humans shows considerable inter-individual variation and appears to be under strong
genetic control, the exact nature of factors establishing telomere length set point remains
elusive. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we previously identified several candidate
genes underlying natural telomere length variation in this species. In this proposal, we will utilize
genetic, genomic, biochemical and epigenetic approaches to explore their functions in telomere
length control and other major cellular processes, and to gain an evolutionary perspective on
functional gene pleiotropy. In Aim 1, we will explore several hypotheses for direct and indirect
roles of Arabidopsis TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in
establishing natural telomere length polymorphism across Arabidopsis genotypes. We will also
employ powerful Arabidopsis genomic and transcriptomic tools to identify and characterize TERT
trans-regulators and uncover novel factors underlying natural variation in telomerase enzyme
activity levels across multiple Arabidopsis genotypes. Through a series of genetic
complementation experiments with Arabidopsis telomere length mutants, experiments in Aim 2
will address the nature and extent of functional redundancies between telomere biology,
ribosome biogenesis and chromatin assembly, and establish the blueprint for dissecting
telomeric versus non-telomeric roles of identified genes. Additionally, in Aim 2 we will utilize
several innovative genomic and epigenetic approaches to identify and validate additional
candidate genes involved in telomere length control. Overall, the results of this study are
expected to significantly increase our understanding of genetic differences underlying telomere
length polymorphism in natural Arabidopsis populations. Because modes of telomere regulation
are highly conserved, our data may also provide novel insight into the molecular basis for
different rates of aging and predisposition to human diseases associated with telomere length
abnormalities."

Suicide is a major public health concern. Globally, over 700,000 people die of suicide each year. It is the 4th
leading cause of death among youth throughout the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently set
a goal to reduce global suicides by 1/3rd by 2030. One major area of opportunity is within low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), where over 77% of all suicides occur. Throughout the world, health systems have
begun implementing prevention and intervention approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness to reduce
suicide in numerous studies. This collection of evidence-based approaches make-up the Zero Suicide (ZS)
model, which has now penetrated the national health systems in >20 countries worldwide along with hundreds
of United States (US) health systems. Despite this success, this full model may be challenging to implement in
LMICs due to limited mental health infrastructures. However, several studies support the effectiveness of brief,
pragmatic approaches that may be adapted and implemented in LMICs. Nepal, a small country in South Asia,
serves as an optimal location to adapt and test these suicide prevention approaches. The suicide rate in Nepal
is more than double the US rate, and young people are disproportionately affected. In October 2022, a
National Suicide Prevention Symposium was cohosted by the Nepalese Government Ministry of Health and
Population, the GTA Foundation, and Henry Ford Health. In the meeting, youth were identified as the highest
priority sub-population. There was consensus that very little suicide prevention is being implemented, but there
was clear support for new research and program implementation. The established research and community
partnership between Henry Ford Health and the GTA Foundation in Nepal provides an ideal infrastructure to
learn from stakeholders about the feasibility of suicide prevention approaches and how best to implement them
in Nepal. The overall goal of the proposed R21 project is to work in partnership with stakeholders to develop
implementation strategies for adopting suicide prevention approaches among youth in Nepal. The specific aims
are to 1) Examine the feasibility of evidence-based suicide prevention approaches for youth in Nepal via
stakeholder surveys and interviews, and 2) Develop and evaluate implementation strategies for prevention and
intervention among youth at risk for suicide through a multi-step process informed by focus groups with key
stakeholders. Stakeholders will include national and local government leaders, community organization staff,
administrators and clinicians at hospitals and health clinics, school personnel, parents and youth. The
proposed project will generate data to inform a future hybrid trial of the proposed implementation strategies
and the design of a national suicide prevention strategy in Nepal."

 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have driven a revolution in the treatment of breast cancer; however, the
long-term benefits on patients are still heterogeneous. ADCs induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells,
leading to anticancer immunity, and this plays a key role in antitumor response of ADCs. Therapy-induced
anticancer immunity is often limited by immunosuppressive mechanisms posed by the tumor microenvironment
(TME). Treatment of breast cancer cells with trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1), an ADC, causes extracellular
ATP release, which initiates the recruitment of innate immune cells and in the priming of anti‐tumor immunity.
However, extracellular ATP in the TME is quickly degraded into immunosuppressive adenosine via the concerted
enzymatic activities of CD39 and CD73, dampening anticancer immunity. We hypothesize that ATP-responsive
delivery of CD39/CD73 inhibitors with boronic acid (BA)-containing nanoparticles enables complementation of
ADCs’ actions and the NP delivery, leading to synergistic anticancer actions at two levels. Firstly, cancer-
targeting ADCs generate ATP to trigger the release of CD39/CD73 inhibitors from the NPs only in tumor sites,
preventing off-target effects in normal tissues. Thereafter, the released enzyme inhibitors prevent conversion of
ATP to Ado, enhancing and prolonging the immunogenic actions by ADCs, leading to durable tumor response.
We have prepared BA-containing nanoparticles for ATP-responsive drug delivery. CD39 inhibitor ARL67156
(ARL), a nucleotide analogue, is loaded to the nanoparticles through the interaction with BA. The nucleotide drug
can be released from the nanoparticles through replacement with ATP and other nucleotides. In preliminary
studies, treatment of breast cancer cells with T-DM1 followed by NP-ARL increased extracellular ATP
concentration and reduced the presence of adenosine. Combination therapy with T-DM1 and NP-ARL in
EO711/HER2-bearing mice remodeled the TME into an immunostimulatory landscape. This change of immune
landscape led to excellent immune-medicated tumor response in this syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer.
In this proposal, we will explore the mechanisms for immune activation produced by ATP-responsive drug
delivery, and will then enhance anticancer activity of our approach for providing an effective and safe therapy of
HER2-low breast cancer. This project can be directly translated into a novel cancer immunotherapy treating BC
that is aggressive and highly immune heterogeneous. Studies of this project will test the feasibility of using BA-
based nanoparticles as a new delivery system for drug targeting, and thus will open a new research horizon for
delivery of nucleotide/nucleoside drugs that can treat various diseases."

Black Americans are over six times more likely to experience an assault-related firearm injury compared to
White Americans. Thus, while a White American is admitted to the hospital due to firearm assault every 2 days,
a Black American is admitted every 9 hours. Residential segregation, vacant and abandoned properties,
neighborhood walkability, and green space access represent key place-based community features of the urban
environment that contribute to Black Americans’ elevated gun violence exposure. However, existing research
has relied on regression-based statistical techniques focused on the independent, variable-centered
relationships that these features share with firearm violence. There is a critical need for a comprehensive
examination of the joint effects of these place-based features that utilizes a place-centered technique. Such a
technique will reveal how these place-based community features interact to create neighborhood profiles that
position Black Americans for gun violence exposure. The proposed project will utilize latent profile analysis – a
place-centered, latent variable classification technique – to fill this knowledge gap using existing data on the N
= 1644 populated census blocks from the City of Syracuse, NY. Data will be obtained from several sources
including the US Decennial Census (residential segregation, neighborhood walkability), the City of Syracuse
(vacant and abandoned properties, green space access), the Central New York Crime Analysis Center (firearm
fatalities), and the State University of New York Upstate Medical Center (non-fatal firearm injuries). These data
will be linked at the census block level to complete the following aims: 1) To assess how residential
segregation, vacant and abandoned properties, neighborhood walkability, and green space access combine to
form distinct neighborhood profiles; 2) To determine how different neighborhood profiles characterized by
unique combinations of these place-based community features display different levels of firearm violence
(firearm fatalities and non-fatal firearm injuries). Collectively, these aims will advance our overall objective to
further precision public health efforts that more effectively reduce Black Americans’ firearm violence exposure.
This will be achieved by informing policy and prevention strategies that are tailored to the pattern of place-
based features defining those neighborhoods that confer the greatest gun violence exposure risk. The project’s
focus on the influences of the sociocultural and physical environment on Black Americans’ firearm violence
exposure embeds it within NIMHD’s research framework and directly addresses NIMHD’s interest in
understanding the antecedents of violence in health disparity populations (NOT-MD-18-006)."

The increased incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders highlights the need for improved
therapeutics to treat these diseases. Our work places RIPK1 kinase at the apex of inflammatory pathways
where it regulates a form of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3 and
MLKL. In the work proposed, we will delineate novel necroptosis pathways important in autoimmunity and
immune-mediated liver injury operative in autoimmune and viral hepatitis.
We demonstrate that mice with a dendritic cell RIPK1-deficiency (Ripk1DC KO) develop inflammation and
autoimmunity; unexpectedly revealing that RIPK1 restrains necroptosis in dendritic cells (DC) in contrast to
it well established role as an initiator of necroptosis. During development, RIPK1 prevents necroptosis
mediated by the nucleic acid sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) leading us to hypothesize that ZBP1-
mediated dendritic cell necroptosis breaks tolerance and induces autoimmunity. We will test this hypothesis
in Aim 1 by determining whether a ZBP1-deficiency prevents inflammation and autoimmunity in Ripk1DC KO
mice. We will identify the nucleic acid species bound to ZBP1 and will establish whether nucleic acid binding
is required to induce inflammation and/or autoimmunity. Nucleic acids in the Z-form are known to be highly
immunogenic and anti-Z-DNA autoantibodies occur in lupus patients; therefore, we will test genetically
whether inhibiting ZBP1 or necroptosis ameliorates disease in other autoimmune prone mice. In Aim 2, we
will investigate whether RIPK1-kinase-dependent necroptosis contributes to a mouse model of autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH) induced by the plant lectin Concanavalin A (Con A). Based on our preliminary data in
reciprocal hematopoietic chimeras we hypothesize that AIH is mediated by canonical necroptosis in
hematopoietic cells and noncanonical necroptosis in hepatocytes. Consistent with increased RIPK1 and
MLKL expression in the livers of AIH patients, our preliminary data implicate RIPK1 and MLKL but not
RIPK3 in hepatocyte cell death, leading us to hypothesize that a novel RIPK3 independent necroptosis
pathway is induced in hepatocytes. Going forward we will test this hypothesis rigorously by generating mice
that express kinase inactive RIPK1D138N or delete Ripk3 or Mlkl specifically in liver parenchymal cells. An
additional goal will be to delineate this non-canonical necroptosis pathway, by identifying the RIPK1-
interacting kinase responsible for MLKL activation in hepatocytes and to assess its contribution to AIH.
Successful completion of these Aims will elucidate the contribution(s) of these new necroptosis pathways

The New England Regional Biosafety Laboratory (NERBL) was established in 2008 to: (1) ensure that
research and tasks in response to pathogens of pandemic potential and other emerging infections (PPP/EI) are
safely, efficiently, and rigorously accomplished; (2) serve as a regional resource for academic and industry
partners engaged in activities that yield knowledge and medical countermeasures to PPP/EI; and (3) be ready
to serve as directed by NIH/NIAID and their federal partners. A critical function of the NERBL includes the
development and continuous improvement of specialized research functions unique to BSL3/ABSL3,
particularly those focused on pathogens with human impact. At Tufts, existing expertise and knowledge
bridges several areas of emphasis including bacteriology (tuberculosis [Mtb]), virology (influenza), and vector-
pathogen interactions (eastern equine and Powassan encephalitis, tularemia). Building upon these
fundamental capacities, the primary goal of Core 3 is to optimize and expand BSL3/ABSL3 resources
and services for academic, industry and federal researchers to address both regional and national
needs. Additionally, Core 3 will provide research services, training, and expertise across the larger Regional
Biocontainment Laboratories network while also developing, validating and distributing standard operating
procedures for conducting BSL3/ABSL3 research. To accomplish this, we will optimize core capacities for Mtb
research, optimize core capacities for influenza research, enhance expertise in vector-pathogen interaction
research, and grow core competencies through the larger RBL Network partnership. This work is supported
by a set of team members with several key skills necessary for undertaking studies that involve Mtb, influenza,
and tick-borne disease, including: 1) propagation and isolation of pathogens; 2) use of several experimental
animal model system including tick challenge models; 3) application of medical countermeasure screening; 4)
use of various aerobiology methodologies; 5) assessment of immunologic biomarkers/outcomes associated
with infectious agents; and 6) integration of pathology and genomic data, including spatial
transcriptomics/proteomics. Together, completion of these specific aims will strengthen the overall RBL
collaborative with respect to collective expertise and capacities necessary for robust PPP/EI responsiveness,
and provide a toolbox of resources for the larger infectious disease research community."
10804683,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of most human
genes. The broad importance of APA is well exemplified by the altered expression of NUDT21, a key APA
regulator that we reported in the first cycle of this grant, in diseases such as glioblastoma, diopathic pulmonary
fibrosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders. More recently, our work has revealed a novel mechanism by which 3ʹ-
UTR shortening can repress tumor suppressor genes (e.g., PTEN) in trans by disrupting competing
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) crosstalk, rather than by inducing oncogenes in cis. Aside from these few
examples, the prevalence and functions of APA in a wide spectrum of human traits and diseases remain
largely unknown. Most human traits/diseases have been found as associated with hundreds of thousands of
noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in numerous genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
However, functional interpretation of these SNPs remains a significant challenge because GWAS data do not
show how the SNPs work. To better understand their effects, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have
been widely used to link GWAS SNPs to gene expression. Despite massive efforts on elucidating eQTLs, the
functions of many GWAS SNPs remain unexplained. An important reason is that eQTLs do not consider APA
regulation. We have recently constructed the first human 3′UTR APA quantitative trait loci (3′aQTLs), which
contain ~0.4 million SNPs associated with APA of target genes, using ~8,000 GTEx v7 RNA-seq samples
across 46 tissue types (Nature Genetics, accepted in 2021). These 3′aQTLs can explain ~16.1% of GWAS
SNPs in 15 common traits/diseases, and they are largely distinct from eQTLs and splicing QTLs. Based on
these exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that computational and experimental modeling of APA will
substantially facilitate the interpretation of numerous GWAS SNPs important for APA regulation, which are
enriched in 3′UTRs and gene downstream regions. Hence, we propose to develop innovative bioinformatics
and experimental methods for identifying 3′aQTLs and nominating APA-linked disease/trait susceptibility genes
in a wide variety of cell types and environmental factors, followed by in vivo functional characterization using
our unique CRISPR engineering system. We expect to establish APA as an emerging and important molecular
phenotype to explain a large fraction of GWAS risk SNPs, leading to significant novel biological insights into
the genetic basis of APA and APA-linked susceptibility genes in a wide spectrum of human traits and diseases."

 Aberrant splicing is a major mechanism leading to the progression of cancer, and newly emerging
experimental and computational approaches reveal a critically important, high-resolution view of the
heterogeneity of cancer to most directly pinpoint biomarkers, drug targets, and neoantigens for
immunotherapies. Current gene-targeted cancer therapies are primarily hampered by the extreme
genetic heterogeneity observed across patient populations. “One gene, one function, one disease” model
cannot reconcile with the complexity that different mutations of the same gene often lead to different
phenotypes. A recent pan-cancer characterization of aberrant splicing we conducted revealed thousands
of potential driver mutations that alter the activity of splice regulatory regions and their target protein
isoforms. In the recent past, genome and exome sequencing projects have identified thousands of
genetic mutations in cancer patients, including somatic and germline mutations. To date, most literature
has focused on studying mutations that affect the encoded protein amino acid sequence. Recent
evidence has emerged to indicate possible functions of “silent” mutations, which act to deregulate
alternative splicing, leading to production of aberrant levels or identities of distinct protein isoforms.
 Here we propose a set of innovative, broadly applicable technologies to systematically link silent
cancer mutations to splicing events and the functional impacts of their consequent protein isoforms.
Specifically we will pursue the following two aims: (1) SysMap-Splice: An integrated systems approach
coupled with long-read sequencing to discover and characterize full-length protein isoform drivers in
cancer; and (2) Can-IsoPPI: An enhanced platform to investigate full-length splice isoform-mediated PPI
rewiring in cancer, based on affinity purification-mass spectrometry. Together, our integrative approach
is both innovative and significant, because it will provide insights in prioritizing cancer-causing genotypes
that have a direct impact on protein isoform expression of a patient, a critical step towards isoform-
resolved personalized precision medicine, drug targets, and neoantigen discovery.

10799287,"A critical aspect of social cognition is the ability to infer emotion based upon facial expression, termed face
emotion recognition (FER). We have recently shown that FER deficits in schizophrenia (Sz) and autism
disorder spectrum (ASD) are associated with impaired activation and resting-state functional connectivity
within early visual regions and between early visual cortex and pulvinar nucleus (PuN) of the thalamus.
Furthermore, we have shown that these deficits interrelate with impaired generation of alpha-frequency
oscillations, which are known to mediate PuN-cortical connectivity. At present, tools for modulation of
oscillatory activity within deep structures are limited. In this project, we will implement a non-invasive deep
brain stimulation technique termed transcranial Interference Stimulation (tIS) to directly modulate the
oscillatory activity of PuN and to understand and modify temporal dynamics of FER and social/affective
function across healthy volunteers (HV) and Sz. tIS differs from more traditional transcranial electrical
stimulation (tES) approaches such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in that it uses two
separate high-frequency (>1 kHz) carriers to introduce transcranial energy, and then create physiological-
range responses at the point where the two carriers intersect, corresponding to the beat frequency between
them. Here, we will use carriers that differ by 8-12 Hz (depending on the individual's alpha frequency peak),
permitting modulation of alpha-frequency interactions between PuN and visual cortex. The study will consist of
two specific aims. Under Aim 1, we will evaluate the effects of escalating tIS intensities and repeated dosing
on dynamic pulvino-cortical interaction effects on face-emotion processes in HV using concurrent task-EEG
recording and tIS, along with the target- and frequency-specificity of the effect. We will use a FER task in
which we previously reported visual sensory and FER differential patterns of PuN dysfunction and related
oscillatory disturbance across Sz and ASD and task-related EEG modulations during tIS stimulation will be
assessed. MRS read-outs will be used to assess tissue-level safety. Under Aim 2, we will conduct an RCT of
5d repeated tIS in Sz to assess its ability to correct ongoing deficits in alpha-frequency modulation during face
processing, as well as its behavioral effects on FER. In accordance with the goals of the U01 mechanism, this
project represents a collaborative partnership with Soterix Medical, Inc, which is developing tIS for clinical
use, serves as IDE sponsor and will provide the device and personalized, “exhaustive search” tIS field
modeling routines for this project. The project will collect target-engagement, safety, tolerability and efficacy
data needed to “de-risk” continued tIS development, while also evaluating critical mechanisms underlying
early visual processing and FER deficits in Sz. Novel features include personalized, fMRI-based native-space
targeting, simultaneous tIS and EEG, and FDA IDE-approved MRS-based safety measures. If successful, this
will permit future controlled studies to evaluate effects to ameliorate neuro- and social cognitive deficits across
neuropsychiatric disorders."
10806177,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder is an urgent public health crisis in the U.S. and roughly 30% of Americans prescribed opioids
misuse their medications. The overwhelming reason people with opioid use disorder continue taking opioids is
to avoid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal is physically painful and emotionally exhausting. Despite the inherently
chronic relapsing nature of drug abuse and withdrawal, studies of how long-term opioid use alters the aversion
circuits of the brain are surprisingly limited compared to those studying the reward circuits. Dysfunction of
mesolimbic circuits, which includes the ventral pallidum (VP) and its downstream targets, has been implicated
in a wide range of substance abuse disorders, including opioid use disorder, but it is not known how opioid use-
induced adaptations arise in these brain areas. One hypothesis is that withdrawal from chronic use of opioids
may prompt adaptations in aversion-processing circuits that generate a higher sensitivity to aversive stimuli and
mediate the general negative affective state associated with withdrawal; thus leading to increased stress and
subsequent relapse. The VP is especially well-positioned to mediate adaptations of aversion circuits in opioid
use disorder. VP neurons receive input from reward and aversion encoding structures and modulate aversion
centers of the brain, a primary output being the lateral habenula (LHb). Furthermore, a recently discovered subset
of VP neurons (VPGlu) has been shown to encode aversion in reward-related contexts. In this proposal, I plan to
use a multi-faceted approach to investigate opioid use-induced adaptations of LHb-projecting VP (VPGluLHb)
neurons in mice. I hypothesize that VPGlu neurons are hyperactive and more responsive to noxious stimuli in
protracted opioid withdrawal, and that opioid withdrawal potentiates transmission at VPGluLHb synapses.
Lastly, I expect that VPGlu neuronal activity confers sensitivity to negative outcomes and that this response is
heighted following opioid withdrawal. I propose to test each of these hypotheses in specific aims using in vivo
and ex vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavioral techniques to evaluate VPGluLHb activity and
plasticity as potential mechanisms underlying enhanced sensitivity to aversive outcomes and events. Successful
completion of these aims will inform future therapeutic interventions to treat the negative affective state of opioid
withdrawal to allow for successful treatment of opioid use disorder."
10806178,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perception of rewards is highly dependent on the exact reward seeking context. This suggests that discrete
elements of the context may directly influence reward subjective value via multisensory integration, which is
important because higher-value rewards can drive increased reward learning and seeking. An understanding of
how multimodal stimuli modulate reward subjective value and inform reward learning is incomplete without
determining how and where these stimuli are processed in the brain. Ensembles in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
have been previously reported to be co-responsive to unique taste/smell pairs, but the stability of this
representation over time and direct connection to primary sensory input has not been assessed. The purpose of
this project is to determine how multisensory integration of discrete environmental stimuli paired with primary
rewards impacts associative learning for reward seeking and to gain a functional understanding of multisensory
encoding in the OFC at the single cell level. It is vital to first address this question with natural reward circuitry
to gain a full understanding of the basic neurobiology that is maladapted during addiction. As such, this project
will utilize a tastant reward and an environmental olfactory stimulus, a combination that has previously been
reported to enhance tastant value in human studies. I hypothesize that multisensory integration of environmental
stimuli and rewards will increase reward subjective value, expedite the rate of associative learning, and enhance
reward seeking. Additionally, I predict that the same OFC ensembles will be consistently activated to
multisensory, reward-relevant stimuli and that this activity utilizes direct input from primary sensory cortices.
In this project, Aim 1 will address how the multimodal integration of environmental stimuli (odor) with a primary
reward (tastant) impacts the rate of learning for reward seeking in a single-day learning task, while assessing
reward value using a novel palatability metric. Aim 2 will address the stability and direct connection to primary
sensory input of ensembles in the OFC for the multimodal taste/smell stimulus using simultaneous two-photon
calcium imaging and optogenetics. Together, these aims will establish the contribution of the integration of
discrete environmental stimuli with cued reward to drive learning for reward seeking and provide an
understanding of the neural circuitry that may underlie this phenomenon. The results of this project will lay a vital
groundwork for future projects to assess how the circuitry that integrates discrete environmental and reward
stimuli is coopted during addiction to perpetuate drug seeking during addiction and relapse."

18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT imaging has become an essential tool for guiding and adapting
treatments for lymphoma. However, the PET evaluation criteria currently used for assessing lymphoma, which
consists of subjective visual scoring on a 5-point scale, is suboptimal. The visual scores suffer from high inter-
observer variability and have low prognostic power for new emerging biological therapies. Quantitative PET
metrics have been shown to be more predictive of clinical outcomes than visual scores, but quantitative analysis
of whole-body PET/CT images is prohibitively time-consuming and impractical in routine clinical care.
Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in automating the quantitative analysis of baseline FDG PET/CT images,
but comprehensive evaluation of interim-therapy and post-therapy images using DL has proven difficult. Residual
lymphoma has low-level uptake, which can be hard to differentiate from physiologic or treatment-related uptake,
and reading physicians must use clinical histories and baseline PET images (i.e., sites of initial disease) to make
reliable diagnoses. DL algorithms, on the other hand, only operate on cross-sectional images and are unable to
account for historical context.
Our objective is to develop DL algorithms that operate on PET/CT images from more than one time point so that
algorithms can learn longitudinal dependencies for contextually-aware predictions. We also aim to develop
multimodal vision-language models that can simultaneously interpret radiology text reports while performing
PET/CT image analysis. These models can leverage critical information about patient history and physician
interpretation when processing retrospective images. Furthermore, we will use semi-supervised learning to
leverage both unlabeled datasets and labeled datasets. Our overall goal is to develop contextually-aware
algorithms for automated longitudinal analysis of whole-body PET/CT images in lymphoma. These tools will be
developed using diverse datasets from multiple institutions. PET metrics measured by DL will be validated as
predictive markers of outcome using data from a Phase 3 clinical trial."
10803420,"This application is for competitive renewal of funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to cover
two waves of full data collection – wave 12 (2025/26) and wave 13 (2027/28), together with a 3rd administration
of the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP). ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began
in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), with the remaining funding coming from
UK Government Departments. The central aim is to provide a nationally representative population research
platform for studying the dynamic relationships between socioeconomic position, mental and physical health,
cognitive function (including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias), economic and social circumstances and
well-being, as people move from work to retirement and into older age.
 This application is centered around key scientific issues relevant to population aging, with a particular focus
on AD/ADRD and research that can enhance understanding of healthy aging in the USA through comparisons
with HRS. These issues include the rising prevalence of AD/ADRD, changing work patterns, digital inclusion, the
experience of older ethnic minority men and women, the impact of COVID-19 and long-COVID, the increase in
unpaid informal caregiving, climate change, and the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial
factors. The new data needed to tackle these issues will be linked with existing waves, while innovations in
methodology and linkage to multiple registry data will increase the value of the study for researchers worldwide
while lowering costs and reducing participant burden.
 The specific objectives of the new proposal are:
1. Add new content related to the evolving issues in healthy aging, while maintaining core content from previous
 waves on economics, social participation, cognitive function and dementia, health, biomarkers, genetics,
 social care, social prescribing, subjective well-being, and psychosocial factors.
2. Interview approximately 10,544 respondents in wave 12 and 10,890 in wave 13, with biomedical and physical
 performance data collection from all respondents in wave 13.
3. Administer HCAP to 2,000 participants in 2028, to provide a third comprehensive assessment of cognition
 and AD/ADRD risk that can be related to the HRS and cognitive function in the full sample.
4. Introduce web-first survey methods backed by face-to-face and telephone assessments.
5. Continue to oversample ethnic minorities in the refreshment samples to increase minority representation.
6. Carry out objective assessments of physical activity and sleep (accelerometry) and hearing in Wave 13.
7. Create linkage with health care records, pollution and housing quality data, and financial registry data.
8. Construct 13 waves of accessible and well-documented panel data, increasing accessibility and liaising with
 HRS, the Gateway and sister aging studies in other countries to maximize international use of ELSA."
10803477,"Frailty is a complex clinical condition that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and high risk for
mortality in older adults. Identifying biological mechanisms that protect from frailty is an important step in the
development of effective therapies that protect from and delay frailty. Aging is a major risk factor for frailty; thus,
studying biological mechanisms and populations that delay aging may lead to the identification of molecular
factors that can protect from frailty. The biological approaches thus far have mainly focused on descriptive
phenotypes, such as inflammatory plasma profile and candidate gene approaches, looking for risk factors for
frailty. It is apparent, however, that frailty is a complex syndrome, akin to other complex disorders; thus, simplistic
approaches that focus on one genetic variant or inflammatory biomarker at a time are unlikely to yield satisfactory
progress. Moreover, to date, few attempts have been made to identify protective biological components of
resilience to frailty. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts who will tackle these barriers
by applying state-of-the-art multi-omics approach to test the hypothesis that unique genomic, epigenomic and
proteomic profiles, which are enriched among families with exceptional longevity, are associated with resilience
to frailty. Frailty resilience will be quantified using a newly devised and validated measure, the Frailty Resilience
Score (FRS), that incorporates the complex biology of frailty by integrating genetic risk in the form of frailty-
specific polygenic risk score (PRS), age, and sex. The FRS will be studied in the context of a multi-omics
approach to identify the genomic (Aim 1), epigenomic (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) components that protect
from frailty. Whole exome sequencing and SNP arrays will be used to identify gene variants and gene sets
associated with frailty resilience (Aim 1). DNA methylation across 935,000 CpG sites will be used for epigenomic
discovery (Aim 2) and approximately 5,000 plasma proteins for the proteomic discovery (Aim 3) of resilience
markers and pathways. Additionally, integration of proteomics with genomics and epigenomics will be performed
to identify common mechanisms and pathways of frailty resilience. These approaches will be applied to a
longitudinal cohort of older adults (n=1,400; mean age 76, median follow-up 9 years) from the ongoing LonGenity
study, who are annually evaluated with frailty measures, have banked DNA, and whose samples have already
been subjected to WES, and proteomic analysis. This unique cohort is (1) enriched with protective genes, as
half of them are offspring of centenarians and is (2) relatively homogeneous genetically, as all subjects are from
an Ashkenazi Jewish founder population, a feature that increases the power for genetic and biological discovery.
This multi-omics approach has the potential to both expand our understanding of biology and result in discovery
of biomarkers for frailty resilience. Understanding the biologic mechanisms that protect from multi-system failure
in older adults is a first step in generating interventions against frailty; while identification of biomarkers will inform
us, in the short-term, of the effectiveness of interventions that aim to delay aging and frailty."
10803626,"Project Summary
The vitamin K cycle supports blood coagulation, bone mineralization, and vascular calcium homeostasis. The
activity of vitamin-K-dependent proteins (e.g., coagulation factors) is regulated by the γ-carboxylase, GGCX.
Epoxidation of vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) drives catalysis of GGCX and is regenerated by vitamin K epoxide
reductase (VKOR) with the assistance of a VKORL paralog and FSP1. VKOR is targeted by warfarin, a widely
used oral anticoagulant whose overdose often leads to severe bleeding. Due to poor mechanistic understandings,
modulation of the vitamin K cycle to improve anticoagulation therapy has not been explored. In addition, FSP1
regulates ferroptosis by producing KH2, which also affords potent protection against lipid peroxidation. However,
the roles of vitamin K reductases in coagulation and ferroptosis, which are linked to numerous cardiovascular
disorders, are unclear. Further, the mechanisms of the tightly regulated GGCX catalysis remain elusive. Thus,
there is a need to establish a deeper understanding of the entire vitamin K cycle and the biology underlying blood
coagulation so new therapeutic strategies can be developed for thromboembolic and cardiovascular diseases.
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the physiological process of the entire vitamin K cycle and the underlying
mechanisms. The objective of this renewal application is to modulate the redox state of VKOR to regulate
anticoagulation, elucidate the relative contributions of VKOR, VKORL and FSP1 to support coagulation and
control ferroptosis, and understand the structural mechanisms of GGCX catalysis. Our hypotheses are: (1)
shifting VKOR towards a reduced state enhances vitamin K antidoting by increasing VKOR activity and
facilitating warfarin release; (2) VKOR/VKORL are primarily responsible for K antidoting and reducing lipid
peroxidation in the ER; and (3) GGCX binding of substrates induces conformational changes to tightly regulate
the sequential reactions. Our preliminary data obtained 11 crystal structures of VKOR and a VKORL paralog
with substrates and antagonists at different redox states. We also discovered that VKOR at reduced state is
highly active but poorly inhibited by warfarin, and that K competition at partially oxidized state releases warfarin.
We showed that VKOR/VKORL better support carboxylation and K antidoting relative to FSP1. We identified
VKOR partner proteins and showed that reduced glutathione maintains VKOR activity. We obtained the first
cryo-EM structures of human and conus GGCX that suggests keto-enol tautomerization as an elegant solution
that couples epoxidation and carboxylation across the membrane interface. Armed with our expertise in the
vitamin K cycle and membrane proteins, we will test our hypotheses with three specific aims: (1) Identify new
anticoagulation strategies by employing VKOR redox states; (2) elucidate the interplay of the vitamin K cycle in
γ-carboxylation and ferroptosis; and (3) understand the structural mechanisms of γ-carboxylation. The proposed
studies are expected to significantly advance our knowledge of the entire vitamin K cycle and lead to innovative
strategies that will improve treatment for thromboembolic and cardiovascular diseases."
10803623,"BACKGROUND: Suicide confers a massive burden to individuals and society, accounting for nearly 20
Veteran deaths every day. After controlling for age, Veterans’ suicide risk is 22% higher than US adult civilians.
In response, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has made suicide prevention its first priority. The
VA’s suicide prevention framework prioritizes patients at the highest risk for suicide, including those who
previously attempted suicide, were recently released from inpatient mental health treatment, or use opioids.
Although this strategy has led to improvements for high-risk patients, the majority of patients that die by suicide
are not included in this group. Indeed, less than 3% of recent VA suicide deaths were classified as high-risk by
the leading prediction metric. This proposal specifically focuses on this “non-high-risk” majority, i.e., those who
died by suicide, but whose risk was not detected by existing prediction mechanisms. This proposal leverages
big data to better identify, track, and treat this critical population. It has the potential to have a large impact on
Veteran health, broadening the reach of effective suicide prevention services.
OBJECTIVES: The long-term goal is for the candidate, Dr. Maxwell Levis, to become an independent clinical
researcher focused on developing, testing, and improving suicide prevention resources. His short-term
goals are to: 1) acquire skills in population-based approaches to suicide prediction and prevention, 2) improve
machine learning and natural language processing ability, and 3) gain experience adapting suicide prevention
resources. His research objectives align closely with these goals. Dr. Levis’ proposal’s central hypothesis is
that, through leveraging big data, he can better understand non-high-risk suicide decedents, and, in turn,
develop targeted suicide prediction and prevention mechanisms. In the award’s last two years, Dr. Levis will
submit a VA Merit Award proposal on leveraging psychotherapy to decrease suicide risk in this population.
METHODS: The VA’s suicide prevention framework relies on universal strategies to reach all patients (low-
risk), selective strategies to reach some patients (moderate-risk), and indicated strategies to reach the
relatively few patients with symptoms associated with suicide (high-risk). While strides have been made for
indicated strategies, comparable achievements have not been made for universal and selective strategies.
Using Corporate Data Warehouse data, Dr. Levis will develop a dataset of recent (2017–2018; n ≈ 4000) non-
high-risk suicide decedents (cases) and characterize this sample’s demographics, service and mental health
usage, and risk and treatment factors. He will then develop a suicide risk-matched (1:[10]) sample of VA
patients that did not die (controls), but shared similar risk, services, demographics, location, and treatment
intervals. Dr. Levis will then leverage cases’ and controls’ structured and unstructured electronic health record
(EHR) data to develop machine-learning-derived suicide-prediction models. He will also sub-select non-high-
risk patients that received psychotherapy in the year before death by suicide (n ≈ 2,750) and risk-matched
controls that did not die (1:5), but shared similar risk, psychotherapy usage, [pharmacotherapy], demographics,
location, and treatment intervals. Dr. Levis will use time-sensitive machine learning methods to evaluate
changes in psychotherapy note text over time, tracking change mechanisms, intervals of heightened changes,
and domains associated with reduced suicide risk. These findings will support a subsequent investigator-
initiated research proposal using derived information to leverage psychotherapy to reduce suicide risk among
Veterans.
IMPACT: The goal of this award is to help Dr. Levis become an independent clinical researcher in the suicide
prevention field. This award consists of educational, research, and mentorship components. Education
components will center on analytic and clinical research skills. Dr. Levis will receive mentorship from suicide
prevention and clinical research leaders. These areas will be central for Dr. Levis’ Merit Award proposal."

 Early life adversity (ELA) is a multidimensional and potent risk factor for neurocognitive risk, downstream
drug use vulnerabilities, and adolescent drug use and misuse. The effects of ELA on youth’s drug use risk
depend on multiple dynamic family, peer, school, community, and sociocultural risk and protective contexts.
Yet, a significant knowledge base is missing to further our understanding of the contexts in which neural
biomarkers affect drug risk vulnerabilities and behaviors in adolescence.
 Emerging research and theory implicate neuroregulatory systems that underpin emotion and behavioral
regulation as a powerful focus for adolescent drug use risk investigations. We focus on individual differences in
neuroregulatory systems whereby cognitive control networks become more effective over time in modulating
emotion processing networks, including the emotion/salience and reward salience networks. According to this
dual system view, a neuroregulatory imbalance between the socioemotional network (or ERSN, comprised of
the emotional, reward, and salience networks) and CCN ushers in diminished self-regulation abilities that
underlie drug risk behaviors in adolescence. This developmental mechanism and subsequent risk behaviors
may be differentially affected by youth’s dimensional stress. Extant developmental studies have cataloged
psychosocial risk and protective processes that moderate the impact of ELA and the development of drug use
vulnerabilities in adolescence. Yet ecological approaches remain rare in neuroscience approaches. Using a
developmental ecological neuroscience approach, we propose to investigate neurocognitive mechanisms that
mediate, and the contextual factors that moderate, the effect of ELA on drug-related vulnerabilities and drug
use. We will focus on the impact of ELA on developmental changes in functional activation and communication
(i.e., functional connectivity; FC) between the ERSN and CCN networks and its mechanistic role in leading to
adolescent drug use vulnerabilities and later drug use.
 We propose to use a large, longitudinal dataset: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study
(ABCD; N=11,883; ages 9-10 at baseline and 11.5-12.5 at wave 6). We aim to test (a) the developmental
cognitive mechanisms that mediate the effect of ELA on drug use vulnerabilities and attendant drug use and
misuse (b) the moderating influence of family, peer, school, community, and sociocultural contexts on the
neurocognitive processes that lead to drug use vulnerabilities. Modeling multilevel latent change in ecological,
behavioral, and neuroimaging data is critical to further the precision and specificity of developmental models
and preventative intervention programs for drug addiction resilience in adolescence."

There is a massive prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. with 34.2 million having diabetes, and 88 million adults
with prediabetes. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of the islet β cell mediated in part by
β-cell dysfunction prior to autoimmune attack. Polyamine and hypusine production are important for the
translation of a subset of RNAs involved in the unfolded protein response, ER stress, and cytokine response in
the β cell. Our preliminary data suggests that the polyamine/hypusine pathway is involved in the translation of
proteins required for the response of the β cell to inflammation. Inhibition of two rate limiting enzymes along the
polyamine/hypusine pathway, either genetically or with small molecule inhibitors, results in a decrease of ER
stress leading to protection from β-cell death and ultimately type 1 diabetes. For this proposal we will use a
combination of mouse, and human models to understand how the polyamines and hypusine specifically alter the
β cell’s response to stress. We propose to study the role of polyamines and hypusine in specific mRNA translation
of proteins that are important to the maladaptive response of β-cell ER stress and hypothesis that polyamine
depletion leads to ER stress resolution, preserved β-cell function, and ultimately reduced T1D pathogenesis. To
test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
Aim 1: Interrogate the molecular mechanisms by which the polyamine/hypusine pathway contributes to β-cell
dysfunction and death.
Aim 2: Determine the role of β cell polyamine/hypusine pathway during autoimmunity and the development of
T1D.
Aim 3: Assess the efficacy of treatment with polyamine/hypusine blockade.
The primary impact of this proposal is the identification of mechanisms of the polyamine/hypusine pathway in β
cells during the diabetes pathogenesis."

 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has reached epidemic proportions and will result in an immense
burden of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Therapeutics for NASH is a very active area of investigation, but
even with development of propriety drugs there will be major issues of financial availability for such a large
percentage of the population. This motivated us to search for generic drugs with therapeutic potential in NASH,
resulting in the identification of digoxin. We, and others, have identified an important role of digoxin in providing
hepatoprotection in a range of liver conditions, including NASH. We have further identified that digoxin binds to
pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and stops PKM2 from initiating immune responses in macrophages. There is a
large amount of published data from other studies that supports the ability of digoxin to reduce inflammation,
steatosis, and fibrosis in the liver. There is also a high likelihood for translation of these findings to humans
because we have demonstrated that oral digoxin reduces immune responses in healthy volunteers and others
have demonstrated that oral digoxin reduces serum cholesterol, as we previously reported based on
observations in mice.
 At least three mechanisms of digoxin-induced hepatoprotection have been identified. These include binding
to PKM2 as reported by us, digoxin-mediated inhibition of RORγt and TH17 cells, as well as activation of
transcription factor EB (TFEB). Of great clinical relevance is the fact that hepatoprotection occurs at a
concentration below that required for cardiac effects, significantly improving the safety profile of digoxin.
 The large amount of experimental and translational data on the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective
effects of digoxin which has accumulated over the last 55 years now supports the conduct of a clinical trial to
directly test the ability of digoxin as a therapy for NASH. We will test the ability of oral digoxin to reduce
steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in patients with NASH. This will be done at the standard cardiac dose and
at a lower dose. In addition, we will examine the immunomodulatory effects of digoxin with respect to myeloid
cells, TH17 cells, and liver tissue and correlate these with the clinical response. The demonstration of
hepatoprotective effects of a generic medication for NASH will be transformative. Due to the lack of commercial
return, this avenue of research will only occur outside the pharmaceutical industry."

As one of the most common and deadly cancer types worldwide, squamous cancer can occur to diverse organ
sites including lung, esophagus, upper digestive tracts, cervix, and skin. Current treatments of squamous cancer
are mainly limited to aggressive surgeries or unspecific chemotherapies and radiotherapies, while biomarker-
guided targeted therapies are largely missing. The majority of squamous cancers are associated with
overexpression of the SOX2 gene, encoding an SRY-box transcription factor. SOX2 plays important roles in
specifying squamous lineages, but drives squamous cancer formation when hyperactivated. Despite the
importance of SOX2 in squamous cancer, SOX2 as a transcription factor is a difficult target for small molecules.
Identification of alternative therapeutic targets is hindered by our limited knowledge of mechanisms of the SOX2
oncogene. In particular, two key questions remain largely unknown: 1) how the SOX2 oncogene is
transcriptionally activated, and 2) how the SOX2 transcription factor regulates its target genes in squamous
cancer. We will address these questions in the 3D genome context that is essential for promoter-enhancer
interactions and gene regulation, but has been largely missed from traditional linear genomics approaches.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the SOX2 oncogene is transcriptionally activated by
regulators bound at a distal enhancer through a long-range chromatin loop, and that the encoded SOX2
transcription factor in turn binds to enhancers, cooperating with the cohesin complex and other co-
factors, to regulate the 3D genome architecture and oncogenic transcriptional programs. We will combine
functional 3D genomics with myriad CRISPR technologies to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will determine
the regulatory mechanism underlying overexpression of the SOX2 oncogene in squamous cancer. Focusing on
a squamous-cancer specific enhancer that we identified as a principal driver of SOX2 overexpression, we will
utilize motif analysis and dCas9-APEX-mediated proteomics to identify transcription factors and chromatin
regulators responsible for SOX2 overexpression. In addition, we will use epigenome editing approaches to
interfere the chromatin loop connecting the enhancer to the SOX2 promoter and determine its role in SOX2
transcriptional activation. In Aim 2, we will determine how the SOX2 transcription factor regulates oncogenic
transcriptional programs in squamous cancer. We will apply 3D genomics to identify chromatin loops connecting
SOX2 binding sites to their direct target genes. We will then prioritize and functionally characterize 10 SOX2-
target genes. We will also determine the role of SOX2 in cohesin recruitment and chromatin looping. Furthermore,
we will identify additional SOX2 co-factors that cooperate with SOX2 in transcriptional regulation. The successful
completion of this proposal will reveal novel mechanisms of the SOX2 oncogene in squamous cancer. The
findings will uncover alternative therapeutic targets for SOX2-driven squamous cancers from diverse organ sites."

Abstract
Building on our existing infrastructure and scientific collaborations, and the expertise gained
during the first two years of the HPAP effort for Type 1 Diabetes, we have assembled five cores
with expertise ranging from pancreas procurement and islet isolation to data integration. These
Cores form a for a comprehensive and integrated Penn Human Pancreas Analysis Program –
T2D based entirely at the University of Pennsylvania. Core A will procure a spectrum of human
pancreata and detailed donor medical history; perform high resolution HLA typing by next
generation sequencing; isolate islets; and distribute islets and tissues to the other Cores for further
analysis or processing. Core B will perform physiological phenotyping on the isolated islets. Core
C will perform multiple advanced modalities for the molecular profiling of isolated islets including
RNAseq, ATACseq and DNA methylome analysis of sorted islet cell populations; single cell
ATACseq and RNAseq, and mass cytometry for single cell quantification of more than 20 cell
surface and intracellular markers. Core D will process tissues using multiple modalities that will
allow for analysis using advanced technologies such as multiplexed immunoflourescent staining,
whole slide imaging, and imaging mass cytometry. This Core will also archive tissues, DNA and
blood, as well as other T2D-relevant organs such as skeletal muscle, intestine, adipose tissue
and liver for future use by other NIDDK-approved consortia. Finally, Core E will assemble,
annotate and maintain an open-access database for the Program and its member-researchers,
and collaborate with the HIRN in the sharing of data from both programs. The entire program will
directed by an Executive Committee consisting of the core leaders and the PI, who will be the
interface with HIRN and NIDDK leadership. HPAP-T2D will provide physiologic, genomic, genetic,
and histological analysis of the pancreas in type 2 diabetes at unprecedented detail, share the
rich data with researchers world-wide before publication, and thus enable breakthrough
discoveries in our understanding of this disease that has reached epidemic levels world-wide."
10806951,"ERα is a novel RNA-binding protein controlling breast cancer
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, with over 70% of breast cancers harboring the
activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα), a key oncogenic transcription factor. Almost all research on the
function of ERα in breast cancer has been predominantly centered on the role of ERα as a transcription factor.
We have instead made a striking discovery that ERα is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with an ascribed RNA-
binding domain (RBD). We performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking
immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) and CRISPR analyses to unravel a unique network of mRNAs, crucial for
cancer progression. Notably, we further discovered that mutating the ERα RBD, without affecting its DNA-binding
activity, significantly impedes breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the percentage of
ERα binding to mRNA is significantly increased in cells resistant to tamoxifen, an antagonist targeting the
transcriptional activity of ERα. Mutation of the RBD in ERα or inhibition of targets of ERα such as the antiapoptotic
protein MCL1 re-sensitize resistant breast cancer cells to tamoxifen-induced cell cycle arrest and cell death.
Based on these results, we hypothesize that ERα is a previously uncharacterized RBP that modulates post-
transcriptional gene expression to sustain breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. These findings
transform our understanding of ERα and the molecular underpinnings of breast cancer. In this grant, we leverage
our compelling preliminary results to define the mechanisms by which ERα reprograms gene expression at the
post-transcription level as a means to contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance. Specifically, in Aim
1, we will harness the power of two state-of-the-art technologies to define the mechanisms by which ERα
regulates post-transcriptional gene expression in breast cancer at the level of mRNA stability and translation
control. In Aim 2, we will delineate the mechanisms by which ERα-mediated RNA metabolism stimulates the
Integrated stress response (ISR) and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which are adaptive pathways critical
for cancer development. We will also characterize the role of eIF2-eIF2B in ERα-mediated post-transcriptional
regulation in cancer development and progression in vivo. In Aim 3, we will characterize the role of ERα as an
RBP in breast cancer and its therapeutic implications. We will employ elegant genetic mouse models as well as
xenografts and orthotopic models to dissect the role of ERα RNA-binding activity in-vivo. Therefore, we will be
in a strong position to unveil the function of ERα RNA-binding activity on tumor initiation, progression, metastasis
formation, and therapeutic response."
10804874,"For Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) experiencing homelessness, obtaining permanent
housing is only the first step in achieving stability and improved quality of life. Many recently housed
Veterans continue to struggle with many aspects of functioning and day to day living. Difficulties with
community integration, which includes engagement in vocational, recreational, social, and
independent living activities, are common. For providers, maintaining connection with these
individuals and engaging them in sustained treatment to improve functional outcomes once they
obtain permanent housing pose significant challenges. During this critical transition, as Veterans
move from temporary to permanent housing, they are particularly susceptible to falling out of mental
healthcare and other VA services. However, few, if any, evidence-based psychosocial treatments
designed to increase functional recovery, including community integration, have been systematically
applied during this transitional period. Whether such treatments could prove effective in improving
engagement and increasing continuity of care for these Veterans is not known. The current pilot study
aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week individualized intervention that combines
motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a hybrid in-person/remote
format (MI-CBTech) to improve community integration in Veterans with SMI experiencing
homelessness. This study has the potential to fill key gaps in treatment options for this high priority
population. The long-term goal of the intervention is to return these individuals to functional
independence so they may participate more fully in their lives and communities.
For the proposed study, 50 Veterans with SMI experiencing homelessness will be recruited from the
VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA) Domiciliary, a residential treatment program.
Participants will be randomly assigned to either the MI-CBTech experimental arm or control arm
(mindfulness). All participants will be administered interviews (symptom ratings and community
functioning), and assessments of cognitive ability during an in-person baseline visit. Both treatment
arms will consist of 8 weeks of active intervention, including three in-person visits (3 MI sessions for
MI-CBTech and 3 supportive therapy sessions for the control arm) followed by 6 weeks of mobile
phone application use. During the period of remote application use, both arms will have phone check-
ins during weeks 2, 4, and 6 to obtain information on application use and troubleshoot any potential
problems with compliance or completion. Participants will complete two repeat assessments of
community functioning, one at end of treatment and one at 16-week follow-up.
For feasibility, the primary outcome measures will be participant recruitment (successful target
enrollment rate and completion of baseline in-person assessment and sessions) and retention
(completion of post-treatment and follow-up assessments). For acceptability, the primary measures
will be adherence (application use and completion of homework assignments) and subjective
satisfaction (as measured by a composite satisfaction index). These results will lay the groundwork
for a future Merit Review Award application that will support a controlled efficacy study."
10804879,"RESEARCH STRATEGY: The objective of this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms by which macrophage
renin signaling contributes to the development of hypertension (HTN) associated with disrupted vitamin D (VD)
signaling. HTN is the most common chronic disease in the veteran population and associated with an increased
risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Despite our best efforts, many veterans have uncontrolled HTN,
highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Since VD deficiency is common among veterans,
associated with the development of HTN in humans, and promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype,
we have focused on the mechanisms by which disrupted VD signaling contributes to the development of HTN.
We have found that macrophage renin secretion is stimulated by deletion of the VD receptor (VDR) in
macrophages (KODMAC). Transplantation of bone marrow from KODMAC mice into renin-null mice normalizes
blood pressure (BP) and restores circulating renin, highlighting the physiological relevance of macrophage renin
in regulating systemic BP. However, the role of local macrophage renin in driving HTN, as well as the
mechanisms governing macrophage renin transcription and the impact of macrophage-produced renin on
macrophage immune function are not known. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that
macrophage renin is a critical non-renal modulator of systemic HTN and inflammation in the setting of
disrupted VD signaling. Our Aims are to (1) determine the role of local macrophage renin in mediating the
development of HTN in murine models with disrupted macrophage VD signaling and (2) determine the
mechanisms associated with macrophage renin upregulation in the setting of disrupted VD signaling and its
effect on the macrophage function/secretome. The expected outcome of this work is to establish a new paradigm
by which impaired VD signaling functions as a major immunoregulatory program involved in systemic BP
regulation via increase macrophage renin production. We also expect that these findings will generate novel
therapeutic strategies for HTN management.

10785779,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anal cancer represents approximately ~10% of all solid cancers among people with HIV (PWH) and is
responsible for ~4% of all mortality in this group, representing a major morbidity burden in this population.
Screening for anal precancerous lesions and treating these tumors has been proven to prevent invasive cancer
and offers a clinical opportunity for addressing this emerging disease. However, standard screening tests (anal
cytology and high-risk HPV testing) have very poor specificity leading to burdensome and invasive
confirmatory testing. To address this we have identified genomic alterations that can identify anal high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions (aHSIL), the immediate precursors of invasive cancer, with potentially greater
accuracy and at lower cost than standard screening tests. However, the application of this approach for
screening has not yet been investigated. The Specific Aims of this research proposal are (1) to compare the
performance of a cytobrush-based, novel genomic test for the detection of aHSIL, to standard of care in a
prospective cohort of people with HIV (PWH) at high risk of anal cancer and (2) to identify genomic alterations
associated with aggressive aHSIL lesions and to develop a classifier the predicts lesions that are more likely to
recur. To address these Aims, we will enroll a prospective cohort of 250 PWH for anal cancer screening and
longitudinal data collection. This project will validate a genomic panel to identify aHSIL and compare it to
standard of care screening as well as identify biomarkers associate with aHSIL recurrence. This application will
also support Dr. Richard Silvera's career development into an independent patient-oriented investigator in the
field of anal cancer among people with HIV. Dr. Silvera's career goal is to become a leader in developing novel
strategies for the identification and prevention of anal cancers among PWH. The proposed career development
plan integrates in-depth mentoring from a team of senior scientists and clinicians, advanced coursework in
research design, analysis, cancer genomics, biomarker development, and experiential learning through the
conduct of the proposed research in a highly supportive environment. The mentorship team, which includes
independent investigators with extensive expertise in research of cancers among people with HIV as well as
the genomics of cancer, will guide the candidate's research and career development. At conclusion of this
project Dr. Silvera will be well positioned to become an independent physician-investigator studying biological
and clinical issues related to anal cancers among people with HIV."
10788301,"Dr. Pardue’s research program is centered on developing life-changing treatments for veterans with
vision loss. She has made significant contributions in three research areas: a) treatments for retinal
degeneration, b) early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and c) retinal mechanisms of refractive
development. Pre-clinical studies from her research program have enhanced our understanding of
mechanisms that underlie blinding diseases and advanced new treatment options. Her dual position between
the VA and Georgia Tech creates a unique situation to leverage resources and collaborations to move new
technologies into the clinic. She is a firm believer that collaborative research is essential to translate results
from bench to bedside. This is reflected in over 75% of her 89 publications stemming from collaborations with
over 46 different investigators. Moreover, her findings have formed the basis for 3 areas of translational studies
to human patients (retinal prosthetics, diabetic retinopathy, and neuroprotection therapies). Dr. Pardue’s dual
appointment and research interests create novel opportunities to draw parallels and intersections between
different systems and fields of study with the potential for ground-breaking discoveries.
 Dr. Pardue’s commitment to teaching and mentorship are illustrated by a number of roles. She has
lectured to undergraduate and graduate students on the retina and visual system for the last 18 years and
been the instructor for 7 courses. Dr. Pardue has a strong interest in professional development and has
organized and taught courses for post-docs and graduate students on this topic at the VA, Emory, and Georgia
Tech, as well as at international conferences. In addition, she actively supports women in science at the
graduate and junior faculty levels through institutional and international programs. Dr. Pardue has mentored 5
VA Career Development Awardees (CDAs). Over 80% of the students that she has mentored have continued
on in medicine or science.
 Dr. Pardue has consistently served the scientific community throughout her career. Specific to the VA,
Dr. Pardue chaired the IACUC Committee from 2004-2008 and has chaired the R&D Committee for the last ten
years (2008-date). She assisted with two successful renewal cycles of the Atlanta VA Rehab Center. As the
Associate Director of Scientific Projects, she directed the internal review process of all Rehab Center
submissions, increasing the funding rate to 20% for Merits and 42% for CDAs. She currently serves as the
interim Associate Director of the CVNR. She also serves on the Advisory Board for the Atlanta VA non-profit
foundation (AREF). On the international level, she has served on several committees for ARVO and was
awarded their prestigious Silver Fellow Award in May 2016. Dr. Pardue has served on many study sections
from NIH, VA, and various national and international private foundations. She currently serves as a regular
member of NIH Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies (NOIT) study section. Her contributions
and leadership in the field was recognized in 2017 by induction as a fellow into the American Institute of
Medical and Biological Engineers (AIMBE).
 Dr. Pardue’s future goals are to 1) develop new rehabilitation strategies for blinding diseases, 2) identify
the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy and determine early interventions to slow the progression of vision
loss, and 3) determine the role of dopamine in refractive eye growth. These goals are grounded in the results
from her laboratory over the last several years, including the increased number of publications in high impact
journals. Based on prior success, she anticipates the development of new treatment strategies. Translation of
these findings from the laboratory to the clinic will be facilitated by her collaborations within the CVNR and
clinicians at the VA. Thus, these projects support both the common theme of understanding and treating retinal
disease to prolong functional vision and the VA mission of improving healthcare for veterans."
10788408,"Inhibitors of the G protein Gαs which drives pancreatic tumorigenesis
Project Summary / Abstract
The GNAS gene encodes the Gαs stimulatory subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which mediate G-protein-
coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, a central mechanism by which cells sense and respond to extracellular stimuli.
Multiple human cancer types exhibit recurrent gain-of-function mutations in the pathway, most frequently
targeting GNAS. The most lethal tumor type where GNAS is frequently mutated is the intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), a precursor of invasive pancreatic cancer. Recent mouse modelling from Bardeesy
and coworkers has shown that pancreatic IPMN tumors which contain three coincident genetic lesions, K-Ras
(G12D), Gαs (R201C), and p53 -/-, are suppressed when Gαs (R201C) is silenced, providing strong genetic
validation for targeting this mutant protein. For over 30 years, the prevailing model explaining the gain-of-
function activity of the R201 mutations was through the loss of GTPase activity and resulting inability of mutant
Gαs to switch off to the GDP state. Recently, our laboratory revised this model and revealed that the R201C
mutation can bypass the need for GTP binding by directly activating GDP-bound Gαs through stabilization of an
intramolecular hydrogen bond network. This understanding has led to a therapeutic opportunity that we seek to
exploit to treat pancreatic tumorigenesis. We propose to develop state-selective Gαs binding molecules which
block adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation. Inspired by the cyclic peptide natural product YM-254890 which is a
GDP-state specific cyclic peptide inhibitor of Gαq, we initiated a drug discovery approach to identify both active
state and inactive state specific inhibitors of Gαs. Using the Random non-standard Peptide Integrated Discovery
(RaPID) system developed by our collaborator Dr. Hiroaki Suga we have selected active state and inactive state
preferring cyclic peptides against Gαs. We have solved high resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of our function
blocking cyclic peptides which explain their nucleotide state specificity and inhibitory activity. We propose to
use the RaPID technology to focus chemical diversity to improve potency of the lead cyclic peptides and test our
lead molecules in cells generated from Dr. Bardeesy's model. This proposal capitalizes on three recent
breakthroughs, mouse modeling by Dr. Bardeesy, unnatural cyclic peptide library generation by Dr. Suga, and a
new non-canonical type of G protein signaling by the driver oncoprotein Gαs by our laboratory to target a deadly
form of pancreatic cancer."
10924058,"The goal of Project 3 is to examine the association of cumulative exposure to type 2 diabetes (T2D) medications,
primarily metformin, with cognitive impairment and its underlying neuropathology in the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP) Outcomes Study (DPPOS) cohort. Repurposing of T2D medications, particularly insulin
sensitizing medications, has been proposed for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Metformin is the first line treatment and the most widely used T2D medication, but there are conflicting data on
whether metformin is beneficial, harmful, or has no effects on AD and risk of cognitive impairment. The
DPP/DPPOS provided randomly assigned metformin and now includes over 20 years of data on cumulative
metformin exposure. It provides a unique opportunity to examine the association of metformin with cognitive
impairment and related neuropathology. GLP1a, DPP4i, and SGLT2i have been used more recently and less
frequently in DPPOS compared with metformin and can be examined on an exploratory basis. We now propose
to ascertain dementia and MCI in all DPPOS participants. We will examine amyloid (Aß42/40 ratio), tau (ptau-
181), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]), and neuroinflammation (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein
[GFAP]) in plasma in all participants. In 650 participants we will ascertain brain amyloid with 18F-Florbetaben
Positron Emission Tomography (PET); using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we will ascertain atrophy
(cortical thickness), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and explore microbleeds, white matter microstructure,
and resting functional connectivity. We will classify the cognitive syndromes as AD continuum or non-AD
pathology following the National Institute on Aging (NIA)/Alzheimer’s Association (AA) research framework using
primarily ptau-181 in all participants. We will explore classification by tau, neurodegeneration, and vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We will use statistical methods to ensure that
findings are not confounded by propensity to use T2D medications. We will achieve our goal through the
following aims: (1) To examine the association of cumulative metformin exposure with amnestic and non-
amnestic cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia; (2) To examine the association of cumulative metformin
exposure with brain amyloid, neurodegeneration and CVD in the 650 participants with brain imaging; (3) To
examine the association of cumulative metformin exposure with trajectories of plasma biomarkers of amyloid,
tau, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. We will also explore: other T2D medications as exposures;
metformin associated cobalamin deficiency in relation to cognitive impairment; neuronal insulin signaling as an
outcome; glycemia, advanced glycation end products, insulinemia, peripheral inflammation, endothelial function,
vascular risk factors, and neuroprotective factors as mediators; the aggregate exposure to T2D medications and
physical activity; the genomic signatures moderating the associations in aims 1-3; effect modification by sex,
ethnic/racial group, cognitive reserve, and APOE-ε4 in all aims."
10924060,"The goal of Project 4 is to study the interrelationships of physical activity (PA), lower extremity physical function
(PF), and frailty, with cognitive impairment and its underlying neuropathology in older adults in the continuum of
pre-diabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcomes Study
(DPPOS). PA is a common lifestyle target in T2D prevention and treatment and was a key component of the
lifestyle intervention in the DPP. Higher sustained PA levels are hypothesized to be associated with a lower risk
of cognitive impairment. PF decline and frailty, increased in older adults with PreD/T2D, are closely related to
PA, and are also associated with cognitive impairment. Thus, this project seeks to better understand the
individual and joint associations of PA, PF, and frailty with cognitive outcomes and underlying neuropathology
among persons with PreD/T2D. Our preliminary data show that lower PA and PF levels and higher frailty at
midlife are concurrently associated with poorer global and domain-specific cognitive function. We now propose
to examine the association among PA, PF, and frailty trajectories, across the mid- to late-life transition period,
with cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, and with plasma and imaging biomarkers
of neuropathology. Further, we will evaluate (1) exercise-induced myokines as mediators, and (2) T2D-related
metabolic factors and complications as moderators and mediators. We will leverage >25 years of PA data, >15
years of PF and frailty data, and extensive metabolic phenotyping in the longitudinal framework of DPPOS among
participants (N = 1,979) expected to enroll in DPPOS-AD/ADRD. We will achieve our goal through the following
specific aims: (1) To relate PA, PF, and frailty trajectories, separately and jointly, to amnestic and non-amnestic
cognitive decline and risk of MCI and dementia (AD continuum vs. non-AD pathology as exploratory) in
PreD/T2D; 2) To relate PA, PF, and frailty trajectories, separately and jointly, to changes in plasma biomarkers
of amyloid (Aβ42/40 ratio), tau (phosphorylated tau 181 [ptau-181]), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light
[NfL]), and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Among participants with brain imaging (N =
650), we will relate PA, PF, and frailty trajectories to amyloid burden, cortical thickness, and cerebrovascular
disease; (3) To examine the association of PA, PF, and frailty with exercise-induced myokines (e.g., brain-
derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) and the relationship of myokines with
cognitive outcomes examined in Aim 1 and biomarkers in Aim 2. (4) To explore whether glycemic burden,
vascular burden, microvascular/macrovascular complications, and peripheral inflammation moderate and/or
mediate the associations examined across aims 1-3; (5) Exploratory Aim: Aims 1-4 will also explore interactions
by APOE-ε4, sex, body mass index (BMI), original randomized treatment assignment, race/ethnicity, and
measures of cognitive reserve (e.g., education level)."

10793649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this project is to understand mechanisms by which immature egg cells, or oocytes, become
developmentally competent. Mammalian oocytes are stored in the ovary, arrested at meiotic prophase, for
extended periods of time (decades in women). Following puberty, oocytes enter a period of growth in which
they synthesize proteins needed for the maturation process. They are stimulated to mature by signals from the
pituitary. Oocytes undergo many cytoplasmic changes during oocyte maturation, the period between prophase
I and metaphase II. These include a dramatic reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in which the
ER becomes concentrated in the egg cortex. Ca2+ uptake into the ER also occurs, and that is necessary for
the egg to release intracellular Ca2+ from the ER at fertilization, a critical event required for early embryonic
development. Oocytes also undergo changes that permit them to undergo cortical granule exocytosis at
fertilization, an important event that renders the fertilized egg impermeable to more than one sperm and thus
serves as a polyspermy prevention mechanism. Many questions remain about these events. Aim 1 will
investigate whether changes in ER structure and the formation of ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contacts are
required for developmental competence, as well as mechanisms that regulate ER reorganization, formation of
ER-PM contacts, and Ca2+ uptake during maturation. Aim 2 will identify proteins that are needed for
constitutive exocytosis as well as the Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of cortical granules. These experiments will
make use of protein degradation methods to study the role of specific proteins, alone or in combination with
other candidate proteins, using isolated or follicle-enclosed oocytes. Importantly, we will use a newly
developed method for the rapid and acute degradation of endogenous proteins. Oocytes will be injected with
fluorescent molecules that allow the visualization of the ER and ER-PM contacts, or with
antibodies/siRNAs/morpholinos to specifically deplete proteins. The conclusions reached from these studies
will be applicable to understanding oocyte development in women. Currently, the ability to mature human
oocytes in vitro is an area of high importance, but methods for maturing oocytes are imperfect. A complete
knowledge of all aspects of oocyte development could lead to improved culturing methods that will increase the
success of assisted reproduction."

The continuous discovery of new biological targets presents opportunities to dramatically improve our
understanding of diseases and normal function and provides new avenues for treatment. In vivo imaging of these
targets via positron-emission tomography (PET) is an especially powerful tool to understand the initiation and
progression of disease and to aid in the development of novel therapeutics. The major benefits of PET are the
very high sensitivity (enabling imaging of rare targets such as neuroreceptors without saturating them), and the
ability to image deep tissues (which provides translatability from preclinical research to later clinical use).
But the development of useful and validated tracers can take years or decades. A significant limiting factor is the
complexity and cost of radiochemistry, and the difficulty in using current technologies to optimize synthesis
conditions – a key step toward achieving reliable production with sufficient yield to support initial imaging studies.
Slow throughput and high reagent and isotope consumption mean that optimization studies are very expensive
and time-consuming, and thus such studies tend to be very limited and are unlikely to find globally optimal
conditions. These limitations also create pressures in other aspects of new probe development, e.g., significant
efforts are made to reduce the number of “hits” so only a very small number of compounds are labeled and
studied via in vitro and ex vivo assays and in vivo imaging. However, this selection process is imperfect as it
sometimes leads to the pursuit of dead-ends while it excludes promising candidates.
To more rapidly leverage preclinical and clinical imaging of new biological targets, the radiochemistry field is in
urgent need of new tools to improve the tracer discovery and development process. Our proposed solution is
the development of high-throughput radiochemistry methods. Arrays of droplet reactions have recently been
introduced as a way to rapidly perform dozens of reactions in parallel from a single batch of radioisotope, with
total reagent consumption of those reactions similar to a single batch on a conventional system. Furthermore,
the droplet reactions can readily be scaled to quantities for preclinical or even clinical imaging. These methods
could be used to efficiently explore a vast reaction parameter space in a matter of days (instead of weeks to
months), or they could be used to label dozens of candidate compounds in parallel to perform screening based
on the most relevant metric: in vivo properties. While these reaction arrays, operated using manual pipetting,
have revealed the benefits and potential of high-throughput radiochemistry, this new technology requires
significant further development and automation to increase safety and speed, and reduce the chance for human
error. We propose to (1) integrate in situ radiation detectors to quantify the radioactivity at various stages of each
reaction, (2) integrate a method to automatically sample the reactions for analysis (radio-TLC or radio-UPLC),
and (3) use high-throughput methods to optimize the synthesis of 5 neurotracers that currently have low yield,
develop at least one novel tracer, and develop best practices for high-throughput optimization in radiochemistry."

The current opioid epidemic is fueled by the steady rise of prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, which is
a controlled-release tablet of oxycodone. Although both clinical and animal studies have found that the rate of
onset of drug action influences the development of addiction, the exceptionally strong abuse liability of
oxycodone was manifested even when it was consumed in the controlled-release from. The heritability of
opioid addiction has been estimated to be approximately 0.5 in humans. However, few human genetics studies
have been conducted due to the difficulty in assembling the necessary large study population. In this proposal,
we aim to conduct a genetic mapping study to identify genetic factors influencing oxycodone-motivated
behaviors and vulnerability to stress, a major risk factor of opioid use disorder. To follow the clinical use
pattern, we developed an operant oral oxycodone self-administration model, where rats voluntarily consume
oral oxycodone to obtain doses that are well above clinical prescriptions. The WMI and WLI inbred strains of
rats we propose to use in this study were selectively bred from the stress-vulnerable Wistar Kyoto rat. The
WMI is an established animal model of depression and vulnerability to stress, while the WLI serves as its
isogenic control. Our preliminary data showed higher levels of oxycodone intake and oxycodone seeking in the
WMI compared to the WLI strains. We also found that females have higher oxycodone intake than males.
There were also strain and sex differences in basal plasma corticosterone (CORT) and steady-state
hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) expression. We therefore hypothesized that
genetically-determined stress response to oxycodone withdrawal drives the strain differences in oxycodone
self-administration and reinstatement of oxycodone seeking. In Aim 1, we will use a reduced complexity
mapping strategy to identify the causal genetic factors for oxycodone and stress response phenotypes. This
mapping strategy is supported by the high heritability, large effect size of strain on phenotypes, and existing
whole genome sequencing data for the WMI and WLI strains ( ~100x coverage per strain, with ~4,400 high
confidence polymorphisms between strains). In Aim 2, we will identify candidate genes using a systems
genetics approach. The low number of segregating variants between WLI and WMI greatly facilitates this goal.
In Aim 3, we will confirm causal genes using an established knockin CAG-LSL-Cas9 rat model on the WMI/WLI
genetic background."

Recent recognition of the prevalence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in biology and human diseases
has challenged the traditional paradigm that stable structure is required for protein function. Furthermore, many
IDPs have been found to remain disordered even in specific complexes and functional assemblies. These
discoveries have now dramatically expanded the meaning of “structure” in the protein structure-function
paradigm, to include a continuum from disordered ensembles to well-defined conformations. Importantly, these
disordered proteins and dynamic interactions are central components of the regulatory networks that dictate
virtually all aspects of cell decision-making. They are associated with a growing number of human diseases
including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and heart diseases. There is thus a crucial need to
establish the molecular basis of how conformational disorder mediates protein function, so as to understand how
these functional mechanisms may be perturbed in diseases, or rescued by drug molecules for therapeutics. The
key challenge towards achieving these overarching goals is quantitative description of the disordered protein
states in relevant biological and disease contexts. Experimental measurements of averaged structural properties
alone are inadequate to define the disordered protein ensemble, and reliable molecular simulations have a
crucial and transformative role to play. This project aims to continue to develop advanced molecular modeling
and simulation methodologies that can provide accurate description of disordered protein states, expand the
accessible time and length scales, and enhance our ability to embrace critical questions in molecular level
biomedical research. Through strategically chosen experimental collaborations, this project will further tackle
questions and problems centered around several systems of great biomedical significance: 1) To establish the
sequence-structure-function-disease relationship of IDPs, we will determine how multisite phosphorylation and
cancer-associated mutations modulate the structure, dynamics and interactions of the transactivation domain
(TAD) of tumor suppressor p53; 2) To develop effective strategies for targeting disordered protein states, we
will determine the molecular basis of how the anti-cancer drug EGCG inhibits p53-TAD through dynamic
interactions and study the functional dynamics and inhibition of flaviviral proteases; 3) To understand dynamic
protein-protein interactions in relevant contexts, we will determine the molecular basis of how molecular
chaperone Hsp70 achieves selective promiscuity to help the cell cope with protein folding challenge and how a
novel family of virulence protein named SPIN from S. aureus inhibits human myeloperoxidase for evading the
host innate immune defense. Integrated computational and experimental approaches deployed throughout these
studies will enable us to direct our computational method development efforts to critical areas for which advances
are needed, while at the same time push and test our methods with tangible feedback.

This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application describes a career development and
research plan designed to position me as an independent investigator in phagocytosis of apoptotic cell
(efferocytosis) in kidney injuries. The main research focus is establishing a way to ameliorate acute kidney
injury (AKI), a significant clinical problem associated with high morbidity and mortality, which predisposes
individuals to chronic renal disease or even death. Our current knowledge suggests that efferocytosis is
triggered during AKI and that defects in this process lead to exacerbation of the pathology. However, there is a
significant lack of knowledge as to whether boosting efferocytosis results in faster resolution of AKI, and in
addition, which cell type(s) should be targeted has not been explored. To this end, we established a novel way
to facilitate apoptotic cell clearance by modifying one of the phagocytic receptors to be more active and have
applied this to generate a unique mouse model system. I believe this approach will provide proof of principle
that enhancing efferocytosis as an approach to enhance rapid resolution and prevention of chronic progressive
fibrosis. My preliminary data suggest expression of this phagocytic receptor enhances efferocytosis in primary
macrophages and human proximal tubular epithelial cell line. In the current proposal, we will elucidate: 1) the
effect of boosting efferocytosis on AKI by using bilateral ischemia reperfusion (IRI) model, 2) identify the cell
type(s) in which enhancing apoptotic cell removal affects kidney injuries. The knowledge gained from this
project will open up a new research to find a way to target phagocyte to promote efferocytosis for kidney injury
therapies.
Through this research plan we will 1) use our uniquely created hyper-phagocytic transgenic mouse model for
the first time in the field, 2) become proficient with rodent kidney injury models, and 3) develop an
understanding of renal physiology with the ultimate goal of establishing and funding an independent laboratory
focused on cures and treatments for acute kidney diseases. The career development plan includes training in
kidney injury models under the guidance of Dr. Mark D. Okusa at the University of Virginia (UVA) and didactic
course work through NIH P50 O'Brien (UAB) to equip me with advanced and comprehensive knowledge of
kidney disease models and physiology. For this award, I will be mentored by Dr. Kodi S. Ravichandran, a
recognized expert in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Additional assistance in planning, troubleshooting, and
interpreting results will be provided by Dr. Peter Lobo, Dr. Rahul Sharma and Dr. Victor H. Engelhard for
immunology. After successful completion of this training program, an independent NIH funded R01 application
will be submitted in the latter part of the K01 award."

Relapse rates among adolescents remain high despite advances in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment.
Chronic relapse cycles have high individual costs, such as higher risk of infectious disease transmission and
low life satisfaction, as well as downstream societal costs, including healthcare system burden and
inefficiencies. Limited adolescent-focused recovery supports represent a critical barrier to sustaining treatment
effects, highlighting the critical need to invest in research that contributes to the evidence base of adolescent-
focused continuing care and development of adolescent recovery supports. Recognizing the urgency of this
research and its potential contributions to the field, the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s (NIDA’s) 2022-2026
Strategic Framework identified developing and testing recovery support strategies as a priority scientific area,
with a goal of advancing the science of recovery support. Recovery supports affiliated with youth-serving
institutions offer a unique opportunity to provide adolescents with developmentally appropriate continuing care
following SUD treatment. Recovery high schools (RHSs) are one such approach, which are specialized
schools designed to provide students with therapeutic and peer recovery supports in a learning environment
where all students are committed to maintaining recovery from an SUD, cultivating a pro-recovery social
network for these adolescents. Using innovative approaches that align with NIDA key focus areas, this project
will draw upon data from the only controlled evaluation of RHSs to date to accomplish the following aims: (Aim
1) examine whether RHS attendance following SUD treatment has beneficial effects on long-term recovery
outcomes; (Aim 2) identify if and to what extent pro-recovery peer affiliation mediates the proposed
relationship between RHS attendance and recovery outcomes; and (Aim 3) assess whether and to what extent
the indirect effect of RHS attendance on substance use outcomes via pro-recovery peer affiliation is moderated
by perceived social benefits of substance use. Upon successful completion, this project will help NIDA
accomplish its goal of advancing the science of recovery support by delivering the expected outcomes: (1)
additional evidence supporting RHSs as a continuing care approach; and (2) greater insight into the underlying
mechanisms and conditional processes of RHS attendance. This critical knowledge is needed to support the
refinement and expansion of RHSs to provide greater and more equitable access as well as inform the
development of other continuing care approaches for this underserved population."

Black college students who attend Predominately White Institutions (PWIs) in the United States (US) are
disproportionately exposed to both explicit and subtle racial discrimination, which is associated with substance
use, misuse, and substance use-related consequences. However, much of the existing research on racial
discrimination and substance use in Black college students has focused on alcohol, using retrospective self-
report and cross-sectional surveys. The lack of in vivo prospective data prevents us from understanding how
Black college students’ substance use behaviors fluctuate in near real-time subsequent to racial discrimination
experienced in near real-time. Examining racial discrimination and substance use at the momentary level is
especially important for Black college students at PWIs who report facing unique race-related stressors
compounded by stressors generally associated with the college environment (e.g., increased responsibilities,
academic pressures) that are also known risk factors for substance use. In addition, US colleges are
witnessing national increases in nicotine, marijuana, and other drug use. Therefore, examining racial
discrimination as a risk factor for the use of multiple substances warrants greater empirical attention. The
proposed study aims to fill these knowledge gaps by leveraging ecological momentary assessment, a repeated
collection of real-time data, and advanced statistical analyses (e.g., multilevel modeling) to investigate how
racial discrimination “gets under the skin” to increase Black college students’ substance use risk. Aim 1
addresses concurrent and lagged effects at the between-person and within-person levels: (1) Do Black college
students who report higher experiences of racial discrimination on average (i.e., across time) report higher
levels of substance use (between-person effects)? (2) Do Black college students report substance use more
on days when they report more racial discrimination than usual (i.e., higher than their personal mean) (within-
person effects)? In response to national priorities that call for empirical investigations of mechanisms linking
racism to substance use and misuse in marginalized groups, this study draws on the Psychological Mediation
Framework to generate knowledge about the indirect effect of racial discrimination on substance use through
affective, social, and cognitive processes (Aim 2). This study represents an unprecedented opportunity to
collect repeated real-time data on racial discrimination, substance use (alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, other
drugs), and substance use patterns (e.g., types of use, quantity of use, co-use) among a subgroup of Black
Americans in a developmental period known to be associated with high-risk substance use. In line with NIDA’s
Racial Equity Initiative and 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, findings from this study will help identify specific
mechanisms as intervention targets to address substance use disparities related to racism in the US."

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play important roles in numerous physiological processes and are
known as polymodal sensors that integrate a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli in cellular signaling.
TRPV3, a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, is predominantly expressed in skin
keratinocytes and implicated in cutaneous sensation, including thermo-sensation, nociception, and itch, in
addition to maintenance of the skin barrier, wound healing, and hair growth. The dysfunction of TRPV3 channels,
often a result of genetic mutations, is associated with numerous human skin diseases, including a
genodermatosis known as Olmsted syndrome, psoriasis, skin tumors, hair loss, cutaneous pain, itch, pruritic and
atopic dermatitis, rosacea, and acne vulgaris. Furthermore, overexpression of TRPV3 is implicated in the
development and progression of colorectal and lung cancer. Targeting TRPV3 for disease treatment requires
detailed information about the structure and function of this channel. We plan to study the TRPV3 channel
structure and function using a combination of different biophysical and biochemical methods. Our specific aims
are: (1) determine the molecular mechanisms of TRPV3 activation by small molecules and disease-causing
mutations, (2) establish structural bases of TRPV3 activation by heat, and (3) elucidate structural mechanisms
of TRPV3 inhibition. To achieve our goals, we will use the Fluorescence-detection Size Exclusion
Chromatography (FSEC) and thermostability assays to assess expression, assembly, homogeneity and stability
of the TRPV3 protein, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain structures of TRPV3 with or without disease-
associated mutations, at different temperatures and in complex with different activators, modulators and
inhibitors, as well as site-directed mutagenesis combined with electrophysiology, including single-channel
recordings from planar lipid bilayers and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from HEK 293 cells, and ratiometric
measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM to assess
TRPV3 function and to critically test our structural models. Combining our structural and functional results, we
will decipher the mechanisms of TRPV3 regulation and gating. Achieving our aims will have a significant impact
on skin physiology and ion channel biophysics and will generate new knowledge that will assist in structure-
based drug design and help the development of new therapeutic strategies."
10793489,"More than 230,000 women in the US will be diagnosed with breast cancer and nearly 40,000 will die from the
disease annually. The majority of breast tumors express estrogen receptor α (ER), found in ~70-80% of all cases.
Women with ER+ tumors typically receive endocrine therapy (ET), such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen
(TAM). While initial survival rates are generally good, it is estimated that ~40% of ER+ tumors will relapse, with
almost half of these recurring after completing the standard 5 years of adjuvant ET. This risk for late relapse
suggests that in many cases a population of tumor cells can persist or tolerate ET agents, only to contribute to
relapse once ET is completed. This conclusion is supported by several studies showing that 10 yr of ET is
superior to 5 yr. In studying how early responses to the selective pressure of ET might contribute to ET-tolerance,
we found that activation of NFB was a common event in ER+ breast tumors of patients treated with neo-adjuvant
ET, as well as in ER+ breast cancer cell lines, patient derived organoids, and xenografts. This activation appears
to be the result of an expansion of NFB+ breast cancer cells that can proliferate and persist despite ET
treatment. Importantly, inhibiting NFB prevents relapse, as determined by the lack of regrowth of cells and
tumors once TAM treatment is terminated. Moreover, we found that a gene signature derived from ET-tolerant
cells was associated with high tumor grade and increased risk of relapse in patients with ER+ disease. Based
on these findings, we hypothesize that the selective pressure of ET allows for the expansion of NFB+, ET-
tolerant cell populations and that targeting these populations therapeutically will prevent relapse and disease
progression. To test this, we propose three aims: Aim 1. To define ET-tolerant cell populations in ER+ breast
cancer models; Aim 2. To determine the mechanism of NFB regulation and action in ET-tolerance; and Aim 3.
To investigate the consequences of targeting ET-tolerant cell populations. To address these aims, we will
perform single cell RNA-seq on ET-treatment naïve preclinical models under the selective pressure of short-term
ET and over time as adaptive resistance develops. We will then investigate the persistence of these populations
in preclinical models of ET-resistance and validate our findings in human primary and metastatic tumors. We will
also examine the hypothesis that NFB activity in ET-tolerant cells is a response to cellular stress caused by the
selective pressure of ET, as well as a protective player in response to that cellular stress. In addition, we will use
complementary genetic and small molecule inhibitors that inhibit the NFB pathway, as well as inhibitors of key
NFB regulators and effectors, to test the role of ET-tolerant cells in relapse and disease progression, using both
patient-derived tumors in immunocompromised mice and an immunocompetent mouse model. The successful
completion of these aims will establish i) a novel role for NFB in promoting ET-tolerance and disease relapse
of ER+ breast cancer, ii) mechanistic insight into the function of NFB in promoting ET tolerance, and iii) novel
strategies to target ET-tolerant cells to prevent recurrence of ER+ breast cancer."

Spatio-temporal control of gene expression is a fundamental process in biology. While the role of enhancers to
positively regulate gene expression has been appreciated for decades, silencers are conspicuously absent
from most models. A recent string of high-throughput screens in multiple systems has identified thousands of
silencers. Strikingly, a large number of these silencers fall within bifunctional cis-regulatory elements that also
act as enhancers in other cell types or developmental times. Silencers are also enriched for eQTLs and GWAS
hits, suggesting they are essential for understanding the genetics of complex disease. Silencers are distinct
from insulators, which prevent enhancer-promoter interactions. Silencers actively dampen expression of their
target genes and, like enhancers, act independently of position and orientation. Even though a large number of
silencers have been functionally identified in reporter assays, it is still difficult to predict new silencer elements.
While enhancers, promoters, and insulators can be predicted by ChIP-seq for specific histone post-
translational modifications, no chromatin modifications are known to be predictive of silencers. Additionally, the
set of DNA binding proteins and their cofactors at silencers is largely unknown. Identification of ChIP-seq target
that are highly predictive of silencers would vastly improve the ability of researchers to study these
fundamental elements in new contexts and can give insights into silencing mechanisms. In order to address
fundamental lingering questions regarding silencers, I will perform a proteomic survey to identify factors that
distinguish silencer and enhancer states of bifunctional cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila mesoderm. This
will give key insights into the mechanisms of silencer elements. I will also investigate the three-dimensional
contacts formed between silencers and their targets. It has already been observed that silencers bound by
Snail do not contact TSSs, but instead disrupt normal enhancer-promoter contacts, a process known as anti-
looping. Completion of this project will fill address many of the outstanding questions regarding silencer
elements, including the factors responsible for silencing and the effect they have on their target genes. This
project will uncover specific markers of silencers that will allow future investigators to identify them via ChIP-
seq similar to how other functional elements can be annotated. This research project will give valuable
experience in experimental design and analysis that I hope to carry with me into a career as an academic
investigator."

Small-intestine microbes play pivotal roles in human health, and can affect (and be affected by) factors such as
probiotics, diet, drugs, supplements, and botanicals. Probiotics, including engineered probiotics, act in the small
intestine and may support or compete with commensals and pathogens, as well as improve micronutrient
absorption. In contrast, an altered SI microbiota has been implicated in impairing the efficacy of supplemental
nutrition. Despite these important roles, studies of the human small-intestine microbiome are challenging
because this region of the gut is difficult to access and because the sequencing tools used to analyze stool
microbiomes are inappropriate for host-dominated mucosal samples. Critical gaps include knowing which
microbes colonize the human small-intestine mucosa, where those colonizers originate from, and which microbial
genes and/or environmental features enable them to persist there. These gaps must be addressed in humans
because mouse models of the small-intestine microbiome are severely hampered by coprophagy. One long-
standing hypothesis is that microbes from the oral cavity transit the acidic gauntlet of the stomach and colonize
the small intestine. However, this hypothesis remains contentious and unproven because it is difficult to
differentiate colonizers from dead microbes and endoscopies are known to introduce oral contaminants.
The primary goal of this R21 exploratory study is to document the first definitive observation of oral microbes
translocating and colonizing the SI. To accomplish this goal, we will utilize a combination of two innovative
technologies we have optimized for studying host-rich microbiomes: (1) quantitative sequencing for measuring
the absolute abundances of microbial taxa and differentiating it from contamination and (2) a microbial
enrichment method that enables the construction of high-quality microbial metagenome-assembled genomes
directly from host-rich samples. Identifying a definitive example of live oral-derived microbes colonizing the SI
will open new avenues for more complete characterization of human intestinal microbes and a framework for
further study of the relationship between oral and small-intestine microbial communities. For example, prebiotics
intended to nourish beneficial small-intestine microbes and probiotics can be rationally designed to not
inadvertently promote growth of oral pathobionts. Similarly, probiotic strains can be engineered to better compete
with the oral pathogens capable of colonizing the small intestine and also take advantage of administered
prebiotics. Ultimately, the findings from this R21 will improve the microbiome field’s understanding of how oral
microbes can affect interventions such as specialized diets, drugs, prebiotics, probiotics, dietary supplements,
and botanicals."

 Manganese (Mn) is an essential cofactor for many cellular processes, but at elevated concentrations is
known to exert neurotoxic effects on the brain. To date, population-based studies of Mn-exposed children and
welders have consistently shown that chronic Mn exposure (X) is associated with deficits in motor and
neurobehavioral outcomes (Y). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown that both Mn
exposure and outcomes are associated with brain Mn accumulation (M). While these associations have raised
interest in the development of imaging-based safety guidelines, it is presently unknown as to how brain Mn
accumulation may mediate the relationship between Mn exposure and motor and neurobehavior outcomes
(X→M→Y). This lack of understanding has led some to attempt complex, high-dimensional data analyses to
deconvolve the underlying relationships governing neurotoxicity in Mn-exposed individuals. However, few so far
have accounted for common genetic variants that are likely to have significant moderating effects. Importantly,
Mn levels are known to be influenced by iron (Fe) levels and the expression of Fe-regulatory proteins. Chemically
similar, Mn and Fe move between intra- and extracellular compartments through shared transport mechanisms.
The human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) is an Fe-regulatory protein that negatively regulates mechanisms
facilitating Mn entry into the brain. The HFE histidine-to-aspartate substitution at position 63 (H63D) is a
commonly carried gene variant that results in HFE partial loss-of-function. Thus, the central hypothesis of this
fellowship application is that HFE H63D moderates the relationships between welding, brain Mn accumulation,
and neurobehavioral and motor outcomes. In doing so, H63D may moderate the neurotoxic effects of prolonged
Mn exposure. Uncovering these effects is of particular"

This application directly stems from our recent publication in Nature in which we analyzed bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid from 88 patients with critical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia using a combination of flow cytometry,
bulk transcriptomic profiling of flow sorted alveolar macrophages and, in some patients, single cell RNA-
sequencing. We compared these data with analogous samples collected from 211 patients with pneumonia
secondary to other pathogens before and during the pandemic with a goal of identifying unique pathobiologic
features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Using these data, we generated the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 causes
a slowly unfolding, spatially limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and
cross-reactive T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation. We
address key questions from this hypothesis in three interrelated Specific Aims.
Aim 1. To determine whether alveolar macrophage infection and activation of cross-reactive memory T
cells drive alveolar macrophage/T cells circuits in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We will examine
the role of cross-reactive antibodies in mediating alveolar macrophage infection with SARS-CoV-2. We will also
examine the role of cross-reactive memory T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in
establishing and maintaining positive feedback loops between T cells and infected alveolar macrophages and
the role of these signaling loops in initiating persistent lung and systemic inflammation.
Aim 2. To determine whether calcium channel activation by the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 is
necessary for activation of IL-1β in human alveolar macrophages. We will infect human alveolar
macrophages with mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses lacking calcium channel activity in the envelope protein and
measure their generation of IL-1β in human alveolar macrophage in vitro.
Aim 3. To determine whether a pharmacologic inhibitor of CRAC channel activation can attenuate
alveolitis in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by disrupting circuits between infected
alveolar macrophages and cross-reactive T cells. We are actively enrolling in a clinical trial to determine the
biologic effects of a small molecule inhibitor of CRAC channel activation using sequential analysis of BAL fluid
collected from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. We will use novel data
science approaches to integrate the clinical and genomic data generated from this study.
We have assembled a unique group of investigators with expertise in lung immunology, clinical trials, calcium
channels and virology. Our studies will explore possible reasons for the observed variability in disease severity
after SARS-CoV-2 infection, offer mechanisms to credential CRAC channel inhibitors as both anti-inflammatory
and possible antiviral therapeutics in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and provide a framework
for future clinical trials designed using biomarkers derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid."

Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of great majority of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and poses a great
threat to public health. Activation of thermogenic adipocytes reduces cholesterol levels and protects against
atherosclerosis in animal models. Lower thermogenic adipocyte activity in dyslipidemic patients has been
characterized by high plasma triglycerides (TG), low plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
concentration and lower uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. These findings in mice and humans
underscore the importance of inducers of the thermogenic adipocyte program as potential therapeutic targets for
the treatment of dyslipidemia and CVD. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that follistatin (Fst)
plays an important role not only in adipocyte browning but also in lipoprotein metabolism to regulate TG, total
cholesterol (TC), and HDL-C levels. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that Fst-induced
adipose browning protects against the development of atherosclerosis. We will test our hypothesis under these
Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will determine the role of Fst in adipose browning, lipoprotein metabolism and
development of atherosclerosis. We will determine the effects of Fst tissue and systemic overexpression using
mouse low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient WT and adipose-specific transgenic (FstAdQTg ) mice,
and adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1)-FST344 injected LDLR-/- mice respectively to determine the role of Fst on
i) adipose browning, plasma lipoprotein, TG, and TC levels, ii) tissue (adipose, aorta, and liver), plasma
metabolites and iii) gene expression during diet-induced development of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Effect
of transient loss of Fst on browning, lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis progression will be analyzed in
mPCSK9 injected Fstfl/fl / CreAdQ mice. Aim 2: We will determine the molecular mechanisms by which Fst confer
the pro-browning and anti-atherogenic effects. We will test whether arginase 1 (Arg 1)/beta-adrenergic receptor
(β-AR)/ p38MAPK/FGF21 signaling pathway confer Fst-induced pro-browning and antiatherogenic action in the
three animal models. We will utilize gene aortic lesion and gene metabolite correlation dataset obtained from
system genetics approach of atherosclerosis hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) to identify key Fst-regulated
genes and metabolites. We will perform comprehensive RNA-sequence analysis, and tissue and plasma
metabolite analysis combined with pharmacological inhibition studies to identify novel genes and metabolites
involved during Fst-induced adipose browning and its anti-atherogenic actions.
Our proposed studies will provide significant novel insights into the pro-browning and anti-atherogenic role of Fst
and identify key molecular targets involved in favorably altering lipoprotein metabolism and the development of
atherosclerosis. Inhibition of atherosclerosis development by using Fst protein/peptide is an attractive therapeutic
avenue. Data obtained after successful completion of this project provide rationale for therapeutic drug design
for the treatment of atherosclerosis and enable us to submit highly competitive RO1-like grant applications."

Cardiac inotrope medications used to augment heart contractility during recovery from cardiac surgery carry
steep tradeoffs between risks (e.g., myocardial ischemia, malignant arrhythmia) and benefits (e.g., enhanced
perfusion to vital organs). Inotrope use is often locally standardized within hospitals based on institutional
preferences, rather than individualized to patient-specific risks and benefits. While inotropes are necessary for a
minority of patients with advanced cardiogenic shock to survive past the operating room, on average, inotropes
are independently associated with 3-fold increased mortality (absolute rate 5.0%) and major complications
(18%). For the majority of the 300,000 US patients undergoing cardiac surgeries each year, limited evidence
exists to support or refute the ability of inotropes to improve outcomes. As a result, inotrope practice patterns
vary widely across institutions, contributing to wide variation in rates of mortality and complications.
There is a critical need to understand inotrope use in modern, generalizable cardiac surgery populations, and
identify patient-specific contexts in which inotropes are helpful versus harmful. Without such information,
unwarranted variation in inotrope use for cardiac surgery will remain high, and opportunities to reduce risk of
major complications related to their use (or non-use) will be missed. A paradigm shift to address this need
remains possible through (i) availability of preoperative patient risk factor data, detailed minute-to-minute
perioperative data, and high-quality outcomes registry data; and (ii) channels to access frontline clinicians
capable of describing local practice patterns, structural factors, and attitudes towards inotrope use. Such an
understanding requires integration of multicenter cardiac surgery research and quality collaboratives to validate
findings in a large, contemporary cardiac surgical cohort, while engaging clinician stakeholders in the process.
We propose a multicenter study which leverages the integration of two unique, mature research and quality
improvement collaboratives built upon standardized national registries: the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes
Group (MPOG) and the Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgical Database. MPOG uses
nurse-validated, detailed minute-to-minute intraoperative and early ICU data from the EHR for research and
quality improvement. With University of Michigan as the Coordinating Center and guided by Research Director
PI Mathis, MPOG has integrated over 21 million patient records across >40 health systems in 23 states and
provides quality improvement feedback reports to >7,000 frontline anesthesiology clinicians. In addition, MPOG
has integrated each member hospital’s STS clinical registry to create a unique national “MPOG-STS” dataset.
We will (i) identify patient, clinician, and institution phenotypes associated with inotrope practice patterns (choice,
timing) in cardiac surgery; (ii) characterize and quantify institutional barriers to inotrope practice change; and (iii)
estimate context-specific causal effects of inotropes on outcomes through a novel integration of cardiac surgical
databases, which address unmeasured confounders that have historically biased previous observational studies."
10798859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kennedy’s disease also known as spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease caused by genetic polyglutamine expansion of the androgen receptor
(AR). Recent research has shown that the mutant AR protein misfolds, aggregates, and
abnormally interacts with other proteins, leading to hormone-dependent lower motor neuron
degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy. Currently, there are no treatments available to stop
or slow the progression of SBMA, therefore, there is dire unmet medical need to discover novel
therapeutic agents. The AR pathway is currently a very important area being studied in SBMA.
Experimental studies for the treatment of SBMA have focused on interaction of the AR with
testosterone. Removal of testosterone in animal models through castration appears to be
protective and potentially restores some lost function. Knockout of AR in SBMA patient-derived
stem cells differentiated into neurons reverse the neurotoxic effects of the mutant AR. This led to
the use of antiandrogenic therapies for the SBMA treatment.
Our objective is to evaluate novel selective AR degraders (SARDs) using preclinical models for
the treatment of SBMA and evaluate their mechanism of action. Design, synthesis,
characterization, and structure-activity relationship studies of approximately 60 AR-targeting
small molecules provided necessary information to advance to the next stage of structure activity
relationship (SAR) optimization. The SARDs have been extensively studied in advanced prostate
cancer (PCa) models. Importantly, the SARDs, unlike any other molecule targeting the AR, bind
to the AR activation function-1 (AF-1) domain in the N-terminus domain (NTD) region and degrade
the AR via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The SARDs are orally bioavailable with
pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-like properties suitable for further optimization. The molecules
also exhibited excellent efficacy in vivo SBMA model.
In this application, we will perform SAR studies to identify and optimize a molecule that is effective
against SBMA in vitro (aim-1) and in vivo (aim 2) models at much lower concentrations than the
1st generation molecules. We will also perform studies to elucidate the mechanism of action of
SARDs and AR (aim 3) in SBMA. We have put together an outstanding team that has extensive
experience in hormone receptor and musculoskeletal research (Dr. Narayanan), AR medicinal
chemistry (Dr. Miller), stem cell biology (Dr. Johnson), animal neurobehavior (Dr. Mulligan), and
pharmacokinetics (Dr. Tan)."
10800742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The parasitic infection schistosomiasis afflicts over 200 million people worldwide and is clinically treated using
a single drug, praziquantel (±PZQ). Although ±PZQ has served as a stalwart anthelmintic for decades, the
molecular basis of action of this drug remains undefined. This lack of mechanistic knowledge impedes rational
design of alternative therapeutics and is worrisome in the face of emergence of schistosome strains exhibiting
refractoriness to ±PZQ exposure given ±PZQ is ineffective against all parasitic life cycle stages. Insight into the
targets of ±PZQ action, and their effectors, is therefore needed to develop improved anthelmintic therapies.
This R01 application is based around preliminary data supporting a premise that PZQ is a serotonin-like ligand
in both the parasite and the human host. Our laboratory has recently identified targets for both R-PZQ and S-
PZQ, the two enantiomers in the clinical formulation of ±PZQ. R-PZQ is a ligand at the human 5-HT2B G protein
coupled receptor (5-HT2B GPCR), and S-PZQ is a serotonergic regulator of the human transient receptor
potential melastatin 8 ion channel (TRPM8). These findings are significant as they (i) provide clues to the likely
targets of PZQ enantiomers in the parasite (5-HT GPCRs & TRP channels) and (ii) demonstrate that PZQ does
not act as a selective antiparasitic, but also is active in the host. Notably ±PZQ acutely changes blood vessel
tone within the mesenteric blood vessels where the adult worms reside. Chronic engagement of 5-HT GPCRs
in hepatic stellate cells inhibited fibrotic changes caused by inflammatory reactions to worm eggs deposited in
host tissues. Coalescing such beneficial host and deleterious parasitic activities provides a novel route to
generating improved antiparasitic therapies that kill worms and prevent the tissue damage they cause.
Based on our discoveries, we will map the binding sites of R-PZQ on 5-HT2BR, and S-PZQ on TRPM8 and use
these binding poses to identify similar binding architectures in schistosome bioaminergic GPCRs (Aim 1) and
TRP channels (Aim 2). Following this strategy, we have recently identified a schistosome TRP channel that is
regulated by PZQ (10) – the first target of PZQ ever identified in a flatworm. Finally, we will address the
clinical significance of host bioactivity of anthelmintics (Aim 3) in terms of acute effects on the vasculature, and
chronic effects on hepatic stellate cells that initiate fibrogenic changes underpinning many of the pathologies of
chronic schistosomiasis. Our collaborative team bring together expertise in 5-HT2B receptor structure, TRP
channel biology and blood vessel physiology to execute activities from molecular (receptor structure) to in vivo
pathology (mechanisms regulating parasite infection and liver disease). If successful, our activities will resolve
targets and effectors for ±PZQ that will enable development of better anthelmintic therapies and adjuncts."

Hearing loss is highly prevalent, yet few older adults use hearing aids and disparities in hearing care exist.
Asian Americans have the lowest prevalence of hearing aid use and are one of the fastest-growing segments
of the aging population in the United States. Older Korean Americans (KAs), as predominantly monolingual
first-generation immigrants, represent a population, like other ethnic minority and immigrant populations, who
face barriers to hearing care related to limited English proficiency, poor health literacy, navigational difficulties,
and poverty. The need for affordable, accessible hearing care to meet the needs of more communities is
recognized nationally and community health worker models of care serve a key role in extending access and
delivering culturally responsive care. The HEARS intervention (Hearing Health Equity through Accessible
Research and Solution) is a theory-driven, evidence-based hearing care intervention designed for delivery
through a peer educator model of care that uses over-the-counter hearing technology. HEARS was developed
in-part by the multiple PI team and has since been adapted for delivery to older KAs through faith-based
organizations (K-HEARS). An NIH Stage IB pilot study demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered hearing care intervention specifically designed for
dyads, an older adult with hearing loss and their communication partner, delivered through ethnic churches. To
build upon these findings, we now propose an NIH Stage III efficacy trial, a 2-arm cluster randomized trial, with
440 dyads of older KAs with hearing loss and their communication partners. Our proposal has the following
aims: Aim 1: To test the effect of K-HEARS on improving communication function and health-related quality of
life among older KAs with hearing loss in comparison to a 6-month delayed treatment group. The trial is
powered to detect a 0.32 effect size or greater score difference on the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the
Elderly-Screening between the immediate and delayed treatment groups at 6 months. Aim 2: To evaluate the
effect of K-HEARS on improving third-party disability (i.e., disability of family or friends due to the health
condition of their significant other) and health-related quality of life among communication partners in
comparison to a 6-month delayed treatment group. Exploratory Aim 1: To test the effect of K-HEARS on the
dyad relationship, as measured by mutuality, 6-months post-intervention. Exploratory Aim 2: To identify the
barriers and facilitators of an ethnic church-based CHW model of hearing care to inform future implementation
and dissemination. This project leverages a multidisciplinary bilingual team of investigators and community
partners with a demonstrated track record. The delivery of hearing care through faith-based organizations has
not been done and no prior research has systematically designed and tested a hearing care intervention
using CHWs with over-the-counter hearing technology in a dyadic sample. The proposed study will inform how
we build local capacity to address the needs of underserved older adults and their loved ones."

Cachexia is a devastating complication of cancers and other inflammatory conditions that is defined by rapid
and persistent loss of fat and muscle that is not reversed by caloric supplementation. Cachexia is a major
determinant of both lifespan and quality of life that compromises the ability of patients to recover from life-
saving or extending interventions. Although descriptions of cachexia go back as far as Hippocrates, the
mechanisms underlying this catabolic state are poorly understood, and there remain no effective treatments.
Over 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) suffer from cachexia at some point
during their cancer journey, adding significant morbidity and mortality to an already dire disease. We have
recently found that PDAC alters the ability of the body to utilize fat stores as fuels. The ability of an organism to
survive metabolic challenges, including low nutrition or infection, is dependent upon accessing energy stored in
fat and oxidizing it in the liver. In this proposal we will investigate the role of this altered lipid metabolism in
PDAC-associated cachexia and examine the relationship between adipose tissue, the liver, and skeletal
muscle preservation. The significance of this proposal resides in its use of genetic and metabolomic tools and
a unique patient tissue resource to investigate an unexplored area of the cancer macroenvironment with new
collaborations and efforts directed at isolating and defining the interorgan processes that enable resilience to
physiologic threats. The long-term goal of our research is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how lipid
metabolism impacts skeletal muscle homeostasis in normal physiology and how this is modified in cancer
cachexia in order to develop more effective therapeutic approaches."
10801506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), characterized
by recurrent epigastric discomfort consisting of any one or a combination of postprandial fullness, early
satiation, and/or epigastric pain or burning, in the absence of a clear structural etiology. Despite the high
prevalence, there is a lack of treatment options available to patients for whom traditional pharmacological
interventions have failed due to either lack of efficacy or uncontrollable side effects. While many non-
pharmacological therapies have shown promise for DGBI, including FD, the efficacy of any single-modality
treatment is typically modest. Finding a way to boost clinical outcomes for these therapeutic modalities is a
crucially important goal. As FD is a multifactorial condition with visceral, affective, and cognitive components,
we propose that multimodal neurophysiologically-informed strategies – e.g. combining bottom-up and top-down
approaches - will enhance benefits by targeting different, but convergent, neural pathways that contribute to
FD symptomatology. To date, however, better integration of bottom-up and top-down strategies has been
hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of how they interact to improve FD symptoms, presenting a
knowledge gap that, when filled, could help optimize care by illuminating approaches that are most likely to
have a synergistic salubrious effect. Specifically, we propose a randomized, single-blinded, 2x2 sham-
controlled trial to investigate the potential synergy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS,
bottom-up) with GI-targeted cognitive-behavioral therapy (GI-CBT, top-down). We will evaluate the longitudinal
effects (8 weeks) of taVNS+CBT (or controls) on post-meal gut-brain physiology and clinical outcomes.
Furthermore, we will examine the role of GI-specific anxiety in anticipating (i.e. change at 4 weeks) and thus
predicting clinical improvements following 8 weeks of therapy, as well as mediating post-therapy changes in
gut-brain physiology and clinical outcomes. In our study, we will exploit our fully non-invasive experimental
framework including sequential gastric and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The significance of our
proposal is high as it will provide a mechanistic framework for how taVNS and CBT, both separately and
synergistically, modulate FD pathophysiology, leading to future clinical trials to evaluate this integrated
multimodal intervention for difficult to treat chronic GI disorders, such as FD."

 Consumption of an obesity-promoting “Western diet” (WD) is strongly associated with cognitive
impairment and dementia risk, even independent of obesity 1-5. The hippocampus (HPC), a brain region
classically associated with memory function and more recently with energy balance, is particularly vulnerable
to the negative effects of WD consumption 4, 6. Emerging evidence from both humans and rodent models
identifies the juvenile and adolescent stages as especially vulnerable developmental periods for WD-induced
HPC dysfunction 5, 7-9. Our preliminary results presented herein reveal that juvenile and adolescent WD
consumption is associated with long-lasting memory impairments and hyperphagia during adulthood.
Remarkedly, these negative outcomes are present in the absence of obesity and persist despite a healthy diet
intervention beginning at adult onset. This proposal will discover the biological mechanisms mediating early
life WD-induced programming of disordered memory performance and eating behavior during adulthood.
 We recently discovered a functional link between early life sugar consumption, the gut microbiome, and
HPC dysfunction 10. Applying an analogous approach with our novel early life WD model (sugar + saturated fat
+ processed foods), we have identified substantial gut microbiome changes in early life WD-fed vs. control rats,
including alterations in bacterial populations that are correlated with HPC-dependent memory performance.
The functional relevance of these results will be mechanistically evaluated in this proposal. Given that WD-
induced microbiome changes are associated with changes in brain acetylcholine (ACh) signaling 11, and that
HPC ACh signaling promotes memory function 12-18, additional experiments will explore our novel hypothesis
that aberrant HPC ACh signaling is a neural basis for WD-associated HPC dysfunction. This hypothesis is
supported by our preliminary results showing that early life WD yields long-lasting reductions in markers of
ACh tone, and that nonspecific cholinergic receptor agonism reverses early life WD-associated HPC-dependent
memory impairments. Proposed experiments utilize state-of-the-art in vivo imaging and pharmacological
approaches to identify mechanisms linking early life WD consumption, HPC dysfunction, and ACh signaling.
 In addition to regulating memory function, the HPC has emerged as a key brain region in the higher-
order control of food intake 6, 19. Our preliminary results show that early life WD consumption yields increased
caloric intake driven by elevated meal size, an effect that persists even after a healthy diet intervention.
Additional preliminary data reveal that HPC ACh binding dynamically increases throughout the course of a
meal, and this effect is highly predictive of meal size. We will expand these results by evaluating how early life
WD influences dynamic HPC ACh binding during meal consumption and sensitivity to various physiological
satiation signals. Collective results from the proposal will identify novel neurobiological mechanisms through
which the early life dietary environment programs for impaired cognition and altered energetic outcomes."

 Hypoxic ischemic (HI) insult damages both white matter and grey matter in infants and causes significant
mortality and morbidity. To investigate the pathological mechanisms of neonatal HI injury and find satisfactory
treatments, animal models of neonatal HI injury have been established and widely used. In this project, novel in
vivo magnetic resonance imaging techniques that target tissue microstructure and water exchange between
intra- and extra-cellular spaces will be developed to examine the progression of HI injury and the effects of
therapeutic hypothermia in a neonatal mouse model.
 In aim 1, we will develop diffusion MRI (dMRI) based techniques to measure microstructural changes and
water exchange and validated the techniques using histology. We will use these techniques to characterize the
extent and severity of cell death and to predict tissue survival in edema regions. In aim 2, we will further validate
the dMRI techniques developed in aim 1 using maps of metabolites and lipids generated using mass
spectrometry imaging. In aim 3, the techniques developed in the first two aims will be applied to characterize HI
injury in mice treated with hypothermia to study its effects and elucidate its neuroprotective mechanisms.
 We expect the project to extend our knowledge on the relationships between HI pathology and diagnostic
markers in this mouse model and shed light on the mechanisms of HI injury and therapeutic hypothermia. This
information and techniques developed in this project will be useful to design effective strategies for intervention
and to monitor treatment response in studies using this or similar models."

White adipose tissue has a central role in maintaining whole-body metabolic health. Thus, it is
critical to understand how adipocyte develops and how it remodels in response to high caloric
diet. Accumulating evidence indicates that epigenetics plays a critical role in orchestrating these
processes, however, the mechanisms by which it does so remain largely unknown. In the last
funding cycle, we have demonstrated how the enzymatic effectors of DNA methylation regulates
multiple aspects of adipose biology, including insulin sensitivity and WAT browning. The goal of
this proposal is to better understand how epigenetics controls adipose tissue development and
remodeling under chronic nutrition and its impact on metabolism, focusing specifically on TET3,
an active DNA demethylase. Consistent with our initial discovery finding an increased Tet3
expression during adipogenesis of naïve APCs, we noted a pro-adipogenic function for TET3
using primary APCs. Moreover, reduced WAT development was observed in mice deficient for
Tet3 in APC cells, but not Tet1- or Tet2, nor deficient for Tet3 in mature adipocytes. WAT from
Pdgfra-Tet3 KO mice on a high fat diet (HFD) had reduced adipose mass and adipocyte number,
with decreased signs of fibro-inflammation, suggesting that Tet3 deficiency prevents unhealthy
adipose expansion. Further, these KO mice on HFD dramatically improved insulin resistance and
glucose intolerance compared to WT mice. In line with these morphological and metabolic
changes in KO mice, our transcription and DNA methylation profiling studies revealed that TET3
targets a defined set of key target genes, including many genes involved in extracellular
remodeling (ECM). Based on these novel and exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that
TET3 is a critical epigenetic regulator of adipocyte development and remodeling by regulating
important target genes. To test our hypothesis, Aim1 will firmly establish the role of TET3 function
in adipogenesis using various Tet3 conditional knockout and lineage tracing mouse models. Aim2
will elucidate transcriptional and epigenetic basis of TET3 function by the use of transcriptomic
and epigenomic approaches. Aim 3 will investigate the TET3 targets critical for adipogenesis and
remodeling, and Aim 4 will examine the metabolic consequence of reduced adipogenesis from
Tet3 deficiency. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide novel therapeutic
targets for metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes."

The primary contributors to age-related imbalance remain poorly understood because nearly all contributors to
balance deteriorate with age, including sensory inputs, central processing, motor outputs, biomechanics,
cardiovascular function, and cognition. This proposal examines the contributions of age-related sensory
dysfunction and changes in central sensory processing to imbalance and falls. While vestibular, visual, and
somatosensory contributions to imbalance will be broadly studied, vestibular (head motion and orientation
cues) contributions are emphasized because these potentially important mechanisms have often been
overlooked. This topic is timely because new therapeutics (vestibular prosthetics, hair cell regeneration, non-
invasive brain stimulation) are moving into clinical trials, so knowledge resulting from our project will provide a
foundation for the long-term goal of mitigating fall risk by assigning patients to targeted interventions. While this
project is focused on understanding imbalance in older adults, it will also advance knowledge about the
general neural principles underlying balance. Two specific aims will be studied: Aim 1) Investigate the
contributions of vestibular, somatosensory, and visual dysfunction to imbalance in older adults and those with a
history of falls; and Aim 2) Investigate how standing balance is impacted by deficits in central sensory
processing and closed-loop control in older adults. To investigate these aims, a large cohort of older adults,
including those with a history of falls associated with loss of balance, will be studied using several synergistic
methods, including sensory (vestibular, visual, somatosensory) and non-sensory (muscle strength, cardiac and
cognitive function) assays and quantitative measures of posture, gait, and falls. A sensitive threshold test will
be used to quantify each individual’s sensory function on a continuum (rather than a binary classification) and
can be applied across sensory modalities using consistent physical units, offering a major advantage over
other experimental approaches. Deficits in central sensory integration will be studied using closed-loop
computational models applied to experimental data. A template for the effects of vestibular damage on
imbalance will be developed by testing young adults with peripheral vestibular damage who are otherwise
healthy, allowing imbalance to be partitioned into that arising from vestibular dysfunction vs. other non-
vestibular age-related sensory decline. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion,
because it: 1) determines how imbalance depends on the continuum of vestibular, visual and somatosensory
function – a personalized, holistic understanding of imbalance; 2) develops strategies to study dysfunction in
central sensory integration that will determine if the brain is correctly weighting sensory information based on
the quality of each sensory cue; and 3) advances a theoretical framework in which sensory measures and
imbalance are related to neural noise/variability. These studies will help elucidate how sensory dysfunction and
central integration contribute to imbalance in older adults, toward the long-term goal of mitigating fall risk."

 The Food and Drug Administration's approval of Luxturna marked a new era in the fight to cure blindness
caused by inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). However, despite an approved treatment for RPE65-
mediated disease, there are still over 280 molecularly distinct, currently untreatable IRDs that cause vision loss
from progressive death of the rod, cone, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Further, treatment with
Luxturna does not fully restore vision to normal levels in RPE65-mediated disease, particularly for foveal cone
vision, and there is variability between patients in the amount of vision gained post-treatment.
 Numerous therapeutic approaches, including gene therapies similar to Luxturna, are under development
for IRDs. To maximize chances of success, it is critical to understand the natural sequence of degeneration in
each disease, both to optimize the timing and retinal location of applied therapies as well as to enable precise
evaluation of whether the therapies had an effect.
 We will use multi-modal adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to simultaneously
observe the cone inner segment (IS) and waveguiding outer segment (OS) mosaics and RPE mosaics to
identify AO structural phenotypes in IRDs. We will also use AO microperimetry and optoretinography to test
photoreceptor function in the same IRD patients. Finally, we will measure the AO structural and functional
responses to Luxturna gene therapy for RPE65-mediated disease and AAV2.hCHM gene therapy for
choroideremia. Based on our preliminary and published data, we hypothesize that cone function correlates with
structural phenotype, cones exhibit dysfunction prior to their structural loss, gene therapy will slow or halt
structural degeneration, and gene therapy will reverse photoreceptor dysfunction at retinal locations where
cells are structurally intact but functionally compromised. The information gained through our studies will
enable cellular scale assessment of the safety and efficacy of gene therapy and the will validate AO cellular
scale outcome measures for use in future clinical trials."

Glaucoma is a silent, underdiagnosed, costly and debilitating disease. The prevalence of glaucoma is expected
to reach 80 million by 2020. Direct economic costs for the approximately 2 million US citizens with glaucoma
amount to $2.9 billion. The disease is complex and to date, treatment options for the disease only include
reducing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). However, patients are sometimes resistant to conventional drug
therapies, and it is crucial to identify therapies and develop new treatments for glaucoma that can save retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) from neurodegeneration. Our relevant proposed studies will provide a foundation for
developing a new glaucoma therapeutic that is a neurotrophic factor, human Neuritin 1 (hNRN1). The
utilization of hNRN1 is twofold; firstly, it enables the development of a soluble therapy that can promote
neuroregeneration of RGCs, and secondly, we can validate the neuroprotective effect in control and
glaucomatous RGCs under normal and elevated translaminar pressure conditions. These studies will
substantiate the therapeutic potential of this therapy for future patient-specific translational research. Further,
we will utilize our established novel ex vivo human perfusion model. This model allows for independent
regulation of both simulated IOP and intracranial pressure in human donor eyes, which can exploit the effects
of translaminar pressure on RGCs by mimicking the in vivo glaucomatous paradigm. The combined use of
stem cell technology, collagen constructs, and human donor eye perfusion model is an original approach to
study glaucoma. Our goal is to validate the therapeutic effects of neuritin1 in patient RGCs. Our central
hypothesis is that increased hNRN1 expression exerts a protective effect against human RGC
degeneration caused by glaucomatous NT deprivation and elevated translaminar pressure. To examine
this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
AIM 1: Determine the neuro-regenerative role of human NRN1 in glaucomatous hiPSC-RGCs.
AIM 2: Determine the therapeutic role of hNRN1 to rescue degeneration of HTG RGCs from elevated IOP.
AIM 3: Assess the therapeutic potential of hNRN1 in preventing NTG RGC neurodegeneration.
Our powerful tools and valuable stem cell resources will have enormous potential for breakthrough discovery.
Utilizing hNRN1 as a therapeutic to overcome glaucomatous degeneration of RGCs will allow us to exploit the
most significant resources that can be translatable to clinical studies. It will offer a foundation for deciphering
survival and regeneration of RGCs due to glaucomatous neurodegeneration."

10807092,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
In the current proposal, we will use systems biological approaches to address two fundamental issues in
vaccinology. The first issue concerns the immunology of COVID-19 vaccines, which utilize novel platforms
(mRNA) or adjuvants (Matrix M used in the Novavax vaccine). The second issue is related to the role of the
microbiome on vaccine immunity. With respect to the first issue, despite the rapid development of COVID-
19 vaccines, there is a paucity of understanding about the mechanisms by which they induce innate and
adaptive responses. Furthermore, the nature of the immune response induced by mRNA vaccines in special
populations such as those with serious allergies is unknown. It is conceivable that in such populations, a
predisposition towards Th2 responses, could alter the quality of the immune response. Interestingly,
there have been reports of rare but severe allergic reactions to vaccination, in individuals with an atopic
background. Therefore, we will assess immunity to the BNT162b2 vaccine atopic versus healthy subjects. In
the case of the Matrix-M adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax, there is a
paucity of understanding of innate immune mechanisms stimulated by the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant.
We will analyze samples collected from a Novavax sponsored clinical trial of their investigational subunit
COVID-19 vaccine in South African adults.
 The second theme of the proposal is focused on the impact of the microbiome on immunity to
vaccination in healthy adults. Our recent work involving antibiotics driven ablation of the microbiota has
highlighted an important role for the microbiome in modulating immune responses to vaccination with the
seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immune response against seasonal influenza vaccine in adults
represents a recall response, because of prior exposure to influenza. The impact of the microbiome on a
primary immune response, such as the response to rabies vaccination, is unknown. These issues will be
addressed in the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Systems biological assessment of innate responses to vaccination against COVID-19.
Sub-aim 1a: Multi-omics assessment of innate responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in atopic vs.
healthy adults.
Sub-aim 1b: Multi-omics assessment of innate responses to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.
Aim 2: Systems biological assessment of the impact of the microbiota on innate immunity to rabies
vaccination."
10807095,"ABSTRACT – Project 2
The goal of Project 2 is to assess T cell responses in the context of proposed studies of: (i) COVID-19
vaccines that utilize novel platforms (mRNA) or adjuvants (Matrix M used in the Novavax vaccine) and (ii)
Humans given broad spectrum antibiotics that disrupt their microbiome, prior to and during rabies vaccination.
This goal is highly synergistic with those of Projects 1 and 3, which will evaluate innate and B cell responses
respectively, in the context of the same clinical trials. We will use new developed state-of-the-art techniques
that will allow us to probe the vaccine responses here with an unprecedented scale and depth. The three
methods are: (1) spheromer probes for specific T cells, (2) GLIPH (for Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions by
Paratope Hotspots) analysis of TCR specificity groups, and (3) immune organoids. We will apply these tools in
the following aims:
Aim 1: Assessment of T cell responses to vaccination against COVID-19.
Sub-aim 1a. Analyze T cell responses induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in healthy versus atopic
individuals. We will use the spheromer technology mentioned above, to create and use a panel of pMHC
Spheromers SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes covering the major class I and II HLA alleles, to analyze the T cell
response, in healthy versus atopic subjects. In addition, we will perform TCR repertoire analysis using GLIPH2
to analyze both bulk and single cell TCR sequences in order to define the frequency, phenotype, function and
TCR diversity of antigen specific T cell responses to primary and secondary vaccination in blood and the
draining lymph nodes of both healthy adults and allergy prone subjects.
Sub-aim 1b: Assessment of T cell responses induced by the Novavax Matrix-M adjuvanted subunit vaccine.
We will also analyze samples collected from a Novavax sponsored trial done at the University of Witwatersrand
with spheromers and TCR sequence analysis and determine how the response to an adjuvanted subunit
vaccine differs from that induced by mRNA vaccination
Aim 2: Assessment of the impact of the microbiota on the antigen-specific T cell response to
vaccination. We will assess the impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the primary T cell response to rabies
vaccination. In particular, we will analyze the TCR repertoire and phenotype of T cells responding to this
vaccine, since there are clear indications that the microbiome can influence T cell phenotype, and we
hypothesize that there might be an influence on the repertoire as well."
10807098,"ABSTRACT – Project 3
The focus of Project 3 is to study antigen-specific B cell and plasma cell responses in the context of two timely
and fundamental topics in vaccinology: (i) Immunology of COVID-19 vaccines, and (ii) the impact of the
microbiota on immune responses to vaccination. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), and the vaccines developed to combat this pathogen, have underscored a need for
greater understanding of primary antibody responses in humans. We will use a systematic panel of cutting-
edge humoral immunity analyses to thoroughly characterize antibodies elicited by two CoV-2 vaccines,
and the B cell and plasma cell clonal populations required for B cell memory and sustained antibody
titers. Our focus will be on the serological, B cell and plasma cell responses elicited by a lipid nanoparticle mRNA
vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), and a Matrix M-adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine (Novavax). Combining these
analyses with studies of innate immunity (Project 1) and T cell (Project 2) responses to these vaccines should
highlight cellular mechanisms correlated with the strength and durability of antibody responses. Rare serious
anaphylactoid adverse reactions have been reported for mRNA vaccines, particularly in individuals with a history
of food allergy, and those with IgG antibodies specific for polyethylene glycol (PEG). We will examine potential
B cell contributions to these anaphylactoid reactions, using specimens from affected individuals who
received SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccines. Finally, we will address the role of the microbiome on humoral
immunity to vaccination, with a similar strategy of serological, memory B cell and plasma cell analyses
in participants with or without temporarily ablated microbiota following antibiotic treatment. Of particular
importance in the aforementioned studies, we will not only analyze peripheral blood B cells and plasmablasts,
but also monitor lymph node germinal center reactions by fine-needle aspiration, and sample bone
marrow plasma cells in the same participants, to comprehensively study humoral immunity to
vaccination in humans.
The combined impact of these investigations will likely be clinically significant in guiding the development of
future vaccination strategies by uncovering the B cell and plasma cell specificities, differentiation pathways, and
longevity stimulated by new SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, and in clarifying the role of the microbiome in
vaccine responses to novel antigens."
10807100,"ABSTRACT – Data Management and Analysis Core.
Identifying the biological features of the human immune response that correlate with and predict the
development of an effective immune response to vaccination is an overarching goal of this U19 consortium.
The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) in this proposal has two roles to support this overarching
goal. First, the core will provide reliable data management service for all the data generated by the U19 study.
It will provide management of large amounts of de-identified data, along with timely data submission to NIH
databases. Second, the DMAC will apply a suite of computational tools to analyze data from human samples of
serum, plasma, or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and individual immune cells obtained before and
after vaccination to create new knowledge about the biological basis for effective vaccine-mediated immunity.
To achieve these goals, we have assembled a team of computational biologists and immunologists with deep
expertise in the generation and analysis of highly complex datasets of transcript abundance and metabolic
profiles, who will support Projects 1, 2, and 3 in the following aims:
Aim 1. To provide data management service for the data generated by Stanford HIPC. The DMAC will
provide efficient HIPAA-compliant data storage, backup, and transfer with adequate data security and the
protection of subject identity. It will also facilitate data sharing between the Projects, and with public by
submitting data to appropriate public repositories such as the NIH GEO and ImmPort.
Aim 2: Provide bioinformatics support to Projects 1, 2 and 3 for analyzing systems immunology data
generated in those projects. The DMAC will assist the Projects in this proposal with various statistical and
bioinformatics analysis including differential expression, pathway, transcription factor, interaction network and
other statistical analyses as needed.
Aim 3: Integrative analysis of multiomics signatures of vaccine immunity from orthogonal data sets,
and from public datasets of similar studies. Developing a holistic and system-level view of immune
responses to vaccines requires (1) tools that can accurately capture interactions across the diverse
components of the immune system as they coordinate during response to vaccination and (2) cohorts
representative of the heterogeneity observed in the real world. We will satisfy both criteria in in this aim."
10802553,"Mutations exclusively in SLC29A3, which encodes the lysosomal transporter termed equilibrative
nucleoside transporter-3 (ENT3), cause an expanding spectrum of human genetic disorders, such as H
syndrome, PHID syndrome, RDD syndrome, SHML syndrome, dysosteosclerosis etc. They share common
mutations and overlapping clinical manifestations with anemia, erythroid hypoplasia and hepatosplenomegaly
as characteristic signs. Our group has recently described an indispensable role of ENT3 in the maintenance of
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis via the genetic deletion of ENT3 in mice. Intriguingly, ENT3-
deleted mice manifest clinical signs closely resembling human SLC29A3 disorders. The objective of this
application is to evaluate the molecular disease pathogeneses and treatments of SLC29A3 genetic disorders.
Specifically, it is our hypothesis that interference with the lysosome-to-ER mobilization of bile acid (BA)
chemical chaperones and ER stress signaling in HSCs underlies the pathogeneses of SLC29A3 dysfunctions
and that endogenous or synthetic chaperones will serve as suitable treatment agents to overcome these
disorders. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data showing that BA chemical chaperones are novel
cargos of ENT3, showing ENT3 conferring the BA-dependent amelioration of ER stress signaling in HSCs, and
showing improved function of ENT3-deleted HSCs after treatment with salubrinal, a chemical ER stress
reducer. The rationale for this project is that the identification of the mechanisms of ER stress regulation by
ENT3 in HSCs will determine the molecular disease pathogenesis of SLC29A3 disorders, which would provide
therapeutic opportunities to treat the SLC29A3 genetic disorders. This central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate ENT3 transport and the subcellular disposition of BA
chemical chaperones in HSCs. The working hypothesis is that ENT3 promotes the lysosome-to-ER
mobilization of BA and that the loss of ENT3 will reduce the ER accumulation of BAs with increased
sequestration in the lysosome. We will use new investigational models, ENT3 structure-function analysis, novel
BA molecular probes, time lapse imaging, subcellular pharmacokinetics, and mass spectrometry studies to
address this aim. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate aberrant ER stress signaling as the basis of HSC dysfunction in
SLC29A3 disorders. Key questions connecting ENT3-regulated ER stress signaling and SLC29A3 disease
pathologies will be evaluated in steady-state and stressed HSCs using HSC-specific, inducible and conditional
ENT3 KO mice. Furthermore, endogenous and synthetic chaperones and pharmacological modifiers of ENT3
misfolding, trafficking, and degradation will be evaluated to identify suitable treatment agent(s) for overcoming
SLC29A3 disorders. Completion of this project will illuminate the pathogenetic basis and treatments for
SLC29A3 genetic disorders and will provide unique insight into the ENT3-regulated BA chaperone defense
mechanisms in the physiological ER stress signaling in HSCs."
10802631,"Project Summary/Abstract
Atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) remains the major cause of morbidity and
mortality in the US. Increased number and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils are
associated with increased risk of ACD. The underlying mechanisms of these associations are
incompletely understood, and no therapies specifically address these risk factors. Human GWAS
have unraveled association of a common polymorphism of LNK/SH2B3 (T allele, R262W) with an
increased risk of ACD and increased neutrophil, platelet and eosinophil counts. This LNK variant
is carried by ~75% European, ~50% Latin American and ~30% African American populations. We
have shown that LNK(R262W) reduces LNK function and LNK deficiency in blood cells promotes
atherosclerosis in mouse models. More recently, we have shown that enhanced neutrophil
extracellular trap formation promotes atherothrombosis in Lnk-/- mice. Mechanistically, activated
LNK deficient platelets present increased oxidized phospholipids, priming neutrophils for NETosis.
While eosinophils represent a small fraction of white blood cells, there is accumulating evidence
that they play an important role in thrombosis and atherosclerosis. We have preliminary data
showing prominent eosinophilia and reversal of accelerated thrombosis in Lnk-/- mice by antibody
mediated eosinophil depletion. The preliminary data suggests a major role of eosinophils in
eosinophil, neutrophil and platelet interactions that promotes thrombosis in hematopoietic Lnk-/-
mice. The broad goal of this project is to investigate mechanisms connecting LNK deficiency to
atherosclerosis and thrombosis. A major new hypothesis is that hematopoietic LNK deficiency
promotes arterial thrombosis, plaque erosion and atherosclerosis at least in part via increased
eosinophil production, eosinophil activation and interaction with platelets and neutrophils. In this
proposal, we will follow the leads and generate novel mouse models including a mouse line with
floxed Lnk to explore the mechanisms underlying the role of eosinophils in atherosclerosis and
atherothrombosis in hematopoietic LNK deficiency. A better understanding of these mechanisms
may lead to development of new therapeutic approaches to managing ACD risks, probably in
populations with defined genetic background, e.g. LNK(R262W) polymorphism."
10931588,"ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa), with an annually increasing incident rate, has become the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in American men. The accurate diagnosis of aggressive PCa is critical for the survival of patients.
Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy, the current standard procedure for evaluating the presence and
aggressiveness of PCa, suffers from low core yield, leading to under-sampling and under-grading of clinically
significant tumors. To fill this long-standing and serious technical gap in PCa diagnosis, we propose to develop
a novel dual-modality imaging platform which integrates the emerging photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging
technique with the established TRUS for improved detection and differentiation of clinically significant PCa
tumors. With the unique capability to map functional, chemical, and molecular information reflecting pathological
conditions over the entire human prostate in vivo, non-invasively, the proposed TRUS and PA (namely TRUSPA)
imaging can sensitively detect spatially distributed tumors and, more importantly, differentiate aggressive vs.
non-aggressive PCa tumors.
This proposed multi-institutional research will leverage the extensive experience of Dr. Kothapalli’s lab in
developing and translating TRUSPA imaging systems for in vivo human prostate imaging, and the expertise of
Dr. Wang’s lab in developing novel functional imaging biomarkers of PCa. The central hypothesis is that the
TRUSPA is capable of mapping a list of functional and structural imaging biomarkers in human prostate in a real-
time non-invasive manner for detecting and differentiating clinically significant PCa. To validate this hypothesis,
we will develop a clinical grade TRUSPA platform through the collaborations with Verasonics Inc., a world leading
provider of research ultrasound systems, and Blatek Inc., a company providing customized ultrasound
transducer array fabrication. Based on this platform, a set of new imaging biomarkers for detecting prostate
tumors and characterizing PCa aggressiveness will be rigorously examined via the parallel clinical studies at the
two participating institutions. To pave the road toward successful translation, this research will focus on the
following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop and fully characterize a clinical grade TRUSPA dual imaging system for
PCa detection; and Aim 2. Via the studies on human subjects, examine the clinical performance of TRUSPA, by
assessing a list of structural and functional imaging biomarkers, in distinguishing aggressive from indolent PCa.
Once the performance of the proposed TRUSPA imaging of PCa is validated, this low-cost and user-friendly
technology will be ready for appropriate phase I/II clinical trials in the next funding cycle. TRUSPA imaging, with
the unique capability of detecting and differentiating clinically significant PCa in vivo, non-invasively, in real time,
can seamlessly fit into the current clinical procedure of TRUS image-guided biopsy, and holds great potential to
shift the paradigm of PCa management."
10805790,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Veterans are at disproportionately higher risk of suicide than civilians. Novel approaches towards development
and improvement in delivery of personalized medicine using genomic approaches for our Veterans at-risk is
mission critical. There is no sensitive and specific method to determine who is at risk for suicide, although such a
test would help clinicians to save lives. This research team have contributed to the accumulating evidence of altered
immune response in suicide. We have detected elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered
epigenetic and gene transcript patterns of genes related to inflammation in blood and brain samples of at-risk
suicidal patients and in brains from individuals who died by suicide. We also found altered distributions of activated
microglia and elevated densities of vessel-associated phagocytes in prefrontal cortex white matter after suicide.
The presence of these abnormalities at autopsy strongly points to immunological malfunction in suicide. Therefore,
we seek to investigate at a cellular level the white matter abnormalities in suicide through epigenetic and
transcriptional studies of glial cells (specifically microglia and oligodendrocytes) involved in neuroimmune
processes and link these genomic alterations to identify genes and genetic variants associated with suicidal
behavior in at-risk Veterans participating in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Herein, we propose a set of aims
that include: (1) investigation of neuroinflammatory markers in white matter tissue specimens in 168 well-
characterized postmortem brains from suicide decedent cases and controls who died by accidental causes, (2)
investigation of white matter oligodendrocyte and microglia transcriptional regulatory changes associated with
suicide within the same post mortem specimens, (3) leveraging data from the MVP participants and postmortem
brains from suicide decedents to derive genetically regulated gene expression in glia for development of a
polygenic transcriptional risk score (PTRS) for suicide with improved cross ancestry portability relative to
standard polygenic risk scores, and (4) in an exploratory fashion, examine whether incorporation of DNA
methylation data can improve suicide risk prediction using similar analytic approaches as in Aim 3. It is likely that
these line of investigations will identify genetic and transcriptionally regulated abnormalities that could improve
suicide risk predictions in Veterans, and across underrepresented populations."
10806042,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal brain development and promotes recovery
and neuronal regeneration after brain injury. TH acts in the brain predominantly through
the nuclear receptor, TH receptor alpha (THRA). Additional factors that impact TH
action in the brain including metabolism, activation of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine
(T3) by the enzyme 5′-deiodinase Type 2(Dio2), inactivation by the enzyme 5-
deiodinase Type 3 (Dio3) to reverse T3 (rT3), which occurs in glial
cells, and uptake across the cell membrane by the Mct8 transporter in neurons.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with inflammation, metabolic alterations and
neuronal death. In clinical studies, serum levels of T4 and T3, as well as TH levels in
the brain, are reduced. We have utilized rodent models of TBI to demonstrate that
treatment with T4, 1 hour after injury (selected to model a practical time of
administration after injury), is protective, reduces edema, and promotes neuronal
recovery. We have identified a similar protective effect of TH in an in vitro model of
neuronal injury from hypoxia as well as neuronal inflammation. We will study the
mechanism of TH protection from neuronal injury, utilizing in vivo mouse models of TBI.
We have preliminary data identifying genes whose expression is impacted by hypoxic
neuronal injury and those that are normalized by TH treatment. We will characterize
these genes in the brains of mice after injury to identify specific pathways and locations
influenced by TH treatment with a whole genome approach. Hypoxic injury increases
histone methylation in neurons and this is reduced by T3 treatment. We believe that this
is an important mechanism for T3 protection after injury. We will also identify T3-
stimulated pathways that activate neural regeneration. We have also shown that injury
impairs glial cell proliferation and migration, partially restored by T4 treatment. We will
utilize in vivo rodent models of TBI and in vitro models to identify the actions of TH on
glial cells and the resulting balance of pro- and anti- inflammatory pathways. The
response to TH therapy will include assessment of the brain lesions by imaging and
brain region-specific patterns of gene expression. TH reduction in brain edema and cell
death, and promotion of neuronal regeneration, should provide a beneficial effect after
brain injury. These studies should provide guidance for clinical strategies to use TH,
likely with other agents that are anti-inflammatory, to reduce the impact of brain injury
and promote recovery."
10806046,"It is increasingly apparent that Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) function as a unit
with neurons to regulate sensory function. When the PNS is injured or stressed, SCs become activated for repair.
This involves dramatic SC phenotypic transformation. If this process is abnormal or inhibited, peripheral nerve
injury may result in chronic debilitating pain, a problem observed in the general population, including numerous
Veterans. Treatment options for chronic neuropathic pain are very limited, and alternatives without addiction are
badly needed. We hypothesize that in response to injury, SC activation is variable from cell to cell so that a
continuum of SC activation states co-exist. We also hypothesize that the SC Repair Program may be augmented
therapeutically to improve outcomes. The major goal of this research project is to determine whether we can
target SC LDL Receptor-related Protein-1 (LRP1), a receptor that we have identified as playing a central role in
the SC Repair Program, to improve pain outcomes following peripheral nerve injury. To accomplish our goals,
three Specific Aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we build on our LC-MS/MS proteomics data obtained from
our previously funded VA Merit Award. We identified an endogenous axon-derived protein, PACSIN 1 as a lead
LRP1 ligand candidate that robustly activated cell signaling pathways associated with the SC Repair Program.
We now seek to identify the SC LRP1 binding domain in PACSIN 1 through site-directed mutagenesis, with the
long-term goal of producing a more druggable pain therapeutic. We then design synthetic PACSIN 1 peptides
that are tested and validated in cell signaling, survival and migration assays associated with the SC Repair
Program. Next, we compare gene expression in SCs after PACSIN 1 transactivation of TrkC, activation by other
LRP1 agonists (EI-tPA, SP16) or direct TrkC activation by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), with the goal of identifying an
optimized SC LRP1 agonist. In Specific Aim 2, our goal is to test LRP1 agonists in a mouse model of
chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPPN). We build upon our published data showing that
LRP1 agonists reduce acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain after traumatic injury, and apply it to paclitaxel
induced painful neuropathy, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the Veteran population. We will
measure several pain modalities in our studies to better understand the experiential pain associated with CIPPN.
We utilize mice with genetic deletion of LRP1 in SCs (scLRP1-/-) generated in my laboratory, to test our
hypothesis that SC LRP1 regulates neuroinflammation and whether LRP1 agonists specifically target SC LRP1.
Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will test whether LRP1 agonists regulate neuroinflammation induced by CIPPN in
lumbar DRGs. We then utilize single-cell RNASeq to define the cellular landscape of CIPPN nerves and identify
differences in subpopulations of glia and immune cells when PIPN nerves are treated with LRP1 agonists or
when SC LRP1 is absent. We consider this project innovative because we target a known anti-inflammatory
receptor, LRP1 in SCs, instead of neurons to treat chronic pain. This work provides a translational opportunity
to improve chronic pain management in our VA patients."
10806050,"This proposal outlines a 5-year research and career development plan for Dr. Brandon Nokes, director of
Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation at VA San Diego and a pulmonary/critical care physician at UCSD. The major
objective of his research is deriving mechanistic understanding of within and across-breath negative effort
dependence, common and important subtypes of flow limitation in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This CDA-2
proposal outlines and provides support for his career development plan, specifically focusing on Training Aim
(TA)1, upper airway physiology and control of breathing, TA2, physiological signal processing, TA3, clinical trial
design and appropriate statistics. Dr. Nokes has assembled a diverse team of collaborative experts to support
his career development and mentor him consisting of Dr. Atul Malhotra, an internationally recognized expert in
upper airway physiology with Dr. Owens, Chair-Elect of the Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology (SRN)
Assembly at ATS, as well as Dr. Crotty-Alexander, Section head of Pulmonary/Critical Care of VA San Diego
and recipient of CDA-2 and MERIT funding pertaining to respiratory science. Additionally, his training team
includes experts in upper respiratory physiology (Dr. Powell and Dr. Spragg), fluid mechanics and signal
processing in the upper airway (Dr. Butler), and upper airway electrical stimulation (Dr. Strollo), as well as an
expert in clinical trial design and biostatistics (Dr. Sonia Jain). Despite the significant clinical burden of
obstructive sleep apnea in Veterans (the most common service-connected respiratory condition), continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) use is historically poor. Current approaches to OSA care emphasize “one-
size fits all” approach with CPAP being the gold-standard. However, it is now understood that there are
multiple physiologic traits (endotypes) which may be amenable to tailored therapies beyond CPAP alone. The
PI will evaluate the role of negative pressure reflexes in within-breath negative effort dependence in Aim 1.
Prior investigations assessing negative pressure reflexes are well-validated and the PI is well-trained to identify
NED as well as conduct physiology-based polysomnography (including genioglossus electromyography and
epiglottic pressure catheter placement). However, whether reflex attenuation creates a risk for within-breath
NED has yet to be established. Aim 2 will assess the role of an imbalance in respiratory drive between the
upper airway and thoracic pump mechanistically underly across-breath NED. Both of these modes are flow
limitation are especially important as the only way to terminate these breathing events is through arousal,
leading to sleep fragmentation and potentially adverse neurocognitive and cardiac outcomes. This work will lay
the groundwork for future MERIT studies focused on individualizing OSA treatments. This work will also help to
build the San Diego VA Sleep lab into a world class physiology-tailored sleep lab. The research and career
development plan affords Dr. Nokes an impressive foundation to develop into a prominent clinician-scientist
working to improve care by developing and implementing novel approaches to Veteran sleep care. Dr. Nokes
is fully committed to improving the care of Veterans with OSA by providing individualized sleep care based on
individual physiology."
10807094,"Sleep and wake are critical for animal survival, but the mechanisms by which the brain coordinates
switching between these brain states, from brainstem to cortex, remains unclear. Neuromodulatory signaling
circuits are essential systems for brain state switching, both in sleep/wake and in other contexts. In the current
proposal, we explore the role of one of these neuromodulators—histamine—in the regulation of sleep and
wake in the cerebral cortex. Although histamine has long been known as a wake-promoting neuromodulator, it
is relatively understudied compared to others, so our understanding of its cellular and circuit mechanisms of
action is still in the early stages. Here, we take a holistic perspective of the cell types involved in sleep/wake
circuits, and ask how the largest class of non-neuronal cells in the brain, astrocytes, are involved in sending
and responding to histaminergic signals in the cortex. We aim to address gaps in our knowledge of sleep/wake
dynamics, histaminergic signaling, and astrocytic regulation of neural circuits by uncovering critical cell
biological signaling systems in astrocytes. We apply advanced optical, electrophysiological, and neural
manipulation techniques to reveal how astrocytes may be integrating neuromodulatory signals in cortical
circuits and coordinating populations of neurons. Our main goals include: probing the cell biological
mechanisms by which histamine activates astrocytes, testing the spatiotemporal dynamics of histamine and
astrocytes to determine their causal relationships, and exploring the mechanisms by which astrocytes may
synchronize or desynchronize neuronal activity."
10804861,"Chronic Post-amputation Pain (cPAP) is a major unsolved healthcare problem. Every year, Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) hospitals perform 7,000 amputations and civilian hospitals perform approximately
115,000 amputations. Between 50 and 90% of Amputees will suffer from cPAP, with impaired psychological
well-being, physical disability, and a substantially lower quality of life in those patients affected, in addition to
the cost to society at large. Even novel surgical methods such as regenerative peripheral nerve interface
surgery can only modestly reduce, but not prevent, cPAP. Once cPAP has developed, treatment is very difficult
with few therapeutic options. Despite the high clinical relevance, there are still critical gaps in our knowledge of
cPAP and its pathophysiology. Our proposal is focused on addressing three of these gaps using the framework
of the Million Veteran Program (MVP).
The first Specific Aim is to describe the demographics of the MVP Amputee cohort, and the incidence of cPAP
in that cohort. This will be defined as point prevalence 9 (± 3) months after amputation. The complementary
outcome measures are the incidence and severity of cPAP over time, as well as 1- and 5-year mortality. This
will give us a solid understanding of the Amputee cohort within MVP. In addition, we will describe the
perioperative care these patients received around their amputation, and the access to care they had after
surgery, and whether these factors are associated with the development of cPAP. At completion of Specific Aim
1, we will have created a valuable MVP-specific phenotype for well-conducted genetic studies, which will also
facilitate studies by other researchers. We will have also assessed the patterns of practice, the access to care,
and the resulting time-course and severity of cPAP in MVP patients.
The second, and central, Specific Aim of this proposal is to identify genetic variants that are associated with
cPAP risk in MVP patients. This will serve three purposes: first, it will allow us to better understand the genetic
basis for individual risk to develop cPAP; second, it will allow us to describe the congruence of genetic risk
factors between cPAP and diagnoses which we know to influence pain conditions, in particular chronic non-
cPAP pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD, schizophrenia and substance use disorders; and third, this Aim will
shed light on biological-pathway based risk factors specific for cPAP, which may help identify therapeutic or
preventive candidate therapies going forward. At completion of Specific Aim 2, we will have characterized the
influence of genetic factors on the occurrence of cPAP while accounting for genetic risks of highly correlated
psychosocial risks.
The third Specific Aim of this proposal is to examine patient-specific health characteristics, including
psychosocial factors and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). Despite strong evidence in other domains,
the relationship between psychosocial factors, SDOH, and the development of cPAP is currently unknown. At
completion of Specific Aim 3, we will have developed a holistic approach to the risk factors underlying cPAP by
assessing patient-specific and social determinants of health as they relate to the development of cPAP.
This proposal breaks ground for a future line of research aimed to inform a comprehensive risk score to assess
amputees’ risks of developing chronic pain. Data regarding the occurrence of PAP, the associated genetic
variants, the interventions that might have a beneficial effect on patient outcome, and the psychosocial and
demographic risk factors will offer new insights for assessment, interventions and improvement in meaningful
patient-centered outcomes after amputation surgery."
10805053,"Heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are common in Veterans and frequently complicated by
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure (RVF). Pharmacologic treatments for RVF are limited.
Recent studies suggest that powerful cardioprotective effects are mediated by α1-adrenergic receptors, in
particular the α1A-subtype (α1A-AR). Our preliminary data show that chronic stimulation of α1A-ARs (for 2 wk)
had major beneficial effects on RV function in two models of RVF induced by pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary
artery constriction (PAC). The therapeutic effect was closely linked to reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. This
renewal project will determine the mechanisms involved in α1A-AR-mediated reversal of mitochondrial
dysfunction and reversal of RVF. Moreover, in translational studies using human engineered heart tissue (EHT)
we will determine if chronic α1A-AR agonism increases mitochondrial function and increases contraction of
human EHT. This renewal project will build on the following recent preliminary results:
 1. In a model of RVF induced by PAC, RVF was reversed by chronic treatment with a highly specific α1A-
 AR agonist at a low dose that did not raise blood pressure.
2. Reversal of RVF involved increased myocardial ATP levels and an increased rate of mitochondrial
 respiration, which indicated protective effects on mitochondria.
3. We recently reported that contractions of RV myocardium in-vitro are significantly inhibited by the low
 ATP levels observed in RVF. This suggests that ATP level is a critical determinant of RV function.
4. Reversal of RVF involved increased levels of antioxidant enzymes, decreased levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and decreased ROS-modification of muscle proteins.
5. Reversal of RVF also involved reversal of hyperacetylation of multiple proteins.
6. In translational studies, we used human EHT created using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
 cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We recently reported that the α1A-AR is expressed in human EHT.
Moreover, chronic α1A-AR agonism for 2 wk caused increased contraction of human EHT.
These novel observations suggest 3 hypotheses that will be tested in 3 Specific Aims:
 1. Chronic α1A-AR agonism increases mitochondrial respiration rate and ATP production both by increasing
 cellular antioxidant defenses and by reversing hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins.
 2. Recovery of mitochondrial function drives recovery of myofilament contraction and reversal of RVF by a)
 increased bioenergetic status (e.g. increased ATP level), and b) decreased myofilament damage.
 3. Chronic α1A-AR agonism increases mitochondrial and myofilament function of human EHT.
Aim 1. Determine the mitochondrial mechanisms driving reversal of RVF by chronic α1A-AR agonism. In
the setting of RVF, we will determine the specific mitochondrial processes that are improved by chronic α1A-AR
agonism (Aim 1A), and determine the roles played by increased antioxidant defense (Aim 1B) and reversal of
mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation (Aim 1C).
Aim 2. Determine the myofilament mechanisms driving reversal of RVF by chronic α1A-AR agonism. In
the setting of RVF, we will determine if chronic treatment with α1A-AR agonist causes rescue of myofilament
function by: a) increasing bioenergetic status (e.g. more ATP); and/or b) decreasing damage to cardiac
myofilaments (e.g. involving ROS or acetylation).
Aim 3. Determine if chronic α1A-AR agonism increases mitochondrial function and myofilament function
of human engineered heart tissue. As an approach to testing the effects of chronic α1A-AR agonism in human
cardiomyocytes, we will use human EHT, and we will determine if chronic α1A-AR agonism causes increased
mitochondrial function and increased myofilament function."
10803238,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Developing neuroprotective and repair strategies represents an urgent unmet need for treating
inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including multiple sclerosis (MS).
Lesions in both MS patients and the MS mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
involve T lymphocyte infiltration and axonal damage. However, interactions between CNS-infiltrating T cells
and central neurons remain poorly understood. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is an FDA-approved drug for the
symptomatic treatment of MS to improve walking speed. Although it is commonly believed that 4-AP blocks
Kv1 (Shaker) voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels to enhance axonal conduction and suppress immune response,
the mechanisms underlying 4-AP’s actions in treating MS are still not completely clear. Our new results have
provided several lines of compelling evidence that a Kv3 (Shaw) channel, with high 4-AP sensitivity, is
expressed in both CD4+ T cells and CNS neurons, and plays a key role in T cell-induced axonal injury. This
channel regulates T cell activation that is required for EAE induction, shown by our active and passive EAE
results using its global knockout (KO) mice. This notion is further supported by our data from T cell culture,
immunostaining/confocal imaging, flow cytometry, RNAi knockdown, and conditional KO (cKO) mice.
Therefore, based on our new findings, we propose a novel hypothesis that in the development and pathology
of CNS autoimmunity, Kv3 channel is required for the efficient generation of encephalitogenic T cells, whereas
its upregulation in axons aggravates autoimmune-induced injury via aberrant Ca2+ signaling. To test this
original hypothesis, we have created a floxed mouse line for this Kv3 channel to examine the effects of its cell-
type-specific cKOs on EAE. We will use a multidisciplinary approach, including active and passive EAE
models, inducible cKO and transgenic mouse lines, flow cytometry, confocal and transmission electron
microscopy, functional assays, in vivo RNAi, and a new myelin coculture. We will determine (Aim 1) whether
deleting this Kv3 channel from CD4+ T cells suppresses EAE induction and progression via impaired T cell
activation, (Aim 2) whether deleting this channel from CNS neurons ameliorates autoimmune-induced axonal
injury, and (Aim 3) how this channel regulates pathogenic interactions between T cells and axons in
autoimmune-induced injury. This project is innovative because this is the first study to show that a Kv channel
regulates the function of both immune cells and neurons. This project is significant because the findings of this
project will provide novel mechanistic insights into pathogenic interactions between T cells and neurons, and
hence may contribute to a novel treatment strategy for MS through simultaneously suppressing immune
response and rescuing injured axons."

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are under intensive investigation as therapeutics for treating a diverse
array of human diseases, and while some trials have demonstrated significant patient benefits, most have yielded
suboptimal outcomes. Currently, most clinical trials employ similar manufacturing schemes to treat medically
unrelated diseases, which reflects knowledge gaps in the critical quality attributes that confer potency and
undervalues the impacts of donor selection and manufacturing on potency. We previously identified TWIST1 as
a biomarker that quantifies inter-donor differences in stem/progenitor (growth, CFU-F activity, tri-lineage
potential) and paracrine (pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory) functions of MSCs, thereby
linking these functions mechanistically. We then developed a Clinical Indications Prediction (CLIP) scale based
on TWIST1 that predicts inter-donor differences in MSC potency for a range of activities to produce MSC
products tailored to specific disease indications or patient populations. Most recently, we showed that TWIST1
levels correlate with donor stature, that MSCs from short statured donors exhibit poor growth and potent immuno-
modulatory activity, and that cGMP manufacturing platforms are biased against these donor populations. Based
on these findings, the central goals of this application are to further refine the CLIP scale and establish it as an
industry wide platform to inform donor selection and manufacturing processes to produce MSC-based
therapeutics of defined potency. To accomplish these goals, aim 1 will delineate epigenetic mechanisms that
confer inter-donor differences in TWIST1 levels and correlate outcomes with donor stature to establish stature
as a critical quality attribute that confers potency. MSCs from donors of varying stature will also be exposed to
agents that license pro-angiogenic (FGF2), anti-inflammatory (IL1, TNF) and immuno-modulatory (IFNG)
activities and their impacts on TWIST1 expression will be quantified to determine if the CLIP scale predicts their
sensitivity to these agents. These data will establish the importance of donor selection on MSC potency, which
to date has been largely overlooked. Aim 2 will subject MSCs from donors of variable stature to large-scale
expansion using standard (academic) and proprietary (industry) cGMP manufacturing platforms and quantify
impacts on potency pre- and post-manufacturing using well-established pre-clinical models. Methods (small
molecules, gene editing) to modulate TWIST1 levels post-manufacturing to alter potency will also be explored.
By revealing how biases in donor selection/manufacturing impact product potency these studies will highlight
limitations of current manufacturing platforms that reduce MSC therapeutic efficacy. Lastly, aim 3 will determine
if the CLIP scale predicts inter-donor differences in MSC-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, cargo
content, and potency. Expanding the CLIP scale to EVs will provide a platform to guide their manufacturing as
they enter clinical testing. Successful completion of these studies will deliver a robust, industry-wide platform to
produce MSC therapeutics of defined potency for treating specific disease indications."

Antibiotics are a cornerstone of modern medicine, but antibiotic resistance threatens the effectiveness of our
existing antibacterial arsenal. This phenomenon poses an acute challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a
global pathogen that causes greater mortality than any other bacterium. Nearly half a million drug-resistant
tuberculosis infections occurred in 2021, driving an urgent clinical need to develop novel drugs against M.
tuberculosis and to rigorously characterize new molecular targets. One promising class of targets are the
mycobacterial Clp proteases, which carry out regulated degradation of cytosolic proteins. Although Clp proteases
are known to be essential, their cellular roles and the reasons for their essentiality are poorly understood, which
in turn constrains efforts to develop Clp-targeting therapeutics. This proposal investigates the connection
between arginine phosphorylation and the mycobacterial ClpC1P1P2 Clp protease. In the distantly related
species Bacillus subtilis, phosphoarginine (pArg) modifications occur on diverse proteins during proteotoxic
stress and are recognized by the ClpCP protease as a degradation signal. We recently reported that pArg
modifications also occur in mycobacteria, although the specific conditions that stimulate pArg installation appear
to be different than in B. subtilis. Preliminary studies confirm that pArg-bearing proteins are proteolyzed by
ClpC1P1P2. Additionally, we find that pArg binds ClpC2, a protein that contributes to antibiotic persistence. We
hypothesize that mycobacteria install pArg in response to stress or starvation; that pArg directs ClpC1P1P2
activity and modulates its assembly state; and that ClpC2 is a pArg-sensitive regulator of dormancy and
persistence. This proposal seeks to test this overarching hypothesis and interrogate key biochemical aspects of
pArg recognition. In Aim 1, we use phosphoproteomics to identify stress conditions that elevate pArg, assess
the requirement of pArg on mycobacterial stress tolerance, and identify mycobacterial arginine kinases and
phosphatases. In Aim 2, we use in vitro biochemical approaches to test the influence of pArg number and
substrate stability on proteolysis by ClpC1, and determine the influence of pArg binding on the ClpC1 activity
state. In Aim 3 we assess how pArg-dependent changes in ClpC2 oligomerization influence its function. The
outcomes of this proposal will include an expanded understanding of the roles of pArg in mycobacteria, new
mechanistic details of how pArg-bearing proteins interact with Clp proteases, and elucidation of the role of ClpC2
in pArg-sensing and persistence. These studies will lay the groundwork for future efforts to test the connection
between pArg and M. tuberculosis infection. Moreover, a detailed understanding of pArg-linked proteolytic
pathways will improve our ability to screen for new ClpC1-targeting therapeutic leads."

The control of organellar gene expression is critical for the cellular programming of all eukaryotic
organisms. While perturbing mitochondrial gene expression leads to human pathologies, including cancer,
altering plastid gene expression can kill plants. However, the cell signaling mechanisms that control
organellar gene expression remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of the PI’s laboratory is to utilize
the light-induced plastid differentiation into photosynthetically active chloroplasts in Arabidopsis as a genetic
model to interrogate cell signaling mechanisms for controlling organellar gene expression. The current data
support the central hypothesis that the red and far-red photoreceptor phytochrome B promotes the
degradation of a small family of phytochrome-interacting basic/helix-loop-helix transcription factors in the
nucleus to generate nucleus-to-plastid (anterograde) signals that trigger the assembly and activation of the
multisubunit, bacterial-type plastid RNA polymerase for transcribing plastid photosynthesis genes. Here the PI
propose to utilize a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry, and genomics approaches to (1)
determine the mechanism initiating anterograde signaling in the nucleus, (2) determine the mechanism of
the assembly of the multisubunit plastid RNA polymerase complex, and (3) determine the mechanism
activating the plastid RNA polymerase. The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes
photoreceptor signaling and chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis as a genetic model to elucidate a
previously uncharacterized anterograde signaling pathway. The PI has developed new forward genetic
approaches and biochemical assays and identified critical components that define the framework of
anterograde signaling. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to uncover the light
signaling mechanism for initiating chloroplast biogenesis - a long-standing gap in our knowledge of plant
light signaling and the regulation of photosynthesis. Because the control of transcription in plastids shares
intrinsic similarities with that in mitochondria, what we learn in the plastid model is expected to enhance the
understanding of the general principles of cell signaling mechanisms in controlling organellar gene expression,
including the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, and therefore, will ultimately contribute to the
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the misregulations of mitochondrial gene expression in human
diseases."
10803587,"Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is implicated in life-threatening bacteremia, infective
endocarditis (IE) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite its clinical importance, the underlying virulence
mechanism of Sgg is poorly understood. A prominent feature of Sgg IE or bacteremia is the well-documented
high rate of comorbidity with CRC, averaging around ~60% of cases. This underscores a strong connection
between Sgg activities in the intestinal tract and Sgg infection in the circulatory system. Work from our lab and
others have sort to understand the detailed interactions between Sgg and the colonic epithelium and how the
interactions lead to pathological changes and diseases. Studies have found that Sgg is able to stimulate colon
cancer cell proliferation and translocate across an epithelial barrier in a paracellular fashion. In pre-clinical
models, Sgg has been shown to “drive” the development of colon tumors. The specific Sgg factors and host
pathways underlying these pathogenic activities, however, are largely unknown. Recent findings from our lab
demonstrated that a type VII secretion system (T7SS) plays a significant role in Sgg virulence. In preliminary
studies to further dissect the activities mediated by the T7SS, a specific T7SS effector, EsxA, was found to be
crucial in influencing colonic epithelial homeostasis. Moreover, preliminary data suggests that EsxA functions by
acting as a novel ligand for a host cell surface growth factor receptor of critical function and holds great promise
as a key virulence factor mediating multiple pathogenic phenotypes of Sgg. To the best of our knowledge, these
findings highlight a novel virulence mechanism for Sgg and provide the first experimental evidence for T7SS
regulation of a growth factor receptor. The goal of this proposal is to further delineate the importance of EsxA in
Sgg virulence and to elucidate the signaling and biological outcomes induced by EsxA, using in vitro cell cultures
and animal models well established in our lab. The broad applicability of the proposed virulence mechanism in
Sgg strains will also be determined. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fill major knowledge gaps
in Sgg virulence and advance a new understanding of T7SS function and microbial regulation of growth factor
receptors."

Proteasome inhibitor (PI) drugs turned untreatable multiple myeloma treatable, significantly improve the
quality of life for multiple myeloma patients. There are three FDA-approved PI drugs. In additional to
multiple myeloma (MM), PI drugs are also approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), amyloid light
chain (AL) amyloidosis and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the latter two are noncurable rare
disorders related to plasma cells. Nevertheless, resistance inevitably occurs. All three drugs have
serious toxicities. A high percentage of patients suffer from neuropathy, a debilitating adverse effect
from two peptide boronate based PI drugs, bortezomib and ixazomib. Another PI drug carfilzomib also
has cardiovascular and renal toxicity. Notably, none of the PI drugs showed little clinical benefits in
treating patients with solid tumors in numerous clinical trials. Studies have shown that upon treatment
with PIs, a transcription factor NRF1 will be activated to express more proteasomes that renders PI
drugs less or non-effective. Recent studies show that when chymotryptic β5 and tryptic β2 of the
proteasomes are simultaneously inhibited, NRF1, instead of activation, forms aggregated, disarming the
ability of tumor cells to resist apoptotic stress induced from proteasome inhibition. Because of the
striking difference between the “chymotryptic” proteolytic preference of β5 to cleave after hydrophobic
residues and the “tryptic” preference of β2 to cleave after basic residues, it is challenging to develop
inhibitors that can target both β2 and β5 with similar potency. Besides, such β5β2 targeting inhibitors
would also have to spare the “acidic” β1 active subunit to avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity. No such
inhibitors have been reported in peptide boronate and peptide epoxyketone classes. There are three
known β5β2-inhibitors in other classes, all of them irreversible, carrying unpredictable toxicities. We
have now designed and characterized a group of macrocyclic peptide boronates that simultaneously
inhibit β5 and β2, but not β1. These compounds elicit markedly less NRF1 activation in triple negative
breast cancer cells (TNBC) than BTZ. We now aim to continue our team approach to advance the
structure-guided development of β5β2 inhibitors for cancer treatment by improving their specificity and
pharmaceutical properties and evaluate their in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo efficacy in animal
models of TNBC. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct structure-guided lead optimization to improve
β5β2-inhibitors’ potency, specificity and pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will test β5β2-
inhibitors' cytotoxicity against breast cancer line cells. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of β5β2-inhibitors in in
animal models of TNBC."

Closing the gap in stroke disparities cannot be accomplished without addressing the upstream factors driving
them. Structural Racism and Discrimination (SRD) produces adverse Social Determinants of Health (SDOH),
which have been shown increase stroke risk in a dose dependent manner. The present application focuses on
mitigating the effects of SDOH to improve stroke outcomes in underserved minority populations, using a multi-
level approach that includes the community, healthcare institution, interpersonal, and individual levels. Our
rationale is that the burden of mitigating the multi-level impact of SDOH on social and health inequities should
not fall solely on disenfranchised patients, which in our case is the economically disadvantaged African American
and Hispanic stroke patient. Our 4 Specific Aims intervene on major downstream health effects arising from
adverse SDOH. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US with the greatest burden on communities
of color, and it is not surprising that SDOH is a major driver of stroke disparities. Currently, there is a dearth of
effective SDOH interventions for stroke prevention and recovery. Our proposal seeks to address this gap by
developing a racial equity-trained, multidisciplinary homecare team, or SHIFT (SDOH-Homecare Intervention
Focus Team). SHIFT comprises a local Community Based Organization (CBO)-affiliated Community Health
Worker, a Community Nurse, and a Community Social Worker. We hypothesize that by targeting patient-specific
SDOH risk factors on a community, health systems, interpersonal and individual level with SHIFT, we will mitigate
the adverse effects of SDOH factors to improve functional and physiological outcomes after stroke in vulnerable
race-ethnicity groups. Specifically, we will examine the effect of the SHIFT approach on post-stroke outcomes
of African American and Hispanic patients with > 3 SDOH risk factors compared to Usual Care in a Randomized
Controlled Trial (RCT) embedded within a Hybrid Type I Implementation Effectiveness design. The primary
outcome will be the Stroke Impact Score (SIS 3.0) -- a measure of disability and health-related quality of life after
stroke -- measured at 6 months and 1 year (Aim 1a). Secondary outcomes will assess the effect of the
intervention on blood pressure control and cognitive status (Aim 1b) and explore the role of Allostatic Load – a
measure of physiological weathering – on our outcomes of interest (exploratory Aim 1c). Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that improvement in functional and physiological stroke outcomes as measured in Aim 1 is associated
with reduction in specific SDOH variables. In Aim 3, at the healthcare system level, we will examine the effect of
the SHIFT intervention on health system process variables (Aim 3a) and stroke patient re-admission rates (Aim
3b). At the community level, guided by a standardized organizational capacity measure and scoring matrix, we
will engage in CBO capacity building of a local CBO partner to support the sustainability of its SDOH-mitigating
activities, while gathering multi-level contextual data influencing patient outcomes using a racism-conscious
adaptation of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Aim 4)."
10932315,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Immediate (or “urgent”) care treats injuries or illnesses that lie between primary and emergency care. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, virtual immediate care made up the largest share of visits in the new, expanded telehealth
infrastructure. The rise of virtual immediate care has important implications for health care access and costs,
especially among those with Medicaid. Access to and costs associated with immediate care are especially
important considerations for this marginalized group, who are less likely to engage in primary care, rely more
heavily on expensive emergency department care for non-urgent conditions, and use more immediate care than
those with higher incomes. Though virtual care is widely thought to increase care access and reduce costs, there
are well-documented reasons to believe that these benefits might be offset among Medicaid enrollees. For
example, those with lower incomes are less likely to have broadband access, rendering virtual care largely
inaccessible. When it comes to spending, shifting urgent care visits away from the emergency department
represents an important cost-savings opportunity. However, telehealth visits may also increase costs, by acting
as a complement to in-person care, rather than a substitute, and by inducing new demand that otherwise would
not have occurred. Further complicating the picture, the impact of virtual immediate care on access and costs
likely differs across different types of telehealth models, and across different marginalized subpopulation (e.g.,
those living in rural areas, racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals with special health care needs, and
women). To date, no study has measured the impact of virtual immediate care among Medicaid enrollees. Yet,
as the public health emergency draws to a close in May 2023, state Medicaid agencies face important decisions
on whether to permanently extend COVID-era telehealth policies. Our study’s purpose is to generate urgently-
needed evidence to inform the policy conversation regarding telehealth and Medicaid, curating results that will
be immediately useful to policy-makers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will conduct quantitative analyses
using extensive health record data from major health care systems across three states, followed by stakeholder
interviews with both Medicaid administrators and health systems leaders. Our aims are 1) Measure the impact
of different telehealth delivery models on immediate care access and use among low-income individuals, overall
and by subpopulations; 2) Calculate the impact of different virtual immediate care delivery models on health care
episode costs, accounting for downstream care and new health care use that would not have otherwise occurred,
overall and by subpopulations; 3) Conduct semi-structured interviews with Medicaid administrators and health
system leaders to transform study results into practicable knowledge for policymakers."
10785855,"Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer, with ~20,000 new cases predicted for 2023.
Although first-line treatment with a platinum compound and taxane yields a response rate of more than 80% in
advanced ovarian cancer, the median time of progression-free survival is only 18 months. Retreatment can be
performed after relapse, but chemoresistance becomes a major issue. Therefore, new options for the treatment
of both primary and relapsed ovarian cancer are urgently needed. The Notch signaling pathway regulates cell
proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant Notch activation plays roles in the initiation, progression, and
chemoresistance of a variety of cancer types. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas reveal that Notch-pathway
aberrations associate with 22% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and Notch pathway disruption can sensitize
ovarian tumor cells to platinum-based therapy. Accordingly, drugs that inhibit Notch signaling will be of great
value for treatment of Notch-associated ovarian cancers. To date, the utility of Notch-pathway inhibitors is limited
by dose-dependent and off-target toxicities. Most Notch inhibition strategies have focused on the level Notch
receptor activation. We hypothesized that modulating the interaction of RBPJ, the sole Notch transcriptional
effector, with its gene targets would provide a means to intervene in all Notch-associated cancers, regardless of
the mechanisms of aberrant pathway activation. We discovered that the FDA-approved drug auranofin is a potent
Notch pathway inhibitor. Moreover, we found that auranofin interacts synergistically with cisplatin, preferentially
reducing the viability of high Notch-expressing ovarian cancer cells. In this proposed study, we will use different
preclinical models to test the utility of
auranofin and cisplatin cotreatment for targeted ovarian cancer therapy.
We will use a collection of ovarian cancer cell lines to examine how levels of the different Notch receptors and
ligands impact the auranofin response. We will also use patient-derived tumor organoids (PDO) and patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models to examine auranofin and cisplatin synergy in 3-D culture and the
peritoneal environment.
We will also study how auranofin impacts cancer stem-cell expansion and cancer
relapse. The impact of these studies, if successful, will be significant, as our proposal has the potential to
repurpose an FDA-approved agent for immediate deployment in targeted therapy of both primary and relapsed
ovarian cancers that are Notch-dependent."

Current theories suggest that mammalian behavior arises from an interaction of different action-
selection systems that process information about the past (memory), present (perception), and future
(goals to achieve, outcomes to avoid) differently. Current theories dichotomize systems into planning
and procedural systems, but newer theories suggest more complex, hybrid algorithms may exist within
mammalian decision-systems. Current views of psychiatry are based on dysfunctions in the information
processing of those decision systems, which means that treating and alleviating those disorders will be
enhanced by a better understanding of the information processing that underlies decision making. A
number of disorders (OCD, eating disorders, drug addiction) and a number of RDOC-related dysfunctions
(compulsivity, habits, and issues of cognitive and “self-” control) have all been proposed to depend on
conflicts between these decision systems. We will build on our established expertise in neural ensemble
recording and computational analysis to examine the information processing of decision systems,
particularly in questions of conflicts between these systems. Using DREADD manipulation and neural
ensemble recording technologies, we propose to identify the mechanisms and computations that
underlie action-selection processes under exogenously and internally-driven strategy changes."
10784082,"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR), are two molecular
processes that are central to antibody maturation in mammals. A murine protein, mFAM72A, is
expressed in germinal center B lymphocytes and plays a key role in both these processes. It
interacts with the nuclear form of the DNA repair protein, mUNG2, and is required for optimal
SHM and CSR. It causes inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the latter protein and promotes its
degradation through a proteosome-dependent pathway. The enzyme activation-induced
deaminase (AID) is essential for both SHM and CSR, and converts cytosines in DNA to uracil
creating U•G mispairs. The uracils are processed by two distinct DNA repair pathways. The
uracils may be excised by mUNG2 creating abasic sites that are processed by the base-
excision repair machinery or the U•G mispairs may be recognized by a non-canonical mismatch
repair (ncMMR) process that is not linked to replication. Together these repair pathways cause
base substitution mutations and strand breaks that promote SHM and CSR. ncMMR works only
when U•G pairs created by AID persist in the immunoglobulin genes and recent studies strongly
suggest that mFAM72A helps with the persistence of U•G pairs through interference with
mUNG2 stability and activity. However, it is unclear why the degradation of mUNG2 is
necessary when the binding of mFAM72A to mUNG2 in itself causes substantial inhibition of
enzymatic activity of mUNG2. It is possible that the degradation of mUNG2 is necessary to
reduce the nuclear concentration of this protein changing its association with other proteins that
are inhibitory towards SHM and CSR. To test whether the inhibition of UNG activity is sufficient
for optimal SHM and CSR, we will synthesize a family of known chemical inhibitors of
mammalian UNG and test them in the murine cell culture model for CSR, CH12F3 cells. These
inhibitors bind within the active site of the enzyme, have micromolar to submicromolar IC50 and
are able to inhibit the enzyme inside cells. We will also synthesize proteolysis-targeting chimera
(PROTAC) versions of these inhibitors that should cause degradation of mUNG2. We will treat
mFAM72A knockout (KO) CH12F3 cells with different concentrations of these inhibitors or
PROTACs and determine the frequency of isotype switching from IgM to IgA in these cells. If
inhibition of enzymatic activity of mUNG2 is sufficient for optimal CSR then CSR frequency
should initially increase with increasing concentration of inhibitor reaching a maximum similar to
that found in FAM72A+/+ cells. However, if degradation of mUNG2 is essential for optimal CSR,
the PROTAC treatment- but not inhibitor treatment- should achieve maximal CSR. Following
inhibitor and PROTAC treatment, we will also monitor mutations in the 5'Sµ region of CH12F3
genome as a proxy for SHM. Additionally, we will use a newly constructed RASH-1 cell line as a
model for SHM. This RAMOS-derived human cell line contains an inducible AID gene and SHM
in its genome can be conveniently monitored as loss of GFP fluorescence. mFAM72A promotes
higher frequency of hypermutations in the variable region of the IGH gene in the B lymphocyte
genome and hence we expect that the drug treatments will increase the SHM frequency. If the
maximum SHM frequency is achieved using inhibitors alone, we will conclude that inhibition of
UNG2 activity is sufficient for optimal SHM."

10790188,"Abstract
The sexually transmitted pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is the most common sexually
transmitted infection (STI) and the costliest bacterial STI. Furthermore, STI incidence and prevalence studies
estimate that women bare the highest burden of C. trachomatis infections in the United States. These infections
often progress undetected and can ascend from the vaginal mucosa into the upper reproductive tract leading to
severe health complications, including infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancies. Moreover, these
infections can increase the risk of acquiring more severe secondary infections, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(N. gonorrhoeae), antimicrobial-resistant strains (AMR), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1).
Memory T cells that become localized in the female reproductive tract (FRT) mucosa through recent infection or
vaccination in animal models have been shown to provide optimal immune protection from C. trachomatis,
leading to more rapid pathogen clearance and reducing disease severity. Therefore, generating memory T cells
against bacterial STIs in the FRT is a promising approach to enhancing cellular immunity. Previous scientific
investigations into understanding memory T cell longevity outside the circulation demonstrate that environmental
signals provided by the tissues provide critical support required for their homeostasis and survival in the lung,
skin, and gut. Yet, despite the fact that chlamydial reinfections in women are common and there is no available
vaccine, we have a very limited perspective on how the tissue environment of the FRT impacts T cell-mediated
immunity generated against STIs. Therefore, a major challenge for developing strategies, including vaccine
designs that can prevent bacterial STIs, including chlamydial infections in women, is to determine how we can
support long-lived and durable immunity in the FRT under menstrual cycle regulation. Our proposal aims to
understand the mechanism(s) driving the survival and recall of resident memory T cells (TRM) localized in the
FRT following a previous infection."
10786447,"Abstract. The clinical responses to respiratory viruses are very heterogenous as recently demonstrated by the
COVID-19 pandemic with most aggressive clinical courses among elders, suffering the highest mortality. The
pathophysiological mechanisms leading to poor outcome among elders people are not well understood. Beyond
the increased mortality seen in advanced age group, older critically ill COVID-19 patients (>65yo) had higher
viral loads in their lower airways and blunted anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Using host transcriptomic
approaches described in our preliminary data we are identifying a pattern suggestive of maladaptive immune
responses, more prominently present among elders, that leads to poor outcomes in patients with respiratory
viruses. In addition, through a collaboration between Drs. Segal, Zhang and Forst, we have identified age-related
signatures that are distinct from the lower airway and systemic transcriptome. Interestingly, some of these signals
are also seen in a cohort of patients with influenza virus infections, suggesting a novel profiling that may uncover
important mechanisms of immunoaging. Thus, using samples and data collected from patients with SARS-CoV-
2 or influenza infection, we will test the hypothesis that among older patients with respiratory virus infections,
poor prognosis is characterize by maladaptive host immune responses characterized by downregulation
of type 1 interferon (IFN) responses and increased inflammatory injury, thereby suppressing immune
mechanisms designed to limit viral load. Here, in Aim 1 we will focus on lower airway and blood samples
from critically ill COVID-19 patients. In these, we will use RNA sequencing and single cell RNA
sequencing to evaluate for longitudinal host immune signatures associated with poor outcome among
different age groups. Then in Aim 2 we will establish multiscale gene network models associated with
poor outcome among different age groups of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Then, in Aim 3 we will
perform a comparative study of age-dependent host immune response signatures and network models
in COVID-19 and influenza virus infection. Therefore, this is an unprecedented opportunity to conduct
investigations on paired lower airway and systemic samples from patients suffering infections with respiratory
viruses across different age segments in order to identify novel mechanisms that lead to poor viral control and
clinical outcomes."
10793550,"Summary/Abstract
Blood vessels play an important role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure (BP). Precise BP regulation
requires coordination between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor signals in the endothelium (EC) and smooth
muscle (SMC). EC-derived nitric oxide (NO) is among the key signals which instruct the SMC to dilate or
contract. Our studies show that the NO pathway is coordinately regulated through transcriptional and post-
translational pathways initiated by PPARγ, a nuclear receptor transcription factor. Our data support the
concepts that PPARγ: 1) acts as a sensor in EC to regulate redox state, and through this, bioavailability of NO,
and 2) regulates the responsiveness of SMC to NO by independently controlling a) a RhoA/Rho kinase
(ROCK) activity that promotes constriction, and b) production and stability of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a critical
mediator of vasodilation. The range of PPARγ-dependent molecular mechanisms in both cell types is
surprisingly complex; requiring novel transcriptional co-factors (e.g. retinol binding protein 7; RBP7) which form
a transcriptional regulatory hub with PPARγ, and post-translational regulation of critical SMC mediators (RhoA
and phosphodiesterase 5, PDE5) by Cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated protein turnover. Importantly, this
PPARγ initiated “final common pathway” has profound effects on vasomotor function, BP and vascular
stiffness, and the studies proposed herein have potential implications for the treatment of these disorders.
However, the signals which initiate and mediate these responses and the range of molecular targets remain
poorly understood. This proposal will focus on two distinct PPARγ-regulated pathways. We will examine the
PPARγ-RhoBTB1-Cullin-3 pathway in smooth muscle and will 1) determine if the RhoBTB1-Cullin-3 pathway
can be exploited as a potential future therapeutic by assessing if RhoBTB1 can protect and reverse
phenotypes in models of hypertension or in other disease models in which vascular dysfunction is a
comorbidity, 2) determine if RhoBTB1 is important in other cells types including endothelium, and 3) employ a
proteomic strategy to identify novel RhoBTB1 binding partners and Cullin-3 substrates in vascular smooth
muscle. We will also examine the PPARγ-RBP7-anti-oxidant pathway in endothelium and will perform 1)
structure function analysis to identify key mechanisms regulating PPARγ transcriptional activity by RBP7, and
2) genome wide transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies to assess the contribution of RBP7
to mediated transcriptional activity of PPARγ and its obligate heterodimer RXR. This program will lead to new
concepts and directions of investigation for the field and will not only deepen our understanding of the role of
two fundamentally important pathways in the vasculature, but will also address fundamental transcriptional and
post-translational mechanisms that are of relevance in many cell types."
10790173,"Discovery of Human HLA T Cell Epitopes in Human Metapneumovirus
HMPV is a leading cause of lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. Although nearly all
people are infected with HMPV by age 5 years, immunity to HMPV is incomplete and re-infections occur
throughout life. More severe disease occurs in persons with underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, or prematurity. Data from our group and others shows that T cells are
important to clear infection in mice and humans, yet T cell response can also contribute to disease severity.
Thus, characterizing the human T cell response to HMPV is important to guide safe and effective vaccine
development.
Our lab has established methods to discover human MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes using HLA-transgenic
(huHLA-tg) mice and human PBMCs. The huHLA-tg mice express different HLA supertypes, which collectively
capture a large proportion of different HLA alleles among diverse human populations. We propose to apply
these methods to discover HLA-restricted HMPV epitopes recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. We will
screen both overlapping peptide pools and predictope peptides by ELISPOT against T cells derived from
huHLA-tg mice infected with HMPV. Individual epitope peptides that are confirmed by ELISpot will be ordered
as tetramers from the NIH Tetramer Core. Tetramers will be used to thoroughly analyze and characterize
HMPV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, including: effector molecule production such as IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2,
perforin, and granzyme; degranulation using CD107a; transcription factor profile; and inhibitory receptor
expression. Dominant epitopes confirmed by tetramer staining will be tested for protective efficacy using
peptide vaccination and live virus challenge of mice. HLA-typed human PBMCs will be used to confirm bone
fide recognition of the epitopes by human CD8+ T cells. The results of this project will identify widely shared
HMPV epitopes that can be used to design candidate vaccines and evaluate the response to any HMPV
vaccine. These tools will be needed to understand human immune responses to both natural infection and
vaccines, which is important given the immune-mediated pathology associated with HMPV."
10804699,"Microbes produce natural products to thrive in unique environments where they face a wide
range of conditions and competing organisms. These diverse molecules are often unique to
individual species and play roles in cellular communication and signaling, interspecies
competition, nutrient acquisition, and virulence. The ability of natural products to function in
the biological setting make them attractive candidates for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.
Indeed, roughly two-thirds of small molecule drugs are derived from natural products.
Understanding the biosynthesis of unusual natural products will facilitate the analysis of the
thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with no known product and may lead to the discovery of
new pharmaceutically active molecules. One family of peptide-based natural products is
produced by the multidomain nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Among the hundreds
of NRPS products are the important peptide antibiotics vancomycin and teixobactin, β-lactam
antibiotics like some penicillins and cephalosporins, the genotoxin colibactin, the
immunosuppressant cyclosporin, as well as bacterial siderophores like enterobactin, pyoverdine,
and mycobactin. NRPSs use a remarkable assembly line architecture; multiple protein domains
are joined in a single protein that can be thousands or tens of thousands of residues in length.
During biosynthesis, amino acid building blocks are covalently loaded onto a carrier domain and
delivered to neighboring catalytic domains for peptide extension and modification. The use of
nonproteinogenic amino acids in a ribosome- and mRNA-independent synthesis, as well as
subsequent chemical modification by auxiliary domains, enables the striking diversity of NRPS
products. We propose to continue our biochemical and structural studies to understand the
molecular basis of NRPS function. We will identify the features that govern the efficient
progression through the NRPS structural cycle to allow the delivery of bound substrates in a
coordinated, efficient process. These studies will determine structures of large, multidomain
enzymes in catalytically relevant conformations to understand features that enable this
structural cycle. We will also examine unusual NRPSs to identify the features that endow NRPS
domains with the ability to perform unexpected chemical reactions. We will examine NRPSs
with undetermined biosynthetic mechanism with a particular focus on unusual catalytic
properties of condensation and thioester domains, and will determine the products of
uncharacterized NRPSs from human pathogens."
10800462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Unprecedented clinical successes in past 12 years with immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) such as anti-
CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 re-instigate strong interests in recent years to study the interplay between radiotherapy
(RT) and the immune system, a long-forgone observation. Recent seminal efforts from many groups show that
RT, by releasing danger signals and novel neoantigens, drives dendritic cell maturation that in turn cross prime
T cells to mediate anti-tumor immune responses. However, T cell-intrinsic mechanisms in RT have been
elusive, despite the indispensable role of T cells in governing RT efficacy. Moreover, by turning tumors into in
situ “personalized” vaccines and debulking ICB-resistant large tumors independent of direct killing by IFN-, RT
represents an ideal therapeutic option to overcome ICB resistance associated with tumor loss of IFN-
signaling, a major mechanism of resistance to ICB that we and others recently identified. This study is logically
built upon our preliminary data showing that our RT regimen activates mTOR and its downstream target, the
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs); specific deletion of HIF1 in T cells
abolishes therapeutic effects of RT. Importantly, although not as potent as in WT tumors, our RT regimen is
still able to induce significant suppression of tumors lacking functional IFN- signaling. We therefore
hypothesize that the mTOR-HIF1 axis in TILs is a major mechanism underscoring the therapeutic and
immunological effects of RT, which can be utilized to overcome ICB resistance. In Aim 1, we will establish T
cell-intrinsic mTOR-HIF1 axis controls RT efficacy. In Aim 2, we will determine cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which activated HIF1 orchestrates anti-tumor immunity elicited by RT. In Aim 3, we will
rigorously test our RT regimen, either alone or in conjunction with “targeted” chemotherapies and/or ICBs, in
both human and murine melanomas lacking functional IFN- signaling, with an overall goal to overcome this
major mechanism of ICB resistance. Our studies will reveal for the first time T cell-intrinsic mechanism(s) in
RT. Since our tested compounds are clinically approved, our findings will facilitate a rapid bench to bedside
translation. Furthermore, our rationally designed RT and RT+ICB regimens may guide future clinical trials."

This proposal discovers a novel role of the autonomic nervous system in controlling alveolar formation during
lung development. This finding has opened up a new area of investigation that will increase our mechanistic
understanding of how alveoli are generated. Knowledge from the proposed study has important implications
for treating human lung diseases caused by alveolar immaturity or loss. In this proposal, we will test a model
in which autonomic innervation and activity control alveolar formation. In this process, planar cell polarity
(PCP) signaling regulates neurotransmitter trafficking and release. Neurotransmitters secreted by autonomic
nerves control myofibroblast proliferation and migration, a key step in alveolar formation. Our specific aims
are: (1) To test the hypothesis that autonomic innervation of the lung plays a critical role in alveolar formation;
(2) To test the hypothesis that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling controls neurotransmitter trafficking and
release at the autonomic nerve terminals in the lung; and (3) To test the hypothesis that autonomic
innervation of myofibroblasts is critical for their function during alveologenesis. Taken together, this
application will uncover a novel mechanism of controlling alveolar formation through autonomic innervation. It
also has the potential to provide new strategies to stimulate alveolar regeneration by promoting lung
reinnervation."
10913527,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating the safety and efﬁ-
cacy of treatments for diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders. Due to disease hetero-
geneity, disease rarity, or enrollment disparities, there are limited patients available for clinical trials,
making drug development costly and time-consuming with trials failing at a high rate. The 21st Century
Cures Act has called for regulatory agencies and drug developers to consider innovative clinical trial
designs that bridge conventional clinical trials with real-world data (RWD) to overcome some of these
limitations. External controls (ECs) from RWD have been used to construct the comparator arm in con-
ﬁrmatory trials that eventually received approval from regulatory decision-makers. However, concerns
regarding the validity and comparability of RWD with RCTs have limited their use in a broader context
thus far. Selection bias, differences in variable deﬁnitions, and unmeasured confounding can lead to
biased treatment effect estimates and incorrect inference if RWD are integrated with RCTs. The aims
in this project focus on addressing hidden biases when integrating RWD to improve the efﬁciency of
clinical trials. We will develop a novel sensitivity analysis framework for the use of external real-world
controls to assess the robustness of results to hidden biases, as well as robust and efﬁcient analysis
methods that selectively borrow and adjust for data discrepancies to mitigate the impact of hidden bi-
ases. We will actively engage in dissemination and translation of these new methods to researchers
from industry, academic and regulatory agencies through exemplary applications, state-of-art software,
statistical analysis plan template, resourceful website, and workshops and tutorial sessions. Our ulti-
mate goal is to facilitate more robust use of real-world evidence in regulatory decision-making."
10800894,"Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have substantially worse outcomes than those with primary
and localized CRC. Over 80% of CRC metastases occur in the liver, which has a unique endothelial cell (EC)-
rich microenvironment. Distinct from precedent EC studies focused on angiogenesis and vascular remodeling,
we discovered that liver ECs secrete soluble factors to promote mCRC development in a paracrine fashion.
Specifically, we found that human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3, also known as Erbb3) is a key
mediator of EC-induced mCRC growth in the liver. However, we found that liver ECs activate HER3 independent
of the only known HER3 ligand, neuregulins. Here, we made the paradigm-shifting discovery that leucine rich
alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) secreted from liver ECs is a novel HER3 ligand that activates CRC-associated
HER3 and promote CRC cell growth. Moreover, systemic inhibition of LRG1 attenuates the growth of CRC
subcutaneous (subQ) xenografts and increases mouse survival in an orthotopic mCRC model. The GOAL of this
proposal is to determine the role of LRG1 as a novel HER3 ligand in promoting mCRC development, and to
elucidate the mechanisms by which LRG1 binds and activates HER3. We HYPOTHESIZE that LRG1 is a novel
HER3 ligand and that the LRG1-HER3 signaling axis plays a critical role in CRC liver metastases development.
We will test this hypothesis in two SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1 will determine roles of EC-secreted LRG1 in promoting
mCRC initiation and outgrowth in clinically relevant mCRC models with EC-specific LRG1 knockout mice, a
LRG1 neutralizing antibody, and patient-derived xenografts and organoids. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms
by which LRG1 binds and activate HER3, and determined the correlations between HER3 activation and mCRC
patient outcomes. INNOVATIONS of this project include determination of a novel role of LRG1 in promoting
mCRC development, identification of LRG1 as a novel HER3 ligand, and elucidation of the mechanisms of LRG1
activating HER3. Successful completion of the proposed studies will also identify HER3 activation as a potential
prognostic biomarker for patients with mCRC, and lay a foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies for
targeting LRG1 and other amenable component(s) in the LRG1-HER3 signaling cascade."
10800976,"SUMMARY/SCOPE OF WORK
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Thrombotic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability
worldwide. Genetic, environmental, and pharmacological factors, as well as acute and chronic inflammatory
diseases, are linked to exacerbated thrombosis. Despite this heterogeneity of etiology and risk factors,
thrombosis pathogenesis converges on a common pathway culminating in the conversion of soluble fibrinogen
to an insoluble fibrin matrix that serves as the primary structural component of blood clots. However, there are
currently no therapeutic approaches that directly modulate fibrinogen.
RATIONALE: Thrombosis risk and severity are increased substantially with elevated circulating fibrinogen levels
and other perturbations that promote the formation of a dense fibrin network that is resistant to degradation. This
proposal is based on the concept that fibrin(ogen) can be directly targeted to produce porous fibrin clot structures
with poor red blood cell retention and enhanced susceptibility to fibrinolysis with the ultimate goal of reducing
thrombosis across diverse settings regardless of other confounding sequelae. The central hypothesis is that
specific and selective reduction of circulating fibrinogen levels or directed suppression of fibrin matrix formation
significantly protects against venous and arterial thrombosis while maintaining hemostatic potential.
SPECIFIC AIMS: Innovative studies will be performed using (i) a newly developed lipid nanoparticle delivery
system of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that knocks down fibrinogen to any desired target level and (ii) genetic
and pharmacological strategies (mRNA delivery) utilizing a customized fibrinogen variant (fibrinogenLOCK) that
suppresses fibrin polymerization. These approaches will be used to uncover the contributions of fibrinogen and
fibrin matrix formation in the development of venous and arterial thrombosis as well as to hemostasis and platelet
plug formation. The specific aims are to: (1) Determine the changes in venous and arterial thrombus formation
following targeted reduction in circulating fibrinogen or selective suppression of fibrin matrix formation; (2)
Determine qualitative and quantitative changes in bleeding and platelet plug formation during hemostatic
challenges following fibrinogen reduction or suppression of fibrin matrix formation; (3) Determine the efficacy of
fibrinogen reduction or introduction of fibrinogenLOCK in mitigating thrombosis during endotoxemia (acute
inflammation) and sickle cell disease (chronic inflammatory disease).
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND DELIVERABLES: This work will provide novel mechanistic insight into how
quantitative and qualitative changes in circulating fibrinogen or fibrin matrix formation alters thrombogenesis.
Moreover, the proposed studies will provide essential preclinical data on a novel management strategy for
thrombotic disease across diverse etiologies. We expect to demonstrate that knocking down fibrinogen or
introducing a polymerization-suppressing fibrinogen mutant mitigates thrombosis without impairing hemostasis,
even in the context of pro-thrombotic acute and chronic inflammatory diseases."
10801057,"ABSTRACT
The ability to regulate when and how emotions are used to guide cognition relies on adaptive and plastic circuits
that can integrate internal limbic-visceral and external sensory-motor information for a given behavioral context.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area that plays an important role in this process of emotional regulation
and multimodal integration, acting as a unique connectional node for the otherwise segregated cognitive, motor
and limbic networks. The ACC forms a robust network with the amygdala (AMY), a key limbic structure for
emotion and arousal, which exhibits specialized circuit reorganization and plasticity during emotional stress. Our
previously funded R01 (MH116008) focused on comparing the ACC with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC),
another region implicated in cognition and stress, and on the extrinsic ACC pathways to cognitive/motor and
limbic areas. It remains unclear how exactly these multimodal pathways interact across the functionally distinct
rostral ‘cognitive’ (a32), ventral ‘limbic’ (a25) and dorsal ‘motor’ (a24) subdivisions of the ACC, which is the focus
of this renewal application. Our work in the previous grant period has shown that the robust ACC interconnections
with AMY span all ACC areas and are therefore, well-suited for integrating information across these distinct ACC
functional domains. Further, compared to ACC projections to cognitive/motor areas in LPFC and dorsal premotor
(PMd) cortices, AMY-targeting ACC pyramidal neurons show greater laminar diversity in their distribution, and
biophysical, structural, and inhibitory synaptic properties. Computational modeling show that these unique single-
cell biophysical and connectional properties contribute to diverse laminar oscillatory dynamics in ACC outputs to
AMY, which can support synchrony at low frequencies in L5, but at high frequencies in L3. In contrast, cortico-
cortical ACC outputs to PMd are more tuned towards higher oscillatory frequencies in both layers. While we have
shown how these extrinsic ACC outputs are diverse at the single cell level, the question remains as to how
multimodal information is integrated within the ACC. This renewal focuses on the largely uncharacterized short-
range interconnections within and between the functionally distinct ACC areas that are likely important for this
multimodal integration. Using anatomical tract-tracing, optogenetics, slice physiology, high-resolution
microscopy and computational modeling we propose to assess intrinsic ACC-ACC interconnections in adult
rhesus monkeys (5-13Y) with regards to their: excitatory vs inhibitory constituents, neuromodulation of synaptic
plasticity, interactions with long-range cognitive (LPFC), motor (PMd) and limbic (AMY) pathways, and
contributions to diverse network dynamics. The overall hypothesis is that distinct short-range intrinsic ACC
circuits have specialized excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory properties and interactions with
long-range cortico-limbic pathways, which endow diverse network oscillatory dynamics and plasticity
in the ACC. Novel data from this study will yield new insights into how selective circuit neuromodulation within
distinct ACC networks can lead to normal cognitive-affective behavior and its dysfunction in the primate."

Uncertainty in exposure and outcome measurements poses substantial challenges to the identification and
quantification of the causes of cancer. For example, although difficult to measure well, physical activity patterns
form the basis of many etiologic hypotheses concerning cancer risk. Cancer cases identified in electronic
health records (EHR) and other administrative ‘big data’ sources, such as Medicare claims data, are also
subject to misclassification. This exposure and outcome uncertainty leads to considerable bias in estimated
health effects, masking our ability to detect true associations, which are likely underestimated if detected at all.
It is the role of measurement error and misclassification correction methods to validly and efficiently estimate
the relationship between exposures and cancer outcomes. To accomplish this, a validation study is required for
estimating key features of the error process. Although much has been accomplished in this domain over the
years, the current aims address unsolved problems of high scientific significance that would otherwise remain
unanswered without this additional work. We will drill down into the multi-faceted themes that arise in cancer
research, tackling several seminal new directions of critical importance for the translation of the results of
population-based research to practice and policy. These methods will include estimation of the effects of
within-individual change in lifestyle behaviors on cancer risk corrected for measurement error in the change
variables, utilizing complex, currently under-accessed validation studies of diet and physical activity comprised
of repeated paper and online questionnaire self-reports and repeated concentration and recovery biomarkers
to obtain relative risk estimates unbiased by general measurement error structures which may include
correlated and biased errors, and estimating effects of exposures, including medications, other clinical
treatments, and health behaviors, on cancer incidence in EHR data. The new methods will be applied to
studies of the impact of within-participant change in alcohol intake on breast cancer incidence in the American
Cancer Society’s CPS-II cohort and in Harvard’s Nurses’ Health Study, and to a study disentangling the
impacts of diabetes and diabetes medications on colorectal cancer risk in Yale New Haven’s Epic EHRs.
Dissemination is a central feature of this research. User-friendly publicly available software will accompany all
new methods to be developed. The new methods will be disseminated through short courses and lectures at
national and international epidemiologic and statistical conferences, and through the development of a massive
online open course (MOOC). We have assembled an outstanding team of experts in measurement error
methods and statistical theory, along with an exceptional team of cancer epidemiologists with much prior
collaborative experience with the methods team, to guide the developments and their applications to the
scientific problems at hand. With the talented junior faculty and trainees to be recruited for this project, we will
solve the challenging problems that have been identified."

Multiple neurological diseases [e.g. spinal cord injury (SCI), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain
stem stroke] can all result in severe and devastating limb paralysis. A recent comprehensive
assessment found that >200,000 patients suffer from tetraplegia or severe tetraparesis that prevents
completion of basic activities of daily living that require arm and hand functions. Surveys of such
patients have indicated that improvement of arm and hand function is a top priority. There are no
current therapies or assistive devices that can aid patients with tetraplegia or severe tetraparesis to
experience restoration of reaching and grasping functionality. Our proposal aims to test methods to
enable such patients to directly control a complex robotic arm and hand with the capacity to perform a
set of clinically relevant tasks.
Our specific goals are to leverage the stability of ECoG to establish robust robotic control that is stable
across a period of at least 8 weeks without need for recalibration. Our published data along with new
preliminary data supports the notion that ECoG signals can allow a paralyzed individual to learn
complex neuroprosthetic control that requires no additional training. We will compare two decoding
methods and their ability to enable long-term stable ‘plug-and-play’ complex control. We then aim to
further boost robustness of real-world control in two ways. First, we will track fluctuations in neural
states to reduce decoding errors; this is key for long-term continuous accurate control. Second, we will
test a system that can assist with pre-shaping the robot during neuroprosthetic control.
Together, our aims will determine the feasibility of complex control of neuroprosthetic technology in a
target population of paralyzed patients with severe disability. We will determine how well ECoG can
enable stable and intuitive control of a robotic arm and hand that can enable reaching, grasping and
flexible manipulation of objects. We strongly believe that demonstration of these outcomes will drive
the field towards clinically viable neuroprosthetic control and thereby dramatically improve the quality of
life for paralyzed patients."

The fluorescence lifetime measures the duration a fluorophore remains excited before returning to the ground
state by emitting a photon. It is an intrinsic property unique to each fluorescent molecule and its environmental
state. Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) can perform in vivo lifetime measurements of
endogenous signals in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), ranging from vitamin A derivatives in
lipofuscin (LF) to flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD) in mitochondria. As many fluorescent molecules have been
implicated in aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), FLIO promises precise measurements of the
metabolic status and oxidative stress levels in retinal layers/cells. With three Specific Aims, we propose to
develop cellular-level FLIO. First, we will marry FLIO with state-of-art adaptive optics (AO) to overcome the
eye’s optical imperfections and create adaptive optics (AO) enhanced FLIO (AOFLIO). We will develop
AOFLIO on an AO scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO), a retinal imaging instrument with proven cellular
resolution. The AOFLIO instrument will achieve diffraction-limited image resolution (~2 μm lateral, ~ 30 μm
axial) over a 7º X 7º FOV in a single frame; this is ~21 times larger than that of the current AOSLO. Further,
We will fortify AOFLIO with novel image-processing strategies to quantitatively resolve the complex mix of
colors and lifetimes of retinal and RPE fluorophores. The improved processing capabilities of phasor analyses
of fluorescence lifetimes will permit superimposed signals from multiple molecular species to be unmixed and
permit imaging with a meager light budget. We will leverage recent advances in the histology of the human
retina and RPE for in vivo analyses using FLIO to measure fluorophores within individual cells, specific layers,
and subcellular structures. Thus, AOFLIO promises the combined speed and resolution with an adequate field
of view (FOV) to offer a needed window into retinal function in normal physiology and disease. Second, we will
characterize and distinguish fluorescence signals with high spatial precision in normal human subjects and
establish a normative database of fluorescence lifetimes in different retinal layers and individual (photoreceptor
and RPE) cells in human subjects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity, thereby facilitating correlation with
leading candidates for signal sources. Third, we will use AOFLIO to characterize the metabolic function of the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in AMD, a disease that causes vision loss in over 10 million older Americans.
Our study will focus on intraretinal hyperreflective foci (IHRF), the strongest predictor of the development of
late AMD, and investigate fundamental questions of IHRF pathogenesis and its role in the pathophysiology of
AMD. These Aims will help us improve retinal and RPE metabolic function assessment in normal aging and
AMD. The achievement will provide a foundation for future investigation of the pathophysiology of a broad
array of retinal and central nervous system diseases for which aging is a risk factor."
10803565,"Project summary: The long-term goal of this project is to determine the role of TET1 in non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression. Several recent studies have suggested that the DNA
methylation of specific genes, such as insulin growth factor-like protein 2 (IGFBP2), is highly associated with
NAFLD development. Besides, global DNA methylation is decreased in NAFLD patients. The extent of DNA
methylation is negatively correlated with inflammation and fibrosis in these patients, suggesting the importance
of DNA methylation in NAFLD progression. DNA methylation is catalyzed by the DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs), including DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. In contrast, active DNA demethylation is a series of
biochemical reactions catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase family
proteins, including TET1, TET2, and TET3. It was reported that DNMT1 deficiency inhibited steatosis in an
alcohol-induced steatosis mouse model, thus contradicting the clinical findings. Similarly, liver-specific TET2
and TET3 knockout (KO) mice with elevated global DNA methylation in the liver developed fatty liver diseases
spontaneously, again contradicting the clinical results. Interestingly, it has been shown that the whole body and
adipocyte-specific TET1 KO mice are both protected from obesity in the high-fat diet (HFD) feeding model,
linking the protective role of TET1 in NAFLD. Our unpublished data further demonstrated that two different
whole-body TET1 KO mouse models have improved liver functions and lipid profiles when challenged with an
HFD feeding. We performed RNA-Seq using the liver samples and found that TET1 promotes NAFLD possibly
through targeting CD36 and IGFBP2 which are both involved in hepatic lipid metabolisms. Therefore, based
on the previous findings and our unpublished data, we hypothesize that expression of TET1 leads to
altered epigenetic gene regulations in the liver, contributing to the NAFLD development. We propose
three specific aims to evaluate our hypothesis. 1) We will determine the role of hepatic TET1 in NAFLD
progression. Liver specific TET1 KO mice will be used to determine if depleting hepatic TET1 protects NAFLD
progression. Primary isolated control and TET1 KO hepatocytes from mice will be used to determine lipid
metabolic changes. Besides, control and TET1 KO human hepatocytes established using the CRISPR/Cas9
system will be used to determine if the findings in mice can be translated into human pathobiology. 2) We will
determine the mechanisms by which TET1 is involved in NAFLD development by investigating if TET1’s
enzymatic activity is required for the target gene regulation. Besides, the impacts of reversing TET1 signaling
cascade on NAFLD progression will be determined in vitro and in vivo. 3) We will characterize the impacts of
TET1 on non-parenchymal cells during NAFLD progression, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated
macrophages which are highly correlated with NAFLD disease severity. Accomplishment of the proposal will
yield results toward establishing TET1 as a potential target in NAFLD."

Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have severe anemia due to chronic red blood cell hemolysis and increased oxidative stress. SCD patients present abnormal metabolome profiling for metabolites involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, nucleotide catabolism, and glutathione metabolism. As those metabolites are critical for the hypoxic response, contributing to RBC sickling, mediating inflammation, and activating oxidative stress response, it is warranted to characterize the mechanism by which those aberrant metabolic programs contribute to the SCD disease progression and severity.
By metabolite profiling analysis, we demonstrate that excess heme exposure from hemolysis impairs the TCA cycle activity, leading to accumulated levels of 2-Oxoglutarate (2OG), which will outflow towards L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG). The accumulated 2OG and L2HG display epigenetic modification functions through regulating the enzymatic activity of 2OG-dependent histone demethylases and induce histone hypermethylation. These aberrant epigenetic changes suppress the expression of genes involved in heme/iron metabolism and ferroptosis response and cause iron-dependent programmed cell death ferroptosis. Excess heme was also found to induce the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of the oxidative stress response. Nrf2 ablation in SCD mouse model increased both L2HG levels and histone methylation to affect the expression of genes involved in oxidative and ferroptosis stress response. From these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the Nrf2/hemin/L2HG signaling mediates an integrated metabolic, epigenetic, and ferroptotic response program to regulate SCD severity. We will test this hypothesis with two specific aims. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that heme affects both metabolic and ferroptotic regulatory pathways to drive ferroptosis during erythropoiesis. Aim 2. To evaluate the therapeutic potential by modulating the Nrf2/hemin/L2HG signaling in preclinical SCD animal model. Findings from the studies will illustrate that the Nrf2/hemin/L2HG signaling integrates metabolic, epigenetic and ferroptotic programs to modulate the severity of SCD disease. Such signaling would be therapeutically exploitable for SCD treatment."

 Cannabis is the most widely used drug among pregnant women, and rates of use are increasing
dramatically. Reasons for the sharp increase in cannabis use (CU) among in perinatal women are not clear.
Changes in cannabis legalization, increased access and acceptability of the drug, and a perception of low
health risk or therapeutic benefit are possible explanations. Increased CU for medicinal reasons in the general
population may prompt women to consider CU for pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea. Further, symptoms
of anxiety and depression are common during the perinatal period, and some women may turn to cannabis if it
is perceived to be less risky, or more acceptable, than standard psychopharmacologic treatments. Yet adverse
outcomes have been documented, including higher incidence of low birth weight, greater need for neonatal
intensive care admission, and a 3-fold risk of neonatal morbidity. Mothers who use cannabis prenatally
experience higher rates of depression; among postpartum users, there is also a greater risk for depression and
as well as lower likelihood of breastfeeding. Not all women who use cannabis prior to pregnancy continue
during the perinatal period. Some data suggest that 2/3 of women discontinue CU upon learning of pregnancy,
with up to 1/3 continuing use. Our data show that many women who continue CU express conflicted feelings
about their use. Among those who quit, relapse is not uncommon, especially after delivery. Reasons for
continued CU during the perinatal period, and motivations for cessation, are relatively unknown. In light of the
widespread CU during the perinatal period, a critical need exists to develop tailored interventions, services,
and educational materials, particularly addressing the needs of pregnant women with high levels of mood and
physical symptoms. However, before interventions and services can be developed, it is crucial to elucidate
pregnant women’s motives for CU, predictors of use and cessation, the extent to which mood and physical
symptoms drive patterns of use, as well as the salience of contextual factors (e.g., access to cannabis).
Utilizing a framework based on socioecological models of health behavior, we propose to examine factors that
contribute to women’s CU behavior in the perinatal period. In this 5-year study, we will recruit 200 pregnant
women who report regular CU immediately prior and/or during pregnancy and follow them from the first
trimester of pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. We include 4, 10-day bursts of ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) during the perinatal period to track associations between maternal mood and physical
symptoms, CU, and cannabis cravings. Further, we will conduct qualitative interviews with women to elicit
feedback regarding ideal content and modality of future services and interventions. Quantitative and qualitative
results will be integrated to yield cohesive findings to guide future research and service development. Tailored
support for women may reduce deleterious outcomes associated with CU during the perinatal period."

The overall goal of this project is to test and refine a neurobiological systems model of speech-induced sensory
modulation (SISM). Previous studies used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG)
to reveal that auditory cortical responses evoked when speaking are reduced compared to passive listening, a
phenomenon known as speaking-induced suppression (SIS). This effect has been proposed to reflect the action
of learned forward models that predict sensory consequences of speech movements. While EEG/MEG studies
of SIS have provided important insights, these methods have limited anatomical precision. For this reason, the
auditory regions modulated by forward model predictions in speech, and the circuits that mediate them, remain
relatively poorly understood. To close this knowledge gap, this project uses 7T fMRI to measure brainwide activity
at exquisite resolution while participants complete a series of related auditory-motor tasks across multiple
sessions. Guided by contemporary models of speech production, we hypothesize that three functional circuits
link frontal speech planning areas with superior temporal auditory areas via cortical and trans-cerebellar
pathways, providing sensory predictions at different levels of representation. In Aim 1, one EEG and three fMRI
experiments will be used to map the sensory cortical areas modulated by self-generated speech. These studies
will define subject-specific regions-of-interest (ROIs) that differentially respond to overt speech vs. passive
listening to oneself or another speaker producing the same syllables or sentences. Multivariate encoding models
test hypotheses about the speech features represented in these ROIs. In the same speakers, we will determine
the extent and specificity of modulations in these ROIs during movement planning, prior to motor output. Aim 2
tests how these ROIs participate in error monitoring. Two fMRI experiments are designed to test hypotheses
about responses to auditory errors that are either (1) “low-level” acoustic-phonetic errors induced by unexpected
shifts in auditory feedback, or (2) “high-level” sound substitution errors elicited during a phonological error priming
task. Because Aim 2 is carried out in the same speakers as Aim 1, within-subject comparisons will enable high-
resolution individual-specific models and interpretations across observed effects. In Aim 3, we will determine the
role of the cerebellum (CB) in implementing learned forward models that drive SISM. Individuals with cerebellar
lesions and controls will be recruited to test the hypothesis that the CB is critical in learning predictive models for
speech. In these participants, and those tested in Aims 1 and 2, 7T fMRI will measure neural activity changes
during a speech motor adaptation task and a non-vocal auditory-motor learning task. Individuals with lesions in
Lobule VI are predicted to show reduced learning, reduced SISM, and reduced associations between CB and
auditory cortical activity. Together these studies will accelerate understanding of sensory-motor interactions in
speech through in-depth analysis of individual brains, enable the refinement of detailed neurocomputational
models, and set the stage for precision approaches to diagnosis and intervention in speech disorders."

In order to accelerate observational clinical studies and trials and to identify appropriate patients for treatments,
highly accurate and accessible diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed. Clinical assessments
alone are insufficient for accurate diagnoses, and the current gold standard tests for AD (CSF and PET) are
costly, limited to specialized medical centers, and perceived to be invasive. In our ongoing prospective Study to
Evaluate Amyloid in Blood and Imaging Related to Dementia (SEABIRD), we discovered that decreased blood
plasma Aβ42/40 ratio is an accurate biomarker of amyloid plaques and confirmed this in a diverse community-
based population, also demonstrating that blood tests are feasible to screen the general population.
We have discovered and reported the most accurate Aβ42/40 and phosphorylated-tau blood biomarkers
(%ptau217, %ptau205, and %ptau181) and discovered novel forms of neurofilament light (NfL) that promise to
quantify the major domains of AD pathophysiology. With demonstration that removal of amyloid plaques leads
to disease-modifying treatment clinical benefits, access to anti-amyloid therapies will depend on accurate
diagnosis, and blood biomarkers will be critical tools for doctors and patients in underrepresented populations.
However, there are multiple questions that need to be addressed to inform about the biology, use, and indications
of these rapidly developing and utilized blood-based biomarkers. These questions include: `What are the
diagnostic and prognostic properties of blood Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers to measure
amyloid and tau pathology, clinical cognitive decline, and diagnosis in a real-world clinical patient population?',
and `Which demographic, clinical, or genetic factors influence the relationship of blood A/T/N biomarkers to the
gold standards of clinical cognitive decline, dementia, and PET tests of pathology?'
Our proposed study, called SUNBIRD (Study to Understand Novel Biomarkers in Researching Dementia), will
enroll 1000 new participants from primary and specialty care clinics and follow the existing ~1000 SEABIRD
participants. We will incorporate high performance blood-based biomarkers tracking amyloid, tau and
neurodegeneration and assess their relationship with tau PET, amyloid PET, and other clinical AD tests. We will
follow these cohorts longitudinally using blood samples, EHR data, and in-person and remote cognitive testing.
We aim to understand how blood-based biomarkers can identify those with clinical symptoms due to AD
pathology, determine if blood-based biomarkers can be utilized in lieu of PET or CSF measures, and also
diagnose and stage patients to enable treatment and prevention in the clinic. The proposed work builds on the
prior pioneering approach that discovered and validated blood amyloid biomarkers, discovered novel tau
phosphorylation sites. These studies will lay the groundwork for rapid deployment to accelerate enrollment of
AD trials, clinical diagnosis, and early and accurate diagnosis for the whole population."

Cardiorespiratory conditions such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), congestive heart
failure, COVID pneumonia, and sepsis are among the most common causes of mortality and morbidity,
They are also notable for high rates of persistent psychological distress symptoms including depression,
anxiety, and PTSD that worsen quality of life and outcomes of the underlying conditions, Yet there are few
effective strategies able to overcome barriers of limited access to mental health care. Even less is known
about distress management among people from structurally disadvantaged backgrounds such as racially
and ethnically minoritized populations because of their suboptimal representation in relevant clinical trials.
To fill this gap, we developed Blueprint, an adaptive coping skills training intervention, and have
optimized it over years of research. We conducted a multicenter RCT (PCORI PFA 195) of a telephone- and
web-based version among those recently hospitalized with serious cardiorespiratory conditions, finding that it
reduced depression symptoms and improved quality of life among those with elevated baseline distress.
Informed by lessons learned about intervention delivery and eligibility criteria, we next conducted a singlecenter
pilot RCT (R34 HL 145387) that targeted a broader population and tested a completely automated,
self-guided, symptom-responsive mobile app version of Blueprint. We found excellent adherence and a
strong effect on depression, anxiety, PTSD, and quality of life compared to control.
Given these promising findings, a formal test of the Blueprint adaptive coping skills training intervention's
efficacy is needed. Therefore, we propose a 5-year multicenter RCT with 6-month follow up in which 400
cardiorespiratory failure survivors with elevated symptoms of psychological distress post-discharge are
randomized to either Blueprint or an Education Program control-both delivered through similar mobile app
platforms. Our specific aims will: (1) Test Blueprint vs. control on symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD,
and quality of life; (2) Determine patient-level characteristics associated with a great treatment response
among sociodemographic subgroups of interest, also applying a heterogeneity of treatment effects analysis
to identify other groups of clinical relevance; and (3) Ensure off-the-shelf intervention readiness for
implementation by using an exploratory mixed-methods hybrid type 1 implementation framework analysis
that integrates semi-structured interviews with trial participants and quantitative trial data from Aims 1 and 2.
Innovative elements include a fully automated mobile health delivery system that personalizes content in
response to changes in symptom trajectories, a focus on racially and ethnically minoritized persons, the
integration of a Spanish language intervention version, and strong community engagement. This project
addresses national research priorities and could advance the field with a personalizable yet populationfocused
therapy that could be scaled broadly and efficiently to enhance mental health equity."

The distinct phenotypes making up inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) affect all forms of functional vision,
and therefore, provide an illustrative disease model for low vision and blindness. Usual care for individuals with
IRDs consists of low vision rehabilitation (LVR). Patients experience variable effectiveness with LVR that is
often accompanied by elevations in depression and anxiety, which can complicate the delivery, impact, and
efficacy of LVR. There remains a critical need to develop an individualized treatment approach for patients with
IRDs addressing vision related anxiety. The Principal Investigator has created IRD-specific, psychometrically
validated, patient reported outcome (PRO) measures that capture and quantify specific disabilities of patients
in categories of physiologically distinct forms of visual dysfunction and distress that are seen in variable
phenotypic expressions of IRDs. Our goal in this grant application is to quantify the difficulties, limitations, and
distress experienced by the heterogeneous expressions of IRDs and intervene with LVR and psychotherapy.
Building on our earlier work, we propose to assess the impact of LVR coupled with a well validated cognitive
behavior therapy, called Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT), to enhance functioning and resolve elevations in
depression and anxiety. The proposed research relates closely with the National Eye Institute’s Vision for the
Future, where standards of care must come to emphasize the individual quality of life—with a particular focus
on the patient perspective and encompassing blindness rehabilitation and brain plasticity, assistive devices
and independent living, while also addressing depression in patients coping with vision loss. We propose to
quantify levels of vision-related difficulties, limitations, and distress detected by both the Michigan Retinal
Degeneration Questionnaire (MRDQ) and the Michigan Vision-related Anxiety Questionnaire (MVAQ) in a
cross-sectional study of 600 patients with varying phenotypic manifestations of IRDs. We will quantify
longitudinal change in vision-related and emotional difficulties, limitations, and impairment by intervening with
LVR and ERT applied by targeting the quantified functional deficits detected by MRDQ and MVAQ in patients
with varying phenotypic manifestations of IRDs, by conducting a three-arm trial in 180 IRD patients comparing
LVR in settings of low and high vision-related anxiety, and ERT given to individuals with high vision-related
anxiety to determine the comparative efficacy signal from IRD validated PROs. We see the current work as a
crucial first step to set the stage for a multicenter trial in provision of LVR and ERT for vision-related distress,
and thereby improving the quality of life of patients with progressive visual impairment due to genetic etiology.
This program of research may also offer a blueprint for tailoring and optimizing care for visually impaired
patients well beyond IRDs."

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin cancer with an incidence of 3,000 USA cases/year.
MCC carries a 2-year mortality of 40% with clear unmet medical need. Majority (65%) of MCC are virus-positive.
The Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the main driver of virus-positive MCC tumors. Viral T antigens are
highly immunogenic because they are foreign to the immune system. Viral positive MCC can thus be an ideal
setting to develop targeted immunotherapies including cancer vaccines. Several challenges confront our
ability to develop a T cell-based MCC vaccine; i) the lack of knowledge of conserved immunogenic MCPyV-
derived T cell epitopes that bind to diverse human HLA alleles to provide immunity; ii) the lack of a vaccine
platform for generating persistent memory T cells against cancer cells. To overcome these barriers, I have led
efforts for immunopeptidome analysis, leading to the generation of monoallelic class I expressing cell lines
across 95 different HLA alleles. Using this resource, we identified >185,000 HLA class I-binding peptides, from
which we trained highly accurate epitope prediction algorithms (HLAthena) 6,7. We developed robust protocols
to establish patient-derived MCC lines; application of HLAthena to these lines has yielded new MCPyV epitopes,
which we confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis (Lee JCI, in press). Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Moon we
developed lipid nanodisc immunization to target professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that are capable
of raising mucosal memory CD8 T cells to reject tumors.8 We hypothesize that cancer-driving MCPyV viral
antigens can yield highly immunogenic epitopes. We expect that such knowledge can fuel the development
of an effective off-the-shelf cancer vaccine against MCC. Our aims are thus to:Aim 1. Systematically determine
class I presented MCPyV epitopes across human HLA alleles that could provide global population
coverage for a T cell-based cancer vaccine. We have generated 95 single HLA allele-expressing B721.221
cell lines that provide global HLA coverage 7. We will transfect MCPyV LT and ST and seek to identify class I
HLA-presented MCPyV epitopes by LC-MS/MS analysis. We will also predict epitopes using HLAthena. Epitopes
identified from the MS analysis and predictions will be further analyzed to identify conserved promiscuous
epitopes which could be candidates for a universal off-the-shelf T cell-based MCPyV vaccine.Aim 2. Confirm
the immunogenicity of the candidate MCPyV epitopes. Immunogenic validation and characterization of
MCPyV epitopes will enable the discovery of candidate protective MCC-reactive T cell epitopes. We will utilize
already banked HLA typed naïve and MCC patient human PBMCs in these studies to determine T cell immune
memory, de-novo T cell responses, TCR avidity, and cytotoxic activity against MCC tumor cell lines. Aim 3. Test
the impact of T cell-based therapies directed against MCPyV in in vivo models. We will devise multi-epitope
vaccines using the nanodisc platform. These candidate MCPyV-targeting vaccines will be tested in MCC GEM
model for tumor control. We will further characterize MCC GEM model tumor microenvironment +/- vaccine."
10802822,"Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and results in reduced mobility and pain.
Epidemiological and clinical data have shown a correlation between OA and specific risk factors like obesity.
Particularly, overweight humans have a 4-5× increased risk of knee OA. Currently, the association is not fully
understood, and there are no FDA-approved drugs that can cure obesity-associated OA. For decades, animals,
particularly rodents, have been the most commonly used disease models that provided invaluable insights into
OA pathogenesis. However, one animal model is unlikely to simulate all OA phenotypes in humans. Furthermore,
a low rate of successful translation from current OA animal models to clinical trials was reported. A
complementary model that uses human cells and enables tissue crosstalk simulating human physiology would
thus be a valuable tool for recapitulating specific features of human OA that cannot be modeled in animals.
Recently, our team has engineered an in vitro microphysiological joint chip (miniJoint) that integrates the
osteochondral, synovial, and adipose analogs with immune cell (macrophage) components. In this new project,
we will continue the development and application of the miniJoint by introducing “obese” adipose tissues and
mechanical loading mechanisms to determine whether this novel in vitro system can be used to investigate how
non-obese and obese adipose tissues interact with other tissues during OA pathogenesis. The hypothesis of the
proposed studies is that “normal” adipose tissue drives cartilage degradation in response to interleukin-1β or
mechanical injuries, whereas “obese” adipose tissue secretes detrimental by-products causing cartilage
degradation and synovial inflammation, which is further exacerbated by interleukin-1β treatment or excessive
mechanical loading. The hypothesis will be tested by performing the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will define the influence of normal adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of OA in the miniJoint. Specifically, we will
use interleukin-1β or an in-house developed unit to introduce injuries to the miniJoint. In Aim 2, we will develop
an “obese” fat model in the miniJoint and examine if the by-products from dysfunctional adipose tissue in the
miniJoint will result in inflammation in the synovial tissue and the degradation of cartilage. We expect that
increasing mechanical loading will lead to significant cartilage degradation when the cartilage is simultaneously
exposed to the by-products from “obese” adipose tissue. In Aim 3, we will conduct comprehensive comparisons
among cartilage samples from the miniJoint, animal models, and human donors to define the unique capacity of
the miniJoint to accurately model human OA. The success of the proposed studies will define critical aspects of
human OA that can be readily modeled in the miniJoint. Through complementary studies in the miniJoint and
animal models, the mechanistic basis of obese adipose tissue-mediated pathological changes of joint elements
in humans will be elucidated and help guide the development of novel treatments. In addition, this in vitro model
can be easily adapted for use as a robust platform for novel drug screening."
10803516,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic stimulation depletes memory T cell potential and leads to exhaustion. However, self-reactive
autoimmune T cell responses persist and maintain function during chronic autoimmunity. The mechanisms
behind persistence of autoimmune T cells, including resistance to regulatory mechanisms such as deletion and
exhaustion, are not fully resolved and present a critical problem to our understanding and treatment of chronic
autoimmunity. Importantly, increases in T cell exhaustion markers are correlated with autoimmune remission
and positive responses to anti-CD3 therapy in type 1 diabetes (T1D), suggesting exhaustion to be an important
regulatory mechanism in autoimmunity. Our intriguing new data show that a continuous influx of T cells from the
periphery is necessary to maintain autoimmune T cell numbers in the pancreatic tissue during autoimmune
diabetes, suggesting limitations in the ability of T cells to persist and self-renew at the tissue site. We have
identified distinct CD4 T cell beta cell antigen populations infiltrating pancreatic islets in NOD mice. These
populations are distinguished based on TCR affinity, level of stemness, differentiation, and effector function. Low
affinity T cells are generally associated with a less differentiated phenotype, and preferentially form memory T
cells. Low affinity T cells could be a critical reservoir for autoimmune T cell persistence. Whether low affinity T
cells are differentially susceptible to regulatory mechanisms in autoimmunity is unknown. In this proposal we will
interrogate autoimmune T cell capacity for stemness vs. exhaustion in the context of TCR affinity for self-antigen.
We will assess the contribution of resident vs recruited cells to the tissue-infiltrating pathogenic population. We
will determine whether high and low affinity T cells depend on the same mechanisms for survival and persistence
during chronic stimulation. In combination, the Aims address the over-arching hypothesis that TCR affinity
determines T cell persistence and avoidance of tolerance to chronic stimulation by pancreatic antigen."

The neocortex, a structure covering mammalian brains, computes high-order sensory, motor, and cognitive
processes. Over the course of evolution, the neocortex of certain species expanded dramatically and folded,
thereby conferring superior sensorimotor and cognitive abilities. The immense expansion of the neocortex in
humans made possible the complex behavior, cognition, and intellect unique to our species. Neocortical
expansion and folding reflect an increase in the number of neural cells and, therefore, depend on the number of
neural progenitors (NPs). The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms regulating NP
expansion and neocortical growth and folding. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling promotes NP expansion. In
mice, ectopically elevated SHH signaling activity causes the neocortex to expand and fold. SHH signaling also
increases the number of NPs in the ferret, a species with a naturally folded neocortex, and in human cerebral
organoids, miniature models of the developing brain grown from human pluripotent stem cells. SHH signaling
expands NPs by regulating transcription. The short-term goal of this project is to understand how transcriptional
programs downstream of SHH signaling expand NPs. Preliminary data show that cyclin-dependent kinase 6
(CDK6) regulates a transcriptional program that drives NP expansion downstream of SHH signaling and that a
histone H3 mutation (H3pG34R) that is recurrent in pediatric brain cancer disrupts the SHH signaling–driven
transcriptional program driving NP expansion. Mutations in CDK6 and histone H3 are associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders and brain tumors. Based on these findings, this project will investigate
transcriptional programs driving NP expansion and mechanisms regulating the transcriptional programs by using
mouse models and human NP models that have gain- or loss-of-function mutations in SHH signaling, CDK6,
and histone H3. This project has two main aims. Aim 1 is to investigate how CDK6 regulates transcriptional
programs downstream of SHH signaling to expand NPs. For this aim, we will investigate (1.1) how SHH signaling
and CDK6 affect the transcriptome of each NP type in situ by employing a novel spatial transcriptomic method
with subcellular resolution and high transcriptome output and (1.2) how SHH signaling and CDK6 affect histone
modifications and chromatin structure to regulate transcription. Aim 2 is to investigate how the H3pG34R mutation
affects NPs. For this aim, we will investigate (2.1 and 2.3) the effects of the H3pG34R mutation on the behavior
and transcriptional program of NPs and (2.2) how mutations that co-occur with H3pG34R in pediatric brain cancer
modulate the effects of H3pG34R on NPs. The proposed study will provide important insights into the transcriptional
regulation of NP expansion and how CDK6 and H3 mutations affect such transcriptional programs, thereby
deepening our mechanistic understanding of brain development, evolution, and diseases."

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an exclusively human, double-stranded DNA alphaherpesvirus that produces
varicella (chickenpox) on primary infection then establishes life-long latency in ganglionic sensory neurons in
>95% of adults. With aging and immunosuppression, VZV reactivates in at least 1 in 3 individuals to produce
zoster rash (shingles) that can be further complicated by vasculitis (inflammation of the vasculature), myelitis
(inflammation of the spinal cord), or chronic pain (post-herpetic neuralgia, PHN). Diagnosing VZV as a
causative agent of disease is typically restricted to the detection of viral antigens and/or nucleic acids,
however, the disproportionate and sometimes lack of viral nucleic acid/antigen detection in tissues where
inflammation persists following acute infection has puzzled clinicians and researchers. Therefore, we suggest a
viral-induced, non-infectious “soluble factor” can drive pathology in tissues distant from viral replication in the
ganglionic sensory neurons. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (~40-200 nm in diameter) of endosomal
origin that carry cargo (proteins, nucleic acids) to cells for communication during normal and pathological
states, regulating biological processes and response to disease. Using mass spectrometry (MS) and next-
generation sequencing (NGS), our preliminary data shows that VZV-infected human sensory neurons (huSNs)
release non-infectious exosomes containing unique proteins and miRNAs as well as a single VZV protein
(immediate early 62) compared to uninfected neuronal exosomes. These proteins and miRNAs have been
shown to suppress the host’s innate antiviral pathway. Indeed, when applied to naïve vascular cells, VZV
exosomes induced robust transcriptional changes indicative of suppression of antiviral responses and
increased permissiveness to subsequent VZV infection. Compared to mock, VZV exosomes also induced
elevated proinflammatory cytokine release in these cells. Given the extensive sensory innervation of multiple
organs throughout the body, how these exosomes alter multiple disease-relevant central nervous system
(CNS), and non-nervous system cell types remains an important and unexplored area of research. We
hypothesize that VZV infected huSNs release non-infectious pathogenic exosomes that contribute to the
suppression of innate antiviral responses in cells, resulting in the enhanced permissibility to direct infection, as
well as induce a proinflammatory environment. To test this hypothesis, we will: (Aim 1) Determine the content
of pathogenic exosomes from VZV-infected huSNs throughout the course of infection and if antiviral treatment
alters the pathogenic contents; and (Aim 2) Determine the altered transcriptional and proteomic profile of
exosome-exposed primary human spinal cord astrocytes and brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts in the
context of innate antiviral immune evasion and inflammation. Understanding how virus-associated, non-
infectious exosomes reprogram cells provides a novel mechanism by which virus infection causes pathologies
distal from the original site of infection and expands the spectrum of virus-associated diseases."

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a progressive dilation of the aorta induced by profound disorganization of
the extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cell (SMC) dysfunction, which can lead to high morbidity and
mortality complications (i.e., ruptures and dissections). Although recent single-cell RNAseq studies greatly
informed SMC phenotypic evolution and TAA pathophysiology, no therapeutic avenues tested so far have
demonstrated superior efficacy over prophylactic aortic replacement, which remains the primary option for
patients with TAA. SMC mechanosensing (i.e., the ability of SMC to sense and transmit the vessel wall tension
into the cell) disruption is believed to be a central driver of aortic dilation and SMC dysfunction and due to
extracellular matrix degradation or focal adhesion defect. Yet, there are important unresolved questions. How
does defect in SMC mechanosensing influence SMC phenotypic transitions, particularly SMC
dedifferentiation? What are the mechano-dependent molecular and epigenetic pathways regulating SMC
phenotype and function in TAA? The long-term objective of this project is to investigate how SMC
mechanosensing influences nucleus and chromatin organization and identify mechano-dependent epigenetic
mechanisms whose alterations drive TAA-promoting phenotypes and aortic dilation. Our preliminary studies
identify histone modification H3K4me2 genomic distribution alterations in SMC as a common feature in human
and murine TAA, irrespective of etiology or experimental model. We have recently demonstrated that
H3K4me2 governs SMC lineage identity and contractile state, suggesting that loss of H3K4me2 could drive
SMC dysfunction in TAA. We also found that disruption of the interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and
the nucleus causes similar H3K4me2 alterations and a marked chromatin reorganization. Thus, we
hypothesize that nuclear mechanosensing plays a critical role in maintaining SMC contractile state. Disruption
of the ECM-Cytoskeleton-Nucleus axis encountered in TAA drives chromatin reorganization and epigenetic
reprogramming, including H3K4me2 redistribution causing SMC dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Our central
hypothesis will be tested by employing a multidisciplinary approach ranging from epigenomics to biomechanics
analysis in cultured cell systems, novel epigenome editing mouse models, and human specimens. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that loss of H3K4me2 drives aortic dilation by inducing SMC dedifferentiation and TAA-
promoting phenotypes. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nuclear tension controls chromatin organization
consistent with SMC differentiation and contractility. Aim 3 will determine if the disruption of focal adhesion
mediated-mechanosensing drives aortic dilation by triggering chromatin remodeling promoting SMC transition
to TAA-promoting phenotypes. This proposal will greatly enhance our understanding of external and cellular
pathways influencing SMC function through regulation of epigenetic programming. It could translate to the
identification of new therapeutic strategies for protection against aortic dilation."
10803186,"ABSTRACT
Obesity is the second leading cause of premature death. Consumption of ultra-processed foods is theorized to
be a key cause of obesity. Ultra-processed foods are formulations of cheap industrial sources of dietary energy
and nutrients plus additives such as fat, sugar, and flavors that enhance acceptability of the foods. A cross-
over experiment with overweight adults found that ad lib access to an ultra-processed diet for 2-weeks resulted
in increased caloric intake (508 kcal/day) and more weight gain versus ad lib access to a minimally-processed
diet matched for presented calories, energy density, macronutrients, sugar, sodium, and fiber (Hall et al.,
2019). The fact that ad lib access to ultra-processed foods resulted in a large increase in caloric intake and
weight gain implies that ultra-processed foods may more effectively activate brain regions implicated in reward
processing, attention/salience, and memory that influence eating behavior. However, no brain imaging study
has experimentally tested whether ultra-processed foods are more effective in activating brain regions
implicated in reward, attention, and memory than minimally-processed foods or experimentally investigated the
relative role of the elevated caloric density versus the flavor enhancers of ultra-processed foods in driving
greater activation of these brain regions. Preliminary data showed that tastes of ultra-processed high-calorie
chocolate milkshake produced greater activation in regions implicated in reward valuation (caudate, nucleus
accumbens), attention/salience (precuneus), and memory retrieval (medial temporal gyrus, dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex) than tastes of ultra-processed low-calorie chocolate milkshake. Aim 1 is to test the
hypothesis that tastes, anticipated tastes, and images of ultra-processed foods activate reward, attention, and
memory regions more than tastes, anticipated tastes, and images of minimally-processed foods, and evaluate
the relative role of the higher caloric content versus flavor enhancers in engaging these regions using a 2 x 2
experimental design. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that ultra-processed versus minimally-processed foods
promote stronger learning of cues that predict tastes of ultra-processed foods (incentive sensitization), which is
important because elevated reward region response to food cues/images increases risk for future weight gain
(Demos et al., 2012; Stice et al., 2015; Yokum et al., 2014). Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that participants
who show greater activation in reward/attention/memory regions in response to ultra-processed foods will
consume more ultra-processed foods ad lib and show greater future body fat gain, and to establish neural
fingerprints that predict ad lib ultra-processed food intake and body fat gain. Aim 4 is to test the hypothesis that
participants who show stronger reward cue learning in response to ultra-processed foods will consume more
ultra-processed foods ad lib and show greater future body fat gain. Improved knowledge of neural factors that
increase risk for body fat gain should guide the design of more effective obesity prevention programs and
treatments, which is critical because current prevention programs and treatments have limited efficacy."

Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) risk-stratification is increasingly relevant in the era of thoracic
endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), as outcomes and costs can differ significantly depending on
treatment choice and timing. In addition to clinical and social/demographic risk factors, morphologic
imaging biomarkers such as aorta diameter, entry tear size or locations, and false lumen (FL) thrombus
have been used to predict which patients are at risk of adverse aorta-related outcomes (AARO).
However, these morphologic parameters only indirectly reflect the underlying hemodynamic drivers
(e.g. flow, stasis, and pressure) that lead to AARO.
Our group has shown that 4D flow MRI can in TBAD can measure flow and regurgitation at entry tears
(ET) and quantify true lumen (TL) and FL flow, peak velocity, stasis, and kinetic energy (KE). Our pilot
studies provide strong evidence for the role of these hemodynamic markers for TBAD AARO prediction,
but available data is limited by low patient numbers, heterogenous cohorts, and variable outcome
measures. Additionally, we have identified the following key barriers to clinical translation of 4D flow in
TBAD: 1) image acquisition and analysis is inefficient and not fully validated for accuracy and
reproducibility; 2) it remains unclear which hemodynamic parameters best predict AARO; 3) it is
uncertain if MRA can be used for TEVAR planning (CTA is clinical standard).
The goal of the current proposal is to systematically address these limitations by building on promising
developments already underway in our group to test our central hypothesis: in vivo TBAD
hemodynamics improve predication of patients at high-risk of AARO relative to current
standard-of-care clinical, social/demographic, and morphologic biomarkers. First, we will use
state-of-the-art MRI acceleration and reconstruction techniques to develop and test a dedicated,
clinically translatable rapid, dual-VENC TBAD MRI protocol (Aim 1). We will also perform baseline and
1 year follow-up 4D flow MRI in n=100 acute TBAD patients to determine how hemodynamics compare
to other biomarkers for risk-stratification and AARO prediction (Aim 2). Finally, we will finetune our
existing AI-based 4D flow analysis tools to create an efficient TBAD hemodynamic quantification
pipeline for clinical translation (Am 3). Insights from this study will improve our understanding of the role
of hemodynamics in TBAD pathophysiology and provide new clinical biomarkers for risk assessment."

disease mechanisms that perturb cell shapes, structures and patterns. A great deal is known about the
genetically controlled terminal differentiation programs that produce the specialized cytoskeletal structures,
cell-cell junctional adhesions and cell-extracellular matrix contacts unique to each retinal cell type. How the
resulting cell shapes, structures and connections introduce physical constraints that influence final organ
shape and function is not well-studied. This is particularly critical to a complex organ like the eye, because the
organization of its diverse and highly specialized cell types must be precise to support vision.
The goal of this proposal is to understand the cellular and tissue-scale properties and interactions that together
sculpt the final form of the Drosophila compound eye. The fly retina provides a superbly tractable and well-
defined experimental model, with a proven track record in uncovering conserved mechanisms. The
stereotyped patterning and architecture of the fly retina facilitates the identification and tracking of individual
cell types over space and time, and the wealth of available markers permits detailed analysis and quantification
of cell shapes, structures, interactions and tissue-level patterns. Improving our understanding of fundamental
morphogenetic processes has relevance not only to normal development and regenerative biology, but also to
considering how disease-associated defects in one cell type or in one organ may influence adjacent cell types
or organs. Thus, the knowledge gained from the studies described in this proposal will improve understanding
of an important area of developmental biology and impact human health.
Aim 1 will investigate how interactions between different retinal cell types elaborate and maintain the precise
3D tissue organization and structure required for vision. Our hypothesis is that cell-cell and cell-ecm
interactions provide redundant mechanical coupling that organizes pattern, drives cellular differentiation and
ensures robustness of the retinal morphogenetic program.
Aim 2 will explore how tissue-intrinsic properties and the retinal-extrinsic environment contribute to the
establishment and maintenance of retinal curvature, a tissue-level property critical for vision. We hypothesize
that the pupal retina transitions from an initial “floppy” or viscous-like state that can be influenced by its
physical environment to a rigid or elastic solid-like state that can autonomously support tissue shape."
10803492,"Acute kidney injury is a diagnosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the
Veteran population. Therefore, we propose to develop a regenerative treatment for acute kidney
injury based on progenitor cell exosomes. Recent studies suggest that the therapeutic effects of
stem or progenitor cells are at least partially mediated through exosomes, a subset of
extracellular vesicle. Exosomes are advantageous as they can be lyophilized for storage, are
generally non-immunogenic, and do not require culture of cells just prior to therapeutic
administration. The stem or progenitor cell type that will be utilized for this study is the induced
nephron progenitor cell. Nephron progenitor cells form most of the differentiated cell types of the
adult nephron, but are exhausted just prior to birth in humans. Induced nephron progenitors are
derived from adult human cells in tissue culture through transcription factor reprogramming with
inducible piggyBac transposons. The reprogramming factors are SNAI2, EYA1, and SIX1. We
have isolated and characterized exosomes from induced nephron progenitor cells and find them
to be abundant. Our preliminary data demonstrate that induced nephron progenitor exosomes
have regenerative and protective properties in the HK-2 tubule cell line, human kidney
organoids, and mouse models of acute kidney injury. However, further development is
necessary to bring this potential therapeutic forward from bench to bedside. In Aim 1, we
hypothesize that the exosomes will reduce markers of kidney injury in ischemia reperfusion and
rhabdomyolysis mouse models of acute kidney injury. We will administer the induced nephron
progenitor exosomes before, concurrent with, immediately after, and one day following injury
and evaluate histology as well as markers of kidney function to determine the therapeutic effects
on acute kidney injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the induced nephron progenitor cell-
derived exosomes protect human tubule cells from apoptosis induced by nephrotoxicants
through specific protein and/or RNA species that can be modulated through genome
engineering strategies to further enhance nephron progenitor extracellular vesicle efficacy.
These studies will accelerate the translation of next-generation extracellular vesicle therapies
based on advanced cell and genome engineering techniques for treatment of acute kidney
injury."
10803385,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in cardiac arrest survivors ranges in severity from mild cognitive impairment to per-
sistent vegetative state. Precise estimation of neurologic outcome (neuroprognostication) in this setting is crucial
to guide families and physicians in goals-of-care decisions and to improve allocation of critical care resources.
Outcome prediction tools include neurologic examination, neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and electrophysi-
ologic studies. Accurate neuroprognostication remains challenging, as previous studies assessing the prognostic
accuracy of these tools have been affected by withdrawal of life support due to perceived poor neurologic prog-
nosis (WLS-N), and thus subject to self-fulfilling prophecy bias. This bias, along with early pessimistic prognosti-
cation, most often leads to premature death of those dependent on life support, including some with potential for
good neurologic recovery. Consequently, the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury unbiased by the
effect of WLS-N has not been adequately investigated. In Brazil, the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is
assessed by prognostic tools similar to those used in the US; however, life-sustaining therapies are maintained
for prolonged periods due to cultural norms. This difference in practice, unbiased by WLS-N, allows for a unique
opportunity to observe the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and to identify true predictors of poor
outcome. The elucidation of the impact of WLS-N on the performance of neuroprognostic tools is a vital step
toward more accurate outcome prediction. This will be the first study to combine the advanced expertise from
leading international sites analyzing neuroimaging and electrophysiologic data applied to a population unbiased
by WLS-N, and to unveil the impact of self-fulfilling prophecy bias on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury and on the prediction performance of guideline-recommended neuroprognostic tools. We will prospectively
collect data on demographics, premorbid characteristics, details of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, post-cardiac
arrest care, detailed neurological examination findings, electrophysiologic studies and neuroimaging at standard-
ized time points, and assess functional outcomes at discharge and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Our goals are to: 1)
Determine the independent effect of WLS-N on mortality and overall outcomes, and 2) Demonstrate the
prognostic accuracy of current guideline-recommended tools in an uncensored population. As an ex-
ploratory aim, we will also develop independent, blinded multimodal neuroprognostic models for the US
and Brazil cohorts, and compare their performance. By completing this innovative project, we will understand
the impact of WLS-N on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and better characterize the timing of
recovery after cardiac arrest. These data will influence future neuroprognostication studies and trials of neuro-
therapeutics, as well as optimize the use of critical care resources. This study is the stepping stone to strength-
ening data on neuroprognostication by improving their reliability, thereby ultimately easing undue patient and
family suffering from prognostic uncertainty, and directing medical resources most efficiently."
10789885,"Project Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emergent, currently pandemic
virus and etiological agent of Coronavirus Induced Disease-19 (COVID-19). Despite a flood of scientific
investigation, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the basic cellular processes that facilitate replication
of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and contribute to the pathogenesis of severe disease.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that IRE1α, a component of the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammatory cytokine responses. However, the
stage(s) of the viral life cycle and downstream cellular pathways that mediate these effects remain completely
unknown. ER stress and IRE1α activation are well-associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes,
hypertension, and aging, all of which are risk factors for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We hypothesize
that comorbidity-associated ER stress primes both exuberant viral replication and pathogenic inflammatory
cytokine production via IRE1α. This project leverages our unique ability to test this hypothesis using cell
culture infection models, as well as specimens from patients with COVID-19. IRE1α inhibitors are under
evaluation for treatment of non-infectious human diseases, and we propose that this project will provide
preclinical evidence for the novel application of these drugs to treat infections with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially
other human coronaviruses.
The experiments outlined in this proposal will determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which IRE1α supports
SARS-CoV-2 infection. IRE1α is a nuclease which initiates nonconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA, which
encodes a pleiotropic transcription factor. IRE1α also targets other specific RNAs leading to their degradation.
We will determine whether the requirement for IRE1α is XBP1-dependent or -independent and dissect the
downstream cellular processes that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammatory cytokine responses
(Aim 1). We will systematically identify stage(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle that require IRE1α (Aim 2). We
predict that IRE1α most likely supports biogenesis of ER-derived viral replication platforms, and will focus
experiments on this hypothesis. We predict that IRE1α represents a target for dual anti-viral and anti-
inflammatory therapy and will test this in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 3). Finally, we will
determine whether IRE1α activation occurs during human infection and ER stress is a prognostic marker for
severe COVID-19. Together, the results of this project will reveal basic cellular processes occurring during
coronavirus infection and host factors critical for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

10789910,"Science Core Abstract -- The Science Core (SC) is designed to provide scholars affiliated with the Duke
Population Research Center (DPRC) with high quality, flexible computing and technical services in a cost-
effective manner; including both data access and analytic tools. Over the past five years DPRC has (1)
invested in SC services that leverage the rich IT infrastructure at Duke to ensure provision and seamless
access to computational resources, new analysis tools, support for high-intensity network sampling and
simulation tools, (2) helped to identify appropriate technical support for complex population analysis, and (3)
provided training in new techniques, including those to analyze “big” data sources such as web-based data. In
the next five years, the SC will: (1) build on and maintain excellent computational resource provision for DPRC
scholars, and (2) develop accessible and reproducible tools, methods, and expertise for compiling, curating,
linking, and analyzing an ever growing volume of “big” administrative and healthcare data for population
research, an area in which DPRC scholars are already involved but still face significant challenges to use
them. To accomplish the latter goal, DPRC will bring together scholars at Duke in partnerships with local
government agencies and regional institutions to build the Durham Population Lab (DPL), an initiative that will
permit the examination of social and environmental features that contribute to divergent health trajectories in a
racially and ethnically diverse population. The DPL will function as a test “kitchen,” incorporating new data and
approaches, leveraging large population size for non-random sampling inference, and provide opportunities for
rapid assessment for evidence-based policy making, while advancing the NICDH Population Dynamics
Branch’s general interests in developing new tools and techniques for “big” population and health science."
10792907,"Devices for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are increasingly used for treatment of mental health
indications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is FDA-cleared for the treatment of depression, obsessive
compulsive disorder, and smoking addiction. Two forms of transcranial electric stimulation (TES) are approved
for psychiatric treatment, as well: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for depression and catatonia and cranial
electrotherapy stimulation (CES) for anxiety and insomnia. Further, there are ongoing clinical trials of other TES
paradigms, as well as new indications for TMS. However, these interventions have limitations including the
variable response to TMS, low efficacy of subthreshold TES, and cognitive side-effects of ECT. A contributing
factor is the lack of understanding of the neural elements and populations engaged by the stimulation, both in
general and within an individual patient. This precludes rational selection of the stimulation dose to target specific
neural elements or to account for individual differences in anatomy. For example, TMS intensity is individualized
based on motor cortex stimulation, which has limited relevance to typical targets in prefrontal cortex. Moreover,
the current amplitude in ECT and other forms of TES is not individualized at all, and anatomical differences thus
result in variable stimulation strengths within the brain. This is in contrast to invasive approaches, such as deep
brain stimulation, where modeling of neural target engagement is an established part of surgical planning and
dose selection. The goal of this project is to develop computational tools to simulate, quantify, and visualize the
direct effects of TMS and TES on neurons in the brains of individual patients. The modeled effects will include
both subthreshold polarization and suprathreshold activation of neural elements by the TMS or TES electric field
(E-field), which comprise the critical mechanistic link to subsequent brain circuit modulation. Aim 1 is to
implement high-fidelity models of cortical neurons as well as cortical and subcortical myelinated axons and place
them in individual head models. The neural models will have morphologies and membrane dynamics optimized
to represent layer- and brain-region-specific neurons, and will be validated with existing experimental data. Since
the computational demands to calculate the response of a large population of neurons are prohibitive, Aim 2 is
to develop and validate computationally efficient estimators of the neural responses to make the simulations
accessible for the average user with limited computational resources. Finally, Aim 3 is to make these simulation
and estimation tools widely available to researchers and clinicians by integrating the neural response
quantifications into the SimNIBS software package for E-field simulation to create an integrated tool termed
NeuroSimNIBS. This user-friendly software will enable researchers and clinicians to develop a better
understanding of the effect of TMS and TES on individual brains. Ultimately, NeuroSimNIBS could be used to
individualize the stimulation parameters and rationally plan experiments and therapies for more effective and
consistent neuromodulation."
10792908,"Project summary
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke claim more lives than all forms of cancer combined and result in an
immense health and economic burden (>$316 billion annually in the United States). Current strategies to
prevent acute coronary syndromes and ischemic stroke in at risk patients rely on anti-platelet drugs (e.g.
aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors), which do not translate into clinical efficacy in 1/3rd of patients. More potent anti-
platelet agents such as Glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors (e.g. abciximab) are associated with bleeding
complications and are not suitable for long-term use. Since CVD and stroke are characterized by thrombosis
and inflammation, an ideal drug would be one that inhibits thrombo-inflammatory responses without major
bleeding and activates inflammation resolution programs leading to polarization of macrophages from an M1
(pro-inflammatory) to an M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. To accomplish this, we are exploring an innovative
strategy to inhibit thrombo-inflammation by manipulating aerobic glycolysis in activated platelets and
leukocytes. Our approach will be to target the key regulatory enzyme of aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2
(PKM2). This approach takes advantage of the recent discovery that, like most normal cells, resting platelets
and leukocytes rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, whereas activated platelets and
leukocytes exhibit a high level of aerobic glycolysis (conversion of glucose to lactate in the presence of
oxygen). Notably, recent evidence indicates that PKM2 is highly expressed in the monocytes and
macrophages from patients with coronary artery disease, and a driver of M1 macrophage polarization. Utilizing
novel mutant platelet-specific PKM2 deficient and myeloid-specific PKM2 deficient strains, we have generated
preliminary data that suggests a role for PKM2 in modulating thrombo-inflammation. The goals of this research
program are to further understand how PKM2 regulates platelet and leukocyte function and to determine if
targeting dimeric PKM2 will inhibit thrombo-inflammation in a murine model of hyperlipidemia. To promote the
success of this innovative and high reward program, we will utilize complementary genetic and
pharmacological approaches and state-of-the art intravital microscopy, and follow updated Stroke Therapy
Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) pre-clinical guidelines. We have all the tools, including reagents and
state-of-the art intravital microscopy and animal models, to accomplish our goals. I have the prerequisite
experience as evidenced by my track record, which has shown high productivity and an upward trajectory in
the field of thrombo-inflammation. I have assembled a group of basic scientists and clinicians whose expertise
will help guide the proposed research from bench to clinic. This project has significant clinical implications
since a clear understanding of energy metabolism and its functional consequences on platelet and leukocyte
function could identify novel therapeutic targets common to both thrombosis and inflammation, which may
improve outcomes in patients at high risk for thrombo-inflammatory disorders including acute ischemic stroke."
10792943,"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass which provides days
to weeks of life-saving support to critically ill children and adults whose illness is progressing despite maximal
conventional therapies. Use of ECMO is expanding rapidly and it has supported >71,000 children worldwide.
Advances in ECMO have allowed more children to survive an otherwise fatal illness, however neurological
injury reduces survival by 50-60% and leads to significant long-term neurologic morbidity. Only half of ECMO
survivors have normal neurobehavioral outcomes. The underlying disease and ECMO may both disrupt
cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms and cause neuroinflammation, which may also disrupt autoregulation.
Disrupted cerebral autoregulation predisposes the brain to hemorrhagic or ischemic injury via excessive or
inadequate perfusion, yet it is not monitored during ECMO. Current clinical tools do not predict neurological
injury, greatly inhibiting the development of neuroprotective protocols. Specifically, there is no monitor to
continuously assess the state of cerebral autoregulation, forcing clinicians to rely on imperfect systemic
surrogates that may not reflect risks of impending neurological injury.
The long-term goal of this research is to develop continuous non-invasive bedside monitors for critically ill
patients. The primary goals of this proposal are to (1) test the hypothesis that continuous point-of-care optical
monitoring of cerebral autoregulation can predict neurologic injury after the first 48 hours of ECMO and (2)
demonstrate that optically measured indices of cerebral autoregulation are associated with neuroinflammatory
biomarkers in serial blood samples throughout ECMO. A pilot study led by the Pl has demonstrated the
feasibility of using advanced non-invasive optical monitors to assess cerebral autoregulation
and cerebral perfusion in pediatric ECMO patients. Our ongoing pilot study has shown disrupted
autoregulation indices correlate with neurological injury found on post-ECMO imaging. This proposal will utilize
diffuse optics to longitudinally monitor cerebral autoregulation and inflammation throughout ECMO in a large
pediatric population (0-18 y.o., n=125). In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that alterations in optical metrics of
cerebral autoregulation during ECMO predict neurological injury found on intra-ECMO CT. In Aim 2, we will
demonstrate that optical metrics of cerebral autoregulation measure the temporal course of neuroinflammation,
as evidenced by biomarkers in lab-based blood assays.
If successful, the work of this interdisciplinary team of physical scientists, clinicians, and neuroscientists will
establish the value of continuous quantitative optical monitoring of cerebral autoregulation to prospectively
identify periods of high risk of injury during ECMO. These results will enable the development of brain-focused
cardio-pulmonary bypass protocols (e.g., blood pressure titration) to reduce the rate of neurologic injury and
associated mortality and morbidity in ECMO patients."
10789210,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is substantial evidence that stem-like CD8+ T cells have a central role in the natural
control of chronic viral infection. For example, virus-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-1 natural
controllers have enhanced antiviral potential, related to the development of stemness
properties, including high survival, polyfunctionality, and proliferative potential. Similar
observations have been made for other chronic viral infections in humans, such as Hepatitis
B virus (HBV). The development of stem-like memory CD8+ T cells thus appears crucial to
achieving natural control of chronic viral infections. Considering the lack of cure for
prevalent chronic viral infections such as HIV-1 and HBV, we propose that future therapies
aiming at remission of these diseases require reprogramming CD8+ T cells to exhibit stemness
properties, via cellular adoptive transfer or direct administration of immunomodulatory
drugs. In previous studies, we optimized a system to reprogram HIV-specific CD8+ T cells
from non-controller individuals to improve their functional qualities, using a GSK3 inhibitor.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that HBV-specific CD8+ T cells from individuals with
chronic infection will benefit from this reprogramming method and enhance their functional
qualities. To further elucidate the effectiveness of such CD8+ T cell reprogramming to boost
their antiviral functions in other chronic viral infections, here we aim to: i) Evaluate the
impact of our established method of reprogramming on the antiviral potential of HBV-
specific CD8+ T cells from individuals with chronic infection, in terms of cytokine production,
proliferation, survival, and the response to immune checkpoint blockade; ii) To compare the
functional profile of reprogrammed HBV-specific CD8+ T cells with cells derived from
individuals who reached functional cure of HBV infection. The results of this proposal will
help to better understand the therapeutic potential of CD8+ T cell reprogramming by
targeting transcriptional and metabolic pathways, in the search for the remission of prevalent
chronic viral infections."

Over 3 million people in the United States carry a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic
and incurable condition of unknown cause that carries with it significant morbidity and healthcare costs.
Intestinal dysbiosis is a hallmark of IBD that contributes to its pathogenesis, though specific mechanisms
underlying this observation are lacking. As a gastroenterologist and physician scientist, the candidate seeks to
elucidate specific molecular mechanisms that mediate host-microbe interactions that drive IBD with the ultimate
goal of translating these findings into clinical applications. The proposed research builds on the candidate's
published observations that adenosine (Ado) regulates colonization and virulence of the Salmonella enterica
serovar Tyhpimurium and will provide the candidate with the additional training necessary to move forward as an
independent investigator. Whereas it has been shown that Ado signaling in the GI mucosa promotes resolution
of inflammation, the actions of Ado on the intestinal microbiota have not been examined. The proposed
research tests the hypothesis that extracellular Ado produced in the gastrointestinal mucosa influences the
composition and metabolism of the intestinal microbiota through inhibition of the bacterial stringent response
(SR) to inhibit dysbiosis and promote intestinal homeostasis. This hypothesis is explored through three aims: In
Aim 1, the mechanism by which Ado inhibits growth of enteric bacteria will be defined. Preliminary data show
that Ado inhibits bacterial growth by inducing amino acid auxotrophies through suppression of the SR, a global
bacterial adaptation to nutritional stress. The mechanisms underlying this observation will be determined
through metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of bacterial mutants deficient in purine metabolism. Aim 2 will
elucidate the mechanisms by which Ado promotes intestinal homeostasis by modulating the intestinal
microbiota. A novel mouse model wherein intestinal epithelial cells lack the ability to generate extracellular Ado
(conditional knockout of ecto-5'-nucleotidase) will be used to assess how Ado shapes the intestinal microbiota.
Murine fecal microbial transfer (FMT)-IBD will be used to examine the role of Ado in promoting intestinal
homeostasis by shaping the intestinal microbiota. Finally, Aim 3 presents a translational application of the
mechanisms under study by demonstrating that exogenously administered purines can alter intestinal
homeostasis in an analogous manner to naturally-occurring purines in the intestine. The proposed work will be
performed under the mentorship of Drs. Sean Colgan and Andrés Vázquez-Torres at the University of
Colorado, who have extensive expertise in the role of adenosine in gastrointestinal inflammation and the role of
nucleotide metabolism in the pathogenesis of enteric infectious diseases, respectively. This mentoring team is
ideally suited to the proposed research, which is situated at the intersection of each of their areas of expertise
and will provide the candidate with necessary additional training in the areas of murine models of IBD,
metabolomic analysis, microbiology, and microbiome analysis."
10786952,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rates of emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric emergencies in adolescents have increased
substantially in the past decade, including for suicidality, self-harm, and aggression. A substantial number of
these adolescents will be discharged home from the ED with referrals to outpatient mental health treatment.
Yet, engagement in outpatient mental health treatment among adolescents is low, and rates of repeated
emergency services utilization are high, highlighting the need for better supports for these youth and families.
While effective, brief interventions have been developed to directly support adolescents at the time of their ED
visit, no evidence-based interventions have been developed to support parents of these youth. Further, the
period following an emergency visit is known to be high risk, yet no existing services support parents during the
transition home, while waiting for connection to outpatient services. In this intervention development study, we
seek to iteratively develop, refine, and test an automated, text-messaging intervention for parents of youth
discharged from the ED after a psychiatric emergency. The 8-week intervention (iPEACE; intervention for
parent education after care in the ED) will directly target (1) parent mental health literacy and (2) parent self-
efficacy, with the goal of reducing ED utilization and enhancing outpatient mental health service use and
engagement. In the first phase of the study, we aim to develop and refine the intervention with stakeholder
feedback. Parents (N=15) will receive the 8-week iPEACE starting immediately following ED discharge.
Parents will provide both in-the-moment feedback via text-message surveys and in-depth feedback at the end
of the 8-week period via semi-structured qualitative interviews and self-report measures. We will also conduct
qualitative interviews with enrolled parents’ children and key ED stakeholders. We will use this feedback to
refine the intervention materials. In the second phase of the study, we will conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial (N=90), with n=30 parents randomized to enhanced usual care, n=30 randomized to enhanced
usual care with text-message reminders, and n=30 randomized to receive iPEACE. Parents will complete
follow-up assessments at 4-, 8- and 12-weeks to assess key intervention targets (self-efficacy and mental
health literacy) and outcomes (outpatient mental health service utilization and ED utilization). The goals for the
proposed project include: (1) developing and refining the iPEACE text-messaging intervention; and (2) piloting
the iPEACE intervention compared to enhanced usual care only and enhanced usual care with text-message
reminders to assess key study outcomes and mechanisms to inform a fully-power randomized trial. This R34
has important clinical implications, as findings from this study may support the testing and implementation of a
digital health intervention to improve outcomes for high-risk youth and families. The proposed study has the
potential to inform the provision of clinical services to support families during high-risk clinical transitions."
10787020,"Current strategies to prevent resistance to specific antibiotics focus predominantly on reducing
inappropriate use of those antibiotics. However, colonization with vancomycin-resistant
Enterococci (VRE) in immunocompromised children is not predicted by prior vancomycin
treatment. This observation, also seen for other multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO),
suggests that other host and pathogen factors are pivotal drivers of the spread of antibiotic
resistance. Using VRE as a model MDRO, the objective of this study is to discover drivers on
both sides of the equation. On the host side—how human intestinal microbiome environment
selects VRE—and the pathogen side—which genes allow VRE to outcompete in microbial
communities. Using a combination of molecular, bioinformatic and population-level approaches,
the proposed experiments will test the central hypothesis that VRE colonization and domination
in humans requires disruption of both microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. This
proposal builds upon preliminary observations that human microbiome communities differ in
their ability block VRE colonization, and that VRE strains vary in their ability to overcome the
bacterial community barrier. The first aim will focus on identifying intestinal community microbes
that modulate VRE colonization. This will be evaluated using a priori bioinformatic predictions
and validated in community culture experiments. These experiments will pinpoint the
contributions of specific microbial community members by comparing VRE colonization in
diverse communities and sub-communities. Identification of microbiome interactions that
regulate MDRO colonization will enable exploration and discovery of new mechanisms to stop
spread of antibiotic resistance. The second aim will focus on identifying which bacterial genes
facilitate VRE colonization, persistence, and dominance. Genetic contribution to community
colonization will be tested in community cultures, utilizing both genetic knockouts of predicted
carriage genes and a broader survey with transposon-insertion libraries. This will yield
fundamental insight into how VRE persists in the absence of direct antibiotic selection. Overall,
this work will: i) identify microbiome disruptions that facilitate MDRO colonization for potential
amelioration, ii) inform infection prevention efforts by identifying strains likely to spread drug
resistance and uncover new microbiome interactions as novel anti-infective drug targets."
10793571,"Abstract
Establishing the influence of pollutants on genome function is essential in defining their impact on human
health. Environmental pollutants such as inorganic arsenic (iAs) are responsible for over thirteen million deaths
yearly. Importantly, 24% of the diseases caused by environmental exposures might have been avoided by
disease prevention, diagnosis and the development of safer metal-based therapeutic agents. In order to
understand how these pollutants cause disease, we need to understand how pollutants change gene
expression. Proper gene regulation is essential for normal growth, development and etiology of diseases such
as cancer. Eukaryotic DNA stored as chromatin plays an integral role in gene regulation. At the one-
dimensional (1D) level, chromatin is found as nucleosomes and at the three dimensional level (3D), chromatin
is found in loops and topological domains, both of which regulate gene expression by allowing accessibility to
the DNA wrapped up as chromatin. Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous metal that impacts gene regulation
through modulating the epigenome. We recently provided the epigenetic landscape (DNA methylation, histone
PTMs and histone variants) mediated by iAs. This landscape though important, makes it difficult to decipher
whether the observed effects on gene activity are due to local changes in epigenetic environments, or effects
caused by remote changes several kilobases away, such as the activity of enhancer(s). Additionally, the effect
of the 3D chromatin structure supersedes that at the 1D chromatin level. This 3D information is mediated by
CTCF, known as a ‘master weaver’ of the genome, and any dysregulation of the CTCF binding alters this 3D
structure, resulting in gene dysregulation. We recently showed that iAs selectively inhibits CTCF from binding
to some of its target sites and instigating oncogenic expression patterns. Interestingly, carcinogenesis is not a
linear process but involves a several hybrid in-between stages till final cancer state. We therefore hypothesize
that by inhibiting CTCF binding, iAs reorganizes the genome to maintain specific topologically-activated
domains at the 3D chromatin structure to drive specific oncogenic potentials. To test this hypothesis, we will
map CTCF binding (Aim 1), chromatin 3D (Aim 2) and ChIP-seq of histone marks (Aim 3) as cells undergo iAs-
mediated carcinogenesis. The knowledge derived from the proposed studies will allow us to characterize the
resulting gene regulatory network mediated by iAs exposure, and allow us to unambiguously anchor iAs
exposure to changes in the CTCF interactome in the process of iAs-mediated cancer. Additionally, these
studies will allow us to decipher how iAs initiates, establishes and maintains particular chromatin signatures
that ultimately drive gene expression in iAs pathogenesis. Such studies are critically needed for the
identification of translational targets and the development of therapeutic drugs needed in iAs-disease
pathology."
10793493,"Cognitive dysfunction in the aging and elderly Veteran population confers a risk for increased mortality.
Cognitive deficits are prevalent in neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and
depression. More recently, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized as a factor contributing to
cognitive deficits via intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Moreover, chronic lung disease, particularly
COPD, is also thought to be related to cognitive decline, possibly through sleep fragmentation and hypoxic
injury to the brain. Our pilot project data on the impact of OSA-COPD Overlap Syndrome in older Veterans
provides evidence that the presence of comorbid OSA and COPD does contribute to sleep disturbances,
impairment in certain domains of cognitive function and an overall reduced quality of life (QoL). Given that PAP
therapy has been shown to improve neurocognitive function and sleepiness in moderate to severe OSA,
probably by reducing arousals and hypoxia, as well by improving sustained hypoxia due to COPD, it will likely
also have a positive impact on sleep and cognitive impairment in patients with moderate to severe degree of
Overlap Syndrome. The results from the pilot project speak to the feasibility of conducting a future longer study
of the impact of treatment with positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) vs. conservative care in older Veterans
with Overlap Syndrome. Our future project builds on the pilot data to study the following aims:
Aim1 will investigate the effect of PAP therapy vs. conservative care for 6 months on daytime sleepiness and
sleep quality in older Veterans with OVS. Aim 2 will study the effect of PAP vs. conservative care for 6 months
on neurocognitive function older Veterans with OVS. Aim 3 will determine the effect of PAP vs. conservative
care for 6 months on QoL in older Veterans with OVS. The approach will be a prospective parallel group
randomized controlled study, wherein we will administer sleep and QoL questionnaires, and a battery of
cognitive tests, before and after 6 mo of PAP therapy or conservative management to evaluate the above
outcomes. Our goal is to enhance rehabilitation from comorbid chronic conditions that frequently impact sleep
and cognitive function, with the ultimate objective of improving the overall health and quality of life of elderly
Veterans suffering from these disorders."

safe, secure and effective research program. Multiple components will be integrated in redundant and
complementary systems. In addition, this Core coordinates training programs across sectors to align expertise
and capabilities to provide a sustainable and contemporary workforce. The sectors involved include the RBL
laboratories, the RBL vivarium, Facilities, Institutional Planning & Operations, Information Technology,
Environmental Health and Safety, Occupational Health, Emergency Management. Core 2 has two aims. Aim 1)
To develop the RBL BSL3 and ABSL3 Practices and Biosecurity Training and Education Center which will
integrate basic and advanced practices and training. Core 2 will develop a suite of integrated Units: Biosafety
Practices Unit, BSL3 Scientific Practices Unit, ABSL3 Animal Practices Unit, Occupational Health Unit,
Biosecurity Unit, Emergency Management and Exercise Unit. These structures provide coordinated and
standardized training systems across sectors, to unify and integrate routine and emergency/crisis response
research functions. Aim 2. Enhance and integrate necessary oversight programs. Safe and secure science
requires a web of oversight functions carried out by the following committees: A/BSL3 Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) Committee, the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), The Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC), Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) and Institutional Review Entity (IRE), and the
Institutional Review Board (IRB). Necessary and/or required approvals of research programs and protocols
subject to these oversight systems can often be delayed by successive approval requirements and time lags.
We will develop a system of oversight mechanisms that allow more agile response times and simultaneous
review procedures. We will describe how all the three Cores are served by these interrelated oversight
mechanisms to support a well-funded, compliant, highly productive research program capable of further growth
and rapid response."
10910199,"ABSTRACT Animal Models and Related Services (AMRS) Core
The overall goal of Animal Models and Related Services (AMRS) Core 3 is to establish a biocontainment
research support service core devoted to developing animal models of BSL3 pathogens and associated support
services. Core 3 is highly relevant to the basic and translational foci of the research programs at Rutgers. No
animal model perfectly reproduces the response to infection seen in humans. In Core 3, we are therefore
developing different animal models that can be used to address specific aspects related to respiratory pathogen-
induced disease. The newly developed animal models, and their subsequent use by RBL investigators with
AMRS Core support, along with the purchase of additional specialized equipment will support and enhance the
research enterprise of Rutgers investigators exploring various aspects of pathogen infection and transmission,
and host disease pathogenesis. As SARS-CoV-2 transitions from a pandemic virus to an endemic one, new
variants continue to appear with higher transmission rates which appear to correlate with lower pathogenicity.
AIM 1 will develop animal models for investigating transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. There have been five IAV
pandemics since the 1900s, and there is ongoing concern that the current outbreak of high pathogenic H5N1
avian Influenza virus, which has affected more than 50 million birds so far, could jump to humans and cause a
new pandemic. Animal models will be devloped to study IAV transmission in AIM 2. A subset of individuals has
prolonged complications after COVID-19, which is known as post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC). In Aim
3, we will develop the hamster model to study PASC. The ferret respiratory tract has several similarities to
humans and ferrets are highly permissive to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and several human respiratory viruses.
Therefore, we propose in Aim 4 to develop a ferret transmission model and test its suitability for investigating
transmissibility of clinical strains of Mtb and in identifying the genes that Mtb requires to survive the successive
stresses associated with transmission. More than half of the people with microbiologically cured tuberculosis
(TB) exhibit some form of pulmonary impairment after TB (PIAT) affecting long-term respiratory health. In Aim 5,
we will develop a pre-clinical mouse model of pulmonary impairment after TB (PIAT) for evaluating adjunct host
directed therapeutics. Establishment of animal models to test efficacy of newly discovered compounds with anti-
TB activity in vitro would significantly advance the TB drug program. In Aim 6, we will stablish a pre-clinical
murine model for efficacy testing of new TB drug candidates. As each of these six aims are completed, the AMRS
Core’s technical staff will then aid RBL investigators in the performance of these animal models in their own grant
supported research. The personnel, instrumentation and experience acquired achieving these aims will also be
harnessed to develop and support additional animal models as required to address new biothreats, pandemics
or emerging infectious diseases."
10912065,"The Biocontainment Operations core (Core 1) contributes to the operation and support of the
high-containment research needs of the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) at the Tulane
National Primate Research Center (TNPRC). This core provides comprehensive services,
available to core and affiliate scientists, to coordinate all aspects of high-containment research
involving Risk Group 3 pathogens, select agents, and toxins and ensure compliance and efficient
use of high-containment spaces. By coordinating facilities and research-related needs that must
be integrated according to complex procedures and regulatory requirements in this high-
containment research environment, Biocontainment Operations comprehensively supports
investigators performing complex, high risk, and highly regulated research within the high-
containment spaces in the RBL, including two Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) spaces, the Animal
Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) complex, and supporting areas. Additionally, the core is host to the
TNPRC Quality Assurance Program, which provides services essential for attainment of rigorous
and reproducible scientific data across all research activities at the TNPRC through
implementation of quality standards guided by Good Laboratory Practices. The Specific Aims for
this proposal include: (1) Develop an efficient and standardized approach to preventative
maintenance and quality control of critical pieces of biocontainment equipment within the TNPRC
RBL structure to include building systems, decontamination equipment, and primary containment
equipment. (2) Develop practices for laboratory level equipment for biocontainment research
procedures to ensure high levels of quality assurance and quality control to provide guarantee of
rigor and reproducibility for data generated through studies. (3) Ensure adaptability to changing
needs of the response environment to expand normal operating capacities during a public health,
pandemic response, or biodefense response to meet critical biosafety measures and select agent
requirements. The proposed UC7 will enhance the management of core maintenance,
preventative maintenance, and operations and ensure continuity of support for all high-
containment research operations with the highest level of biosafety compliance expertise and
quality assurance oversight focused on ensuring rigor and reproducibility. Furthermore, these
funds will guarantee that the TNPRC RBL is ready and able to support the incredible surge of
capacity demand in the face of future public health, biodefense, and pandemic response needs."
10932239,"Project Summary
American Indians (AIs) experience disproportionately high rates of alcohol-related problems (ARPs) including
hazardous alcohol use (e.g., HAU; heavy intensive or binge drinking) and alcohol-related consequences (ARC;
health, safety, legal, and social problems including injury and death) as compared to any other racial/ethnic
groups in the U.S.ARPs also hinder holistic well-being (HWB; mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health)
among AI peoples. ARPs among AI peoples is often intergenerational; rooted in social and structural
conditions; and related to loss/lack of cultural identity, social isolation, and deficits in healthy coping and life
skills. Despite an increasing understanding of etiological factors related to ARPs for AI peoples and a growing
number of culturally tailored (often surface level), mostly individually-focused programs to prevent and treat
ARPs among AIs, there is limited research evaluating AI-developed, culturally centered programs for AI people
that focus on foundational factors (e.g., trauma, loss, isolation) underlying ARPs. A highly promising approach
to reduce ARPs among AIs and promote holistic well-being is a culturally centered mentoring program that has
been developed and is currently being implemented by a Lakota-led nonprofit, Oaye Luta Okolakiciye (OLO).
The OLO mentoring program seeks to foster Lakota cultural identity, social connectedness, and healthy coping
and like skills through peer support, cultural immersion, traditional healing and skills training. Despite its strong
potential for reducing ARPs and promoting HWB among AI people, the culturally centered OLO mentoring
program has not been formally evaluated. The proposed project seeks to address this gap in preparation for a
fully powered R01. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of Lakota stakeholders (e.g., Traditional
Knowledge Keepers, Elders, and Lakota health professionals) and highly accomplished action-oriented
researchers to lead this work. Aim 1 (Process Evaluation) includes documenting the OLO mentoring program
processes, strengths, challenges, acceptability and feasibility via a review of all OLO documentation (e.g.,
operating manuals) (Aim 1a), interviews with OLO mentoring program stakeholders (Aim 1b), and mentor-
mentee program engagement via weekly tracking logs (Aim 1c). Aim 2 (Outcome Evaluation) tests the
hypothesis that the OLO mentoring program will positively impact intermediary outcomes (i.e., Lakota cultural
identity, social connectedness, healthy life and coping skills) (Aim 2a). Given the lack of feasibility to recruit a
large enough sample, information about primary outcomes (i.e., reductions in HAU/ARC, alcohol abstinence,
and holistic well-being) will be collected primarily for descriptive purposes to inform a more rigorous R01
design (Aim 2b). Using matched mentor-mentee responses, we will examine how perceptions of the mentoring
process impact intermediary outcomes (Aim 2c). Finally, we will examine how mentee program engagement
impacts outcomes (Aim 2d). To complete these aims, mentees (n=50) will complete baseline, immediate-post-
test, and six-month post program surveys. Mentors (n=10) will also complete an immediate post-test."

ABSTRACT:
The Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) within the Center for Vaccine Research (CVR) at the University
of Pittsburgh is the biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) hub for infection biology. The mission of the RBL is threefold, to
work on pathogen emergence, evolution and host-to-host transmission, to study the pathogenesis of
emerging infectious diseases and to accelerate pre-clinical development of novel interventions and medical
countermeasures for pandemic preparedness and biodefense. Our vision is to be a globally recognized, highly-
collaborative, creative and forward-facing team of infection biologists who are poised to respond to emerging
biological threats both at the national and international level. The entire facility is registered with the Division of
Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT). It brings together infection biologists and clinicians from a variety of disciplines
who require BSL-3 and animal (A)BSL-3 facilities for their wide ranging viral and bacterial research programs.
We propose to establish Operations, Practices and Integrated Services Cores and formally operationalize our
existing structures. These have evolved from the time the RBL was established, and although they have served
their purpose, require modernization to ensure they will remain current and operationally fit-for-purpose. The
Operations Core will have overall management and budgetary responsibility for the RBL. It will administer the
daily, weekly, monthly and yearly BSL-3 activities essential for the support and services arms of the RBL to
function. This will ensure that the BSL-3 laboratories are run and maintained at the highest standards and they
are safe and secure. The Practices Core will support all the basic functions of the RBL enabling scientific
programs to be rigorously managed and ensuring overall data integrity for reproducible outcomes. It will provide
the requisite theoretical and practical trainings to onboard new RBL Investigators and their teams who wish to
work in BSL-3 and ABSL-3 biocontainment. It will provide biosafety and biosecurity support and guarantee the
facility meets all current compliance regulations for Tier 1 select agent registered laboratories. The Integrated
Services Core will deliver a wide range of high quality BSL-3 and ABSL-3 services for internal users and external
collaborators. These will be rigorously overseen by Academic and Service Leads and reviewed annually with the
assistance of an external RBL Director, other BSL-3 experts and an internal Scientific Advisory Group.
Operational support for the RBL in Pittsburgh will ensure we are ready to support any national response to a
range of emerging infectious diseases in the event of another pandemic or bioterrorism attack. Supporting this
cohort of BSL-3 scientists, who can pivot to work on new pathogens in an emergency, is certain to pay dividends."

The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL)
resides within the campus in downtown Memphis in the heart of the medical district. The medical district includes
St. Jude Children’s Hospital, Regional One Health Hospital, Memphis VA Medical Center, and Le Bonheur
Children’s Hospital. The overarching mission of the UTHSC RBL is to provide leadership and support in the
discovery and development of new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics that would protect the general population
from emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism. The RBL supports and fosters basic
research and translational research that leads to the development of countermeasures for biodefense and
emerging infectious agents. In addition to the regional entities above, we support research for academic,
government and commercial entities, nationally and internationally. The long-range objectives and goals of the
UC7 proposal focus on the creation of three Cores to support RBL management and operations, and enhance
and facilitate medical countermeasure research for biodefense, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic
preparedness and response at the RBL. The overall objectives and strategic plan for the operation and use of
the RBL and the Facilities Core (Objective 1), BSL-3 Practices Core (Objective 2) and the Biocontainment
Research Support Service Core (Objective 3). Objective 1. To provide a Facility Management, Maintenance
and Operation Core that will integrate preventive maintenance of mechanical and vivarium infrastructure and
scientific / biosafety equipment necessary for BSL-3 and ABSL-3 containment. Objective 2. To provide a BSL-
3 Practices Core that will integrate the management of operations and training for BSL-3 pathogens of which
some are select agents, promotes communication and harmonize compliance, security, individual competency,
and practices across our RBL Staff and our Users. Objective 3. To facilitate and advance research within
the Biocontainment Research Support Service(s) Core under the umbrella of the “Antiviral &
Antimicrobial Countermeasures Discovery & Development Core’ (herein abbreviated as A2CD2C). The
A2CD2C is unique within the RBL network in its focus on providing LCMS/MS studies for infected, treated animal
tissues in BSL-3 and providing drug pharmacodynamics. The strategic mission for Operation and Use of the
RBL and the three Cores is to provide a seamless and integrated management and operational structure that
efficiently serves its clients and users with the appropriate facility controls, biosafety and select agent

10799084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell fate is determined by a number of factors including genetics, cellular signals
and availability of nutrients. How cells process these numerous inputs to produce
a specific output, such as cell differentiation or proliferation remains poorly
understood. Our project will address how cells process these inputs following the
principle of “supply and demand.” During early T cell development, the synthesis
of a diverse repertoire of T cell receptors defines a robust immune system that
will allow recognition of various pathogens, while tolerant to self-peptides. The
synthesis of a diverse repertoire requires abundant nucleotides and hexosamines
for proper synthesis and folding. Our studies will elucidate how the de novo
hexosamine biosynthesis pathway reprogram metabolism via regulation of
mTOR signaling and pyrimidine metabolism to generate a diverse TCR
repertoire. As we gain better understanding of how these pathways are
reprogrammed to balance nutrient supply with cellular demand, we hope to
develop better strategies for dietary manipulation that can potentially enhance
the functions of the immune system."
10799095,"Energy Metabolism in Osteoblasts and Bone Health
 Energy metabolism is an important regulator of cell fate and tissue homeostasis while its dysregulation is a
hallmark of aging in various tissues, including bone. Data on energy metabolism in osteoblasts (OB) are contra-
dictory, claiming OB reliance either on aerobic glycolysis or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos).
With regards to bioenergetic substrates, glutamine and fatty acids were recently shown to be as important for
OBs as glucose; and they are metabolized mostly in mitochondria. Our new exciting data suggest an explanation
to the above controversies and can reconcile the opposing views on OB metabolism. First, we confirmed that in
OBs, glucose metabolites do not reach the mitochondrial Krebs cycle but mostly flow into the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP) and little into pyruvate and lactate. Actively proliferating and synthetic OBs likely benefit from this
setup as PPP provides NADPH for redox reactions, nucleotides, etc. Second, we found that OB mitochondria
actively metabolize glutamine, supplying not only the Krebs cycle but also cytosolic pyruvate and lactate due to
the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity and ensuing cytosolic reactions. This suggests a regulatory role of
mitochondria in the glycolytic process and PPP in OBs. Third, we found that in aged bone, there is mitochondrial
dysfunction and increased glucose metabolism to lactate and away from the PPP, and signs of oxidative stress.
Systemic inhibition of glucose flux to lactate using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) inhibitor, oxamate, reverses
the glycolytic shift and ‘rejuvenates’ bone in aged mice. Our hypothesis is that in OBs, glucose preferential flux
into the PPP and glutamine-dependent mitochondrial activity supporting glycolysis and the PPP, is required for
bone maintenance and can be restored in aging by targeting LDH-A. This will be tested by characterizing the
role of PPP in OBs using loss-of-function (LOF) of G6PD, a key PPP enzyme (Aim 1); confirming the role of
mitochondria in supporting glycolysis and the PPP in OBs using inhibition of glutaminolysis or MAS (Aim 2); and
confirming LDH-A as a therapeutic target to reverse bone metabolic changes and aging using LDH-A LOF in
OBs (Aim 3). Altogether, this is expected to significantly enhance our understanding of how cell energy metab-
olism determines OB differentiation and function, explain existing controversies in the field, and suggest new
therapies for bone aging."
10904773,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic respiratory tract diseases such as asthma are common and significantly affect the quality of patient lives.
While effective and safe asthma medications are urgently needed, they pose a significant financial burden for
patients. Moreover, the current regulatory pathway, the so-called “weight-of-evidence” approach, carries a
considerable economic risk for generic drug developers. This presents an impediment for bringing cost-effective,
safe and efficacious generic orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs) to the market. Therefore, systematically
evaluating novel approaches that can reliably support the development and regulatory assessment of generic
OIDPs is essential. This project will leverage innovative modeling and simulation strategies to evaluate whether
population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and non-compartmental analysis (NCA) approaches based on
plasma concentrations allow reliable conclusions on the bioequivalence of two OIDPS in the lung. Active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with a range of physicochemical properties that are used in OIDPs will be
studied through computer simulations. In Task 1, this project will develop lung physiologically-based PK (PBPK)
models that can simulate both the local drug exposure profiles at different regions of the lung and plasma drug
concentration profiles. These PBPK models will contain five or more lung compartments, reflecting the 23
physiological generations of the lung. Inhaled drug deposition in various lung regions will be implemented as a
function of the particle size distribution. Further, the lung PBPK models will account for the total lung dose,
dissolution kinetics, permeation, perfusion, as well as (for the upper airways) mucociliary clearance. These lung
PBPK models will be used to simulate realistic plasma PK datasets for Test and Reference OIDPs with
systematically varied properties, in the presence and absence of charcoal to block oral absorption. Simulated
local drug exposure profiles at various regions of the lung will serve as the therapeutically relevant, true,
pulmonary comparators. Studies in Task 2 will use the PBPK-simulated drug exposure profiles in plasma as
relevant inputs. The main goal of this task is to probe whether, and with which level of granularity, population PK
can detect differences in regional pulmonary exposure by modeling plasma concentration-time profiles of Test
and Reference OIDPs. In addition to modeling pulmonary absorption via population PK, the less complex NCA
with established and novel parameters (e.g. partial AUCs during the absorption phase) will be applied using the
same data sets. This will allow one to compare the capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and robustness of both
approaches for detecting differences in regional pulmonary exposure. In Task 3, key findings across all simulated
APIs, OIDPs, conditions, and study designs will be summarized to create robust and generalizable conclusions
to support PK approaches and potential BE criteria for lung BE testing. In Task 4, the report, simulated datasets,
PBPK, population PK and NCA models and results will be made available in an electronic database to the FDA."
10797943,"Aging-related diseases and disorders affect public health, society, and economics worldwide. Adults 65 years
and older are the fastest growing segment of the US population. Sarcopenia (the age-related loss of muscle
mass and function) is associated with a high risk of morbidity-disability, decreased quality of life, increased
burden of treatment and caregiving, and increased mortality. No medication is currently available to treat
sarcopenia. Therefore, there is a substantial unmet clinical need for effective treatments of sarcopenia.
The dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) plays a crucial role in the development of sarcopenia,
which is characterized by: (i) decreased acetylcholine (ACh) content and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs)
at the NMJ, (ii) decreased activation of AMP kinase and the consequent decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis,
(iii) increased inflammation, (iv) decreased number and activation of satellite cells, and (v) decreased capillary
density. Chromogranin A (CgA) derived peptide catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372) decreases inflammation,
increases AMPK phosphorylation, increases capillary density, increases muscle ACh content, and increases grip
strength in old WT and CST knockout (CST-KO) mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that CST and CST mimetic
pharmacophore TKO-10-18 will ameliorate sarcopenia by reversing sarcopenic phenotypes.
 We have developed 3 Specific Aims to test and validate our hypotheses: Aim I: Evaluation of in vivo
plasma pharmacokinetics of oral CST and TKO-10-18. This aim will determine standard non-compartmental
pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, CL, Vss, T1/2, Cmax, Tmax, Clast, and Tlast. Aim II: CST promotes healthy
rehabilitation by improving muscle strength and function in aging WT mice. In Aim II, we will determine
the following: (i) whole body grip strength after 4 months of treatment of 16-month-old mice with saline, oral CST,
and intraperitoneal CST; (ii) sciatic nerve-induced contractility in situ in gastrocnemius muscle; (iii) ex vivo
contraction of soleus and EDL muscles. Based on the existing literature and preliminary data, we expect CST
and TKO-10-18 to increase grip strength in aging WT and CST-KO mice. Aim III. Mechanisms underlying CST
regulation of functional independence or “active aging” in aging WT mice. In Aim III, we will determine the
following: (i) assessment of inflammation by measuring cytokines/chemokines, (ii) muscle regeneration by
determining expression of IL-33, Pax7, Myf5, MyoD1, Mef2, MyoG, Six1 and Six4 genes, (iii) AMPK
phosphorylation by Western blotting, (iv) mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial health by electron
microscopy, (v) determination ACh by ELISA, (vi) capillary density; and (vi) muscle glycogen content. Based on
the published and preliminary data, we expect that CST and TKO-10-18 will improve grip strength in aging mice
by increasing ACh release, activating AMPK, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, activating muscle
regeneration, and increasing angiogenesis.
 Our study will be the first to directly link CST to sarcopenia and potentially establish a CST pathway as a
therapeutic target for sarcopenia. If the outcome is positive, new therapeutic avenues could come to light, making
the risk worthwhile."

The rationale for a more detailed understanding of the safety and efficacy of new therapies for cancer is
compelling. While cancer therapies have always had an element of risk to both well-being and to quality of
life, much has changed in therapeutics in the past ten years. Most important, a greater understanding of the
biological characteristics of cancer has led to more nuanced definitions of populations that may benefit than
were previously possible. With greater use of genomics and resulting specification of precise molecular
characteristics of target cancers, and through (though early) markers of sensitivity and resistance to
immunotherapeutics, both the indications and the use of novel therapeutics is resulting in higher response
rates and more favorable outcomes, at least as judged by progress in clinical trials. Parallel advances in
medical care and the universal adoption of an electronic health record (EHR), coupled with advances in quality
of life (QOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), have made possible a deeper analysis of the
effects and the risks of new therapies as their use is diffused throughout the medical system. Following upon
several guidances to the effect of encouraging and defining the use of real-world data (RWD) to provide real-
world evidence (RWE), this funding mechanism is designed to foster approaches to capture, organize, and
analyze RWD to produce RWE. We propose herein a many-pronged approach that brings together two
strategies: 1) a reimagining of how acquisition of robust, representative, and accurate RWD could be obtained
from existing clinical trials' processes; 2) how an effective RWD approach could generate robust RWE in rare
and less common tumors alike. To assist in this goal, we have developed a collaboration with Optum Life
Sciences, both to help recruit diverse populations with specific molecular profiles, and to characterize
populations with extended databases in various domains. Our Aims are first, to harmonize Phase III and
Phase IV evaluations of new therapies to obtain real-world evidence of the standard therapy in Phase III, and
subsequently of the successful therapy in Phase IV; second, using this cooperative group model, to establish
feasibility of a real-world data Phase IV approach to the evaluation of new therapies for rare tumors. We
expect that by developing these approaches to rigorous data collection in a short timeframe, we will be
complementary to informatics approaches to data collection developed in parallel and provide for them a
robust database for comparative analyses."

Frailty is a state of depleted physiologic reserve that is common in older adults. To date there are no proven
therapies to prevent frailty beyond recommendations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Frailty is associated with
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), through shared pathophysiology mediated in part by
inflammation. Statins are the mainstay of CVD prevention and have effects beyond lipid lowering, including
reducing inflammation. Yet, many adults aged 75 and older are not taking statins due to a lack of evidence in
this age group. The ongoing PREVENTABLE trial will test the effect of atorvastatin 40mg vs placebo in 20,000
adults aged 75 and older free of CVD for the primary outcomes of survival free of dementia and disability, and
secondarily for incident CVD. However, whether statins can slow frailty has not been previously tested and is
not in the parent trial’s protocol. Thus, the proposed study is critical to establish whether statins may prevent or
slow the progression of frailty. PREVENTABLE provides a unique opportunity to test the effect of statins on
frailty using the two leading prevalent conceptual frameworks for quantifying frailty: the Rockwood cumulative
deficit frailty index (Rockwood FI) and Fried physical phenotype. As part of the parent trial, participants will
have a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) performed at baseline and assessment of weight loss. A
funded Physical Performance ancillary study will support the administration of the SPPB at annual follow-up in
2500 participants and annual questionnaires will quantify other domains of frailty, including fatigue and physical
activity. The proposed PREVENTABLE Frailty Ancillary Study will complement the main trial by cleaning and
harmonizing EHR, claims, and trial data to calculate a Rockwood FI for all trial participants (n=20,000), and in
the Physical Performance subset (n=2,000), add annual grip strength and weight loss assessments to
complete the Fried phenotype. Finally, an annual blood sample will be collected in the same 2,000 participants
to measure markers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and other measures to augment the Rockwood FI
with systematically collected routine labs, calculate a lab-FI, and examine Geroscience pathways to determine
the effect of statins on markers of inflammation and biologic aging. The frailty ancillary study will augment the
parent trial and existing ancillary study to determine whether statins: 1) lower the risk of incident frailty defined
according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried physical phenotype in a subset, and 2)
slow the progression of frailty over time according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried
phenotype in a subset. Finally, in the subset with annual blood samples, we will determine the effect of statins
on an FI augmented with labs and a lab-only FI. We will also explore the effect of statins on inflammation and
other hallmarks of aging. Leveraging the infrastructure of the PREVENTABLE trial and its Physical
Performance ancillary study, this timely and cost-effective proposal represents an exceptional opportunity to
test the possibility of statins as a treatment for frailty and biologic aging in a randomized setting."
10803225,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a fatal prostate cancer (PC) subtype with aggressive clinical
features and a poor prognosis. Although it rarely occurs de novo, treatment-induced NEPC shows a
significantly increasing incidence after widespread use of more potent antiandrogens for treatment of
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in recent years, constituting up to 25% of advanced therapy-
resistant CRPC. Currently, NEPC remains incurable with a median overall patient survival of less than a year
from time of diagnosis. These dismal facts underscore a pressing clinical need to identify new molecular
determinants of NEPC pathogenesis and progression and develop an effective targeted therapy to prolong
survival. In preliminary studies, we found that tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate-limiting enzyme
responsible for biosynthesis of peripheral serotonin known as a neurotransmitter enriched in neuroendocrine
tumors and a classical neuroendocrine biomarker, is critically required for maintaining NEPC differentiation,
development and growth. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TPH1 in NEPC cells profoundly represses
neuroendocrine markers, cell proliferation and invasion, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. Importantly, our
data showed that TPH1 is upregulated in human NEPC and CRPC carrying neuroendocrine features relative to
prostatic adenocarcinoma in multiple independent patient cohorts. Mechanistically, our transcriptomic,
bioinformatic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that TPH1 activates mTOR signaling and subsequently
E2F1 and a NEPC-promoting oncogenic transcriptional program mediated synergistically by FOXM1 and TAZ.
These new findings support our hypothesis that TPH1 plays an active role driving NEPC and represents a
therapeutic target of NEPC. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will delineate the molecular mechanism of TPH1
signaling in NEPC, specifically dissecting how TPH1 activates the mTOR-FOXM1/TAZ/E2F1 signaling axis and
how this axis confers NEPC growth advantages and neuroendocrine traits in the context of TPH1. We will also
establish the clinical relevance of our mechanistic findings and assess their prognostic value in a large
collection of human advanced PC samples. Aim 2 will define the functional and biological impact of TPH1 on
NEPC differentiation, growth and progression using a series of in vitro and in vivo phenotypic and
pharmacological assays coupled with complementary human and mouse NEPC cells and organoids, cell line-
and patient-derived xenograft mouse models, and TRAMP transgenic mice. Successful completion of this
project will greatly deepen our mechanistic understanding of NEPC development and progression and provide
a compelling rationale for repurposing clinically available TPH1 inhibitors for NEPC therapy with quick
translational potential to benefit late-stage PC patients in the near future."

Precise control of gene expression in response to external signals and cues is essential for organismal
development, growth, and homeostasis. A critical step in metazoan gene regulation involves pausing
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in early elongation and its controlled release into productive RNA synthesis.
Pausing of RNAPII consists of the association of pause-inducing factor NELF and the central scaffolding
protein SPT5, which maintain RNAPII stably within the promoter region while awaiting the signal for pause
release. Pause release is triggered by the kinase P-TEFb, which phosphorylates RNAPII and SPT5 to
cause the dissociation of NELF and promote productive elongation. However, our recent work
demonstrated that paused RNAPII can experience a different fate: it can be targeted by the Integrator
complex (INT), a multi-subunit transcription termination machine. INT association with paused RNAPII
drives promoter-proximal termination, with RNAPII releasing a short, non-productive RNA. In this way,
INT potently attenuates messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Importantly, INT antagonizes RNAPII
pause release using two distinct activities: endonuclease-mediated cleavage of the nascent RNA and
phosphatase-dependent removal of stimulatory phosphorylation. Indeed, our recent work revealed that
INT recruits the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), directing its activity toward the elongation complex.
 Studies in multiple model systems have demonstrated that mutation or depletion of INT subunits
activates stress-responsive genes, indicating a conserved role for INT in suppressing these pathways in
normal, healthy cells. Accordingly, mutations in INT have been associated with a large number of
diseases, with every one of the subunits in the INT complex being implicated in one or more
pathophysiological state(s). Improving our understanding of INT activity will thus provide invaluable
insights into mechanisms of diseases associated with INT mutations, such as blood, hepatic and gastric
cancers, and developmental disorders, including ciliopathies and aberrant neuronal migration.
 The proposed research will address central questions that remain about INT function and
regulation. Specifically, Aim 1 will dissect the roles of the INT endonuclease and phosphatase modules
in gene regulation, assessing coordination between these modules and the requirement for each catalytic
activity across the repertoire of target genes. Given the established role of INT in attenuating stress-
responsive genes during normal cell growth, Aim 2 will determine how stress signaling can activate these
genes. In particular, we will investigate several potential models for INT inactivation by cellular stressors.
Our work shows the ‘Z3’ complex is an uncharacterized INT module, and, given its previous connections
to DNA/chromatin binding and transcriptional repression, Aim 3 will probe the role of Z3 in INT function."
10803677,"When preclinical research fails to replicate human biology, scientific progress stalls, clinical trials falter, and
patients continue to suffer. While many factors contribute to these failures, lack of attention to pre-analytic
variability is a seminal issue. We recently reported that even short-term exposure to ambient air is sufficient to
trigger signaling changes in tumor and non-malignant biospecimens. Those changes in turn alter their biology
and responsiveness to targeted therapies. Oxygen (O2) tension in various organs ranges from 3-9%, whereas
O2 in ambient air is 21%. Using transgenic models of breast cancer and ascitic fluid from patients with ovarian
cancer, we demonstrated differential expression of various signaling molecules including YAP1, NRF2/KEAP1
and WNT/b-CATENIN when biospecimens are collected and processed under physioxia (3-5% O2) compared to
the same biospecimen collected and processed under ambient air. We also observed that basal and drug-
induced signaling networks that determine cellular response to targeted therapies are impacted by exposure to
ambient air. Key signaling molecules affected include pEGFR(Y1068), pPDGFRb(Y751), pAKT(S473),
pERK(T202/Y204), DNMT3A, TET2, and BRD4. Based on these results, we hypothesize that exposure of
biospecimens to ambient air during collection and processing incorrectly estimates the levels of many signaling
molecules that are used as biomarkers to define tumor characteristics and to determine the potential benefit of
targeted therapies. The effects of ambient air exposure during collection and processing extends to
biospecimens from normal tissues, impacting characterization of the cell-of-origin of their associated cancers.
Experiments designed in three aims will test these hypotheses. In the first aim, we will collect breast tumor
biopsies, malignant ascites, and pleural effusions under 1, 3 and 5% O2 reflecting variable O2 tension in tumors,
then perform comparative analysis with and without subsequent exposure to ambient air for signaling molecules
listed above. Since our preliminary studies have shown the effects of ambient air exposure on the levels of
DNMT3A and TET2, two major determinants of DNA methylation, aim 2 will investigate the effects of ambient
air exposure on the DNA methylome and transcriptome. In the third aim, using the unique institutional resource
of Komen Tissue Bank, the world’s only repository of normal breast tissue donated by healthy women to support
research, we will characterize the effects of ambient air exposure on the levels of biomarkers from Aim 1 and
transcriptome. Successful completion of these studies will change how samples are collected and processed,
ensuring that O2 exposure mimics the O2 concentration of the organ to limit the introduction of ambient air O2-
induced changes. In addition, this work will force the development of new collection devices that limit the
exposure of biospecimens to ambient air. With respect to this specific FOA, this proposal addresses three major
topics: improving clinical biomarker assays for treatment decisions, addressing limited translation of pre-clinical
findings into clinic, and evidence-based standardization of biospecimen handling procedures."
10803503,"Frailty, or having a decreased physiologic capacity to recover from a health-related stressor is common in
and fatal to older Veterans. Frailty is even more prevalent among older adults with chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Among older Veterans with CKD, physical activity frequency is the component of the frailty
phenotype that significantly predicts mortality or dialysis initiation. However, existing interventions are only
aimed to improve exercise capacity, do not apply behavior change theory to identify psychosocial
mechanisms that explain infrequent physical activity, and do not improve muscle weakness despite its
prevalence in CKD and associations with physical activity frequency in older adults. It also remains unknown
how to identify those who would experience the greatest response such that interventions can be targeted.
The ‘Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior’ (COM-B) theory of behavior change posits that a behavior
occurs when an individual is ‘Capable’ of engaging in a behavior; sees the ‘Opportunity’ to engage in the
environment; and feels the ‘Motivation’ to engage. My pilot data demonstrates that sedentary older adults
reported low Patient Activation (the skill and confidence to engage in a behavior). Patient Activation and is a
psychosocial factor that correspond to the ‘Motivation’ component of the COM-B theory. Thus, an
intervention to maximally increase physical activity frequency and reduce frailty risk among older Veterans
with CKD may need to be centered on improving Activation.
The frequency of physical activity behaviors among older adults strongly depends on lower extremity muscle
strength. Adults with CKD experience loss of muscle mass and exhibit poor lower extremity strength.
Resistance training improves muscle strength by placing or force or pressure against muscle. Thus, an
intervention to maximally increase physical activity frequency and reduce frailty risk among older Veterans
with CKD may need to include resistance training.
A maximally effective intervention requires that it be targeted to those would receive the greatest benefit.
Senescence is a phenomenon of cell cycle arrest that is implicated in frailty pathogenesis. Biomarkers of
senescence were recently shown to be predictive of treatment response after a physical activity intervention;
therefore, biomarkers of senescence may be a novel way to identify older Veterans with CKD who would
experience the greatest treatment response after a physical activity intervention.
This proposal will 1) test whether Patient Activation associates with physical activity frequency among older
Veterans with CKD; 2) explore whether other factors in COM-B theory associate with physical activity
frequency; 3) develop and pilot test a novel physical activity intervention targeted to the mechanisms identified;
and 4) explore if biomarkers of senescence predict intervention treatment response. The proposal is significant
because it aims to reduce the adverse sequelae of frailty among Veterans with CKD, a group already
vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. The proposal is innovative in its identification of novel mechanisms
that impact frailty risk and its exploration of whether of biomarkers can predict intervention response.
Completion of this proposal will impact the field, as it will lay the foundation for precise clinical practice
guidelines for physical activity among older adults living with multimorbidity (guidelines which currently do
not exist)."
10802534,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Essential voice tremor (EVT) affects over 40% of individuals with essential tremor (ET), one of the most common
movement disorders. While ET is characterized primarily by upper limb tremor, EVT is a significant problem
because it profoundly disturbs communication and quality of life. Unfortunately, EVT remains poorly treated and
the few available treatments, such as propranolol and botulinum toxin injections, have limited efficacy. Deep
brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermedius nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus is the treatment of choice for
severe upper limb tremor no longer responding to medication. There is evidence that patients undergoing
successful DBS therapy for upper limb tremor, can also exhibit some suppression of voice tremor. However, the
effectiveness of DBS remains unclear because the few available supportive studies used perceptual ratings or
acoustic analysis with a limited number of subjects. EVT suppression with DBS is likely as few case studies
show that the placement of a DBS lead in specific thalamic locations could affect both hand and head regions
and consequently suppress EVT and upper limb tremor. To establish VIM DBS as a treatment for EVT, there is
a critical need to determine the optimal thalamic location for neurostimulation that will mediate upper limb and
voice tremor suppression. This requires precise quantification of voice tremor changes in a large and well-
established cohort. Here, our multidisciplinary group, proposes to address the current knowledge gaps and
determine how VIM DBS leads to effective EVT suppression. We propose to leverage our ability to recruit 140
ET patients undergoing thalamic DBS for upper limb tremor suppression. We expect that 56 of these patients
will exhibit EVT and will be matched to ET patients that do not exhibit EVT (ETNVT).We will test the central
hypothesis that neurostimulation applied onto specific thalamic neurocircuitry will suppress EVT and limb
tremor. In Aim 1, we will use sensitive acoustic analyses to precisely quantify the effectiveness of DBS on EVT.
We will test the hypothesis (H1) that bilateral thalamic DBS will significantly suppress voice tremor in patients
with EVT, reducing voice tremor to the ETNVT level. In Aim 2, based on our strong preliminary data, we propose
to examine the association between voice tremor and axial tremor/fall risk. We will test the hypothesis (H2) that
DBS-induced voice tremor suppression will be associated with reduced axial tremor and reduced fall risk. In Aim
3, we will use cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques to determine the effect of the volume of tissue activated
(VTA) locations and related neurocircuitry on EVT suppression. This proposition is based on our preliminary data
that stimulation of the non-decussating dentato-rubral-thalamo-tract (nDRTT) associated with reduced EVT. We
will test the hypotheses that neurostimulation of the nDRTT will suppress EVT (H3.a) and EVT suppression will
be greater when the VTAs are located in medial thalamic areas that affect both the hand and head (H3b). The
outcomes will be clinically impactful and improve current treatment of ET as they will identify thalamic targets
that optimize EVT suppression and determine if this EVT suppression is a marker for reduced fall risk in ET."
10802542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The trp operon in several bacterial species is regulated at multiple levels that include transcription, translation,
post-translation, and enzyme activity. The recent discovery of a distinct attenuation mechanism of C. trachomatis
trp operon, which we termed “trans”-attenuation because it involved a trans-acting factor, the tryptophan-
biosensing YtgR repressor, points to the significance of maintaining stringent regulation of expression of the
tryptophan salvage genes. Regulation of trp operon by the TrpR repressor and attenuator is thought to be a
check on the relatively high metabolic cost of tryptophan biosynthesis, with transcription only induced when
tryptophan levels are low. The biosynthesis of tryptophan is an energetically costly process due to its requirement
for D-erythrose-4-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and ATP for chorismate biosynthesis, as well as glutamine,
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and serine for the conversion of chorismate to tryptophan. It is not clear if this
applies to C. trachomatis, which only requires one step – serine and indole condensation reaction to form
tryptophan. Instead, we propose an alternative model, whereby dysregulated transcription of the tryptophan
synthase genes trpB and trpA leads to serine overutilization, diverting this amino acid away from other serine-
requiring metabolic pathways, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) biosynthesis. The additional YtgR-mediated
regulation of trpBA expression ensures equitable distribution of serine between tryptophan and PS production.
 The iron-dependent regulation by YtgR is also proposed to be essential for optimal expression of trpBA in
tissue environment that support indole-producing microbiome, such as the stratified squamous epithelium of the
female lower genital tract. During epithelial cell differentiation, the gene for transferrin receptor, TFRC is
progressively downregulated. We previously reported that the slow transferrin receptor recycling pathway is how
C. trachomatis acquires iron. Therefore, TFRC downregulation would subject the pathogen to gradual iron
starvation. Noteworthy is the location of the microbiome to the uppermost differentiated layers of the squamous
epithelium; and YtgR through its iron-responsiveness could be how Chlamydia senses its proximity to indole-
producing microbiota. We propose that this underpins YtgR/IGR importance to C. trachomatis.
 The trans-attenuation function of YtgR on the trp operon relies on a triple tryptophan motif (WWW) that
renders translation of the precursor protein YtgCR sensitive to tryptophan-limiting growth conditions. We
obtained evidence that there are several genes that are transcriptionally induced when tryptophan is at low
levels, but are not regulated by the tryptophan-responsive TrpR repressor. Therefore, there must be another
transcriptional regulator responsible. We propose that YtgR fulfills this role, which would mean a more global
role for this repressor in regulating transcriptional adaptation strategies in times of tryptophan limitation."
10803595,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to establish a human model for low back pain (LBP) caused by intervertebral disc (IVD)
degeneration, and to answer the question, what causes a degenerative disc to become painful? LBP is a leading cause of
disability and morbidity in the adult population, affecting approximately 80% of adults. Up to 40% of all LBP is attributed
to IVD degeneration, which is categorized as discogenic pain. Radiographically aged IVDs do not always correlate with
pathologically painful discs. Current treatments focus on pain management and the restoration of disc height, but the
underlining cause for discogenic pain remains untreated. In our previously published and preliminary studies we have
established an in vitro system to simulate IVD degeneration, a nociception sensing with sensory neuron differentiated from
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), an in vivo bioassay using a rat model and performed single cell transcriptomics of
pain inducing and asymptomatic IVD tissues and developed a hypothesis for the pain induction mechanism. In this proposal
we will combine these systems in Nociception-Chip to unveil the molecular and cellular mechanism of discogenic pain
induction in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1 we will identify the cellular sub-population(s) that transform asymptomatic IVDs
to discogenic pain inducing ones, test the hypothesis that this process is mediated by pro-inflammatory agents and
investigate its reversibility. The single cell data will be utilized to identify specific surface cell markers of the sub-
populations with which we will sort the cells out. We will simulate disc degeneration model in vitro and to test the
functionality of these cells, identify the critical factors that lead to development of discogenic pain and test the response of
nociceptors differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells as a readout of pain sensing. The functionality of these cells
to induce LBP behaviour will be validated in a rat model. We will test the hypothesis that this process is mediated by specific
inflammatory factors or the lack of anti-inflammatory factors like MIR-155 by co-injecting them to a healthy or mildly
degenerated IVDs. In Aim 2 we will identify cellular sub-population(s) enriched in degenerated asymptomatic IVDs and
test the hypothesis that these cells prevent the transformation of asymptomatic to painful IVDs. We will leverage the same
database of single cell transcriptomics used in Aim 1 and will look at the non-painful disc prevalent celsl as potentially
therapiutics cells. These cells will be isolated, characterized and co-injected with pain inducing cells or to a degenerated
IVDs in a rat model that allows measurement for stractural and behavioral LBP outcomes. Overall, both aims are not
interdependant and will contain hypothesis-driven, hypthesis generating and therapituc components.
This study is significant because it will fill substantial gaps in our understanding of discogenic pain developement: establish
a controlled system in vitro to identify the main cause(s) behind discogenic pain; identify molecular signatures and point
towards potential therapeutic targets or cellular population characteristics. This study is novel, because it will elucidate the
role of IVD cells, the factors that induce discogenic pain and impactful because we will identify novel therapeutic targets
that will allow interventions beside the use of analgesics and opioids that are currently prescribed for discogenic pain."

Neural circuits of the primary visual cortex (V1) are critical for generating perceptions of our external world. In
V1, most neurons exhibit potent modulation by stimuli that are outside their receptive fields, a process termed
`surround modulation'. Importantly, the magnitude and sign of surround modulation depend on the orientation
of the center and surround – leading to the notion that flexible surround modulation contributes to scene
segmentation, salience detection, contour integration, and figure/ground segregation. The specific neural
circuits in the visual cortex that explain the orientation dependence of surround modulation are largely
unknown. By combining two photon calcium imaging, two photon holographic optogenetics, in vivo patch clamp
electrophysiology, and the first use of a two photon holographic mesoscope, we aim to reveal the precise
synaptic and circuit architecture in the mouse visual cortex that mediates the earliest stages of image
segmentation. First, we will measure the visually evoked synaptic conductances in cortical interneurons that
explain their highly differentiated tuning properties to contextual visual stimuli. Next, we will precisely map the
local and long-rate connectivity onto specific subtypes of cortical interneurons in vivo using two photon photo-
stimulation. Finally, we will probe how two photon holographic co-activation of surround co-tuned ensembles in
V1 or higher visual areas give rise to figure/ground modulation in V1 principal neurons. Together, our aims will
establish a highly detailed mechanistic understanding for a visual computation responsible for object
recognition."

 Although cancer immunotherapy has been proclaimed a breakthrough in many types of cancer, pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) responds poorly to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. PDAC is
classified as immunologically “cold” tumor with pronounced presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells.
Therefore, developing novel approaches to reprogram the PDAC tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) and
promoting immunotherapeutic efficacy are drastically needed.
 A key knowledge gap in understanding the PDAC TiME is a lack of tools to visualize and monitor these
immunosuppressive myeloid cells during tumor progression and treatment. Molecular imaging approaches
provide such an opportunity through a specific cell-tracking strategy or targeting of surface molecules expressed
on immune cells. In the preliminary studies, we demonstrated that yeast-derived whole b-glucan particles (WGP)
predominately traffic to the pancreas and incite massive infiltration of myeloid cells with trained immunity
phenotype, leading to a reduction in PDAC tumor progression and prolonged survival. Trained immunity is
defined as innate immune responses that can adapt and develop a memory-like phenotype of previous infection
or vaccination. Despite these successes, mice treated with WGP eventually died even in combination with anti-
PD-L1 therapy. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an integrated in vivo imaging with
immunophenotyping approach to understand PDAC immune evasion mechanisms and develop more efficacious
therapy for PDAC. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine if induction of trained immunity reprograms
pancreas myeloid cells thus reshaping their function in the PDAC TiME. We will utilize a radiolabeled WGP and
an anti-CD11b probe to track WGP trafficking and influx of myeloid cells in the pancreas. We will also test the
hypothesis that the abundance of pancreas tissue resident macrophages (TRMs), as measured by the lymphatic
vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1) probe, is a predictive marker for PDAC immune evasion and
progression. Aim 2 will determine whether combining trained immunity with anti-CD47 and/or anti-EGFR mAb
therapy promotes myeloid cell phagocytic/tumoricidal activity to maximize innate antitumor immunity. Targeted
in vivo imaging will be used to monitor phagocytosis and EGFR levels within the PDAC TiME. Aim 3 will
determine the ability of induction of trained immunity to recruit and stimulate adaptive T cells in the pancreas.
We will also determine whether combining induction of trained immunity with anti-CD47 mAb therapy will further
potentiate anti-PD-L1 therapeutic efficacy in PADC. Immuno-imaging will be used to track CD8+ T cell infiltration,
function, and PD-L1 expression within the PDAC TiME. The successful completion of this proposal will likely
provide a novel insight into understanding the mechanisms of PDAC immune evasion and treatment response
and resistance."

This application describes a 5-year plan to investigate the neural dynamics that underpin distortion in memory,
integrating computational modeling approaches with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and non-invasive brain
stimulation techniques (TMS). The candidate, a cognitive neuroscientist with a background in memory
consolidation and experience in fMRI and TMS methods, seeks new training in computational modeling and
model-based fMRI analysis under the mentorship of Dr. Anna Schapiro and Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill. The
training will take place in the first 2 years of the proposal (Aim 1), after which the candidate will complete Aims
2 and 3 as an independent researcher. The proposed experiments aim to fill a critical gap in our understanding
of memory distortions by examining them as a function of multiple sources of information: memory for the
specific details of the event, supported by the hippocampus, and influence by more general prior knowledge,
supported by cortical regions. A predominant model predicts that different versions of the same memory are
stored in the hippocampus and cortex: a detailed version, and a general, gist-like version, respectively.
However, it is unclear whether these traces coordinate or compete in supporting memory and whether such
interactions are shaped by cognitive and neural constraints. The proposed experiments make use of a recently
developed spatial memory task in which the locations of animals and objects are organized by their category
membership. Critically, retrieval can be separated into two components: memory for the image's location
(magnitude of error) and the influence of category knowledge (bias towards images from the same category).
Anticipating that these two measures will be supported by the hippocampus and cortex, respectively, the
candidate will investigate how their dynamic interplay gives rise to distortions by developing a neural network
model with hippocampal and cortical aspects. Aim 1 addresses the hypothesis that there is naturally occurring
variation in whether the hippocampus and cortex cooperate or compete in supporting episodic memories, using
fMRI to test predictions made by the model. Aim 2 introduces a causal manipulation (TMS) to test whether
constraints to the memory system drive the hippocampus and cortex to compete to encode new memories.
Cortical disruption during encoding is predicted to boost hippocampal function, leading to more accurate
memory. Aim 3 will investigate whether known consolidation mechanisms (i.e. memory replay) competitively
prioritize the retention of hippocampal and cortical memory traces. A novel behavioral manipulation is
developed to shift replay to prioritize either specific or general components of a memory, and this will be used
assess its functional relevance. Completion of these aims will reveal novel insights into the hippocampal-
cortical interactions that give rise to distortions in memory. Understanding these interactions will shed light on
how their dysfunction leads to pathology and has the potential to aid clinical researchers in the development of
treatments for patients suffering from subtle impairments in memory, such as stroke patients."

Managing the complex risk-benefit profile of opioid therapeutics is a significant challenge for pain patients and
the physicians that treat them. Prescription opioid analgesics provide excellent pain relief but also put patients
in danger of severe adverse effects such as depression, dependence, abuse, and addiction. The opioid crisis
in the United States reflects these risks as over 2.4 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder, and over
50,000 patients die yearly. Clinical guidelines address the problem of prescription opioid abuse and addiction
by urging physicians to minimize opioid doses. However, years of decreasing doses and a narrow therapeutic
window limit the ability to decrease doses further without losing pain relief effectiveness. Despite decades of
research, we still do not have a total opioid replacement. In the absence of an opioid replacement, there is a
critical unmet need for new technologies that minimize the risks associated with prescription opioids. Amalgent
Therapeutics, Inc. is addressing this need by developing a novel and proprietary opioid adjuvant. Adjuvants
provide an alternative strategy to addressing the problem of opioid use disorder. Our preliminary data show
that this adjuvant increases opioid pain-relieving efficacy by at least four-fold, allowing a substantial decrease
in effective opioid doses. In addition, our data show that the adjuvant mitigates the abuse potential of opioids,
prevents the development of opioid tolerance, and restores effectiveness in neuropathic pain. Amalgent plans
to bring this adjuvant technology to market in AMGT-0220, a fixed-dose combination therapeutic that combines
the adjuvant with a currently marketed opioid. Importantly, the adjuvant is currently approved and marketed for
use in non-pain indications. The combination of two approved drugs is regulated by the FDA under the 505(b)2
new drug approval pathway. This regulatory pathway allows decades of previously acquired safety and clinical
data to support IND submissions for AMGT-0220. The ability to leverage existing data substantially derisks the
AMGT-0220 development program and provides an accelerated path to the clinic. In this Phase 1 SBIR
proposal, we propose work to provide further mechanistic and dosing information for the adjuvant. In Aim 1, we
investigate the mechanism by which the adjuvant increases opioid pain-relieving efficacy and calculate the
minimal concentration needed to decrease opioid doses. In Aim 2, we directly the ability of the adjuvant to
decrease the dose of opioid needed for analgesia in an animal model of post-surgical pain. The work proposed
here will support a Phase 2 application for the nonclinical and clinical development of AMGT-0220."
10789468,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The generation of a robust disease-specific immune response is a critical challenge in
cancer immunotherapies, many of which provide clinical benefit in only a fraction of patients despite remarkable
successes, and in infectious disease vaccines. Harnessing the innate immune system, which has evolved to
sense and respond to complex combinations of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, is highly promising for
augmenting cancer immunotherapies and infectious disease vaccines. While many synthetic innate immune
agonists that activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been developed as vaccine adjuvants, only a
handful of adjuvants have been clinically approved. Generation of a durable immune response faces key barriers:
(1) many current PRR agonist-based adjuvants rely on a single agonist, poorly recapitulating natural pathogen
recognition by the innate immune system; (2) while mounting evidence shows that combining PRR agonists can
promote synergistic activation, control and understanding of the combinatorial effects and spatial modulation of
multiple agonists remain inadequate; and (3) further exacerbating these gaps is a scarcity of platforms for
precisely tuning combinations and spatial arrangements of innate immune agonists. To address these knowledge
and technological gaps, the proposed work will engineer a molecularly defined, modular “all-in-one”
platform that utilizes RNA as both a multifunctional agonist and scaffold to sculpt the immune response
via (1) precise spatial patterning and multivalency of PRR agonists; (2) combinatorial control of innate immune
signaling pathways; and (3) targeted self-delivery. The first aim will leverage the programmable structural
features and sequence of a modular RNA scaffold to combine and pattern PRR agonists for synergistic innate
immune activation. In an orthogonal aim, the team will exploit the natural immune cell-targeting abilities of fungal
wall polysaccharides to create a bioinspired, “all-in-one” synthetic glyco-RNA that can target and activate
antigen-presenting cells. The translational potential of the developed RNA platform will then be explored in a
proof-of-concept evaluation of in vivo therapeutic efficacy in the third aim, using a syngeneic mouse model of
melanoma. If successful, the proposed work will introduce a new paradigm for the rational design of combinatorial
innate immune agonists and a new class of synthetic glyco-RNA therapeutic molecules for targeted immune
activation. The highly modular platform will enable (1) fundamental studies of how combinations of innate
immune agonists and their spatial arrangements function at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels; and
(2) precise modulation of disease-specific immune responses for applications in cancer and infectious diseases."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was associated with over 4.95 million deaths globally in 2019 and is projected
to cause over 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Healthcare systems are the critical settings where novel
AMR organisms (AMROs) may emerge and spread to the broader community. Strategies for cost-effective
AMRO containment in healthcare settings should target locations and individuals that contribute most to AMRO
transmission; however, effective inference methods to accurately identify these targets are currently lacking.
The objective of this project is to develop novel inference systems to quantify heterogeneous transmission
rates in hospital wards and identify individuals carrying AMROs for six high-priority organisms in four major
hospitals in New York City. We will use electronic health records, hospitalization information, laboratory test
results, and genetic sequence data to pursue two specific aims: 1) infer location-specific transmission rates for
multiple AMROs in hospital wards; 2) estimate individual-level AMRO carriage probabilities using multi-type
observations. The project will leverage an innovative combination of advanced modeling techniques, new
inference methodology, and unique datasets on multiple co-circulating AMROs. The specific aims build on our
prior research on modeling and inference of AMROs and abundant preliminary analyses. The proposed
research is significant because it addresses a pressing need in global public health – the emergence and
spread of AMR pathogens in healthcare settings. The expected outcome of this project will produce novel
inference methods for identifying hospital wards and individuals driving the spread of multiple AMROs in
healthcare systems. As the data sources used in the studies are widely available in electronic health records,
the inference system can be generalized for use in other hospital systems."

The microcirculation plays a critical role in organ homeostasis and in disease pathogenesis. Much effort has
been dedicated to developing methods to image the microcirculation, however developing quantitative methods
to assess organ-specific microcirculation remains an ongoing challenge. Identifying microvascular phenotypes
from existing imaging modalities would help overcome these limitations. Most vascular imaging studies focus on
larger vessels (> 1mm) due to limited instrument resolution. However, these studies often collect time-course
data containing dynamic information that reflects blood flow. Since the microcirculation is primarily responsible
for regulating flow, blood flow data reflects microvascular function when there is no proximal stenosis. Thus, we
can use time-course dynamic data from imaging studies to identify microvascular phenotypes without directly
imaging the micro-vessels. Our central hypothesis is that the time course of contrast material in blood vessels
and the dynamics of contrast material in tissue regions contain intravascular and tissue parameters, respectively,
which reflect the status of the microcirculation. We propose to develop robust image analysis techniques to
discover image-based microvascular phenotypes. We will initially focus on the coronary microcirculation, given
the broad public health implications of Ischemic Heart Disease. In Aim 1, we will develop, test, and validate (a)
a recently-developed Hybrid Intelligence (HI) approach to segment major vessel segments and myocardial tissue
regions in clinical coronary angiograms, and (b) methods to estimate parameters of blood flow in segmented
vessels and perfusion in segmented tissue regions. In Aim 2, we will determine the optimal imaging biomarkers
for coronary microvascular function using two leading methods currently used to quantify coronary
microvasculature. First, we will compare vessel-specific parameters and tissue-based parameters to global and
regional myocardial blood flow as measured by Rubidium-82 perfusion cardiac PET. Then, we will compare our
parameters against TIMI frame count measurements, an established yet laborious method to quantify coronary
flow on coronary angiograms. These studies will develop a novel imaging technology to establish coronary-
angiogram based microvascular phenotypes and biomarkers. These methods are also applicable to additional
angiography datasets (2D projection x time) including cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and peripheral vascular
angiograms, and could be extended to 4D datasets (3D imaging x time) as seen in perfusion computed
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies. They would therefore allow for assessment of organ-
specific microcirculation from existing imaging studies and allow for microvascular phenotyping to greatly
improve clinical care and accelerate research in this urgently needed area."

Keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), comprised of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most
common malignancy in the United States, afflicting approximately 3 million Americans annually. The treatment
of KCs is among the most costly of all cancers. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma derive
from epidermal keratinocytes, but despite sharing the same cell of origin, these two keratinocyte carcinomas
diverge along distinct oncogenic pathways. Risk factors for KCs include innate factors, such as genetic risk
loci and fair pigmentation, and environmental exposures, including sun exposure, smoking, and
immunosuppression. Recently, genetic association studies have begun to reveal specific genetic risk factors
underlying KCs. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of which of these KC genetic risk loci
affect the risk of KC in general and which affect susceptibility to basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma specifically, how these loci are influenced by environmental exposures, and how these loci impact
aggressive and high burden KCs. This study will determine whether KC genetic risk loci have effects that are
specific to basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, or are shared across these two types of KC. We
will further evaluate how environmental factors, including sun exposure, smoking, and immunosuppression
influences these risks. Finally, we will develop a risk prediction model of high burden KCs, that builds on our
recently developed risk prediction tool for squamous cell carcinoma, cSCCscore. This tool will improve our
understanding of KC pathogenesis and help guide cancer screening decisions"

Diabetes is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), with about 55-600% of patients on dialysis
having diabetes. Glucose management in the context of dialysis is challenging. In recent studies, we reported
that patients with diabetes and ESKD have increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemic crises.
However, there is lack of contemporary, nationwide data about how diabetes is managed among these
patients, and how each treatment regimen may impact the risks of acute preventable complications (e.g.,
severe hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia) and health outcomes (e.g., readmissions, mortality). Similarly, it is
unknown whether there is a relationship between specific anti-diabetic agents or insulin formulations and the
rates of diabetes crises among minority groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, which are
disproportionately affected by diabetes and ESKD. In this observational study, we propose to use the most
comprehensive database of patients with ESKD, the United States Renal Data System to (aim 1) characterize
contemporary, real-world patterns of glucose-lowering therapy and diabetes technologies in this population,
which may diverge from what is recommended in clinical guideless or explicitly studied in clinical trials. We will
also (aim 2) examine health-related outcomes, specifically all-cause and cause-specific (i.e., for hypoglycemia,
hyperglycemia) hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality, as a function of glucose-lowering regimens (e.g.,
human and analog insulin, GLP-1 receptor agonist, DPP-4 inhibitor). Our analyses will also evaluate for
differences by diabetes type and for disparities based on patient’s race/ethnicity and sex. We anticipate
identifying the most vulnerable subgroups and treatment agents associated with higher risk of acute glycemic
complications, which will have downstream impacts such as translational research trials and management
recommendations. With support from a K23 grant (5-K23DK123384-04), Dr. Galindo is currently assessing if
(aim 1) a novel, factory-calibrated, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system can provide better
assessment of glycemic excursions compared to the standard-of-care using capillary glucose testing, and (aim
2) if using real-time CGM will prevent hypoglycemic events among patients with diabetes and ESKD on dialysis
using insulin therapy, and provide better overall glycemic control. Findings from this study R03 study, coupled
with findings from my K23 prospective study, will have strong clinical and translational impact, and will be used
to design randomized trials focusing on de-escalating or tailoring patient-centered efficacious and safer anti-
diabetic regimens, using an improved glycemic monitoring systems (e.g., CGM) for this high-risk group in
subsequent R01 applications."

Resources and Workforce Development for Research on NIH/NIAID High Priority Pathogens at the University
of Missouri Regional Biocontainment Laboratory
The University of Missouri Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) was commissioned in 2009 as an $18M,
12,377 NSF BSL-3/ABSL-3 facility. During its thirteen years of operation, the RBL, since named the MU
Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research (LIDR) has been a centerpiece of the broader infectious disease
research community at the University of Missouri, receiving strong institutional commitment in the recruitment
and sustainment of world-class faculty for management of the RBL/LIDR and for conducting research on high
priority pathogens. The LIDR operates shared research resources, including state-of-the-art equipment and
professional services in microbiology, aerobiology, immunology, and animal model core facilities that serve the
needs of researchers on campus and in the broader regional and national communities. The faculty and
professional staff of the LIDR are part of the NIH/NIAID RBL-NBL network, with collaborative interactions that
facilitate sharing of best practices and knowledge, providing synergy in achieving our collective biodefense and
emerging infectious disease research agenda. During the COVID pandemic, the MU LIDR, along with its RBL
and NBL partners, led the response to the pandemic and are committed to strengthening pandemic
preparedness of the nation, by providing BSL-3/ABSL-3 training, professional staff, and research services that
allow for rapid responses in all areas, including development of animal models and the evaluation of numerous
treatments, disinfectants, and vaccine platforms to combat the pandemic. The long-term goal of the present
application is to sustain a leading effort for development of novel medical countermeasures for combating the
ever present and changing threats of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, while training an
outstanding cadre of next generation scientists and professionals in biocontainment. The goals of the proposed
cores in Facility Management, Maintenance and Operations, BSL3 Practices, and Biocontainment Research
Support Services are to educate and train the next generation of scientists and biocontainment professionals in
biodefense and emerging infectious diseases, and to facilitate and enhance the development of novel
approaches for prevention and treatment of infections caused by high consequence pathogens whose natural
or deliberate transmission pose a threat to public health and national security. Towards these goals, the proposed
Cores will work within the broader infectious disease community at MU and the NIH/NIAID RBL-NBL network for
enhancement of research productivity and discovery, and continued sharing of information and best practices in
order to meet the changing priorities and needs of NIH/NIAID for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases."

Core 1: Facilities Management, Maintenance, and Operations Core
The University of Missouri Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, the Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research
(LIDR) is a stand-alone facility, located in the east side of campus, that was designed to support research on
select agent pathogens requiring biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Because of the safety and security risks
associated with this research program, the LIDR follows strict site and building security procedures as well as a
rigorous and comprehensive building maintenance schedule and strong personnel infrastructure to maintain
continuous operations of the biocontainment facility. The Facilities Management, Maintenance, and Operations
Core (Core 1 of this UC7 application) is responsible for site and building security and proper functioning of all
building systems. Operations and management of the BSL-3 containment areas involves dozens of trades,
needing HVAC, telecom, steam, hot-water boilers, campus steam, chilled water, electrical distribution, natural
gas, emergency generator, CO2 distribution, water treatment and purification, effluent decontamination, and an
on-site chiller for back-up chilled water. Together the building systems in conjunction with tested emergency
procedures provide redundancy for all off-normal events that could impact the containment areas and adversely
affect research, laboratory workers, and/or the environment. The breadth of expertise needed to maintain
building systems is provided by the MU Campus Facilities group, who employs tradesman in every area that are
assigned to preventive maintenance and repair duties. In addition, there are presently 57 select agent-approved
individuals, along with daily and periodic visitors including building maintenance contractors, renovation
contractors, skilled tradespeople, custodial staff, facility and program inspectors, and users from the broader
infectious disease community at MU. As LIDR BSL-3 laboratories are approved for select agent research, the
site security and biosafety plans require a significant workforce dedicated to facilities management. The
objectives of the proposed Facilities Management, Maintenance, and Operations Core are to increase
efficiencies of the BSL-3/ACL-3/ABSL-3 research program at LIDR, to train an outstanding biocontainment
facilities workforce, and contribute to the RBL-NBL network by sharing of resources and best practices in the
management of high containment facilities. To achieve these goals, the proposed core will work closely with the
BSL-3 Practices Core (core 2) and the Biocontainment Services and Research Resources Core (core 3) to
provide synergy in meeting the needs of the BSL-3 and broader research communities in order to advance the
development of novel medical countermeasures against high consequence bacterial and viral priority pathogens."
10790987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 3 million adolescents are diagnosed annually with major depressive disorder (MDD). Adolescent MDD
predicts lifelong risk of chronic medical conditions, psychosocial disability, and death by suicide. Current
evidence-based practices for adolescent MDD, such as standard cognitive behavioral therapy, are time and
resource intensive while still leaving some adolescent MDD symptoms, including sleep disturbance and fatigue,
unresolved. Capitalizing on adolescents’ near ubiquitous use of technologies, including smartphones and
wearable devices, this proposal aims to develop an innovative and scalable digital tool (i.e., Sidekick) that will
deliver a just-in-time adaptive intervention for adolescent MDD treatment within outpatient primary care. This
R61/R33 will test whether Sidekick engages core target mechanisms of sleep and physical activity for improving
adolescent MDD and functioning. The R61 phase will expand an existing digital platform by developing and
optimizing Sidekick’s intervention algorithms, conducting user testing, and testing whether Sidekick engages
core treatment mechanisms (i.e., sleep duration and physical activity levels). Smartphones and smartwatches
will collect passive data and ecological momentary assessments on sleep and physical activity. Sidekick will
process these streams of data to identify periods where adolescents need just-in-time support to increase
physical activity and improve sleep. Aim 1 will focus on developing and refining the algorithm that individually
tailors intervention type and delivery timing. Aim 2 will consist of a micro-randomized trial with 30 adolescents
receiving collaborative care for MDD to test whether youth demonstrate improved sleep (e.g., more sleep for
insomnia, less sleep for hypersomnia) and increased physical activity when they receive (vs. do not receive) a
Sidekick tailored intervention. Once we satisfy our “go” criteria of engaging sleep and physical activity targets,
the R33 phase will conduct a moderately sized randomized control trial of 70 youth receiving collaborative care
for MDD. Aim 3 will examine whether youth who receive Sidekick in combination with collaborative care vs.
collaborative care alone demonstrate greater improvements in sleep, physical activity, MDD symptoms, and
psychosocial functioning. To better prepare for a larger clinical trial, Aim 4 will assess whether Sidekick is
feasible, acceptable, appropriate, usable, and engaging across all phases of the study. If successful, this project
will have a significant, lasting impact on the field of adolescent mental health by creating a digitally delivered,
just-in-time adaptive intervention that can overcome substantial barriers in accessing evidence-based
interventions and assisting adolescents in their daily contexts where support is most needed. This research will
set the stage for a series of R01s testing Sidekick in expanded settings and as an evidence-based therapy
enhancement tool for other mental health problems that may benefit from in-the-moment physical activity and
sleep support, like suicidality, inattention, and executive functioning difficulties."

Core 2: Biosafety Level 3 Practices
 The Biosafety Level 3 Practices Core (BPC) at the Laboratory of Infectious Disease Research (LIDR)
includes three major components: Biosafety and emergency planning, user training and competency oversight,
and select agent program management. The BPC is integrated within the LIDR program and is positioned to
provide LIDR researchers from across campus with BSL-3 training and resources for working with BSL-3
pathogens. The LIDR is administered under the direction of the Division of Research, Innovation and Impact.
The goals of the BPC are to facilitate and support research by offering professional user training, scientific
procedural oversight, and to advise on all matters related to the scientific program including facility compliance
and safety. To achieve this goal, the BSL-3 Practices Core interfaces with all aspects of LIDR, including building
and facility infrastructure, security, laboratory practices, decontamination, and, importantly, the BPC oversees
the compliance of the BSL-3/select agent program as well as initial and ongoing training of its users. Towards
these goals, the LIDR Biosafety Level 3 Practices Core oversees compliance for working with select agents,
including the LIDR Personnel Suitability and Reliability Program (PSRP). For individuals cleared for entry into
the LIDR, the BSL-3 Practices Core will provide a comprehensive initial and ongoing competency-based training
program, and will be responsible for certifying the readiness of all individuals for entering BSL-3/ACL-3/ABSL-3
laboratories and associated support spaces. In addition, the BSL-3 Practices Core manages emergency
response planning, as well as drills, exercises and after-action reports, investigations and corrective action plans
for the BSL-3 program at LIDR. To maximize efficiencies and adoption of best practices, the BSL-3 Practices
Core is committed to workforce development by offering continuing education and certifications for
biocontainment professionals. Further, the BSL-3 Practices Core will work closely with Core 1 and Core 3 in this
UC7 project to train professional staff in the biosafety, biocontainment, and the safe operations of aerosol-
generating instrumentation. The BSL-3 Practices Core interacts closely with the Institutional Biosafety
Committee, Principal Investigators, the LIDR Operations Committee, and the RBL-NBL network to develop and
adopt best practice standard operating procedures and conduct risk assessments for all work associated with
BSL-3 pathogens. The BSL-3 Practices Core plays a central role in the pandemic preparedness and response
of the LIDR to facilitate its contributions to meeting the needs of emerging infectious diseases. Overall, the BSL-
3 Practices Core enables the work performed at LIDR, and assures that the BSL-3 Cores for the Facility
Operations and Research Resources can carry out their objectives for high containment research without
harming themselves, the environment or community."

in the field of child psychiatric intervention, prevention, and services (CHIPS). The CHIPS program targets
post‐doc trainees and entry‐level faculty preparing to write their first NIMH career development or
project grant in the area of intervention, prevention or services for child psychiatric disorders. It
combines a one‐week summer institute with a minimum of one subsequent year of intensive mentoring
and mentor‐guided expansion of the trainee’s professional network. The overarching goals of this
program are to: (1) recruit and retain promising early career scientists to child and adolescent mental
health intervention, prevention, and services research; (2) increase their success rate and decrease the
time to successful acquisition of external funding; and (3) prepare researchers who can conduct
research that spans the boundaries of intervention, prevention, and services research and that is
strongly informed by advances in translational and developmental science. The one‐week summer
institute strongly emphasizes experiential exercises and mentoring. It is focused on helping trainees
acquire the full range of skills needed to prepare their next grant application. The CHIPS faculty have a
record of successful mentoring and together span the breadth of intervention, prevention, and services
research, and thus can promote the development of a broader training perspective to program
participants than any single training site.
With this competing renewal, responsive to the anticipated Covid‐19 impact on child and adolescent

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are effective at improving cardiovascular outcomes by helping patients
make heart-healthy lifestyle changes. However, these gains often do not last since as many as 50% of CR
patients stop exercising or eating a heart-healthy diet within a few months of completing a CR program. Mobile
health (mHealth) has the potential to provide effective ongoing support after CR programs end, and to help
patients sustain and augment health gains obtained during CR. However, to realize this promise, new
approaches are needed to increase the engagement in mHealth interventions. Patients abandon these
interventions for many reasons, including because they get discouraged when they don't meet their goals,
frustrated when they feel the mHealth system is sending them messages at wrong times or too often, or when
other demands in their lives take priority over trying to be active or eat healthily. Once abandoned mHealth
interventions stop being able to provide any further support. In this project, we will address this important
problem by developing novel algorithms and user interfaces (elements of an mHealth app individuals use to
interact with the app) that will help mHealth interventions to effectively adapt to the changes in individuals'
needs and priorities, so the intervention can remain useful—and thus have an opportunity to support patients—
over the long-term. The methods will (1) help mHealth systems more effectively provide interventions by
monitoring and optimizing how these interventions impact both intermediate-term behavioral outcomes like
commitment to physical activity—which mediate long-term change—as well as engagement with the
intervention itself; and (2) enable users to directly make changes to how an intervention behaves by examining
and correcting the information that the system uses to make decisions about intervention provision and
specifying the level of support that better matches their current circumstances and priorities. Once developed
and optimized in a micro-randomized trial with 60 CR patients, we will evaluate the ability of these innovations
to improve engagement with an mHealth intervention for physical activity and to improve physical activity itself
in a 9-month randomized controlled trial with 150 CR patients. The trial will compare an intervention that
contains the newly developed algorithms and interfaces with one that includes the same components for
supporting behavior change but which does not include the new algorithms and interfaces for increasing
engagement. If found to be successful, the innovations developed in this project will enable the development of
a new generation of mHealth interventions that can effectively support behavior change and maintenance both
for cardiovascular risk reduction and in other domains of health."

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in US men,
with African American men having the highest incidence and mortality rates. Prostate cancer is strongly
influenced by genetic factors, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) of common genetic variants are highly predictive
of prostate cancer risk in men from European, African, East Asian, and Hispanic populations. Rare pathogenic
variants also contribute to overall and aggressive prostate cancer risk, with 15% of metastatic cases carrying
such variation. However, due to high sequencing costs, our knowledge of the contribution of rare genetic variation
to prostate cancer risk is largely based on candidate gene studies, with of the few whole-exome or whole-genome
studies conducted to date having sample sizes that are large enough for the discovery of novel rare
variants/genes. Further, the majority of men included in common and rare genetic variant investigations of
prostate cancer risk have been from European ancestry populations, limiting our knowledge on genetic risk of
prostate cancer in other populations. The objective of this research is to elucidate genetic factors that contribute
to risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer across diverse populations and how such factors can be
combined with lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors to more accurately characterize risk of
prostate cancer. In Aim 1, we will investigate the contribution of rare and common genetic variants to prostate
cancer risk across diverse populations, with the goal of validating known genetic risk factors and discovering
novel genetic risk regions. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether genetic risk of prostate cancer, as measured by
a PRS of known common genetic risk variants, can be modified by rare pathogenic variant carrier status, lifestyle
factors, and socioeconomic factors across diverse populations. This research will be conducted in the All of Us
Research Program, combining results from Aim 1 with other large-scale investigations to improve our ability to
identify novel genetic risk regions. Findings from this investigation are expected to identify novel mechanisms
novel mechanisms to target for preventative measures and improve our understanding of the complex interplay
of genetic risk and modifiable risk factors of prostate cancer. Further, this investigation is anticipated to improve
our ability to identify men at increased risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer, which could have important
screening and healthcare implications for prostate cancer prevention."

Infectious diseases remain a significant cause of morbidity worldwide, highlighting the critical need for accurate
diagnosis. However, shared symptoms among different infections and the emergence of drug resistance make
diagnosis and treatment selection challenging. In this competing renewal, we propose to develop Gigapixel NGS
(gNGS) to enable rapid, sensitive, and information-rich infectious disease diagnosis. gNGS builds upon our
Gigapixel PCR (gPCR) technology by incorporating powerful next-generation sequencing capabilities. By
utilizing double emulsion vesicles for single cell assays, gNGS eliminates the need for specialized droplet
analyzers and allows common flow cytometers to be used for genome isolation.
Our goal in this renewal is to leverage the capabilities of Gigapixel NGS to detect, isolate, and sequence
infectious pathogen genomes from patient samples, which will improve the efficiency and sensitivity of pathogen
sequencing. We will collaborate with Dr. Charles Chiu, a renowned expert in infectious disease diagnostics who
leads the CLIA-certified pathogen lab at UCSF, to develop clinical workflows and bioinformatic tools for
interrogating the recovered genomes for relevant biomarker sequences, including virulence factors and drug
resistance genes. Dr. Chiu's expertise in infectious disease diagnostics and practical experience in clinical
sample sequencing for pathogen detection will ensure that the new diagnostic is effective and practical in a

10802690,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) colonizes the upper airways of children, and the elderly, resulting in millions
of deaths due to pneumonia annually.Pneumonia is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that causes
cytotoxicity leading to invasion of pneumococci into the lung epithelium. Invasive bacteria produce capsule to
translocate to the bloodstream causing death. All Spn strains produce abundant hydrogen peroxide (Spn-H2O2)
as a byproduct of the aerobic fermentation of carbohydrates and it has a demonstrated cytotoxic activity against
in vitro cultured lung epithelial cells. Despite that production of Spn-H2O2 finds optimal conditions in the lung, we
lack fundamental information about the molecular mechanism driving Spn-H2O2 toxicity during replication of
pneumococci in the lung parenchyma. The long-term objective of this research program is to identify the
molecular mechanism(s) leading to Spn-H2O2 toxicity in the lung to find new targets for interventions. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify key molecular targets for curing pneumococcal
pneumonia and preventing bacteremia. We hypothesize that oxidation of host hemoproteins by Spn-H2O2 is
key in the pathophysiology of pneumococcal disease. We have made fundamental discoveries supporting this
hypothesis. We demonstrated that hemoglobin induces formation of robust pneumococcal biofilms and that,
concurrently, Spn-H2O2 oxidizes hemoglobin releasing heme and iron. Remarkably, the oxidation of hemoglobin
by Spn-H2O2 selected for encapsulated pneumococci. The goal of this R01 proposal is therefore to characterize
the role of the oxidation of hemoglobin in the pathophysiology of pneumococcal disease. Three interconnected
aims are proposed to achieve our goal. In Aim 1, we will investigate the fitness cost of Spn-H2O2 oxidation of
hemoglobin during biofilm formation, and the resulting selection of encapsulated pneumococci. We will study
this mechanism(s) by using a series of scavengers and a systematic approach using mutants and complemented
strains with different capacity to produce H2O2. Inhibition of biofilms, toxicity and the selection of encapsulated
Spn will guide us towards the mechanism. In Aim 2, we will use an in vivo model of pneumococcal pneumonia,
along with a quantitative confocal imaging approach, Western blot analysis, genes expression studies, and
established techniques, to investigate niche-specific toxicity of Spn-H2O2, the cell's anti-oxidant response
against Spn-H2O2, the oxidation of hemoglobin and the mechanism leading to selection of encapsulated
pneumococci. In the final Aim 3, we will study the importance of Spn-H2O2 for the acquisition of heme/iron from
hemoglobin to overcome nutrients sequestration by the host. We will address this goal by using a biochemical
approach, a systematic approach with mutants and a transposon insertion sequencing screen. This innovative
study will significantly advance ourknowledge about the cellular, andmolecular pathophysiology of Spn disease.
This is significant because it will provide a framework for interventions aiming at oxidative reactions."

Hepatitis C kills over a million people each year, more than Tuberculosis or HIV. To eradicate the Hepatitis C
epidemic, a dramatic shift in diagnostics methodology is needed. The current paradigm, which relies on lab-
based tests, requires multiple visits with a patient because of the latency between sample collection and result.
This is challenging for at-risk populations and is sometimes impossible in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Moreover, central lab diagnostic technologies are simply not available in some LMICs. To address
this technology gap, we will develop a low-cost, portable, fully automated Sample-To-Answer Test for Hepatitis
C Virus (STAT-HCV). The STAT-HCV, which consists of a disposable cassette, a lateral flow strip, and a low-
cost handheld control unit, is enabled by our invention of Thermally Responsive Alkane Partitions (TRAPs),
pseudo-valves that automate precise sample manipulation steps. This innovation eliminates manual rinses and
the precise addition of reagents. The novel STAT-HCV design uniquely integrates TRAPs to achieve a low-
cost and portable diagnostic that will detect and genotype active Hepatitis C infections in blood collected
directly from patients’ fingertips. Successful outcomes will achieve a low-cost, rapid, portable, and easy-to-use
diagnostic with sensitivity and specificity values that match gold-standard commercial lab-based genomic tests.
This will lead to a new sample-to-answer diagnostic approach that supports eradication of the Hepatitis C
epidemic and that can be broadly applied to point-of-care diagnostics of any bloodborne viral infection."

 Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men, and although it can successfully be
treated in some men, others develop resistance to therapies and can relapse. Thus, it is prudent to discover
new therapeutic targets and develop therapeutic strategies that utilize already developed therapies to expedite
the development of new treatment options for prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer can be caused at
genetic and epigenetic levels. Not only do epigenetic modifications include unwinding of genes (i.e., DNA) so
they can be expressed as RNA, but this epigenetic regulation can also edit RNA. One epigenetic modifier is
protein enzyme enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) that normally modifies the histone H3K27, thereby, tightly
winding DNA and silencing gene expression. Our previous work showed that EZH2 is upregulated in advanced
prostate carcinomas and metastatic prostate cancer, and prostate cancer patients who have higher expression
levels of EZH2 have shorter survival times than prostate cancer patients with low or no expression of EZH2.
Surprisingly, we recently discovered that dysregulation of EZH2 alters RNA editing, which is totally different
from its well-known canonical function as a protein modifier. RNA editing can affect the stability of RNA and
induce variations, mutations, and truncations in the RNA, which alter important regulation of the RNA and
protein translation fidelity. These aberrant effects on RNA by alterations in RNA editing are associated with
cancer, in particular, prostate cancer. Therefore, investigating this novel EZH2 non-canonical function in RNA
editing will help us better understand the progression of advanced prostate cancer. Although the development
of EZH2 inhibitors has been an active area of investigation and multiple biotech and pharmaceutical
companies have been developing such drugs, EZH2 inhibitors alone have not proven effective in most solid
cancers. Thus, identifying new therapeutics targets will lead to the development of new drugs that can be
combined with already developed drugs, hence, expediting the development of new treatment options for
cancer. Our data show, for the first time, that EZH2 directly interacts with ADAR, which is an RNA-specific
adenosine deaminase and one of two enzymes responsible for editing and converting adenosine to inosine in
RNA. Most advanced prostate cancer cells have higher expression levels of EZH2 and ADAR compared to
those in benign prostate epithelial cells and early stage prostate cancer cells, suggesting the importance of
both of these proteins in prostate cancer progression. In the proposed project, we will identify precisely how
EZH2 and ADAR interact and edit the substrates in prostate cancer. Next, we will study how EZH2 and ADAR
work together to promote prostate cancer progression. Understanding these mechanisms will lead to the future
design of new inhibitors of EZH2 and ADAR. Therefore, our work provides a novel rationale to target both
ADAR and EZH2, and we predict that the inhibition of both ADAR and EZH2 will kill more cancer cells than
inhibiting either ADAR or EZH2 alone."
10803597,"Corticospinal neurons (CSN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to specific segmental targets in the
spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract (CST). CSN critically control voluntary movement and are centrally
involved in recovery from paralysis originating from multiple causes, e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral
palsy, etc.. CSN degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor
neurons, causes spasticity and paralysis. Recovery in all these distinct causes of paralysis would ultimately
require long-distance CST regeneration, which remains an unattained goal in regenerative neuroscience.
Previous work using neonatal lesions has established CST regenerative ability declines from development into
adulthood. When the CST is damaged in early life, there is greater plasticity and regeneration as compared to
similar lesions in the adult. However, despite this work, we still do not know when long-distance regenerative
ability is lost during development. This is because a key limitation of these established neonatal lesion models
is that they massively disrupt the spinal environment and thereby interfere with the normal process of long-
distance CSN axon extension during development. This limits the ability of these lesion paradigms to assess the
ability of the CNS to support long-distance regeneration. We recently established a novel microsurgical approach
to axotomize the CST during development, while leaving the spinal environment relatively intact. We identified
that long-distance CST regenerative ability is lost at different times at distinct spinal levels– at postnatal day 4
(P4) the CST can fully regenerate when lesioned at thoracic T11, but fails to do so when lesioned at cervical C2.
Our results indicate that the loss of long-distance CST regenerative ability closely parallels the developmental
timeline of normal CST growth into the spinal cord, which suggests that the normal process of differentiation,
both in CSN and in the spinal cord, results in the loss of long-distance regenerative ability. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that inhibition of differentiation to prolong the immature developmental state will
extend the time window when long-distance regeneration is possible. Specifically, we will manipulate the function
of RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a global repressor of neural differentiation, to test this hypothesis.
Building on this foundation, we will first manipulate REST function (both gain- and loss-of function) at distinct
spinal levels to investigate whether this affects the ability of these spinal segments to support long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim1). We will manipulate REST function in CSN to similarly investigate long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim 2). Finally, we will use single cell profiling to investigate potentially distinct molecular effects
of microlesions at distinct spinal levels on distinct CSN subsets depending on their developmental state (Aim 3).
Together, our work will discern novel molecular mechanisms of how long-distance CST regeneration is regulated
during development, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules that
can be used to effect long-distance CST regeneration in the adult CNS."

Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology.
Approximately 20% of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, a negative
regulator of NRF2, which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. Using
CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we
demonstrated that loss of Keap1 hyper-activates Nrf2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD.
Combining CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolic analyses, we showed that Keap1 mutant cells
are dependent on increased glutamine metabolism, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through
the pharmacological inhibition. In this application we focus on characterizing the molecular mechanisms and
therapeutic potential of targeting glutamine metabolism in KRAS-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD This application
aims to: 1) Assess the therapeutic potential of novel glutamine antagonist in both human and murine KRASG12D-
and KRASG12C-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD pre-clinical models, 2) Provide a rationale for sub-stratification of
human lung cancer patients with KRAS-KEAP1 or -NRF2 mutant tumors as likely responders to glutamine
antagonists and determine the therapeutic potential of combining with clinically relevant KC-Is with DRP-104. 3)
Characterize the metabolic mechanisms underlying glutamine antagonist sensitivity in KRAS-driven KEAP1
mutant LUAD, and 4) Identify mechanisms of resistance to glutamine dependence. Our studies will provide a
rationale for sub-stratification of patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to
DRP-104, a novel glutamine antagonist in clinical trials, which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine."

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is the most common hematologic
malignancy in the United States, and occurs in both adults and children. Approximately 40% of adult
DLBCL patients relapse or are refractory to current frontline therapy. This highlights an urgent need for new
therapeutic options in DLBCL.
 Many DLBCL cell lines are highly sensitive to compounds that cause replicative stress and/or inhibit the
DNA damage response (DDR). Thus, we chose to develop a novel nucleoside analog as a pre-clinical DLBCL
therapeutic since this compound class typically induces replicative stress and are highly active in hematological
cancers. Nucleoside analogs are the most widely successful drug-class and have been approved for treating
hematological cancers, among other indications.
 Using phenotypical chemical biology combined with a high-throughput multiplexed 930 cancer
cell line screen, we identified 4’-ethynyl-deoxycytidine (EdC) as a highly effective and unique pre-clinical
therapeutic for DLBCL. EdC exhibits nanomolar potency in DLBCL (GCB and ABC subtypes) harboring
alterations in epigenetic factors (KMT2D, EZH2), BCL2 and/or MYC and regresses DLBCL tumors in mice within
3-5 days without weight loss or toxicity. In contrast to traditional nucleoside analogs, EdC uniquely acts as a
monophosphate and induces replicative stress by inhibiting de novo dCTP synthesis. To further characterize
and develop EdC as a unique and highly promising pre-clinical therapeutic for DLBCL, we plan to develop the
following Aims: 1. Elucidate the mechanism of action of EdC; 2. Characterize biomarkers for DLBCL
sensitivity to EdC; 3. Investigate the efficacy of EdC on DLBCL in vivo. This proposal is expected to further
elucidate the mechanisms, biomarkers, and in vivo efficacy of EdC as a new pre-clinical candidate for DLBCL."
10932392,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant efforts to identify genes important in human neurodevelopment and disease, a large
proportion of genes and variants remain undiscovered. Duplicated parts of the genome are largely
understudied due to historical errors in the reference and bioinformatic pipelines that filter reads mapping to
multiple locations in the genome. With the recent publication of a complete telomere-to-telomere human
genome, genes and variants can be more effectively assayed across complex loci, but modified computational
approaches are necessary. The proposed study will leverage diverse expertise in functional genomics
and human genetics to test the hypothesis that a subset of human duplicated genes both contribute to
neurological features and cause disorders exclusive to modern-day humans. Duplicated genes have
previously been shown to play a role in early brain development and are enriched at genomic hotspots where
recurrent copy-number variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Starting with a
comprehensive list of thousands of human duplicated genes, functions of a subset of genes expressed during
human corticogenesis will be tested using CRISPR knockout of orthologs and expression of human paralogs in
zebrafish to determine their effects on general morphology, synaptic function, and brain development. The
ability to test tens to hundreds of genes in parallel and conservation of basic developmental processes—such
as neural proliferation, axonal guidance, and synaptogenesis—make zebrafish an ideal model to test these
genes. Second, a genetic screen will be performed in human population cohorts to identify conserved
duplicated genes. Since standard methods filter variants across many complex genomic loci, an improved
bioinformatics approach leveraging short-read data will be devised and optimized using available sequencing
benchmarks. Further, conserved genes will be screened for de novo and rare variants in autistic individuals
using published datasets. Leveraging this multifaceted approach will enable systematic assessment of
duplicated genes and their putative roles in human neurological traits and disorders. The zebrafish toolkit will
be generally applicable to assaying functions of additional (non-duplicated) genes important in brain
development, while the improved bioinformatics approach will enable additional screens of duplicated genes in
other disease cohorts. This project will not only provide important insights into what it means to be human, but
also it has the capability to discover missing genetic risk and elucidate the etiology of complex genetic neural
traits and disorders."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for approximately 22% of all cancer
deaths. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended in adults aged 50-80
years who have a history of pack-years to 20 and are current smokers or quit in the past 15 years, but
screening with LDCT remains controversial due to the very high false-positive rates, increased radiation
exposures, and costs. Moreover, many adults are diagnosed with lung cancer who are not eligible for
screening. In the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the task force identified “Future Research
Needs,” which includes conducting more research on biomarkers, noting that: “Biomarkers could potentially be
used to identify high-risk candidates for screening with LDCT”. For this project, we propose to measure DNA
methylation levels in blood leukocytes obtained from samples that were collected prior to screening (and at
multiple time points) in participants of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Our first objective is to
develop a pre-screening tool that would classify high-risk participants into additional risk categories to reduce
number of scans needed. Our second objective is to examine whether differences in DNA methylation markers
can distinguish participants with positive screening results who developed lung cancer from those with false
positives (i.e., did not develop cancer). Our third objective is to examine whether differences in DNA
methylation markers can discriminate participants who had a negative scan and were diagnosed with lung
cancer during follow-up and through the end of 2014 from those with a negative scan who did not develop lung
cancer. Using the NLST archived samples will allow us to efficiently evaluate whether DNA methylation
markers can improve models for risk stratification, thus reduce unnecessary scans needed to be performed, as
well as potentially assist in identifying true positive and false negative LDCT scans.

10803567,"Visual sensory substitution devices, in which images from a video camera are converted to a cross-modal signal
that is then presented to the subjects in place of direct visual information, offer an alternative, non-surgical
approach for the blind to appreciate aspects of their immediate environment. These non-invasive, low-cost
technologies can also offer higher visual acuity and wider fields of view than currently available retinal and
cortical implants. However, sensory substitution devices are rarely adopted to interpret and translate complex,
natural environments for daily use by blind individuals partly because of their impracticality. In addition, little is
known about the perceptual and behavioral consequences of delivering new patterns of information as an
alternative sense when the visual system is damaged at different ages. The metabolic and functional processes
that allow the deprived human visual cortex for enhancing cross-modal plasticity have not been clearly defined
either. These research gaps must be filled before sensory substitution can be exploited as a method of vision
rehabilitation for improving function and independence while reducing the associated costs of blindness. The
goal of this project is to develop and refine sensory substitution technologies and to identify the determinants of
cross-modal plasticity in brains deprived of visual input in order to facilitate sensory substitution. To achieve this
goal, we will incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify images of complex, natural environments into
isolated objects for sensory substitution. We will then use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy
(MRS), combined with behavioral assessments to examine the neural substrates of sensory substitution in early
and late blind subjects. We will leverage tactile and auditory substitution stimuli to determine how changes in
neurochemicals reflect the cross-modal activity of visually deprived brains. We will also test how training with AI
can help blind individuals interpret visual environmental cues in a more meaningful way. Feedback from the
behavioral and neurobiological results will help refine our sensory substitution devices. Aim 1: To improve
sensory substitution toward practical use, we will use AI and 3D coding to convert complex everyday scenarios
into simplified and aesthetically engaging versions that aid both immediate task performance and sensory
substitution training. Aim 2: To determine how visual processing pathways in the brain adapt to vision loss, we
will employ advanced MRI and MRS to unveil the structural, metabolic, and functional brain properties in
participants with different onset ages and durations of blindness before training. Aim 3: To determine the effects
of sensory substitution training on visual processing pathways and performance of the blind, we will use
advanced MRI and MRS to determine if cross-modal perceptual learning alters the deprived visual cortex toward
a more plastic state via modulating its excitatory-inhibitory balance and choline levels. We will also examine the
neurobehavioral changes that occur when identifying and locating the objects of interest using auditory or tactile
stimuli with and without AI-assisted image deconstruction."

Synaptic organizers form macromolecular bridges that span the cleft of synapses, the contact and
communication points between neurons. Defects in many different synaptic organizers are implicated in
neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability
(ID), illnesses in dire need of better medications. Synaptic organizers regulate the formation and function of
synapses, but their molecular mechanisms are not well understood. They likely produce a code that helps wire
billions of neurons together into neural circuits that are discrete and specific, yet also plastic, such as those
regulating human behavior. We are leveraging the neurexin (NRXN) family of synaptic organizers, and their
many partners, as prototypes to understand how trans-synaptic bridges are formed and shape synaptic
connections. Defects in NRXNs and their partners are implicated in SZ, ASD and ID. Working model: When
NRXN trans-synaptic bridges malfunction, fundamental synaptic processes change and lead to the pathology
of severe mental illness. Mounting evidence suggests that the trans-synaptic bridges formed between
NRXNs and their partners are dynamically controlled via a portfolio of different mechanisms that either
boost them or suppress them. It is not known on a molecular level how these different regulatory mechanisms
exactly work to control the formation and/or function of NRXN-mediated trans-synaptic bridges, or the bases of
their dynamic action. We hypothesize that NRXNs and their partners form a molecular platform that is
targeted by a set of fundamentally different and dynamic regulatory mechanisms, exploiting: 1) protein
3D conformational changes; 2) regulators with opposite functions; 3) the oligomeric status of partners;
and 4) factors secreted by astrocytes. In this proposal, we will determine the underpinnings of key
mechanisms, first establishing the molecular ground rules using structural, biophysical, and biochemical
techniques, and then strategically interrogating these rules in a cellular context and in in vivo studies.
Collectively, our results will reveal how regulatory mechanisms mold NRXN trans-synaptic bridges,
impacting their ability to regulate synapse formation and synaptic communication. This proposal is significant
because in addition to revealing molecular mechanisms that regulate a very large portfolio of trans-synaptic
bridges and their functions, it will also reveal protein interactions that can be targeted to manipulate specific
synaptic connections for therapeutic purposes and address specific CNS disorders. This proposal is
conceptually innovative because it propels an emerging paradigm shift that trans-synaptic bridges, like those
formed between NRXNs and their partners, are in fact subject to intense regulation by other interacting
proteins, including other synaptic organizers, and these synergize together to shape synaptic connections. This
proposal is also technically innovative because it involves using electron tomography to image flexible
synapse-organizing molecules, for which we are actively developing methodologies."

Failure of the right ventricle (RV) is a main component of the morbidity and mortality of pulmonary hypertension
(PH). There exists no specific treatment for RV dysfunction and failure and the only cure for many patients
(especially in the case of pulmonary arterial hypertension) remains transplantation. This is partially due to the
critical lack of understanding of RV biology; therapeutic strategies that are beneficial for LV failure have worse
outcomes when applied to those with RV failure. What has been observed in RV dysfunction in human subjects
and animal models is exaggerated fibrosis and divergent contractile and hypertrophic responses to several drugs
when compared to LV dysfunction. Thus, the RV may contain distinct pathobiology compared to the LV that has
high significance for treatment of PH. A greater understanding of RV cellular biology is needed to develop new
opportunities toward our long-term goal of discovering tailored therapies for dysfunction and failure of the RV.
We performed transcriptomic analysis to compare the RV with the LV using Sprague Dawley rats and found
significant differences in immune-related and fibrotic genes. Flow cytometry was used to confirm that the RV of
control rats had an average of four-fold higher density of immune cells, namely macrophages/monocytes,
compared to the LV. When rats were subject to pressure overload via hypoxia in combination with the VEGF
pathway inhibitor Sugen, the RV became hyper-fibrotic. This was also clear in isolated fibroblasts from the RV
of control rats, which had a higher proliferation rate and an alteration of metabolic genes. Thus, we were led to
our central hypothesis: the RV is primed for disproportionate dysfunction under pressure overload due to the
unique physiology of its cellular constituents, namely immune cells and fibroblasts. We will investigate this
hypothesis with the following two aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of the immune response in the RV during
adaptive and adverse remodeling. We will test the hypothesis that distinctive macrophage populations in the RV
are critical for the “hyper-fibrosis” found in RV disease, and modulating specific inflammatory signals will be able
to dampen the fibrotic response. Aim 2: Identify the fibrotic mediators in RV fibroblasts in situ and in vitro. We
will test the hypothesis that RV fibroblasts have altered cellular metabolic programming that causes an enhanced
fibrotic response, mediated by interactions with cardiac macrophages. This project will provide new
understanding of the cellular processes that occur during pathologic remodeling of the RV. This knowledge is
expected to yield new therapeutic approaches for RV dysfunction and failure occurring with PH, which currently
have no specific treatment."

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation, a phenotypic switch from a differentiated
contractile phenotype to a proliferative phenotype, contributes to vascular remodeling and the development of
diverse vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis following angioplasty.
However, the molecular mechanisms that control VSMC phenotypic modulation are poorly understood. Our
exciting preliminary data strongly support a novel role of Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) in VSMC
phenotypic modulation. RUNX3 belongs to the ‘Runt domain’ family of transcription factors that act as
regulators of gene expression in several important developmental pathways. We found that RUNX3 expression
is significantly increased by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a potent stimulator of VSMC
phenotypic modulation. Knockdown of RUNX3 reversed PDGF-BB-inhibited expression of SMC contractile
markers. In addition, RUNX3 knockdown blocked PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation. These data
demonstrate that RUNX3 is essential for PDGF-BB-induced VSMC phenotypic modulation and cell proliferation
in vitro. In addition, RUNX3 overexpression blocked myocardin-induced α-SMA expression and promoter
activity, suggesting that RUNX3 regulates VSMC contractile marker expression through myocardin/SRF
signaling. RUNX3 knockdown also inhibited PDGF-BB induced expression of c-Myc, a crucial driver of VSMC
proliferation. The PDGF-BB-induced activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of GSK3β, important pathways in
regulating c-Myc levels, were adversely affected by RUNX3 knockdown. RUNX3 expression was activated in
the media and neointima VSMCs following the left common carotid artery injury in C57BL/6 mice. RUNX3
deficiency (RUNX3-/-) dramatically inhibited injury-induced neointima formation, suggesting that RUNX3 plays a
critical role in injury-induced neointima formation and vascular remodeling in vivo. These data together strongly
support a novel hypothesis that RUNX3 induces VSMC phenotypic modulation by suppressing VSMC
contractile marker expression and promotes VSMC proliferation via c-Myc, leading to neointima
formation/vascular remodeling, which will be tested by three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying RUNX3 function in modulating VSMC phenotype by testing the hypothesis that
RUNX3 regulates VSMC phenotypic modulation via suppressing myocardin/SRF-mediated transcriptional
activation of VSMC marker genes. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that RUNX3 upregulates c-Myc expression
through NF-κB and GSK3β/β-catenin signaling to promote VSMC proliferation. Aim 3: Test whether RUNX3
is essential for carotid artery ligation/wire injury-induced vascular remodeling using global, VSMC-specific, and
endothelial cell-specific RUNX3 knockout mice. Taken together, this project will shed new lights on the
pathogenesis of vascular remodeling after vessel injury, which may ultimately lead to the identification of novel
targets for therapeutic treatment of various cardiovascular diseases related to vascular remodeling."

In vertebrates, calcium and phosphate form a metastable solution, from which they precipitate at specific
nucleation sites to form hydroxyapatite. Under physiological conditions, mineralization is restricted to skeleton
and teeth, despite the abundant presence of nucleation sites in soft connective tissues. The pathological
deposition of hydroxyapatite outside the boundaries of the skeleton, is known as ectopic mineralization, a
condition that affects millions of people around the globe. Ectopic mineralization is linked to a wide variety of
clinical conditions such as trauma, aging, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases, all major causes of
significant morbidity and mortality. Related to the skeleton, an understudied research area is the pathological
mineralization of spinal joints, and especially the tissues of the intervertebral disc (IVD). This is remarkable
considering the high prevalence of chronic low back and neck pain and associated IVD degeneration and spinal
pathologies and their dramatic socio-economic consequences. The major risk factor associated with back pain
is the degenerative status of the IVD and ectopic mineralization significantly contributes to this pathology. Current
information indicates that tissues are protected against uncontrolled mineralization by two classes of
complementary systems, proteins and low molecular weight (LMW) compounds (< 1000 Da). The first group
includes proteins like fetuin-A, osteopontin and Matrix Gla Protein whereas the best-known example of the
second class is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Noteworthy, the role that citrate and phosphocitrate (PC), two
other endogenous metabolites that inhibit mineralization, play in the prevention of ectopic mineralization has
received surprisingly little attention. Moreover, how the extracellular levels of these endogenous LMW
compounds are regulated is incompletely understood. One major goal of this proposal is understanding the
mechanisms by which extracellular PPi together with citrate and PC regulate the mineralization of spinal and
other soft tissues. These studies will build on our previous work in which we identified the membrane proteins
ABCC6 and ANK as crucial factors in extracellular PPi homeostasis. We propose to delineate how these proteins
collaborate to prevent ectopic mineralization of IVD and other tissues. In addition, we recently discovered that
ANK regulates extracellular levels of citrate. We now plan to determine if extracellular citrate, which tightly binds
calcium, protects the IVD against dystrophic mineralization. Finally, we propose to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying synthesis and cellular extrusion of PC, an understudied but very potent endogenous mineralization
inhibitor. We expect that the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into how extracellular homeostasis
of PPi, citrate and PC is maintained, and how these metabolites prevent dystrophic mineralization of the IVD.
Moreover, we will determine if these endogenous LMW mineralization inhibitors can be used therapeutically,
addressing the unmet clinical need of effective treatments for ectopic mineralization in the spine, a condition that
affects millions of individuals worldwide."

10931728,"Project Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms of retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy
(RVCL), an adult-onset vascular dementia associated with brain atrophy, blindness, and premature death,
usually within 5-10 years of disease onset. RVCL is an autosomal dominant disease that is refractory to treatment
with immunosuppression despite the fact that RVCL patients develop autoantibodies. RVCL-causing mutations
in the TREX1 gene cause disease with 100% penetrance. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this
devastating disease, and the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis have not yet been defined.
Dr. Jonathan Miner (PI) directs the RVCL Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania and coordinates
care of RVCL patients from around the United States and the world. Dr. Miner also leads a team of RVCL-
focused clinicians and investigators. Preliminarily the Miner laboratory has generated numerous mouse and
human cellular models of RVCL and discovered novel molecular mechanisms that may be driving
endotheliopathy, cellular senescence, and the resulting vascular dementia. The co-investigator is Dr. Nouri
Neamati, a medicinal chemist and biochemist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Neamati is developing TREX1
inhibitors and protein degraders. This partnership has led to novel animal models, single-cell RNA-seq studies,
and first-in-class inhibitors of TREX1, as well as our discovery that RVCL-causing TREX1 mutations lead to
failure of replicative senescence and dysregulation of endogenous retroelements.
Here, we propose to use cellular and animal models to define the role of TREX1 in regulating DNA damage,
retroelements, and pathology (Aim 1), to use animal models to define functions of TREX1 mutants and a DNA
damage repair pathway in humoral immunity (Aim 2), and to determine the role of TREX1 DNase activity using
an enzyme-dead TREX1 mutant mice and first-in-class TREX1 inhibitors and protein degraders (Aim 3). Our
mechanistic studies will broadly elucidate functions of TREX1 and the role of TREX1-mediated DNA damage in
a mouse model expressing TREX1 mutants known to cause small vessel disease and vascular dementia in
humans. Insights gained from our work may clarify the role of TREX1 and endogenous retroviruses in cellular
senescence, eventually leading to new therapies for this monogenic vascular dementia."
10935981,"Pre-and post-migration exposures to interpersonal violence and inadequate or lack of access to care can have
a significant negative impact on immigrant women’s health and contribute to health disparities among
immigrant women in the US. Immigrant women with pre-and post-migration or cumulative exposures to
interpersonal violence are at high risk for co-occurring mental and physical health problems (e.g., PTSD,
HIV/STI) and safety issues such as living in unsafe households or being in unsafe relationships. However, very
few women seek help from formal service providers due to factors such as isolation, shame, mistrust of health
professionals or lack of knowledge. Thus, there is need for evidence-based digital interventions that address
care needs of immigrant women with cumulative exposures to violence and mental health symptoms and can
be accessed outside formal services settings. A trauma-informed internet and mobile-phone based
intervention (Being Safe, Healthy, and Positively Empowered (BSHAPE) was designed to improve outcomes
for immigrant women with cumulative exposures to violence and mental health symptoms. The findings from
the BSHAPE pilot study found BSHAPE intervention to be feasible, and acceptable. Women who participated
in BSHAPE showed improvement in outcomes such as reduced stress, enhanced self-efficacy, improved
mental health and safety-related empowerment. The proposed study will use a sequential, mixed methods
longitudinal design to evaluate efficacy of BSHAPE in a large-scale trial. In the first phase, the study will further
refine BSHAPE to make it more user friendly, engaging, accessible and adaptive to immigrant women from
diverse backgrounds. For this, the study will use findings from the pilot study and the feedback obtained from
women who participated in the BSHAPE pilot trial. The input will be obtained from cultural experts and
immigrant women from diverse countries of origin using a qualitative approach. In the second phase, the study
will use a longitudinal randomized controlled trial design to randomize 676 women to the BSHAPE arm (n=338)
or the control arm (n=338). The health and safety related outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months
follow up. It is hypothesized the participation in BSHAPE will lead to improved mental health, reduced stress,
enhanced self-care, and improved safety among immigrant women with cumulative exposures to violence. In
addition, the study will explore potential mediators and moderators of the intervention effect on key outcomes.
The study will result in an evidence based digital BSHAPE intervention that will be designed to provide remote
support to underserved and marginalized immigrant women with unmet needs for care, particularly those
residing in low resource and underserved areas in the US. The intervention also has the potential to be more
accessible and acceptable to immigrant women survivors who may not access standard care services due to
socio-cultural, economic, transportation and immigration-related barriers."
10802625,"Project Summary
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is of fundamental importance to human health through its regulation of all
aspects of gastrointestinal (GI) function, most notably gut motility. Congenital or acquired abnormalities of the
ENS consequently can lead to serious functional GI disorders, including esophageal achalasia, gastroparesis,
intestinal pseudo-obstruction, irritable bowel syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, and slow transit constipation.
The adult intestine is known to possess neuronal progenitors that can be utilized for regenerative cell therapy
to treat these neurointestinal diseases. However, to be able to stimulate endogenous enteric neurogenesis in
the adult intestine, or to improve current methods for culturing and expanding neuronal progenitors in a dish,
we need to understand the mechanisms that regulate the neurogenic response in the gut. In our current R01,
we have shown that a subset of enteric glial cells, highly enriched within the myenteric ganglia, possesses a
gene expression program and chromatin state predictive of neurogenic potential. These cells are capable of
undergoing rapid neuronal differentiation in response to specific stimuli, such as intestinal inflammation. The
overall objective of the current proposal is to define the cellular, molecular, and epigenetic signals that activate
this inflammatory-mediated neurogenic response in glia. Based on our preliminary studies, we propose the
following specific aims: (1) determine the role of muscularis macrophages and their inflammatory products in
promoting enteric neurogenesis; (2) investigate the role of Sox2 and Sox10 transcription factors in preventing
neuronal differentiation of enteric glia; and (3) characterize the phenotypic diversity and function of newly born
glial-derived neurons. This proposal is innovative in testing an immune-mediated mechanism for postnatal
enteric neurogenesis and does so utilizing state-of-the-art techniques, including CUT&RUN epigenomic
profiling, AAV-based gene silencing in vivo, neurosphere transplantation, and isolation and culture of
muscularis macrophages. The team provides expertise in ENS development, enteric neuronal stem cell
biology, ENS cell therapy, intestinal inflammation, bioinformatics, and clinical neurogastroenterology.
Successful completion of the proposed experiments will significantly enhance our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying neurogenesis in the adult intestine, identify new targets for pharmacotherapies that
can modulate enteric neurogenesis in vivo, and improve our ability to expand enteric neuronal progenitors in
vitro for cell therapy applications, including the development of cell transplantation for the treatment of
Hirschsprung disease and other neurointestinal diseases."
10802692,"Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a transition state between “normal” aging and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). Older adults with MCR have an increased risk of developing AD/ADRD. They suffer from brain atrophy in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)—a brain region subserving executive function—and have abnormal dlPFC activation when walking and performing a cognitive task (i.e., dual-tasking, DT), an executive function that predicts incident AD/ADRD. MCR thus identifies an opportunity to intervene (upstream) to alter the trajectory of cognitive decline and the risk of AD/ADRD in later life. 
In a series of pilot studies, we have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves dual-tasking gait, executive function, and related outcomes. These short-term studies are encouraging. Yet, the extent to which tDCS can induce longer-term benefits is unclear. We have also shown that tDCS can be administered safely in the home and that a smartphone app can be used for home-based testing of DT gait. 
We will enroll 128 older adults into a sham-controlled, double-blinded, delayed-start, multi-site clinical trial of home-based tDCS, with stimulation parameters tailored to target the anatomically defined left dlPFC of each participant. After an initial open-label 2-week tDCS intervention, participants will be randomized into a tDCS arm (5 weekly tDCS sessions for 6 months), or a delayed-start Sham arm (5 weekly sham sessions for 3 months before switching to 5 weekly sessions of tDCS for 3 months). In-lab assessments will be conducted at baseline, after the initial 2-week intervention, after 3 and 6 months of stimulation, and 3 months later. Structural and functional MRIs will be acquired at baseline and 3 months. The primary endpoint will be DT cost (DTC) to gait speed, a cognitive-motor marker of prefrontal function and predictor of future cognitive decline. 
Our primary hypothesis is that compared to Sham, the tDCS arm will exhibit lower (better) DTC to gait speed after 3 months of continued stimulation. We also expect that tDCS, compared to Sham, will lead to better performance on other tests of executive and cognitive function, reduced (more efficient) dlPFC activation when walking, and measurable changes in prefrontal structure and functional connectivity as measured by MRI. The delayed-start trial design will further enable us to test the hypotheses that the benefits of tDCS accumulate over time, and that the rate of decline of benefits is slower after six months, as compared to only three months of use. Finally, we will utilize weekly, home-based gait assessments using our app throughout the RCT—and for 3 months after—to establish individual and group trajectories of change in the DTC to gait speed over time, allowing us to address many critical unknowns (e.g., if and when do the benefits of 2-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months of tDCS wear off, and if so, at what rate?). We anticipate showing that home-based tDCS is an effective, long-term therapeutic option capable of inducing sustained improvements in cognitive and motor function, as well as left dlPFC structure and function, in older adults at risk of developing AD/ADRD."
10802819,"Project Summary/Abstract
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic blood disorders that that can cause severe symptoms and
early death. New treatments have become available that help ameliorate symptoms, but they do not reliably slow
or halt disease progression. We seek to better understand what drives disease development and progression in
MPNs, so that we can develop better therapies for patients with these diseases.
Our preliminary data indicates that the NFkB pathway is abnormally activated in MPNs. We hypothesize that
NFkB pathway signaling contributes to the development of MPNs. Therefore, we have proposed a combination
of mouse and human studies to determine how NFkB contributes to MPN pathogenesis, and to evaluate whether
inhibition of NFkB pathway signaling may have potential therapeutic benefits for MPN patients."
10789886,"ABSTRACT
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common type of structural birth defects in humans, resulting
from the failure of neural tube closure (NTC) during neurulation. The etiology of NTDs are known to be multi-
factorial, including interacting genetic and environmental factors. There are multiple developmentally-related
signaling pathways involved as NTC proceeds spatially and temporally. The identification of specific genetic
variants that contribute significantly to the etiology of NTDs, and the characterization of their underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms leading to failed NTC has progressed slowly over the last several decades. What is
important to recognize is that NTDs stand out as a preventable birth defect. Research spanning decades
demonstrates that maternal periconceptional supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs by 30%
to 70%. Yet not all NTDs are folate responsive. Currently between 30-50% of all NTDs are not preventable by
folic acid supplementation. The proposed research project is based on our recently published folic acid non-
responsive Slc25a32 null mouse model, and its interaction with a folic acid responsive Wnt co-receptor, Lrp6
mutant mouse model. The studies are designed to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms characteristic of
folic acid resistant NTDs, and to test our hypothesis that these folate resistant NTDs may be prevented by
interventions with downstream folate metabolites, such as formate. It was recently determined that formate could
rescue folic acid-resistant NTD mice, suggesting that mitochondrial one carbon metabolism might be
compromised in the non-folate responsive NTD population. Despite almost 40 years of intensive study, we still
do not fully understand the molecular, cellular and biochemical mechanisms that underlie the folate-dependent
process of NTC. This gap in our knowledge hinders our ability to make informed health policy decisions about
folate fortification and to identify novel treatments to prevent folate-resistant NTDs."
10789888,"As the number and proportion of people aged 65 or older continue to increase in the United States, the
number of Americans living with dementia is also growing. Among all dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementia (ADRD) is the most common cause, accounting for approximately 60%-80% of the
cases. Improving the care of people living with ADRD impacts the lives of not only the patients and their
family but also the caregivers and their family, posing significant challenges to the well-being of the
society. The purpose of this project is to exploit the autonomy and intelligence capability of a humanoid
robot to comprehend, assist, relieve, and evaluate (CARE) patients with AD. The proposed Robotic CARE
system has the capacity to detect the emotion and cognitive state of an AD patient, communicate and
collaborate with the patient to accomplish basic instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) such as meal
preparation, laundry, self-feeding, as well as help caregivers by reducing their levels of burden and stress.
The proposed system could effectively bridge the CARE gap in our society, offering unprecedented
potential for improving the quality of lives of both the patients and their caregivers. It is worth mentioning
that the proposed Robotic CARE system is not to replace the caregivers, but rather to supplement the
caregivers while providing companionship for AD patients since the system will learn to automatically
assess patients’ cognitive state so as to better understand and respond to patients’ need.
The CARE system is expected to advance the state-of-the-art in several related fields with its innovative
and unique integration of cognitive assessment and rehabilitation with robot-assisted care. The proposed
system makes contributions from three perspectives. First, cognitive assessment using instrumental
activities of daily living (IADL) for patient-caregiver interaction will be conducted. Second,
neurophysiological assessment using multimodal integration and unsupervised learning for patient-robot
interaction will be conducted. Third, co-robot assessment using reinforcement learning for
patient-robot-caregiver interaction will be conducted. The proposed team includes expertise from nursing
with specialty in dementia care and gerontology, biomedical engineering with specialty in brain-computer
interface, and computer science with specialty in machine/deep learning."
10790005,"ABSTRACT
Immune surveillance by phagocytic cells plays a vital role in controlling infections by internalize bacteria and
kill them by a process of enzymatic degradation. Degradation also releases bacterial molecules that activate
innate immune receptors and antigens for presentation to the adaptive immune system ultimately
orchestrating the overall immune response to a microbe. The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, like
Staphylococcus aureus, is predominantly composed peptidoglycan, an amino acid-crosslinked sugar
polymer. We recently demonstrated that the monomeric sugar, n-acetylglucosamine, released during
peptidoglycan degradation, is inflammatory. N-acetylglucosamine interacts with the glycolytic enzyme
hexokinase, inhibiting its function. As a consequence, hexokinase’s interaction with the mitochondrial outer
membrane is disrupted and this dissociation initiates a signaling cascade responsible for assembly of the
multi-protein NLRP3 inflammasome complex necessary for activation of the protease caspase-1. Caspase-
1 is responsible for the cleavage and activation of several key inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b and
IL-18, important for inflammatory cell recruitment and activation. Our results suggest that phagocytic cells
have adapted their normal glycolytic regulation to sense abnormally high levels of a bacterial sugar as
danger. To evade immune surveillance, bacteria modify their peptidoglycan layer to resist degradation by
phagocytic cells and limiting the availability of innate inflammatory signals, including n-acetylglucosamine.
The amount of n-acetylglucosamine impacting hexokinase function and glycolysis will depend on transport
across the phagosomal membrane into the cytosol. Preliminary evidence suggests that the amount of IL-
1b produced by phagocytic cells, specifically in response to peptidoglycan, is dependent on the function of
the GLUT family of sugar transports. In addition, we have generated a mouse model deficient for one of the
three hexokinases expressed by phagocytic cells and observed differential impacts on glycolysis and
inflammatory responses. This proposal aims to define the roles of the three hexokinases expressed by
phagocytic cell in the inflammatory response to gram-positive bacteria peptidoglycan, as well characterize
the transport and impact of peptidoglycan-derived n-acetylglucosamine on the metabolism and
inflammatory responses of phagocytic cells. We hypothesize that the overall degree of inflammation induced
by gram-positive bacteria is impacted by the amount and availability of n-acetylglucosamine generating
during bacterial peptidoglycan degradation due in part to n-acetylglucosamine’s inhibition of glycolytic
metabolism."
10784232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This NIH K08 Career Development Award proposal describes a five-year training program studying the role of
NLRP3 inflammasome in Tet2-/- clonal hematopoiesis. The widespread presence of blood cells harboring
somatic genetic alterations in the absence of any hematologic malignancy defines the condition known as
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Both human and mouse studies have demonstrated
significant associations between CHIP and cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic liver disease, osteoporosis, and gout. Focused studies on the genes most frequently mutated in CHIP,
epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A, have implicated increased chemokine expression and
inflammasome hyperactivation in myeloid cells as a possible mechanistic connection between CH and these
diseases. Dysregulated innate immune and inflammatory signaling also contribute to preleukemic states and
pathogenesis of myeloid disease, but precise mechanisms remain unclear. I propose in Aim 1 to study the role
of NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation and innate immunity, in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. I will characterize the functional role of NLRP3 using an orthogonal approach of clonal
hematopoiesis mouse models, human xenografts and patient specimens. In Aim 2, I propose to characterize
the function of NLRP3 inflammasome at the transcriptional and chromatin levels using single cell sequencing
technology. I will further define the hematopoietic progenitor compartment responsible for Tet2-deficient,
NLRP3-dependent clonal expansion. This work will implicate NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the development
of clonal hematopoiesis and suggest new strategies to target the inflammatory drive in CHIP. The applicant,
Dr. Waihay Wong, has completed clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and Hematopathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He will complete a research program focused
on training as an independent investigator to study the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. Dr. Wong proposes to develop expertise in next-generation sequencing, computational
analysis, and mouse models of disease. The mentor, Dr. Benjamin Ebert (HHMI Investigator, Professor of
Medicine at HMS and Chair of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, DFCI), is a renowned expert
in the biology of hematopoietic cells and clonal hematopoiesis. Dr. Ebert has successfully mentored numerous
physician-scientists to become independent academic investigators. This mentoring will be supported by
formal course work, seminars, presentations at international meetings, and regular meetings with Dr. Wong’s
Advisory Committee which has complementary expertise and experience in mentoring physician-scientists to
develop independent research programs. Dr. Wong will conduct this research at the DFCI and leverage the
exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute to complete this
work and realize his long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."
10784302,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Approximately 90% of the blood vessels in the brain are capillaries, which have been
traditionally viewed solely as a dense and passive network of tiny vessels which allow efficient nutrient and waste
exchange. More recently, the capillaries have been appreciated for their ability to sense brain
activity/environments and electrically communicate these signals with upstream arteries/arterioles to ensure
rapid and efficient blood flow regulation. The initiation and propagation of these hyperpolarzing electrical signals
in the capillaries requires activation of vascular potassium ion channels such as inwardly-rectifying K+ 2 channels
(Kir2). Recently, the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) channel has been functionally characterized in capillary
endothelial cells (cECs) and pericytes. The physiological stimuli which activate capillary KATP channels and
regulate blood flow in the brain are unclear. Furthermore, the electrical signaling and amplification processes
between pericytes and cEC are poorly understood. Drops in brain O2 concentration can occur in response to
many physiological and pathological conditions such as stroke, tumor growth, altitude change, and hypotension,
and consequently results in a metabolic challenge to cells and leads to accumulation of extracellular adenosine.
Both changes in cellular ATP and adenosine signaling can stimulate KATP channel function. Here, I hypothesize
that local and global hypoxic events stimulate capillary pericyte and cEC KATP channel activity and
hyperpolarization, the latter of which is amplified and propagates through cEC Kir2.1 activation to increase blood
flow. I will test this hypothesis with two distinct aims. First, I will elucidate the mechanisms by which capillary
KATP channels increase cerebral blood flow to hypoxia. Second, I will elucidate electrical coupling and
amplification processes within and between capillary pericytes and cECs during KATP activation. These aims will
be accomplished using newly developed animal models, electrophysiology in native isolated cells and intact
tissues, and advanced optical imaging in isolated tissue and whole animals.
Dr. Nicholas Klug has an ideal training history in vascular physiology, an exceptional environment in the
laboratory of Dr. Mark Nelson, and a high potential as an independent, NIH funded vascular researcher.
Dedicated mentoring from the mentoring committee of Dr. Mark Nelson and Dr. Andy Shih (University of
Washington) will provide Dr. Klug with new and expanded knowledge and tools in vascular physiology, optical
imaging approaches, and ion channel function and provide detailed professional guidance to distinguish himself
as an independent investigator. Collaboration with Dr. Christer Betsholtz and Dr. Yangguang Ou will provide new
models and tools to properly address the role of capillary sensing/signaling and adenosine release in vivo.
Ultimately, the K01 Award provides substantial structure and support which will place Dr. Klug in a strong position
for continuous R01-level support, his research will expand our understanding of the sensing and signaling
properties of capillaries within the central nervous system."
10828234,"1 The 15th International Conference on Brain Energy Metabolism (ICBEM): Brain Bioenergetics in Aging
 2 - Neurovascular and Neurometabolic Coupling and Fuels” will be held September 17-21, 2024 in Ljubljana,
 3 Slovenia. Alterations in energy metabolism at the cellular and subcellular level and in neurovascular and
 4 neurometabolic coupling are key aspects of brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease, however, little is known
 5 regarding the mechanisms and interactions between poorly understood, yet critical aspects of energy
 6 metabolism. The goal of 15th ICBEM is to bring together leading experts in emerging techniques and
 7 researchers in clinical and basic neuroscience, and radiology who would not otherwise meet. ICBEM 2024 will
 8 serve as a driving force for cutting-edge discussions, formulation of incisive experiments, and for fostering
 9 collaborations to open novel areas of exploration of energy metabolism that underlie and contribute to aging-
10 related diseases. To enhance interaction, the conference is limited to ~118 attendees and opens with a
11 Keynote talk, by Alzheimer’s Association Lifetime achievement award recipient, Agneta Nordberg. Dr.
12 Nordberg will address advanced imaging and biomarker identification to monitor compromised brain energy
13 metabolism in Alzheimer’s patients. The conference is organized into two special sessions and 8 scientific
14 sessions with 29 session speakers of which 19 (66%) are women, 14 (48%) are early career investigators and
15 3 (10%) are under-represented investigators from the US. The conference brings together experts as well as
16 students and postdocs in a highly interactive forum with 33% of meeting time allocated for discussion of
17 emerging concepts related to coordination of neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling and associated in
18 vivo imaging modalities, metabolic regulation of cognition, astrocyte, microglial and neuronal metabolism, and
19 substrate transport and trafficking in healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease; and mechanisms of resilience to
20 metabolic insult. Many of the invited speakers work with Alzheimer’s disease patients or animal models, brain
21 aging or neurodegeneration with over half of the speakers working specifically in the area of Alzheimer’s
22 disease. A key concept is that energy metabolism is not just a permissive factor but is a driver of changes in
23 brain function associated with age-associated disease. Trainee presentations are key aspects of the meeting
24 and bring a new generation of scientists into our community to foster their maturation by inclusion as speakers
25 and session co-chairs. In addition to talks by early career investigators, 20 students/postdocs will be awarded
26 travel stipends based on competitive ranking of abstracts, and the top 9, selected by an evaluation committee
27 will present short talks. This conference will provide an outstanding venue for cross-disciplinary interactions,
28 i.e., between basic neuroscientists, clinicians, and neuroimaging scientists. Formal talks and informal
29 discussions are always highlights of this unique conference series that fosters new collaborations and scientific
30 interactions to address emerging issues."
10892182,"ABSTRACT – TRAINING CORE 
Science and health related research is more promising today than ever before. One can scarcely keep up with 
all the latest discoveries in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. New medical 
discoveries and health care reforms are emerging at a pace that far exceeds our current capacity to translate 
new tests and treatments into an ever-evolving clinical environment. As such, while training in the skills 
required for bench to bedside translation remains fundamental, there is also a compelling need to expand the 
pool of scientists capable of performing cross-disciplinary areas such as the systems biology, epidemiology/ 
health services and implementation research necessary to translate scientific discoveries into day-to-day 
clinical practice. The objectives of the University of Michigan Kidney, Urology and Hematology Research 
Training Network (UM KUHR) TL1 are to provide early-stage, academically inclined scientists and 
physicians with the requisite skills and experience across the translational research spectrum to 
bridge the persistent gaps between basic scientific discovery, clinical practice, and population health. 
The proposed training program consists of two principal components: 1) Didactic course work with 
concentrations in basic science, bioinformatics, clinical trials, epidemiology, health services research or 
implementation science; and 2) Concurrent applied in-depth research experience in the conception, execution, 
and dissemination of a well-designed research project. In order to adapt to the needs of the healthcare 
marketplace, the program will have broad criteria to matriculate both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who 
are pursing or have either an MD and/or PhD. Guided by their program faculty preceptor, trainees will be 
instructed in the philosophy, ethics, and theory behind research, as well as methodological techniques derived 
from a broad array of basic, clinical, and public health sciences. The Programs Leads will undertake 
administration of this program while progress will be monitored continuously by Program Faculty Preceptors, 
and quarterly by the Selection and Mentoring Committee. Trainees will be expected to present their work to 
the Selection and Mentoring Committee, at local and national scientific conferences and the UM KUHR Annual 
Regional Research Retreat. By the end of the training program, trainees will have completed both the 
requirements for an advanced research degree and a mentored research project, including publication of their 
findings in the peer-reviewed literature. Based on our past records, graduates of our institution’s training 
programs are well-positioned to establish a longitudinal research agenda and to pursue an independent 
research career in academic medicine."
10892944,"Abstract 
Traditional training in kidney, urologic or hematologic (KUH) research equips the basic, translational 
and clinical investigator with specific knowledge and technical skills that are particular to each of these 
individual disciplines. During their careers, however, investigators can find it challenging to cross boundaries 
between their specific areas of expertise to address important questions in overlapping KUH disciplines. These 
“leaps” have to be encouraged and taught, as it is through these interdisciplinary interactions and 
collaborations that we will advance KUH research and achieve the scientific discoveries needed to improve the 
care and quality of life of people with KUH diseases. 
The training program that we propose in this U2C/TL1 application aims to prepare the next generation 
of KUH investigators with the interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mindset that will allow them to naturally 
engage and seek interdisciplinary collaborations. To achieve this goal, we will harness the experience and 
excellence in research and training of four of the leading medical schools in the New York City (NYC) 
metropolitan region, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the 
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, 
to establish the “New York Consortium for Interdisciplinary Training in Kidney, Urological and Hematological 
Research” (NYC Train KUHR)” (pronounced “NYC Train cure”). The Training Core will be developed around 
the strong supporting system provided by the other NYC Train KUHR Cores: the Networking Core, the 
Professional Development Core and the Administrative Core. 
The Training Core will promote interdisciplinary thinking and support development of technical skills to 
facilitate engagement in collaborations and team science. The proposed program builds on our experience 
from three existing, successful nephrology T32 grants, an R25 grant, a T35 grant and an NIH O’Brien Center in 
Urology. It also builds on the combined research and training strengths of over 100 preceptors from across the 
four institutions that bring to the program their expertise in KUH research and complementary areas, including 
genomics, developmental biology, epidemiology, neuroscience, bioengineering and clinical trials across the 
lifespan. At its full capacity, the program will train 9 pre-doctoral and 16 post-doctoral fellows across the four 
institutions. The training program will use independent development plans and thesis and scholarship oversight 
committees to individualize trainee experiences. Emphasis will be placed on experiential mentored research 
experiences as well as professional development activities to prepare the trainees for a research career in 
academic medicine. The knowledge and skills learned from this training program and the other educational and

Malaria is an important cause of illness and death worldwide, with most of these deaths resulting from
Plasmodium falciparum infection. Successful completion of the P. falciparum life cycle and infection of a
new human host requires transmission. During the asexual blood stage in human red blood cells, a small
population of parasites differentiates into transmission forms known as gametocytes. These gametocytes
can complete the sexual stage of the parasite life cycle following ingestion by a mosquito. Gametocyte
maturation in human red blood cells occurs over 10-12 days and is associated with major changes in
cellular morphology and rigidity. A newly discovered protein PfBLEB (for Baso-Lateral Expansion Boundary)
is essential for mature gametocyte formation. In asexual parasites, PfBLEB is part of the basal complex, a
ring-like multi-protein complex at the leading edge of the inner membrane complex. While PfBLEB is
dispensable for both asexual replication and gametocyte commitment, it is essential for gametocyte
development. PfBLEB-knockdown or knockout gametocytes arrest during maturation and are non-
transmissible. Furthermore, the PfBLEB-deficient gametocytes have gross morphologic changes with
defects in major cytoskeletal features of the maturing transmission-stage parasite, including the inner
membrane complex and subpellicular microtubules.
In gametocytes with normal PfBLEB expression, PfBLEB defines a new subcellular compartment within the
parasite, demarcating the regions of the parasite plasma membrane that are devoid of the underlying inner
membrane complex. The PfBLEB-compartment is essential for gametocyte development, but the function
and protein constituents of this newly discovered subcellular compartment remain unknown. The goal of the
current application is to define and genetically evaluate the protein components of the PfBLEB compartment
and to understand the functional defects in PfBLEB-deficient gametocytes. The first aim will utilize proximity
labeling and reverse genetics to explore the PfBLEB-containing compartment. The second aim will utilize
multiple imaging and microfabrication techniques to gain a functional understanding of what processes are
abnormal in PfBLEB-deficient gametocytes. Together, the proposed studies will add a new layer to our
molecular understanding of gametocyte development in P. falciparum."

There is a strong rationale to prioritize tobacco control policy interventions in communities at high risk for
tobacco product exposure, lower access to pharmacies, and associated health disparities. Policy efforts to
increase access to NRT by requiring its sale and signage in community retailers could address multiple threats
to public health. To date, there have been limited efforts to increase NRT availability in the tobacco retail
environment. Growing out of the recognition that convenience stores sell most tobacco products but little NRT,
in 2022 NJ became the first U.S. state to require tobacco retailers to sell NRT. While a law requiring NRT at
the point of sale holds promise to further reduce tobacco use, the extent to which this new law could have a
positive equity impact is unknown. This exploratory R21 project uses a mixed methods approach to
understand the implementation and short-term impact of a new statewide NRT law, seeking to expand the
evidence base with a focus on racial/ethnic groups in the context of a diverse tobacco environment.
Specifically, we will: 1) determine whether NRT compliance varies by neighborhood characteristics using store
audits and conducting spatial analyses to examine associations between compliance and neighborhood
demographics and tobacco retailer density, and 2) explore short-term indicators of the NRT law’s impact by
examining trends in NRT product sales and NJ Quitline calls between 2021 and 2023. The relevance of the
proposed research to public health is its ability to improve existing and future NRT policies in ways that could
promote health equity and reduce tobacco-related disparities."

10793552,"Access to kidney transplantation as a cure for end-stage renal disease is severely limited by donor organ
shortage. Exacerbating this shortage is a major knowledge gap of key factors shaping early kidney allograft
inflammation, which in turn impact subsequent alloimmunity. Our preliminary studies suggest that donor kidney
resident macrophages brought to the recipient by the transplanted kidney play a major role in mediating early
kidney allograft inflammation. Specifically, during the immediate post-transplant period, these donor kidney
resident macrophages proliferate robustly and increase in numbers, and promote prompt graft infiltration of
recipient macrophages. Graft-infiltrating macrophages in turn produce a significant amount of the chemokine
CCL8, which is associated with acute rejection of the transplanted kidney. Therapeutically, depletion of donor
kidney resident macrophages prior to kidney transplantation results in a significant reduction of influx of recipient
macrophages as well as their production of CCL8. This intervention results in superior function of the
transplanted kidney even in setting of prolonged cold ischemia time, and promotes immunosuppression-free
long-term allograft survival. These observations led us to hypothesize that donor kidney resident macrophages
critically orchestrate early graft inflammation via recruitment and activation of recipient macrophages which then
promotes transplant alloimmunity in a CCL8-dependent manner. Thus, a potential therapeutic opportunity here
is to block donor kidney resident macrophages and/or CCL8 signaling to inhibit early graft inflammation and to
facilitate transplant tolerance. In this new R01 application, we propose two specific aims that will: 1) determine
mechanisms by which donor kidney resident macrophages promote early allograft inflammation. This aim will
also test the efficacy of targeting these mechanisms to reduce graft inflammation and to expand utilization of
donor kidneys with prolonged cold ischemia time; 2) determine mechanisms by which donor kidney resident
macrophages promote alloimmunity. This aim will also test the efficacy of targeting these mechanisms to inhibit
alloimmunity and to facilitate clinically-feasible transplant tolerance induction. Our experienced team of
investigators include the PI Dr. Luo, an expert in transplant immunobiology who will direct all immunological
studies in murine kidney transplant models, and the co-I Dr. Shen, an expert in live tissue imaging who will direct
all imaging studies of donor kidney resident macrophages interacting with graft-infiltrating recipient
macrophages. Our ultimate goal is to define the role of donor kidney resident macrophages in promoting early
kidney allograft inflammation and kidney transplant alloimmunity, and to design clinically feasible therapies
targeting this cell population for enhancing short-term kidney allograft function and long-term kidney allograft
survival."

Malaria remains an important public health issue. The oocyst stage is the most under-studied
stage of the malaria parasite due to technical difficulties in isolating and staining these parasites
and the lack of robust in vitro cultures. This is the expansion phase of the parasite in the mosquito
host yet we have only a rudimentary understanding of the magnitude of this expansion: To date,
only two studies have attempted to quantify the number of sporozoites in single oocysts, likely
due to the time-consuming nature of manual counting. To overcome this and perform more
robust quantification, we will develop methods to accurately quantify sporozoites in single
oocysts using super-resolution imaging and deep-learning based image processing pipelines.
The methodology will be validated by manual quantification. Furthermore, we will use the method
to investigate mosquito species-specific differences in the magnitude of oocyst maturation using
different parasite isolates in Asian and African mosquito vectors. This method can be further
developed to classify oocyst microstructures and enable in-depth studies of stage specific gene
and protein expression over the entire developmental cycle of the oocyst in combination with in
situ -omics methodologies. It is also anticipated that an accurate assessment of the magnitude
of oocyst maturation will improve our understanding of the quantitative dynamics of parasite
transmission from mosquito to mammalian host."
10790121,"7. Project summary. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) play a pivotal role in regulating a plethora of biological
processes and their misregulations have been associated with a variety of diseases. Modern proteomic tools
enabled over 600,000 PPIs to be identified as potential targets, which can be validated at an incredible pace by
programmable gene-editing point-mutations in mammalian cells. Given these technological advances, the
modulation of intra- and extracellular PPIs has emerged as one of the most exciting strategies towards next-
generation therapeutics. Yet, the development of PPIs inhibitors is lagging far behind the other successful drug
modalities (antibodies and small molecules) due to the challenges associated with the large, shallow, often
dynamic, and water-exposed binding interfaces. Therefore, we propose to study novel PPI inhibitors modalities
via -hairpin peptides featuring large binding-surface areas inspired by the long non-canonical loops forming
antibody paratopes. Our goals are to preserve the high-affinity and binding specificity of antibodies by mimicking
the binding-competent conformation of CDR-H3 loops sequence to disrupt PPIs. This research proposes to
exploit -hairpin scaffolds synthesized in our lab to recreate antibody loops of conceptually any sequence, length,
and conformational plasticity (aim 1). As a proof-of-concept (PoC), a structure-guided approach from X-ray
crystal structures of protein–antibody drug complexes will be followed to rationally design PPI inhibitors of the
programmed cell death 1 (PD1) immunoreceptor and its ligand 1 (PDL1). Indeed, the PD1/PDL1 interaction
inhibits T-cell effector function in a process known as tumor immune evasion, and its blockade has proven to be
an effective strategy to restore T-cell proliferation in different cancer-types. To validate our PoC, covalent
inhibitors will be designed by crafting electrophilic warheads at specific loop positions of the most potent -hairpin
binders (aim 2). Overall, our strategy combines the synthesis of -hairpins bearing strained loops (N > 12-
residues) that closely mimic the large binding contacts of antibodies CDR-H3 loops to create high-affinity
inhibitors with the positioning of electrophilic warheads for covalent binding at the PPI interface. A series of novel
electrophilic warheads will be evaluated to target a distinctive lysine residue (K131) located at the center of PD1
binding epitope. A structure–activity optimization will also be achieved by alanine-scanning to validate the most
promising cell-penetrating hairpin peptides in living cells (PBMCs). This strategy of CDR-H3 mimicry into
covalent -hairpins could potentially be a game-changer by revisiting peptide drugs that are not able to bind
tightly and selectively to extra- and/or intracellular proteins and often abandoned during preclinical studies due
to a lack of in vivo activity. As a result, a large number of protein targets associated with various diseases could
become druggable and offer new possibilities in the space of PPI inhibitors for drug discovery."

Following the global roll-out of rotavirus vaccines, attention is now focusing on vaccination strategies against
norovirus, the next leading cause of viral gastroenteritis. Several norovirus vaccine candidates are in the pipeline,
including an oral GI.1/GII.4 vaccine that will soon be tested in lactating women. The main goal of this vaccination
strategy is to elicit norovirus-specific antibodies in breastmilk. However, very little is currently known about
norovirus immunity in breastmilk. Epidemiologic studies do not consistently find breastfeeding to protect against
norovirus. Also, no prior studies have fully characterized norovirus-specific antibodies in lactating women with
natural norovirus infections to understand what might be attainable with postpartum vaccines. A better
understanding of maternal immunity and how it protects infants against norovirus infections could guide novel
postpartum vaccination strategies. In addition, pediatric vaccines are being developed. A parenteral GI.1/GII.4
norovirus vaccine is undergoing testing in children after encouraging Phase IIb results in adults. However,
vaccine-elicited immunity in naïve infants may differ from that in adults, who have experienced multiple prior
infections. For example, our group demonstrated that the dominant response to the parenteral GI.1/GII.4 vaccine
in adults was boosting from a previous GII.4 infection. Further, we have demonstrated that natural norovirus
infections in young children elicit a narrow antibody response—typically to the infecting genotype only—
suggesting that an effective pediatric vaccine would need to include multiple norovirus genotypes. These
differences in the immune response in adults vs. children suggest that understanding the unique immune stage
of the infant is necessary to develop an effective pediatric vaccine. This project connects a robust field site with
state-of-the-art immunological approaches to inform norovirus vaccination strategies to benefit children. We will
enroll 120 Guatemalan breastfed infants with acute norovirus gastroenteritis and their mothers to determine if
there is an association between norovirus-specific antibodies in breastmilk and the duration of norovirus
infections in infants. Next, we will characterize and compare humoral immunity to norovirus in infants and
mothers infected with the same norovirus strain. Finally, we will characterize the kinetics and breadth of
norovirus-specific antibodies in breastmilk in lactating women with norovirus infections. We hypothesize that a)
infants receiving breastmilk with higher levels of genotype-specific norovirus antibodies will have shorter
norovirus infections as compared to infants receiving lower levels of these antibodies, b) infants will mount narrow
antibody responses to norovirus as compared to (previously exposed) adults, and c) in lactating women with
norovirus infections, norovirus-specific antibody responses in breastmilk will be broad and short-lived, similar to
antibody responses to norovirus in another mucosal fluid, saliva. This project responds to the pressing need to
inform norovirus vaccination strategies to benefit children, while adding to our basic understanding of immune
protection at the maternal-child interface."

The objective of this proposal is to elucidate how folic acid prevents neural tube defects on the cellular and
molecular level, and to develop a platform to functionally validate and test the FA responsiveness of human NTD
candidate genes. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common congenital abnormality, affecting 6
in 10,000 pregnancies in the United States. Failure to close the neural tube, the precursor to the brain and spinal
cord, is complex disorder resulting from genetic and environmental stressors. Because multiple factors play into
the development of this disorder, it is critical to understand how environmental factors interact with genetics in
the etiology of NTDs. While population-wide folic acid (FA) fortification has reduced the overall NTD rate by 28%
in the US, it remains unclear how folic acid prevents NTDs. My proposal aims to address two hypotheses about
folic acid and neural tube defects. First, I hypothesize that FA contributes to NTD prevention by acting at the cell
movement level as well as inducing transcriptional cascades to compensate for the dysregulated genes. To
uncover whether FA can rescue NT closure by acting at the cellular or molecular level, I will characterize the
cellular movements and transcriptional profiles for the Alx1 mutant mouse model supplemented with FA. The
Alx1 knockout model results in NTDs in 100% of mutant embryos, however prenatal FA supplementation can
reduce the incidence to 13%. The Alx1 mutant is a tractable model to dissect the contribution of FA fortification
to restoring NT closure because NTDs in this model result from dysregulation of a transcription factor and
abnormal cellular movements. We will use imaging-based techniques to characterize cell morphogenesis
processes and scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq to identify FA-induced gene expression in the Alx1-null
background. Results from these complimentary studies will inform if FA acts by supporting cellular movements,
inducing transcriptional activity, or a combination. Second, I hypothesize that testing more gene mutations for
FA responsiveness will reveal patterns of gene types that benefit from FA fortification as a prevention strategy.
To address this hypothesis, I will develop a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) entitled
The What, the Why, and the How of neural tube defects. The scientific aim of this course will be to functionally
validate candidate human NTD genes of unknown significance in NT closure in chick embryos and test the folic
acid responsiveness. The societal aim of the CURE is to increase the number of relevant research opportunities
for undergraduates while meeting a public health need to screen candidate genes and communicate back to
clinicians and families. I expect screening more candidate genes for NTDs and FA responsiveness will reveal
new high-risk genes and increase our predictive power over the types of dysregulated genes likely responsive
to FA supplementation. Together, the results from this proposal will be important to bolster our understanding of
how FA can prevent NTDs and improve risk assessment of preventative strategies against neural tube defects."

Treatment outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have continued to lag behind outcomes
reported for other hematological malignancies like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in part because of the
relatively slow development of immunotherapy (including immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICI]) compared with ALL.
However, translation of currently available immunotherapies to AML treatment has been challenging, and novel
AML-targeting drugs with immune-stimulating activity are greatly needed. The cGAS-STING signaling is a major
pathway that promotes an extrinsic type I Interferon (IFN-I) response, which potently primes T cells in “immune-
cold” cancers, including AML. My laboratory has been active in defining the function of protein arginine
methyltransferases (PRMTs) in leukemia. Herein, our preliminary studies on the basis of primary AML cells as
well as murine AML models reveal an anti-AML immune activation seen after inhibition of PRMT9, a most
recently defined PRMT. Specifically, PRMT9 inhibition stimulated leukemia-intrinsic cGAS, as evidenced by
cGAMP (an immunotransmitter) production, and induced a leukemia-eliminating IFN-I response in murine AML-
microenvironment (ME). When combined with an ICI (PD1 inhibitor), the in-house PRMT9 inhibitor LD2
eradicated AML in animal models. Thus, we hypothesize that PRMT9 activity allows AML cells to evade immune
surveillance by repressing cGAS-STING activity in the ME, and that LD2, alone or combined with an ICI (PD1
inhibitor), elicits T cell activity to eliminate AML cells. Extracellular cGAMP, which is hydrolyzed by ENPP1, and
STING activation in host immune cells, are reportedly essential for immunity. Thus, in Aim 1, using two AML
transplant models, we will determine whether downregulating cGAMP (via either ENPP1-overexpression or
cGAS-knockout (KO) in AML cells) or STING-KO in the immune cell compartment of recipient mice would reverse
PRMT9 inhibition-induced AML regression. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms underlying cancer-
intrinsic cGAS activation seen after PRMT9 inhibition. Specifically, we will define PRMT9 targets that when
unmethylated underlie cGAS activation. In Aim 3, we will assess anti-AML activity of LD2 alone or combined with
a PD1 inhibitor, using AML mouse models. Moreover, to define potential shifts in immune cell types/states after
PRMT9 inhibition, we will perform single-cell transcriptome analysis on AML PDX cells from humanized mouse
treated with LD2 or the combination. We are the first to identify PRMT9 as a druggable immune activation target
against cancer. If successful, this work would support combining a PRMT9 inhibitor with ICIs as a therapy for
AML, in which single ICI therapy has very limited effects."

The COVID-19 pandemic accentuated the inextricable link between worker and patient safety. Yet most
hospitals have separate initiatives for either patient or worker safety. A case in point is safe patient handling
and mobility (SPHM), where most programs are implemented by Employee Health and Safety without
coordination with other quality or patient safety departments. This disconnect is significant because adverse
and costly outcomes such as patient falls or workers’ patient-assist injuries have overlapping risk factors that
must be addressed together. One promising response is through a program that integrates stakeholders,
including influential front-line workers, to address overlapping risk factors for patient falls and patient-assist
injuries. Our preliminary research pre-tested an integrated safety program at a rural hospital in Oregon that
demonstrated 12-month effectiveness in improving leading indicators and reduction of patient-assist injury
rates. The program had four main components: 1) the involvement of patient and worker safety stakeholders;
2) the innovative application of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify peer-recognized safety leaders
instead of self- or supervisor-nominated workers who may not have the influence required to effect change; 3)
training stakeholders on safety leadership, and 4) implementation of quality improvement (QI) cycles to reduce
safety barriers. Based on these promising results, we plan to build a new scalable intervention to be tested in a
rigorous multi-hospital trial. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in
six rural hospitals to evaluate the effectiveness and process of a safety program titled Safety Integration
Stakeholders (SAINTS). We will test the central hypothesis that relative to usual practice controls, the three
hospitals randomly assigned to the SAINTS program will have reduced risk factors for patient falls and patient-
assist injuries 12 months after the end of the program. The rationale is that the SAINTS program will positively
impact outcomes by identifying and training key players on strategies to boost environmental, administrative,
and educational precautions relevant to SPHM. We propose two aims: Aim 1: Determine the SAINTS'
effectiveness in reducing overlapping risk factors for patient falls and patient-assist injuries. Effectiveness will
be determined by surveying in-patient unit workers on risk factors for patient-assist injuries and patient falls at
baseline, six months after program initiation, and 12 months after the end of implementation (primary
endpoint). The trial is powered to detect changes in leading indicators, but we will also examine lagging effects
on the incidence rates of patient falls, patient-assist injuries, entries in reporting systems, and staff turnover.
Aim 2: Identify safety precaution measures produced by the SAINTS program. Given the semi-structured
design, we will conduct a multi-method process evaluation to identify the extent to which the program was
delivered as planned and if it led to the adoption of preventative measures."

Our goal is to determine the connection among genes, brain structure and neuropsychiatric disorders. These
disorders are common and increasing in incidence worldwide. Lower costs of both genotyping and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition have provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand how genetic
factors shape brain morphology. Given that structural brain measures may reflect intermediate phenotypes of
neuropsychiatric disorders on the pathway between genotypes and clinical phenotypes. These findings in turn
may help us better understand the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Data released by UK Biobank
and ABCD Study (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) containing individual-level genotypes and
rich phenotype variables allow genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in brain imaging phenotypes to
identify genetic variants associated with brain morphology. Our study and work from other groups in brain
imaging GWAS have confirmed that many identified genes are related to neurodevelopmental processes. The
first objective in the current study is to uncover genetic variants associated with brain imaging phenotypes (Aim
1). Our second objective is to test genetic heterogeneity between the sexes in association with brain
morphology and to include the X chromosome in the analysis (Aim 2). Our third objective is to determine the
impact of neuropsychiatric genetic risks on the brain (Aim 3). Previously we produced the genetic atlases of
the human cortex based on MRI data of twins using fuzzy clustering. Our most recent work demonstrated the
value of using the atlases to determine genetic variants influencing brain structure. In this proposal, we will
leverage an increased sample size with both MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The larger
sample increases power for discovering and replicating SNPs associated with individual brain structures and
will enable us to examine genetic heterogeneity between the sexes. Many GWAS loci are located in non-
coding genomic regions thus it is hard to have functional interpretation of GWAS findings. We will use new
methods for SNP-to-gene mapping to tackle this daunting challenge. We will also characterize pleiotropy
among multiple brain regions. This will provide insight into shared and distinct genetic influences among brain
regions, given that different brain regions have previously been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (Aim
1). Second, we will include the X chromosome in the association analysis with brain structure and determine X-
linked dosage compensation (Aim 2). Third, building on improved genetic knowledge of the brain, we will
determine its genetic relationship with neuropsychiatric disorders. We will estimate effects of neuropsychiatric
genetic risks on brain structure and how the disorders are mediated by brain structure. (Aim 3). This current
project has potential to significantly increase our understanding of the genetic basis of the human brain, to
determine shared genetic influences on brain structure and neuropsychiatric disorders, and ultimately to
advance therapeutic development for neuropsychiatric disorders."

Epidemiological studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between dental disease and systemic
conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), with the chronic inflammatory state caused by
dental infections attributed as a plausible contributing factor to systemic disease pathogenesis. Despite research
progress, the results of these studies are controversial. Among the hindering factors impeding progress in the
field is the lack of integrated dental, medical, and genomic data thereby leaving much to be learned about the
host biological mechanisms contributing to dental and systemic disease relationships. In previous studies, we
have shown the importance of combining genetic and epidemiological association analysis to advance
knowledge on dental and systemic disease relationships. Further, we’ve shown that variation in dental-disease
associated loci were significantly associated with increased risk for >30 systemic disease phecodes. In this
application, we will test the hypothesis that a potential shared genetic etiology may contribute to the
interconnectedness between dental and systemic disease and propose a large-scale study with integrated
participant data for more conclusive findings and to move the field forward. We will leverage and integrate high-
quality clinical (dental and medical), genomic, and demographic data available from >200,000 participants in the
All of Us Research Program to identify host factors most likely contributing to a combined phenotype of dental +
systemic disease. We will identify gene variants associated with each combined phenotype and determine
whether polygenic risk can increase risk to a combined phentoype. This study represents a major advance in
the field by creating a roadmap for integrating clinical and genomic data from a large and diverse population to
elucidate the contributions of host predisposing factors to dental + systemic disease phenotypes. Data generated
through this proposal will be available in the All of Us Researcher Workbench. This proposal addresses NIDCR’s

Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA structures that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and
maintain genomic stability. Maintenance of adequate telomere length is thus essential for cellular
immortalization and tumorigenesis. While most human cancers achieve this through telomerase
activation, ~ 5% - 10% of them adopt a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening
of telomeres (ALT) to elongate their telomeres. Although the ALT-driven cancers are generally aggressive
with poor prognosis, there are currently no targeted therapies. In human cancers, ALT is strongly
associated with genetic alterations that affect histone H3.3 chaperone ATRX-DAXX complex. We and
others previously demonstrated that the ATRX-DAXX complex is essential for normal telomere
maintenance. We showed that ATRX or DAXX loss, while promoting tumorigenesis by potentiating the
ALT-driven immortalization, also creates a persistent telomere replication dysfunction. We therefore
hypothesize that ALT-immortalized cancers must have adopted special mechanism(s) to offset their
innate telomere DNA replication defects, and thus would be selectively vulnerable to the inhibition of
those compensatory pathways. By combining our unique isogenic ALT-immortalization model system
and customized domain-focused CRISPR screen platform, we have uncovered a list of selective
molecular vulnerabilities including histone lysine demethylase KDM2A for ALT-dependent cells. We
demonstrate that KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation is required for ALT-directed telomere
maintenance. Inactivation of KDM2A impairs ALT-specific multitelomere cluster dissolution, leading to
chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. The objectives of this proposal are to delineate the
molecular mechanism underlying ALT-directed telomere maintenance and to identify mechanism-based
therapeutic targets against ALT-driven human cancers. To meet those goals, we will pursue the following
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular functions of KDM2A in ALT-directed
telomere maintenance. In Aim 2, we will define the potential adverse effects and off-tumor toxicities of
future KDM2A-targeted therapies. In Aim 3, we will establish an in vivo platform to explore the synthetic-
lethal interactions of ALT-driven ATRX-mutant malignant gliomas. Completion of the proposed studies
will uncover the molecular mechanisms and critical dependencies underlying ALT-directed telomere
maintenance and thus drive the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutics against ALT-
dependent cancers including the ATRX mutant malignant gliomas."

Tumors are known to induce the formation of unique microenvironments in distant organs that
facilitate seeding, survival, and growth of metastatic nodules. These sites, known as pre-
metastatic niches, emerge as a response to the combined systemic effects of tumor-derived
factors and shed extracellular vesicles. Aside from premetastatic niches, distant alterations in
otherwise normal tissues of cancer-bearing subjects have not been identified. While evaluating
the systemic vasculature of tumor-bearing mice, we serendipitously found that presence of
certain types of carcinomas implanted subcutaneously have a deleterious effect on intestinal
lymphatics and blood vessels. This surprising finding was directly correlated with severe weight
loss and progressive reduction of skeletal muscle mass, a condition known as cachexia.
Importantly, in cancer patients, cachexia has a meaningful negative impact in their ability to
respond and recover from therapy and thus identification of individuals at risk and effective
treatments to reverse this condition are imperative. Blocking cachexia offers not only a
significant improvement in the quality of life for these patients, but it also improves tolerance
and response to cancer treatment, with measurable increase in survival rates. Although the
clinical consequences of cachexia and its positive response to therapy are well known, read-
outs for early diagnosis and effective treatment remain challenging. Our preliminary findings
uncovered that tumors with high circulating levels of specific inflammatory cytokines induced
vascular and lymphatic barrier dysfunction in the intestine. In particular, the capillaries and
central lymphatic lacteal of intestinal villi showed prolonged and exacerbated levels of
VEGFR2/3 signaling, TAK1 phosphorylation and other alterations that yield compromised
junctional complexes. In turn, we documented changes in food absorption despite unaltered
levels of food consumption and associated weight loss. Collectively, the findings indicate that
cancer-induced alterations in the vasculo-lymphatic compartment of intestinal villi contribute
to, and perhaps trigger, the development of cachexia by affecting their ability to absorb lipids.
The goal of this project is to determine whether deficiencies in lymphatic and vascular
endothelium are a significant underlying cause of cancer-induced cachexia that can be targeted
to reverse the condition. Our two progued approach will delve into further understanding of
the underlying molecular mechanisms while pursuing pre-clinical trials in mouse models to test
therapeutic avenues aimed at correcting the vascular deficiencies. The contribution of the
vasculature as an important culprit in cachexia has not been recognized and it could be
transformative as it may offer an unprecedented opportunity for intervention at early stages by
focusing on rewiring endothelial barrier and blocking this devastating condition."

In day-to-day life, we often flexibly select actions based on what we anticipate the outcomes will be. Stress can
lead to failures in flexible goal seeking in rodents and humans alike, causing organisms to defer to familiar,
routinized behaviors that can contribute to compulsions, over-eating, or other health concerns.
 To obtain desired outcomes, we often must encode new information about these outcomes (how to get them,
what their value is, etc.), and then retrieve those memories later to execute action strategies. The ventrolateral
orbitofrontal cortex (VLO) is necessary for rodents to encode and retrieve new memories regarding optimal action
strategies. Moreover, basolateral amygdala-to-VLO inputs are necessary for memory encoding, and ventral
hippocampal-to-VLO projections are necessary for memories to be durable and long-lasting. Further, VLO
neurons that are active during memory encoding are necessary for memory retrieval, suggesting that specific
VLO neurons form stable memory traces for new action strategies. This proposal will focus on this neuron
population, operationally referred to as “memory trace” neurons.
 The structural plasticity of deep-layer VLO neurons, which receive subcortical inputs, appears necessary for
new action memory formation. Further, specific protein activities controlling the structural plasticity of
postsynaptic compartments are also necessary. It is sensible to imagine that specific inputs to, and protein
activities within, memory trace neurons are essential for new action memory formation. Our aims are:
 Aim 1: Determine how VLO neurons form cohesive memory traces. We will use a tool termed “trapping”
to gain genetic access to specific memory trace cells in the VLO. We will first stimulate them following training
conditions that typically induce inflexible, habit-based responding. We hypothesize that their stimulation will
override habit-like behavior, owing to action memory retrieval. We will then combine TRAP and multiplexed
chemogenetic strategies to identify subcortical inputs necessary for memory traces to form.
 Aim 2: Identify the anatomical and developmental determinants of learning-related dendritic spine
plasticity in the VLO. We will next combine TRAP and chemogenetic strategies to test the hypothesis that
amygdalar or hippocampal neuron activity is necessary for learning-related dendritic spine plasticity on VLO
neurons that form action memory traces. Next, we hypothesize that chronic developmental social isolation, which
obstructs action flexibility, also obstructs learning-related spine plasticity, while delayed isolation will not.
 Aim 3: Determine whether action flexibility involves specific protein activities. Finally, we will use
inducible, site-selective viral-mediated gene transfer to selectively reduce Rho-kinase (ROCK2) in memory trace
VLO neurons. We anticipate that suppressing ROCK2 will enrich the capacity for action flexibility and override
habit-like behavior. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that ROCK2 activity is dynamically tuned with new
learning, its suppression triggered by concurrent excitatory plasticity in the amygdala or hippocampus."
10803265,"Project Summary: Antisocial behaviors like lying, stealing, reactive aggression, and sexually inappropriate
behaviors are common in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and can be severe, leading
some patients to be charged with crimes, lose substantial amounts of money, or irrevocably damage social
relationships. Despite how problematic these symptoms are, the behavioral phenotype for antisocial behaviors
in bvFTD has yet to be clearly defined and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Work in non-
diseased and psychiatric populations suggests that antisocial behaviors might be differentiated into factors for
aggressive vs. rule-breaking behaviors with different underlying mechanisms. In preliminary data, we
developed a novel informant-based questionnaire called the social behavior questionnaire (SBQ) to measure
antisocial behavior in bvFTD and also found distinct factors for aggressive vs. rule breaking behaviors. In Aim
1 we will provide further evidence to support distinct antisocial behavioral phenotypes for aggressive vs. rule-
breaking behaviors in bvFTD by administering an established measure of aggression and rule-breaking
validated in non-patient populations and showing convergent validity between this established measure and
our novel, bvFTD-specific measure. In Aim 2 we will investigate the neural correlates for aggression and rule-
breaking in bvFTD. Patterns of brain atrophy in bvFTD are heterogeneous between patients but preferentially
affect two intrinsic functional connectivity networks within the brain: the salience network (SN) and the
semantic appraisal network (SAN). We have developed a novel method called atrophy network mapping to
localize neurological symptoms to a brain network rather than to a specific brain region. In preliminary data
using atrophy network mapping we found that aggressive behaviors in bvFTD localized to the SAN and rule-
breaking behaviors localized to the SN, hypotheses we will test in Aim 2. bvFTD is characterized by early and
prominent changes to socioemotional processes, a neuropsychological pattern of impairment that is also seen
in other patients with antisocial behavior even without executive dysfunction. Our preliminary data suggests
that different socioemotional impairments relate to different types of antisocial behaviors in bvFTD, with
aggressive behaviors relating to impaired empathic concern and rule-breaking behaviors relating to impaired
perspective taking, hypotheses we will test in aim 3. Determining whether aggressive and nonaggressive
behaviors are dissociable at the behavioral, neural, or decision-making levels would have a potential impact on
clinical care, helping in early diagnosis, prognosis, and counseling. Study results would also have an impact
on guiding future research efforts to prevent or treat antisocial behaviors in bvFTD."

Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related illnesses are severe, debilitating, and
often fatal. Cognitive impairments in psychosis are among the leading predictors of disability and poor quality
of life; despite this, there are no first line interventions to target these symptoms. Neuroimaging correlates of
cognitive impairment in psychosis have been identified using fMRI techniques; however, these studies are
mostly correlational in nature, limiting application of these findings to intervention. In order to develop targeted
cognitive interventions, there is an urgent need to 1) identify neural circuits that are causally linked to cognitive
function, and 2) demonstrate that circuits are modifiable and that circuit-level change is associated with
cognitive change. This project is a renewal of a R01 funded multi-year, multi-PI plan to identify the circuit basis
of medication refractory symptoms of psychotic disorders. With NIMH support we found that cerebellar-cortical
functional connectivity is linked to both psychotic symptoms (hallucinations) and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. Functional connectivity can be engaged and manipulated non-invasively using neuromodulation
techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The combination of TMS and longitudinal imaging
can help establish causal links between circuits and cognition. In the current project we have identified distinct
cortical-cerebellar circuits linked to cognitive deficits in psychosis and its prodrome. We replicated this finding
and have pilot data that this circuit can be successfully engaged using rTMS. Thus, the goals of this project are
1) to test whether neural circuit dysfunction is dynamically and causally associated with cognitive impairments
in people with psychotic disorders, and 2) to test whether TMS drives dynamic change in both neural circuitry
and cognitive performance. We hypothesize that the relationship between circuit connectivity and cognition
reflects dynamic states intra-individually and over time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the connectivity state
of this circuit is modifiable by TMS and that circuit manipulation will result in cognitive change. The PIs have
expertise in cognition and imaging in psychosis and the fMRI-guided TMS protocols proposed here, including
successful engagement of cerebellar-cortical targets, as well as access to the equipment and resources
necessary to carry out the study. If our hypotheses are supported, we will have identified an actionable target
that can be immediately deployed in intervention trials to test the potential for fMRI-guided TMS to drive
enduring change in cognitive circuitry and performance in psychosis."

There are now close to six million people in the Unites States living with Alzheimer’s disease and related de-
mentias (ADRD) and this number is only expected to grow as the population continues to age. The current lack
of effective treatments for ADRD speaks to the need to better understand the multiple pathophysiological factors
that contribute to these complex diseases. There is growing evidence that age-related metabolic dysfunction
plays a role in the Alzheimer’s etiology. The link between vascular risk factors and AD is explained in part by
insufficient nutrient delivery to match the high energy demands of the brain and less efficient energy production
as the brain ages. The concept of a “brain energy gap” has led to treatments aimed at enhancing energy pro-
duction and cognitive performance, notably, ketogenic dietary supplements. These have been shown to increase
cerebral ketone metabolism in AD patients, suggesting improved aerobic metabolism. However, this hypothesis
has not been tested given the complexity of imaging oxygen and glucose metabolism. Positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET) is the current standard, but the procedure requires 18F-fluorodeoxglucose (FDG) to measure glucose
metabolism, 3 15O-tracers to measure oxygen metabolism and blood flow, and arterial sampling for quantification.
 We hypothesize that cerebral oxygen and glucose metabolism can be imaged noninvasively within a
single session using hybrid PET/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). Our team has developed a robust
quantitative blood oxygenation level dependent contrast (qBOLD) method of imaging oxygen extraction, which
can be combined with MRI-based perfusion (arterial spin labeling, ASL) to map cerebral oxygen metabolism. In
tandem, we have developed a PET approach for quantifying glucose metabolism that does not require arterial
catheterization. Combining these methods on a PET/MR scanner provides the ability to image oxygen and glu-
cose metabolism simultaneously and non-invasively, thereby reducing scan time, radiation dose and patient
discomfort. As part of the proposed research, we will validate our qBOLD/ASL method for imaging oxygen me-
tabolism by comparison to 15O-PET. Conducting these studies on a PET/MR system will ensure the PET and
MRI measurements are collected under the same physiological state. The MRI oximetry method will be combined
with FDG PET to investigate the effects of a ketogenic supplement on oxygen and glucose metabolism in AD
patients. The outcomes of this project will include validating an MRI-based method for imaging oxygen metabo-
lism and demonstrating how it can be combined with FDG PET to evaluate a treatment that targets the brain
energy gap associated with AD. Replacing 15O-PET by MRI oximetry would greatly enhance the feasibility of
imaging substrate (i.e. glucose) and total energy metabolism (i.e. oxygen) considering how few PET sites with
15O capabilities remain, while FDG is the most used tracer. The longer-term goals are to provide non-invasive,
neuro-imaging tools for studying individuals with ADRD and evaluate effectiveness of emerging drugs."

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the major complications of diabetes that greatly contribute to morbidity and
mortality. Currently, there is no effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Diabetes at an early
stage affects the intestinal microbial composition that promotes the manifestation of metabolic syndrome.
However, how gut dysbiosis contributes to the diabetic complications including DPN, is unknown. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication and bacterial EVs retain bacterial genetic and biomaterials.
Recent studies show that gut bacterial EVs participate in immune signaling pathways and host metabolic
homeostasis that are associated with many disorders. The impact of microbiota derived EVs on DPN has not
been investigated. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that gut bacterial EVs participate in the DPN progression.
Importantly, our preliminary data also indicate that Lactobacillus-derived EVs alleviate the systemic inflammatory
response, protect peripheral nerve damage, and improve neurorecovery in diabetic mice with peripheral
neuropathy. In this application, we propose to investigate the effect of gut bacteria-EVs on the development of
DPN and to examine the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus-derived EVs and molecular mechanisms
underlying this therapy on neuroinflammation and peripheral nerve damage. These studies will not only
significantly expand our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-peripheral nerve
communication and progression of DPN, but also provide a novel and potentially useful treatment strategy for
patients with DPN.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting white matter instead of specific nuclei or cortex is an emerging therapeutic
approach for individuals with treatment resistant neurological or psychiatric disorders. This treatment approach
is thought to have its beneficial effects through functional modulation of neural activity across distributed brain
networks that connect through the white matter that is being stimulated. Evidence for this is, however, in short
supply. This means that the underlying functional and anatomical mechanisms that contribute to the therapeutic
effects of white matter DBS are poorly understood. Lack of this knowledge hinders refinement of this treatment
and its potential use to target other white matter tracts. Here we will model the effects of DBS in macaques and
determine the mechanisms engaged by DBS therapy that targets the location where three white matter tracts –
forceps minor, uncinate fascicle and cingulum bundle – overlap in frontal cortex adjacent to subcallosal anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC). We will employ this model as prior work has shown that stimulation of these tracts is
associated with both fast positive changes in affect as well as slower longer-term effects on affective state that
develop over many weeks in people with treatment resistant mood disorders. Our aim here is to establish the
micro- and meso-scale neurological changes across both time frames caused by deep brain stimulation. We
hypothesize that they are caused by two distinct mechanisms. The fast effects are the result of functional
changes whereas the slow changes are the result of structural changes to white matter. To test our hypothesis,
we will use a combination of deep brain stimulation, resting-state fMRI, neurophysiology, and postmortem
anatomy in macaque monkeys. Using the same diffusion imaging tractography approach used in human patients,
mini-deep brain stimulation electrodes will be targeted to the confluence of three white matter tracts. We will then
assess the progressive systems level changes in fMRI resting-state functional connectivity and diffusion
weighted imaging estimates of anatomical connections that are caused by deep brain stimulation of these three
white matter tracts. In parallel, we will assess the microscale neurophysiological changes that occur as a result
of stimulation. Here our experiments are designed to discern the immediate effects of stimulation on functional
interaction between areas that directly connect through the white matter adjacent to subcallosal ACC as well as
the longer-term changes in functional communication between areas. Finally, we will characterize the changes
in anatomy that are associated with the brain-wide functional effects of deep brain stimulation to white matter.
Here we will use both confocal and electron microscopy to discern alterations to white matter that are caused by
stimulation. Completing these experiments will begin to reveal the functional and anatomical mechanisms of
DBS when it is directed to white matter. Overall, what we discover will provide insights into how circuit-level
functions are modulated by DBS as well as aid the refinement of emerging DBS treatments."
10802660,"Blast induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury in modern warfare. Estimates are that from 12
to 23 percent of Veterans who served in the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters of operation during
OEF, OIF and New Dawn suffered a TBI during deployment with blast exposure being the predominant
mechanism of injury and mild injuries (mTBI) being most common. Blast related mTBI has been linked to a
variety of chronic cognitive and chronic mental health disorders in Veterans including post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), depression and risk for suicide. Supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment.
Pharmacological options are limited and do not correct the underlying cause of brain dysfunction.
 For more than a decade the Elder lab have been studying a rat model of repetitive low-level blast exposure.
Rats exposed to three 74.5 kPa exposures delivered one per day over three days develop a delayed blast-
induced behavioral phenotype, which includes chronic cognitive changes and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD)-related traits. These rats thus provide a clinically relevant model of the chronic neurobehavioral
syndromes seen in veterans. Inflammation has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of blast injury. In the
rat model being studied in the Elder lab, blast exposure is associated with chronic perivascular astroglial injury
and chronic perivascular inflammation. Recent RNA transcriptomics has identified an inflammatory signature in
brain following blast, which develops over the time frame during which the chronic behavioral phenotype
appears.
 Boldine has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and has been shown to exert beneficial effects in
experimental models associated with increased pro-inflammatory signaling. These effects of boldine have been
attributed in part to its ability to block connexin (Cx) hemichannels (HC) which are membrane pores that bind
CxHC on adjacent cells to form gap junctions or exist as HC on the cell surface. CxHC can be either open or
closed. Open CxHC trigger pro-inflammatory signaling cascades including activation of inflammasomes and of
NF-kB.
 The overall goal of the present study is to address the unmet need for new therapies for the chronic cognitive
and neuropsychiatric complications of blast-related mTBI by determining whether boldine can improve behavior
in rats following low-level blast exposure and block development of the inflammatory signature seen in brain
following blast injury. These goals will be achieved using the Elder lab’s rat model of blast exposure through two
specific aims: (1) To determine whether orally administered boldine can prevent the appearance of PTSD-related
traits and cognitive impairments in blast-exposed rats. (2) To test if orally administered boldine reverses the
inflammatory signature in brain following blast exposure. We posit that boldine will reduce chronic perivascular
inflammation and the molecular inflammatory signature that follows blast overpressure injury. If this prediction is
correct, we anticipate an accelerated path to translation of boldine – an ingredient in a USDA-approved nutritional
supplement – for use in relieving neuropsychiatric symptoms of Veterans."

The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is required for initiating and maintaining regular rhythmic heartbeats. CCS
defects commonly give rise to arrhythmia, a leading cause of morbidity and death worldwide. Despite its
importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying CCS homeostasis and regeneration are poorly understood.
Hippo signaling, a fundamental molecular signaling pathway, inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation and
regeneration. However, the role of Hippo signaling in the CCS is largely unclear. We made the first evidence of
an essential role for the Hippo signaling in maintaining CCS homeostasis and repair after injury, which functions
via the canonical Hippo signaling mediated by Hippo downstream effectors Yap and Taz. Deletion of Hippo
signaling Lats1 and Lats2 in the CCS caused disrupted CCS homeostasis and cardiac arrhythmias in adult mice,
which is rescued via genetic deletion of Yap/Taz in the CCS. However, upon CCS injury, Lats1/2 deletion is
protective and improved cardiac function. Our preliminary data also suggested a crosstalk between the Hippo
and TGF-β signals, as well as Yap/Taz interactions with different transcription factors in no-injury and injury CCS.
Here we will further study these findings at the single-cell level to provide unprecedented and novel mechanistic
insight(s) into the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the CCS. We are aimed to identify therapeutic targets
applicable to the future treatment of human patients with CCS dysfunction and regenerative medicine."

 Nearly one third of all adults with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) present with lupus nephritis (LN)
at diagnosis and up to two thirds manifest kidney involvement during the course of the disease with higher
prevalence in minority populations particularly those of African ancestry. Furthermore, as many as 10% of
patients with LN will progress to end-stage and require dialysis and/or kidney transplant. The ability to accurately
identify LN patients at risk for progression could shift much of the current management paradigm from treatment
to prevention. However, the prognostic significance of histopathologic classification of LN, the most current
arising from a collaboration between the International Society of Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society
(ISN/RPS) in 2004 is controversial. Therefore, novel approaches are required to obtain continuous, quantitative
data to improve accuracy, reproducibility, and prognostic utility.
During the last decade, the rapid evolution of digital image technology has begun to challenge the established
light microscopy-based protocols. Digital pathology, a dynamic, image-based environment for the acquisition,
management, and analysis of information generated from digitized images, is emerging in the setting of clinical
trials and research, including kidney disease, but has yet to be comprehensively applied to lupus nephritis
biopsy interpretation in a large cohort. We hypothesize that digital pathology and image analysis approaches
will improve the prognostic utility of the kidney biopsy in lupus nephritis and allow more efficacious treatment
approaches. Thus, the goal of our proposal is to take advantage of the recent advancements of digital
pathology, deep learning, and machine learning, both supervised and unsupervised methods, and the broad
and extensive experience of the research team, and apply 1) quantitative morphology, 2) supervised computer-
aided deep learning image analysis algorithms with morphometric analysis, and 3) unsupervised machine
learning algorithms. To test our hypotheses, we will use our Digital Pathology Image Repositories (DPIR). We
have generated our DPIR from approximately 550 whole-slide scans of lupus nephritis biopsies from X patients
enrolled in the Accelerated Medicines Partnership (AMP) for Lupus Nephritis and the University of Michigan
Lupus Cohort. Data from the AMP cohort includes extensive clinical parameters obtained during longitudinal
follow up for 52+ weeks with predefined clinical outcomes of renal response. The Michigan Lupus Cohort
likewise includes detailed clinical information over several years already."

The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify long-term neurobehavioral consequences of childhood mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) for the developing brain and examine their contribution to addiction risk using a
rigorous cotwin-control design, longitudinal follow-up, and multimodal and innovative neuroimaging tools and
neurobehavioral assessments. mTBI sustained during childhood or adolescence, periods of continuing brain
development and reorganization, is a major public health problem due to its high prevalence and long-lasting
neurobehavioral consequences associated with increased risk for addictive behaviors. However, progress in
understanding long-term sequelae of mTBI and their role in addiction is hindered by a number of significant
methodological challenges: a) case-control studies are correlative and do not allow to distinguish consequences
of TBI from pre-existing neurocognitive deficits potentially increasing the risk for TBI; b) matching cases and
controls is very problematic due to substantial (and largely heritable) individual variability in brain structure and
function and heterogeneity of brain damage; c) single neuroimaging modalities provide only a limited insight into
the consequences of mTBI; d) in cross-sectional studies, the effects of mTBI may be confounded with the effects
of substance use. The proposed study will address these critical barriers to progress using a combination of
rigorous and innovative approaches: (i) the co-twin control design that will provide the best-possible controls for
mTBI cases - their monozygotic co-twins without TBI history, (ii) multimodal neuroimaging assessments
leveraging high spatial resolution of MRI and high temporal resolution of brain electrophysiology, and (iii) a
longitudinal follow-up assessment of changes in substance use behaviors (onset, regular use, substance use
disorder symptoms). Assessment will include structural, functional, and diffusion MRI, quantitative Gradient
Recalled Echo (qGRE) MRI, a novel neuroimaging technique sensitive to cortical cellular microstructure, brain
neurophysiology including resting-state EEG, and event-related brain potentials (ERP), methods that are
sensitive to abnormal timing and synchrony of neuronal dynamics. The following Specific Aims will be pursued:
Aim 1: To identify long-term consequences of mTBI in early adolescence and distinguish them from pre-existing
factors potentially associated with risk for mTBI using a cotwin control design. We hypothesize that, in mTBI-
discordant monozygotic pairs, twins with lifetime history of mTBI will show alterations in brain structure and
function and deficits in neuropsychological performance compared with their cotwins without mTBI history; Aim
2: To determine, both cross-sectionally and prospectively, whether mTBI is associated with elevated risk for
addictive behaviors. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which long-lasting neurobehavioral
consequences of childhood and adolescent mTBI contribute to addiction risk will inform the development of more
efficient treatment and rehabilitation approaches, as well as prevention of substance use and abuse and mental
illness in youth with a history of mTBI."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects billions of people. NAFLD was first defined in the USA 35 years
ago, yet progress toward a true cure has been incremental and limited to lifestyle modification. The long-term
goal of our research program is to take a fresh view on human liver metabolism through the lens of precision
hepatology to define personalized mechanisms as a fundamental step toward developing evidence-based,
rational solutions for mechanism-directed diagnostic and therapeutic investigation.
Here, we propose to explore liver effect by integrative pre-clinical research, combining patients’ and engineered
human tissues using new technologies such as human organoids, gene editing and comprehensive
genomics/transcriptomics. We propose to use our pioneering steatohepatitis organoids in combination with an
innovative population-scale pluripotent stem cell (PSC) approach to identifying NASH genotype-phenotype
associations under disrupted metabolic states. Our Preliminary Data using this human organoid GWAS system
suggests that GCKR rs1260326 confer risk for developing steatosis and inflammation under oleic acid induced
insulin resistant conditions, supported by cohort data from thousands of NASH patients. Based on these exciting
Preliminary Data, the overall objective in this application is to elucidate variant-dependent effects of common
coding single nucleotide polymorphism on liver specific steatosis and inflammation under disrupted metabolic
states. Our central hypothesis is that GCKR rs1260326 activates glucokinase to trigger hepatic lipogenesis
under an insulin resistant state, thereby exacerbating pathogenic inflammation through mitochondrial
oxidative stress. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic determination of GCKR genetic
predisposition in T2D complicated steatohepatitis will provide a strong foundation for identifying susceptible
populations and molecular pathway directed therapy development. We will critically test and validate our
hypothesis in the following Aims: In Aim1, we will determine the mechanistic role of GCKR rs1260326 in
steatohepatitis liver organoids. In Aim2, we will interrogate GCKR rs1260326 mediated mitochondrial
dysregulation in organoid and patients. In Aim3, we will redefine GCKR rs1260326 and steatohepatitis
associations in diabetic NASH patients. At the completion, we will have determined how common risk variants
and metabolic activities in the liver interact to cause aggressive forms of NASH, informing risk stratification
strategies, as well as the potentially diverging efficacy of available therapies. Our studies will lead to a better
mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial dysregulation associated with GCKR rs1260326 at the level of liver,
forming a basis for mitochondrial metabolism-directed therapeutic investigations. Further, by demonstrating the
utility of our population-based organoid model system, this investigative strategy may open the door to many
other studies of pleiotropic heritable factors, potentially transforming the future of precision hepatology."

Thirty million people in the United States live with a rare disorder, and approximately half of those affected
are children. The current study focuses on children with vascular anomalies (VAs), a spectrum of rare
congenital disorders that are often misdiagnosed and mistreated. Complex VAs can result in pain, disfigurement,
coagulopathy, dysfunction, and death if left untreated. Therefore, children require the care of VA specialists, and
coordination between primary and specialty care is imperative for children with rare diseases to ensure
patients receive comprehensive, safe, and effective care. This is especially true for families living in rural
communities, given that VA specialists are clustered at urban pediatric medical centers. However, caregivers
of children with rare diseases struggle to get their children the comprehensive care they need. Our
preliminary data suggests that common barriers to care include a fragmented system of care, distance to
specialists, lack of knowledgeable pediatricians, and inadequate local resources. Coordinated primary and
specialty care is essential for children with VAs because it can help reduce the risk of emergency room
visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Therefore, the proposed study aims to identify facilitators and
barriers to high-quality care coordination for patients with VAs, especially those in rural areas. Little is known
about gaps in care coordination and continuity of care for patients with rare diseases or the ways that geographic
location influences care coordination. Therefore, the goal of our proposed study is to fill this important gap by
using an innovative triadic research design that involves interviews with caregiver-pediatrician-VA specialist
triads to gain a comprehensive understanding of care coordination for children with VAs. We will achieve this
goal through three aims: Aim 1: To characterize VA specialists’ perspectives on facilitators and barriers to care
coordination for patients with VAs, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with VA specialists practicing at
multidisciplinary VA centers. Aim 2: To characterize caregivers of VA patients’ perspectives on facilitators and
barriers to care coordination for patients with VAs, we will interview caregivers of children with VAs who live in
rural and non-rural areas. Aim 3: To characterize pediatricians’ perspectives on facilitators and barriers to care
coordination for patients with VAs, we will interview pediatricians who care for patients with VAs, sampling
clinicians who practice in rural and non-rural areas. We will use thematic analysis to analyze our interview
transcripts. The analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of facilitators and barriers to care coordination,
with a comparison of rural and non-rural contexts, through a synthesis of pediatricians’, specialists’, and
caregivers’ perspectives. The results will reveal modifiable factors that can be leveraged to design future
interventions to improve primary care."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common malignancy in the world and the 4th leading cause
of cancer death in the US. Resection and transplantation are the sole potentially curative treatments for HCC,
but only 10-15% of patients are candidates. Nivolumab (human anti-PD-1 mAb) was FDA approved in 2017 for
HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib. Recent clinical trials demonstrate the potential of immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 for the
treatment of HCC. However, the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC leads to a
resistance to ICB immunotherapy and immune related adverse effects (irAEs); thus, the efficacy of ICB
immunotherapy may not be sufficient to elicit durable clinical benefits. Combinational ICB immunotherapies
pairing with immunogenic local therapies are a promising approach for the treatment of HCC. Recently pre-
clinic and clinical trials have tested aPD-L1 ICB immunotherapy in a combination with interventional local
ablation therapies with the promise for enhancing overall therapeutic effects. One limitation that accounts for
the compromised efficacy of systemic ICB immunotherapy in the combination is low tumor specific accessibility
and off-target binding of ICB antibodies to normal tissues upon systemic administration. Tumor site specific
delivery of ICBs will enhance tumoral immune checkpoint blockage efficacy with avoiding systemic non-specific
activation of the immune system resulting in irAEs. Locally delivered ICB conjugated nano-carriers have
enabled the emergence of platforms for safely delivering effective dose of ICBs in the tumor.
 We propose catheter-directed intra-arterial (IA) infusion of oriented anti-PD-L1 conjugated ferumoxytol using
Z-domain (aPD-L1-Z-Fer) for a synergistic combination ICB immunotherapy with immunogenic irreversible
electroporation (IRE) local therapy. An engineered Z domain, immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc domain-specific
binding protein, is proposed to enhance the immune checkpoint blocking efficiency of aPD-L1 with FDA
approved iron oxide nanoparticles (ferumoxytol; Fer). Our recent results demonstrated that Z-domain adaptors
provided a convenient and controlled aPD-L1 ICB conjugation onto Fer (aPD-L1-Z-Fer) and subsequent the
enhancement of immune checkpoint blockade efficiency. Our proposed IA infusion of aPD-L1-Z-Fer will permit
further efficient and targeted delivery of immunostimulatory aPD-L1 to allow an increase in the dosage and
improved safety profile after the immunogenic interventional local ablation therapy for superior therapeutic
outcomes. MRI visible aPD-L1-Z-Fer and MR image guidance should also permit to monitor/track/quantify the
delivery of aPD-L1-Z-Fer to the targeted tumor tissues treated with an immunogenic local therapy. Through a
collaborative project building upon our strengths in nano-immunotherapy, interventional oncology, and
radiology, we seek to develop a powerful new approach for image-guided combinational IA infused aPD-L1-Z-
Fer and immunogenic local ablation for the treatment of HCC."

Breast reconstruction after mastectomy is critical to comprehensive breast cancer treatment because it can
restore quality of life and body image, which are often impaired after mastectomy. However, many patients are
not offered reconstruction, especially those who identify as Black or Hispanic/Latina. Many patients lack
knowledge about breast reconstruction risks, and their choices about reconstruction often misalign with their
preferences. We have developed a breast reconstruction decision aid called BREASTChoice and
demonstrated its efficacy and effectiveness in two randomized controlled trials. Patients and clinicians found
BREASTChoice highly usable but requested a version they could use on a mobile device and easily share with
family and friends. Like most decision aids, BREASTChoice’s implementation has been limited to clinical
settings and had limited uptake. For dissemination of decision support to be successful, it must make decision
support available how, when, and where people want to use it. Dissemination through social media within
online communities could broaden the reach of BREASTChoice and other decision tools. Most Americans use
social media (81%) and use the internet for health information (72%). Even most older adults (60%) use the
internet. Breast cancer survivors are especially engaged in social media and online communities. Our
preliminary data suggest that breast cancer survivors would engage with BREASTChoice through social
media. Guided by the Designing for Dissemination paradigm, and in partnership with 3 cancer survivor and two
clinician organizations, we propose to adapt BREASTChoice and disseminate it through social media within
online communities. Aim 1. Adapt BREASTChoice for mobile use and online dissemination. Guided by the
ADAPT-ITT model, we will conduct iterative phases of testing in breast cancer survivors (n=45), qualitative
interviews with topical experts (n=10), and website programming changes. Adaptations will be tracked using
FRAME. Aim 2. Design and test social media messages for dissemination of BREASTChoice. Guided by
Diffusion of Innovations Theory, we will engage key community partners regarding potential adoption and
readiness for change; assess the social media dissemination context, including digital opinion leaders and
platforms; and develop and test social media messages. Aim 3. Disseminate BREASTChoice to breast cancer
survivors by leveraging social media. Using the adapted tool and tested messages, we will roll out a social
media campaign over 12 months. We will test the campaign’s exposure, reach, and engagement with
interrupted time series analysis, and BREASTChoice effectiveness (surgery choice, decision quality, decisional
conflict, satisfaction with decisions) through a longitudinal user survey. Upon completion of these aims, we will
have overcome a major scientific gap, the limited adoption of decision aids, and have developed a widely
applicable approach to disseminating decision aids outside of clinical contexts."
10805627,"This BCCMA entitled “Cardiovascular Remodeling following Arteriovenous Fistula Creation” brings
together three VA investigators to elucidate the mechanisms of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure in
the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this specific Project 2, entitled “Type VIII Collagen Contributes
to Adverse Arteriovenous Fistula Remodeling,” we plan to advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanism determining venous maturation after arteriovenous anastomosis with the hope of developing
personalized interventions to prevent early failure. Vascular access failure is the most important cause of
morbidity and hospitalization among veterans and the general population receiving hemodialysis (HD). This
highlights a clear need for in-depth research initiatives that apply state-of-the-art research technology to
clinically relevant tissues to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to failure. This retro-
translational research (from clinical to basic science) finds support in preliminary premises that reveal the
association between alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and failure. We have recently
discovered that embryogenic type VIII collagen in the human AVF is associated with non-maturation. This
collagen promotes further matrix deposition during vascular development and fibrotic diseases. Our
fundamental hypothesis is that postoperative activation of the non-canonical TGF-b / MAPK / ELK-1 signaling
axis in venous SMC upregulates COL8A1 expression and protein accumulation to exacerbate fibrosis and
inward remodeling of the fistula wall. To test the hypothesis, we will use an integrated molecular/cellular
approach, encompassing in vivo and in vitro models. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate the causality of SMC-derived
Type VIII collagen in AVF remodeling. In Aim 2, we will dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which
type VIII collagen increases the risk of AVF failure. Finally in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the relationship
between the number of COL8A1+ SMCs and the increased risk of maturation failure in patients undergoing AVF
creation in two stages. We will reveal the first cellular atlas of mature and failed human AVF fistulas obtained
at transposition. We will further confirm the association between this type of cells and AVF outcomes using a
propensity score-matched retrospective cohort of 100 human AVF samples. We expect to demonstrate the
causality of type VIII collagen to the improperly remodeled AVF wall."
10805629,"As the sixth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death accounting
for 800,000 deaths a year globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a challenging malignancy
to diagnose and manage, with an overall 5-year survival of only 20%. HCC has a rising incidence
and is the leading cause of death among patients with cirrhosis. Since liver cancer is found more
frequently among men, and death related to liver cancer is about 3 times greater in men, the
United States veteran population is at particular risk. Veterans have a higher incidence of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol associated liver disease and viral hepatitis, which are the
most common risk for HCC. The threat of HCC persists despite the successful cure of hepatitis C
infection. The VA Health Care System is the largest provider in the US for the treatment of liver
disease and liver cancer, thus making advances in detection, diagnosis, radiogenomics and the
identification of prognostic indicators of liver cancer an important component of the VA’s Precision
Oncology initiative.
 Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is upregulated in an estimated 91% of HCC.
Preliminary studies have shown that a novel PSMA-targeted PET (PSMA PET), which is currently
approved and utilized for the evaluation of prostate cancer, is highly sensitive in the detection of
HCC. In this proposal, we delineate a plan to consider and demonstrate the utility of PSMA PET
scans in three groups of veterans: those undergoing surveillance for HCC, treatment naïve
patients who are newly diagnosed with HCC, and patients previously treated for HCC being
evaluated for treatment response. By evaluating PSMA PET in these specific patient populations,
we intend to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and staging of HCC, and avoid futile locoregional
therapies to patients with metastatic HCC. By improving the diagnosis and staging of HCC with
PSMA-PET the ultimate aim of this study is improved overall survival. Specifically, the following
parameters will be evaluated: 1. the utility of PSMA PET in improving the diagnosis of HCC within
indeterminate nodules (LIRADS; LR3 and LR4 lesions) in patients with cirrhosis undergoing
surveillance, 2. the addition of PSMA PET in improving the accuracy of HCC staging among
treatment naïve patients compared to CT/MRI, 3. the role of PSMA PET in improving the
assessment of treatment response in HCC patients treated with locoregional therapy (LRT).
 We expect that PSMA PET will identify locoregional or distant HCC metastatic lesions not
detected by CT/MRI, thus altering BCLC staging and management. We also anticipate that the
lack of uptake of PSMA may reliably detect the complete response of HCC after LRT, and that
residual activity will correlate with viable tumor. PSMA PET will be performed concurrently with
CT/MRI, and staging and response to HCC treatment will be compared between that with CT/MRI,
and CT/MRI plus PSMA PET. Data gathered by this observational clinical study may inform future
randomized clinical trials incorporating PSMA PET in HCC management."
10790004,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Attention and arousal states play critical roles in influencing how we process information, from moment to
moment. While attention is believed to be strongly coupled with arousal states, the interaction between, and
independent properties of, attention and arousal in modulating visual processing remains poorly understood. In
this proposed research, I will employ a combination of novel functional neuroimaging methods and computational
modeling to examine how attention and arousal influence vision. Specifically, I will examine the modulatory role
of attention and arousal on one of the cornerstone properties of vision, contrast sensitivity—the ability to detect
an object from its background. After disentangling the independent and interactive modulatory effects of arousal
and attention on contrast processing, I will build arousal into computational models of attention in order to gain
insight into the potential canonical computations carried out by arousal and attention in influencing vision, which
in turn has the potential to shape a wide-range of downstream processes such as memory, decision-making,
and navigation. By revealing the extent and role to which attention and arousal alters early vision, results from
this proposal could further our understanding of the cortical and subcortical visual function of people with
abnormal arousal levels (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, general anxiety disorder), and with potential
applications down the road in guiding the diagnoses and treatment of disorders that involve atypical arousal
levels."

 Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality
in men in the United States. The American Urological Association recommends the use of multiparametric
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for diagnosis and disease management in all men at high risk for
prostate cancer. mpMRI is also beneficial in men: 1) with an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
following an initial negative prostate biopsy; 2) during longitudinal follow-up in active surveillance for biopsy-
proven low-risk prostate cancer; and 3) for guidance of locally targeted therapies including cryotherapy, high
intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA), and emerging
radioligand targeted treatments for intermediate to high-risk cancers. These recommendations are only
realizable through accurate localization and characterization of individual prostate lesions on MRI, which is
significantly challenging in men with pelvic metal implants. This is important since the incidence of prostate
cancer increases substantially over 50 years of age and in parallel, the prevalence of hip replacement surgery
also increases in that age group (estimated to reach ~4 million by 2030 in the US). Most of the metal implants
in current clinical use are MR compatible, however, they distort the local magnetic field (B0) causing significant
signal loss and image distortion. This is particularly problematic with echo-planar based diffusion-weighted
imaging (EP-DWI), rendering these images non-diagnostic. This is a major limitation since DWI, according to
the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) classification, is the pivotal sequence for lesion
detection and characterization in the peripheral zone, where 70-75% of prostate cancers arise. To address this
unmet clinical need, we propose to establish a 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) based DWI that is robust and can be
widely implemented across all MR scanners. This is built upon our recently introduced novel acquisition and
reconstruction strategy utilizing variable density Cartesian acquisition with spiral profile reordering (VD-
CASPR). The volumetric acquisition of 3D VD-CASPR-DWI provides higher signal to noise ratio and the TSE
readout improves the robustness to B0 inhomogeneities. This provides superior image quality and enables the
visualization of the entire prostate gland without image distortions facilitating accurate detection and
characterization of prostate lesions in men with pelvic metal implants. We will optimize the novel 3D VD-
CASPR-DWI in phantoms and in-vivo prostate imaging of healthy volunteers. We will then validate this
technique in 20 patients without and 20 patients with pelvic metal implants, evaluated for known or suspected
prostate cancer. The successful outcome of this project will be an optimized mpMRI with our novel 3D VD-
CASPR-DWI that provides pertinent clinical information for better management of prostate cancer patients and
subsequently improve their quality of life and overall survival."

10910212,"FACILITIES MANAGEMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND OPERATIONS CORE: ABSTRACT
The productivity of the investigators for which George Mason University’s (GMU) Biomedical
Research Lab (BRL) supports, is directly correlated with limited interruptions to access
containment laboratories and the equipment within them to conduct innovative infectious
disease research. The BRL has a facilities management and operations structure as well as
processes in place that have enabled consistent certification since the BRL was approved by
the CDC to conduct BSL-3 and Select Agent work in 2012. Furthermore, the BRL’s Select Agent
registration was renewed for three years in February 2023.
As the BRL transitioned from a college to a university level core facility in the Institute for
Biohealth Innovation in March 2022, a GAP analysis was completed by internal stakeholders
and separately by Facility Dynamics Engineering. Collectively, these exercises identified
opportunities for improvement to ensure that the facility, which is currently twelve years old, is
properly maintained and appropriately staffed. The Facilities Management, Maintenance, and
Operations core will implement a comprehensive BSL-3 facilities preventative maintenance and
upgrade plan to ensure continuity of operations, continued compliance with federal regulations,
and a safe and secure facility. This upgrade will include succession planning for continuity of
facilities and operations leadership and incorporation of training for facilities engineers and
facilities leadership. An effectively managed facility with expanded training opportunities, will
ensure efficient utilization of laboratories, enable advanced knowledge of new and existing
systems, continued certification of the BRL, staff retention, and support overall safety of staff
and the environment."
10786582,"Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) including abscesses, burn infections, cellulitis
and diabetic foot infections represent an enormous burden on the healthcare industry. Treatment options are
limited, and treatment failure is common, frequently leading to chronic wound infection. Staphylococcus aureus
is the most common cause of these infections, followed by Enterococcus faecalis.
 Vancomycin, a lipid II targeting antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis, is essential in the treatment of
cSSSI. However, vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci
(VRE) are a growing problem. Additionally, even in susceptible populations, antibiotic tolerant persister cells can
survive vancomycin exposure, making eradication of infection difficult to achieve. Identifying ways to increase
the efficacy of vancomycin, to target persister cells and overcome resistance would greatly improve the treatment
of cSSSIs.
 We find that palmitoleic acid, a non-toxic unsaturated fatty acid found in human serum potentiates
vancomycin efficacy against S. aureus and E. faecalis. Strikingly, palmitoleic acid also rapidly sensitizes persister
cells and resistant populations to vancomycin. Vancomycin causes accumulation of the hydrophobic lipid II
molecule at the septum. Our preliminary data suggests that palmitoleic acid is recruited to these hydrophobic
regions which destabilize the membrane and cause cell death. Vancomycin-resistant isolates induce expression
of resistance genes when they encounter vancomycin. We hypothesize that the rapidity of palmitoleic acid-
vancomycin killing may outpace the induction of resistance gene expression, resulting in death of the resistant
strains.
 In this proposal, we will 1) determine how palmitoleic acid/vancomycin kills persister cells and
overcomes vancomycin-resistance and 2) evaluate the efficacy of this therapeutic combination in a pre-clinical
diabetic wound infection model. Utilizing host-produced unsaturated fatty acids to potentiate vancomycin killing
against resistant organisms is conceptually innovative. If successful, this proposal will represent the first steps
toward the development of a powerful therapeutic combination for the eradication of recalcitrant gram-positive
wound infection."
10917276,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive technique that can be used to help diagnose and monitor cancer. It is based on
the principle that tumor cells release small pieces of DNA and RNA into circulation. In several human cancers,
FDA-approved liquid biopsy tests are designed to look for common disease-associated mutations. These liquid
biopsy tests are most successful in tumors with a well-defined mutation landscape, such as lung and breast
cancer. However, looking for common mutations is less successful in structurally complex tumors with a lower
incidence of mutations, as is the case with many sarcomas, such as osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing’s sarcoma.
Recent data indicate that mutation-independent liquid biopsy techniques, including assessment of circulating
DNA fragment size patterns and methylation status, can increase sensitivity of the assay and identify the tissue
of origin and histologic subtype of human cancers. Additionally, evidence now suggests that unique gene
expression and methylation signatures measured by liquid biopsy have the potential to act as a surrogate for
response to treatment and/or identify early emergence of treatment resistance. As such, there is potential for
using an advance liquid biopsy tool to inform patient-specific therapies more effectively, particularly in instances
where repeat imaging/tumor sampling is challenging. As such, the hypothesis underlying this proposal is that
gene expression and epigenetic metastatic signatures can be identified in RNA and DNA isolated from
plasma in canine OS and integrated using machine learning to improve the sensitivity of liquid biopsy.
It is further predicted that this improved liquid biopsy platform will be capable of identifying treatment
specific signatures reflective of response or resistance to therapy. We will use canine OS, which has a
structurally chaotic tumor genome, as a large animal disease model of human sarcomas. Using patient-matched
plasma samples from dogs with OS taken at multiple timepoints throughout treatment, we will evaluate cell-free
DNA and RNA using a comprehensive mutation-independent liquid biopsy assay. This will incorporate evaluation
multiple parameters, including cell-free DNA fragment sizes, methylation, and gene expression alterations and
use machine learning to optimize parameter integration. The liquid biopsy tool will be further validated for
detection of early disease progression in OS patients. Lastly, we will begin to dissect how drug exposure alters
disease-specific signatures in circulation. Ultimately, the tools and techniques developed from this work will have
broad applicability to both canine and human sarcomas, facilitating enhanced accuracy for cancer detection and
clinical decision-making. Importantly, the work outlined in this proposal provides a unique opportunity for
expansion of genomic skill sets in the context of translational medicine, thereby further supporting my
development as a successful independent clinician scientist."
10789572,"Neurodevelopmental disability can be caused by pathogenic variants in any one of numerous genes, many
of which are still being identified. The identification of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in an NDD gene
in a proband leads to families, clinicians, and scientists wondering if the VUS is causal or a “red herring.”
Ideally, reliable, cell-based, protein-based, or biochemical assays would test functional consequences of such
variants, helping add experimental evidence for variant reclassification under ACMG criteria. However, for
many NDD genes, there are no in vitro or ex vivo assays, and the effect of a VUS must be tested in vivo.
 This exploratory grant proposes an efficient and innovative strategy to evaluate VUSs in genes that cause
NDD when haploinsufficient in humans, that cause no phenotype or a subtle phenotype when haploinsufficient
in mice, and that cause a clear fetal phenotype when knocked out (KO) in mice. This is the situation for many
human disease genes, including the NDD gene ANKRD17. De novo heterozygous nonsense, frameshift, and
canonical splice site variants in ANKRD17 found in multiple probands with NDD indicate the mechanism of
mutational effect is haploinsufficiency. However, Ankrd17 haploinsufficient mice are viable and fertile, without a
reported neurodevelopmental phenotype. In contrast, Ankrd17 KO mice exhibit a lethal cardiovascular
phenotype at E10.5. ANKRD17 and Ankrd17 are 96% identical and 98% similar at the amino acid level. The
advantage of our strategy is that is simpler to determine if a hemizygous or homozygous variant is a loss-of-
function because it causes a fetal KO phenotype than it is to determine if that variant causes a subtle
heterozygous phenotype postnatally. The former only requires efficient zygotic editing, and fetal phenotyping
and genotyping. The latter requires newly generated mouse strains and postnatal neurobehavioral testing.
 As proof of concept, we will use i-GONAD to introduce Ankrd17 pathogenic and benign variants in E0.7
zygotes. i-GONAD is an efficient in vivo zygote gene-editing method for introducing hemizygous,
heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygous variants. We will phenotype fetuses at E10.5 and
correlate phenotypes with genotypes. We expect fetuses that are hemizygous and homozygous for
pathogenic variants to exhibit the same phenotype as KO fetuses, while fetuses hemizygous or homozygous
for benign variants will appear normal. We will then test VUSs in ANKRD17 that were identified in patients with
NDD and make the results of these experiments accessible via the NIH-supported ClinVar portal.
 Successful completion of these experiments will establish a new paradigm for testing VUSs in genes that
cause highly penetrant haploinsufficiency phenotypes in humans, subtle or no haploinsufficiency phenotype in
mice, and highly penetrant fetal phenotypes in knockout mice."

The purpose of this R03 proposal is to develop pilot studies using new research methodology and technology to
investigate how dietary potassium (K+) deficiency leads to kidney injury. It is well known that dietary K+ deficiency
leads to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, as well as chronic kidney disease. My NIDDK K08 research was
funded to study how K+ deficiency alters proteins in the distal convoluted tubule leading to salt-sensitive
hypertension. In addition to hypertension, we observed that K+ deficient mice develop kidney injury with a
decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increase in inflammatory markers. It has been proposed
that K+ deficiency causes kidney injury through activation of ammoniagenesis in the proximal tubule, yet the link
between hypokalemic-induced ammoniagenesis and kidney injury remains obscure. Our preliminary results in
K+ deficient mice have shown an increase in ammoniagenesis, an increase in complement activation, an increase
in inflammatory markers, and an increase in fibrosis. However, it is unclear whether the kidney injury is due to
local effects within proximal tubule cells, or due to an extra-renal immune or endocrine response. To isolate the
direct effects of low K+ on the proximal tubule we propose to develop and optimize two cellular model systems.
1) The first is optimizing a 2D permeable support proximal tubule model. This 2D polarized cellular model is the
current standard for studying proximal tubule cells in culture systems. 2) The second is developing a tubule-
scaffold using 3D bioprinted collagen that can be seeded with proximal tubule cells to recapitulate the 3D
environment with tubular constraints, laminar flow, and mechanical forces—factors all known to play a critical
role in proximal tubule differentiation and physiology. By developing these two cellular model systems we intend
to isolate the direct effects of low K+ on the proximal tubule, including the effects on ammoniagenesis and
activation of the de novo immune response. The results from this grant will advance our understanding of how
the Western diet, which is deficient in potassium, may increase susceptibility to kidney injury. Additionally, these
results will generate publications, facilitate independence, and form the foundation for my R01 application."

Ultrasonic imaging is widely used to monitor fetal growth and development during the first and second
trimester, and multiple studies document the resultant positive impacts on fetal and maternal
outcomes. However, current methods fail to provide adequate visualization of key structures in many
patients, and alternative imaging modes are rarely available to these patients. We have developed
novel ultrasonic beamforming methods that utilize the spatial coherence of backscattered echoes.
These methods, in simulation, phantom, and blinded-observer clinical studies, show markedly
improved image quality over conventional ultrasonic images, especially in difficult-to-image patients.
We propose extend our theory of coherence imaging to 1.5D and 2D arrays and to very large arrays.
Using such advanced arrays, we propose clinical studies to assess the role of coherence imaging in
key fetal diagnostic tasks in first trimester and second trimester scans. Quantitative image quality
metrics and observer studies are proposed to compare B-mode and coherence images with an
emphasis on difficult-to-image patients for whom current imaging methods fail. Related studies will
measure the contribution of various sources of image degradation in fetal scans. If successful, the
proposed research could lead to a new class of ultrasonic beamforming methods that operate in
imaging environments in which current methods fail."
10786538,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Over 3 million children in the United States attend schools within 100 meters of a major roadway, resulting
in significant exposure to traffic-related air pollutants during school hours and while commuting to and from
school. In our prior work, we have identified commuting as a period of high-intensity exposure and have
obtained evidence linking school pollution exposure to airway inflammation. Moreover, we found that
individual-level exposure to black carbon (BC)/soot varies significantly among children within an urban
community, and we hypothesize that changes in respiratory patterns associated with physical activity may
directly influence inhaled BC mass during active vs. passive commuting. Critically, however, there remains a
gap in our knowledge regarding evidence-based targets for interventions to reduce exposures while children
commute and play in school. We plan to bridge this scientific gap using our innovative approaches to
assessing air pollution exposure and by leveraging our strong community partnerships.
 Recent advances in wearable technology now allow us to simultaneously measure: 1) BC pollutant
concentrations in the breathing zone, 2) minute ventilation (VE; i.e., tidal volume x respiratory rates), and 3)
locations of activity with global positioning system (GPS) data. In the current study, we will collect detailed
measurements of inhaled mass of BC particulate pollutant in a cohort of 40 children in grades 7–12 who live
and attend school in an urban community. After conducting cardiopulmonary exercise testing to calibrate HR
sensors at the individual level, we will ask children to wear HR sensors and BC monitors in their natural
environment for 48 hours and repeat measurements after 6 months. We will compare inhaled mass of BC
during periods of activity vs. rest (Aim 1), among children who engage in active (e.g., walking) vs. passive
(e.g., bus or subway) commuting to/from school (Aim 2a) and across four different time periods throughout the
school day (i.e. morning commute, school hours, afternoon commute, non-school hours) (Aim 2b).Our overall
hypothesis is that inhaled BC mass during periods of high activity contributes a large percentage to daily
exposure. We further hypothesize that children who engage in active commuting will have greater inhaled
mass of BC compared to children who engage in passive commuting and that exposures will be greatest
during the morning commute.
 Our study will provide preliminary data for a future intervention study aimed at determining the safest
routes to and from school for reducing personal exposure to air pollutants. Thus, this proposal aligns with the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s strategic objective to optimize technological developments to
facilitate lifestyle interventions and improve the maintenance of health and wellness. Data derived from this
R03 study also will have a direct impact on informing local legislation and could affect policy in similar
communities where schools are located adjacent to major traffic routes."
10789225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over 2.2 million US patients are estimated to have limb loss, with the number projected to
rise to 3.6 million by 2050. The current standard for rehabilitation and mobility following
amputation is a socket-mounted prosthesis which bears force through the skin of the residual
limb. However, this traditional attachment method is frequently associated with functionally-
limiting problems including chronic pain, discomfort, and medical complications at the residuum-
prosthesis interface. Osseointegration (OI) for reconstruction in amputees is a procedure in
which a metal implant is directly anchored to the residual bone. A prosthetic limb is then
attached to the distal end of the implant (abutment) which protrudes through a small opening in
the skin. Directly anchoring a prosthetic device to the bone much more closely matches
the physiology and mechanics of a non-amputated limb, resulting in superior outcomes
with regards to physical function, skin-related complications, chronic pain and osseoperception.
However, to date, risk of infection represents the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of
OI prostheses due to the transcutaneous nature of the implant. Antimicrobial photodynamic
therapy (aPDT) is a treatment modality in which a topical photosensitizing (PS) agent (FDA-
approved 5-aminolevulinic acid, 5-ALA) is applied, is preferentially taken up by microbial cells,
and is subsequently activated by application of light, producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free
radicals that eradicate microorganisms. Our previous work has demonstrated that topical aPDT
eliminates >95% of both biofilm-based and planktonic bacteria both in vitro and in an in vivo
rodent model—substantially more effective as a microbiocide than any other currently
utilized adjuvant treatment strategy. Thus, our overall objectives in this proposal are to build an
optimized light administration device and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, usability, preliminary
efficacy and safety in human patients with OI prostheses. This represents the next step toward
attainment of our long-term goal, which is to facilitate widespread implementation of OI by
integrating aPDT into the regular wound-care regimen thus prevening infection. To attain our
objectives two aims will be pursued: (1) design and build a light tunnel optimized for delivery of
aPDT at the implant-skin interface and (2) evaluate feasibility, acceptability, usability,
preliminary efficacy and safety for infection prevention in OI patients. The completion of this
study is a critical step to the development and implementation of a multicenter definitive RCT
powered to detect a reduction in rate of infection in OI patients. Successful reduction in
infection would be paradigm-shifting."

Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a complex congenital condition that affects approximately 1:3,500 to 1:5,600
live births. Clinical features associated with CFM include underdevelopment of the facial structures, most
commonly affecting the ear (e.g. microtia), and jaw (e.g. mandibular hypoplasia). Nearly half of individuals with
CFM also have extra-cranial malformations, such as heart, kidney, or spine anomalies. Individuals with CFM
have complex healthcare needs and often require a lifetime of staged and (ideally) coordinated evaluations
and interventions to optimize growth and nutrition, hearing, neurodevelopment, breathing, and minimize the
impact of extra-cranial malformations. Recent advances in techniques for hearing amplification, jaw
distraction, and ear reconstruction have the potential to improve aspects of health important to individuals with
CFM. However, we have large gaps in knowledge about holistic healthcare outcomes, burden of healthcare,
cost, and the psychologic needs of individuals with CFM and/or their caregivers. Individuals with CFM have
rarely been included in qualitative studies to explore their unique healthcare experiences. This study proposes
to establish an international community of individuals affected by CFM, healthcare providers, and advocacy
leaders to facilitate future research in CFM. Multi-perspective data pertaining to the psychological health and
healthcare experiences of individuals with CFM and their caregivers across the treatment pathway will be
collected. The study team proposes a mixed-methods multi-informant and international study. This
methodologically rigorous approach will be used to achieve the following goals: validate a psychological
conceptual framework for CFM through interviews with 160 individuals with CFM and/or their caregivers (Aim
1); identify predictors of psychological distress in an international population of 800 individuals affected by CFM
(Aim 2); evaluate the extent to which current healthcare provisions address the areas of psychological concern
identified in Aims 1 and 2 through interviews with over 60 healthcare professionals and patient advocates (Aim
3); and establish a registry for participants with CFM and/or their caregivers for future research (Aim 4). This
project will provide a comprehensive approach for assessing psychological health and healthcare experiences
of individuals with CFM and their caregivers. Future studies will focus on investigations of specific interventions
to optimize psychologic health in this vulnerable population."
10790927,"ABSTRACT
 Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that have evolved to co-exist with their hosts. As such, they
have the ability to both hijack the necessary host machinery to promote viral proliferation as well as to antagonize
host immune defenses. Despite extensive research in these areas there are still significant gaps in our
knowledge of the repertoire of host genes that function in either pro-viral or anti-viral manner. A novel strategy
to identify host genes that are important for mammalian virus infection takes advantage of the model organism
C. elegans. Due to its simplicity and the fact that ~40% of its genes (~7500) are conserved with humans, C.
elegans has played a key role in many fundamental discoveries in biology. However, its use in the study of
virology had been limited by the lack of known viruses capable of naturally infecting C. elegans until the discovery
in 2011 of Orsay Virus. Orsay virus is a non-enveloped positive sense RNA virus related to viruses in the families
Picorna-, Calici- and Astroviridae, and thus it can serve as a model for many pathogenic mammalian viruses.
Several published studies have demonstrated clear proof of concept that the Orsay virus-C. elegans model can
be used to identify novel genes important for infection by mammalian viruses. For some genes that are absolutely
required for Orsay virus infection in C. elegans, knockouts of the orthologous gene in human cell culture result
in up to ~1,000-fold reductions in virus titers for viruses like encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Coxsackie
Virus B3 (CVB3). To systematically identify genes that promote or antagonize Orsay virus infection in C. elegans,
a large-scale RNAi screen will be performed. RNAi in C. elegans is both more facile and robust than
corresponding siRNA screening in mammalian cells, and it is complementary to CRISPR screens in cell culture.
The goals of this project are: (1) To systematically identify host factors that impact Orsay virus infection in C.
elegans by performing RNAi against the ~ 7500 C. elegans genes with human orthologs. (2) Determine whether

Traumatic injury, defined as sudden and severe physical injury, is a leading cause of death and years of life
lost in the United States. Regional trauma systems, in which emergency medical providers and acute care
facilities integrate and coordinate triage and treatment of injured patients, are broadly implemented in the U.S.
and proven to reduce mortality through consolidated, specialized care at trauma centers. Limited access to
trauma centers is an important contributor to greater trauma mortality among people living in rural
communities. Despite efforts of regional trauma systems to ensure timely, high-quality care for all patients,
disparities in trauma mortality by rurality, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic remain widespread. There is an
immediate need to understand the causes of trauma-related disparities across diverse rural and other
underserved populations. We propose systems science is needed to understand the causal mechanisms of
trauma-related disparities and identify high-impact interventions for rural and other underserved populations.
Our long-term research goal is to use complex systems theory and simulation modeling to design, implement,
and evaluate system-level changes to regionalized trauma care that improve population health and address
health disparities. System dynamics is an established modeling approach for complex, dynamic systems with
multiple cause-effect relationships and feedback loops. In this National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities (NIMHD) R21 proposal, our short-term objective is to develop a causal loop diagram of regional
trauma systems informed by secondary analysis of existing data and key stakeholder input. We will create a
comprehensive dataset linking existing statewide data from North Carolina on EMS and in-hospital trauma
care, trauma patient mortality, and patient and community demographics and socioeconomic status. To
complement these quantitative data, we will engage regional trauma system stakeholders and subject matter
experts with qualitative system dynamics methods. Our specific aims are to: (1) evaluate rural, racial-ethnic,
and socioeconomic disparities in trauma triage and long-term mortality among North Carolina trauma patients;
and (2) create a causal loop diagram for a regional trauma system in North Carolina through stakeholder
engagement to identify potential high-impact interventions to address trauma disparities. Upon successful
completion of these aims, we will have produced essential preliminary data on trauma-related disparities in
rural and other subgroups to pursue system dynamics research to understand and improve population health
and quality of care for underserved populations. The proposed research and our long-term research goal has
potential for significant scientific impact on health systems modeling that can directly contribute to improving
outcomes for patients experiencing acute, life-threatening illness and injury."
10910195,"ABSTRACT; CORE 1, Facility Management, Maintenance and Operations (FMMO) core
The coordination of research and research support services to ensure safe and efficient performance is central
to all research and public health missions of the Rutgers RBL. Here, we propose to use existing University
support for the RBL along with new funding supported by this UC7 application to combine all RBL support
personnel from several contributing Departments and Divisions into a single expanded Facility Management,
Maintenance and Operations (FMMO) Core. This new core will fundamentally transform our RBL by organizing
the diverse research and facilities support personnel into a single interactive core for improved operations of
critical infrastructure, equipment, and laboratory services to the RBL community. The FMMO core will provide
BSL3 management and oversite, ensure efficient operations and maintenance of the BSL3 facilities, provide
trained staff to support the BSL3 building systems and equipment, and provide routine animal husbandry,
microbiology and virology services in support of investigators grant funded research projects. In Aim 1, we will
re-organize and improve our existing research and facilities support services (working with the BSL3 Practices
Core 2 and the Animal research and specialized service Core 3) into three integrated units to address all aspects
of facilities management, maintenance, and operations In Aim 2, we will develop, implement and monitor a new
robust system for preventative maintenance and life-cycle governed replacement of equipment critical to RBL
functioning."

Relics of mobile DNA make our genomes look like the aftermath of a mob scene. Even worse, some endogenous
retrotransposons did not die out, but rather still swarm our cells early in ontogeny. Their actions can seriously
damage the genome of the nascent embryo and cause sporadic diseases and infertility. Recently, we discovered
a mechanism by which neighboring cells actively remove pluripotent cells that fail to undergo silencing of their
endogenous retrotransposons. Our hypothesis is that there is a conditional policing mechanism reminiscent of a
primitive immune system. We propose that pluripotent stem cells sense the endogenous retroviral load of their
neighboring cells and, if it is higher than their own, act to kill and remove the overloaded cells. Upon completion
of the outlined work, we will have (i) probed a previously unexplored sensing mechanism that involves cells
“sniffing” one another for endogenous retroviruses and the removal of cells that failed to silence their genetic
parasites (Aims 1 and 2) and (ii) tested whether this system is tunable and subject to immune modulation (Aim
3). These outcomes will have a positive impact because they will force us to shift our attention away from solely
cell-intrinsic defense strategies towards considering a much more nuanced system in which cells constantly
monitor one another for endogenous retrotransposon-related health. Our line of investigation will provide new
targets for genetic diagnosis and interventions targeting pregnancy loss and infertility."
10793497,"Abstract/Summary
Everyone is chronically infected by pathogens that are able to evade the host adaptive immune responses. Our
work focuses on the process of antigen recognition by CD8 T cells during chronic viral and parasitic infections
with the goal of determining how these infections avoid T cell immunity. Many chronic infections generate a
robust CD8 effector response that ultimately results in compromised responses and exhausted CD8 T cells
despite persistent levels of antigen. Antigen recognition is governed by the interaction of the T cell receptor
(TCR) with antigenic peptide:MHC (pMHC). These proteins are found in the surface membranes of T cells and
antigen presenting cells. Protein interactions that occur between opposing cells happen within two dimensional
(2D) constraints that pertinently influence the kinetics of the interaction. Kinetic binding parameters such as 2D
TCR affinity and bond lifetime for antigenic pMHC are critical for T cell activation and subsequently dictate T
cell activity. Our revised R01 application builds on our previously published work and preliminary data that
defines the importance of TCR affinity and bond lifetime for pMHC antigen as key parameters that determine T
cell fate. The assessment of the dynamic interaction between the 2D-restricted TCR and pMHC is a novel and
exciting area of research because we, and others, have found that T cells apply force through the TCR:pMHC
bond resulting in alteration in the length of time of antigen recognition. Importantly, our work shows that an
increase in bond lifetime under force is absolutely required for optimal T cell effector functions. Thus, we
hypothesize that chronic infection leads to exhausted T cell responses through reduction in the bond lifetime
and overall strength of antigen recognition. So far, we have generated compelling preliminary data during
chronic viral and parasitic infections. The ensuing work will be undertaken through 3 specific aims that will: 1)
Define T cell effector functions, affinity and bond lifetime under force during chronic infection, 2) Dissect the
role of the CD8 coreceptor in antigen recognition, and 3) Correlate 2D affinity and bond lifetimes with defined
effector functions. The innovative insights generated by our work will provide the base understanding of CD8 T
cell activation/inactivation in the presence of persistent encounters with antigen. Thus in this application, we
seek to understand how changes in 2D kinetics of antigen recognition distinguish competent effectors from
incompetent exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic infections."

The Downstate Clinical Research Scholars Training Program (CREST) will provide a structured program that
prepares nurses and physicians to conduct rigorous research that addresses health disparities and advances
health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic coupled with acts of social injustice all converge to reinforce that
racism is a fundamental driver of racial and ethnic health disparities and requires an urgent response from the
scientific community. Recent NIH funding initiatives have also called for research that examines the impact of
structural racism and discrimination on health disparities. These events provide the rationale for developing
CREST as a health-equity focused research training program. CREST builds upon an established health equity
infrastructure at SUNY Downstate and long-standing community partnerships. Eligible trainees are nurses with
advanced doctoral degrees, post-residents/clinical fellows, and junior faculty from backgrounds that are
underrepresented in biomedical research. CREST will consist of a 2-year didactic curriculum and mentored
research experience component and a 1-year pilot projects component. The curriculum is an established
Master of Public Health in our School of Public Health. It will be delivered via innovative hybrid and hyflex
(evening, synchronous online, asynchronous online, and in-person) modalities. This program has an over 95%
on-time completion rate. Trainees will participate in grant writing workshops as they prepare to submit
applications for the pilot project component. Unique aspects of CREST include an interprofessional learning
environment, formal didactic sessions on applying antiracism, structural competency, and trauma-informed
frameworks in designing research, and opportunities to engage community partners and representatives from
the New York City Department of Health. CREST will be led by an MPI team who have collaborated on NIH
funded training programs and who are dedicated to building a diverse research workforce. This team will
collaboratively implement the following aims 1) provide an equity-focused didactic research curriculum and a
mentored clinical research experience; 2) implement a pilot studies program that serves as a catalyst for
generating preliminary data that can be used in preparation for future career development (K) or research
project (R) grants; 3) establish a CREST-Mentorship Network comprised of local and national mentors who
have a track record of supporting academic, professional, and personal growth and who will foster trainee
capacity for independent research. CREST will yield a critical-mass of clinician scientists who can successfully
compete for funding, conduct disparities research, and advance equity research."
10790182,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Red blood cells (RBCs) are a perfect model to study oxidant stress. RBCs are the most abundant cell in
the body (84% of total human cells) and play an essential role in oxygen transport and thus in the regulation of
all oxygen-dependent metabolic processes. To facilitate this task, RBCs are loaded with hemoglobin (Hb) and
iron. Indeed, 66% of total bodily iron is in RBCs. As a result, the mature RBC faces significant oxidant stress
deriving from iron-dependent Fenton and Haber-Weiss redox chemistry. The lack of nuclei and organelles
prevents RBCs from synthesizing new proteins to replace oxidatively damaged components during the average
lifespan of 120 days in circulation. Every day over 200 billion RBCs are removed from the bloodstream and de
novo generated via erythropoiesis, a process that relies on the uptake of circulating iron in the ferric (oxidized)
state, and its reduction to the ferrous state. This process is catalyzed by the ferrireductase STEAP3 – a
transcriptionally-regulated target of tumor protein p53. Both p53 and STEAP3 are critical to erythropoiesis and
polymorphic in humans, whereby mutations in p53 - occurring in >50% of all cancers, 0.2% of all healthy humans
- are not just inherited, but commonly accumulate during organismal aging or exposure to carcinogens.
In genetic studies on murine models of in vitro aging of RBCs (i.e., under conditions that mimic blood storage
in the blood bank) we have documented that hypermorphic STEAP3 is associated with poor blood storage
quality, owing to increased oxidant stress and elevated lipid peroxidation. Iron-mediated non-apoptotic cell death
via lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, a novel process of cell death investigated extensively in
nucleated cells, but hitherto ignored in iron-loaded RBCs. More than other cells, RBCs rely on antioxidant
systems to keep oxidant stress in check. A key antioxidant system is represented by the soluble tripeptide
glutathione, glutathione-dependent detoxification systems (e.g., glutathione-peroxidase 4 - GPX4 to counteract
lipid peroxidation) and oxidized glutathione recycling via NADPH-dependent enzymes. The main pathway that
sustains NADPH synthesis in RBCs is the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose 6-phoshate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, an X-linked gene that is mutated in ~500 million people.
Oxidant damage to protein triggers formation of isoaspartyl damage, a process counteracted by the enzyme
PIMT. Relevant to this proposal, in other cell types p53 promotes ferroptosis by up-regulation of STEAP3 and
down-regulation of G6PD, while being itself negatively regulated by PIMT. Even though genetic and
pharmacological tools are available to regulate ferroptosis, these approaches are untested in mature RBCs,
which is the focus of this project. Relevance to public health: RBC responses to hypoxia and oxidant stress
regulate hemolysis, an etiological contributor to physio/pathological adaptations to pro-oxidant challenges in vivo
(e.g., high altitude, exercise) or ex vivo, such as blood bank storage of RBCs for transfusion purposes, ranked
1st in the list of breakthroughs in the history of mankind that are credited with saving the most lives."
10804668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Two main issues currently plague the field of transplantation in humans: (i) poor control of chronic rejection
by current immunosuppressive drugs; and (ii) low success of tolerance induction. At the center of these issues
is innate immune memory stemming from both innate allorecognition and trained immunity, which generate a
state of chronic inflammation. Unfortunately, innate immune memory is not specifically targeted by current
immunosuppressive drugs. In addition, commonly used immunosuppressive regimens hinder the much-needed
immune regulation processes required for tolerance by impeding CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg)
homeostasis and suppressor function.
 Thus, a key deficit in the field is a lack of available therapeutics that both target innate immune
memory and promote immune regulation.
 In this regard, our data demonstrate that innate cells are central to Treg suppressor function within
allografts, highlighting the robust relationship between innate cells and Treg. Therefore, we hypothesize that
inhibition of innate immune memory promotes a long-lasting regulatory environment by enhancing
both myeloid regulatory cells (MRCs) and Treg suppressor functions, which protects allograft from
rejection. We will test this in the following AIMs:
 This project will investigate whether inhibition of innate immune memory promotes MRC (AIM 1) and Treg
(AIM 2) regulatory functions in the setting of transplantation. We will use both genetic approaches and novel
nanotherapeutics to specifically inhibit innate allorecognition and trained immunity in transplanted mice, and the
promotion of MRCs and Treg, as well as their immune regulatory functions, will be assessed. These experiments
will enhance our knowledge on the role of innate immune memory in immune regulatory functions, which remains
largely unexplored.
 Importantly, the visualization of MRC and Treg suppressor function using multi-photon intravital microscopy
and the use of novel nanotherapeutics targeting innate immune memory are central in testing these hypotheses.
These AIMs will be accomplished through the collaborative efforts of an interdisciplinary group of experts in the
fields of in nanotherapeutics, intravital microscopy, innate allorecognition trained immunity, and transplant
immunobiology. Therefore, this grant application is dually responsive to this RFA (Emerging Science and
Technology in Transplantation (U01)) as it will both use intravital imaging and targeted therapeutic delivery.
 Overall, new knowledge generated from this grant will: 1) identify molecular targets to inhibit innate immune
memory and promote immune regulatory function; and 2) visualize – at the cellular level, in the living host, and
in real time – MRCs and Treg immune regulation in the setting of transplantation."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), caused by excess accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis), has a global prevalence of 25.2% and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. There are few effective ways to prevent or treat NAFLD making it one of the biggest unmet public health needs of our time. A better understanding of the pathophysiology is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment. NAFLD is a highly heritable disease (20-70%) with prevalence rates that vary across ethnic groups, i.e. individuals of Hispanic ancestry have a higher prevalence than European and African ancestry individuals. One of the first published GWAS was our work from the Genetics of Obesity-associated Liver Disease (GOLD) Consortium identifying five loci associated with computed tomography-measured liver attenuation in European-ancestry populations. Trans ethnic analyses confirmed some associations and also identified ancestry specific alleles suggesting novel disease promoting loci may exist in minority populations. Since known variation explains only 4.8% of the variance in liver attenuation, additional genetic loci that impact predisposition to NAFLD remain to be discovered. The objective of this application is to identify additional rare variants with effects on NAFLD through whole genome sequencing (WGS) in ethnically diverse populations included in NHLBI’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Consortium (n=23,156). We will replicate effects in GOLD cohorts (n=8,865) lacking WGS by imputing GWAS data to the TOPMed reference panel. Implicated genes from these single rare variant and rare variant burden testing analyses will be functionally tested for effects on hepatic steatosis to confirm causality. Our central hypothesis is that rare variants contribute to variation and risk. These WGS identified variants can help prioritize loci that can be targeted for NAFLD therapy. Our long-term goal is to improve the diagnosis, management, treatment and ultimately prevention of NAFLD by understanding the genomic contributions to pathophysiology. Results from our work will help us to understand the genetic architecture of NAFLD and link these associations to genes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a significant public health issue and the leading cause of disability in
young and middle-age adults. The FDA's approval of esketamine nasal spray for TRD and the rapid proliferation
of clinics providing ketamine (KET) has markedly increased numbers of patients receiving these interventions.
However, we lack valid and reliable biological or clinical markers that predict treatment success for an initial
course of KET therapy. Electroencephalography (EEG) gamma band power is a neurophysiological measure of
cortical excitability and synaptic potentiation. These processes are implicated in KET’s mechanism as a NMDA
receptor channel antagonist, making gamma power a candidate biomarker. The broad, long-term objective of
this R21 application is to optimize the rational selection of patients with TRD who benefit from rapid-acting
antidepressant therapies such as KET or esketamine. To achieve this goal, we examine gamma band
potentiation (KET induced power increase) in treatment-seeking TRD patients (N=60) scheduled to receive an
induction course of KET therapy (twice weekly infusions for 4 weeks) from a partner community-based clinic. To
examine gamma potentiation, we conduct a pharmaco-EEG challenge entailing a fixed-order infusion of saline
followed by KET while recording resting-state and evoked gamma oscillatory activity. To characterize the unique
effects of psychotropic medication resistance, we include an age- and sex-matched major depressive disorder
(MDD) group (N=20), and an age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) group (N=20). In AIM 1, we examine
baseline patterns of gamma band power and potentiation in TRD patients compared to MDD and HCs. We
hypothesize that patients with depression (TRD/MDD) will have lower baseline gamma power than HCs, and
that patients with TRD will show greater gamma potentiation in response to KET, compared to non-treatment
resistant MDD patients and HCs. In AIM 2, we determine the relevance of gamma band potentiation to the
antidepressant mechanism of action of KET for TRD patients who receive an induction course of KET therapy.
We hypothesize that greater reduction in depressive symptoms during the induction phase of KET therapy is
associated with a higher level of gamma potentiation in response to the first infusion of KET. An innovative
exploratory aim is to investigate the stability of gamma band potentiation at the midpoint of the KET induction
course of treatment and its relationship with clinical outcomes. This project is significant because the current
trial-and-error approach to TRD therapeutics highlights the urgent need for personalized care. Our study’s
potential to efficiently capture gamma dynamics across a spectrum of depressed patients provides strong
innovation. Finally, this project is impactful because, if successful, it provides a compelling rationale for a larger
prospective investigation of gamma dynamics as a moderator of outcome to varied TRD therapies which impact
the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition."
10800707,"Although close to 85% of residents in long-term care facilities (LTC) have osteoporosis and the risk of
osteoporotic fractures is nearly 10 times that of community dwelling elderly, few are treated and studies are
scarce. The large pivotal osteoporosis trials in postmenopausal women exclude those who are sedentary,
frail or functionally impaired even though this is the group at highest fracture risk. Before a fracture reduction
study can be justified in this cohort, an investigation demonstrating efficacy and predictability is a necessary
first step. We have previously demonstrated that zoledronic acid (ZOL) can maintain bone mineral density
(BMD) and is safe in frail elderly. However a dual action anabolic antiresorptive agent has a distinct
advantage to build bone rapidly. The newly approved once monthly dual action romosozumab (ROMO),
provides significant improvements in BMD and fracture reduction in 1 year. If ROMO were given prior to a
potent antiresorptive medication such as ZOL, this combination (rapid boost over a year with ROMO and
maintain integrity 2nd year with ZOL) could provide a novel treatment paradigm in this high risk population.
The concern for ROMO is the potential increase risk of cardiovascular events demonstrated in one pivotal
study. Before a large fracture reduction trial can be justified in this frail population, a study demonstrating
BMD efficacy and safety is imperative. We will test the hypotheses that in frail institutionalized women,
one year of ROMO prior to one year of ZOL will 1) be more efficacious compared to one year of
calcium plus vitamin D prior to a year of ZOL as demonstrated by improvements in conventional
bone density measurements, 2) improve novel measures of bone trabecular microstructure and bone
turnover markers, and 3) provide characteristics associated with responders and non-responders. To
address these hypotheses, we propose to conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind controlled trial to test
the efficacy and safety of ROMO (year 1) and ZOL (year 2) compared to calcium+vitamin D (year 1) and
ZOL( year 2), in 200 institutionalized frail women age 65+ in LTC. Safety will be carefully monitored.
Serious adverse events (SAE's) will be obtained by a novel electronic alert system that provides real time
notifications including ROMO associated cardiovascular SAE's. This study includes innovative features: 1)
focus on the neglected LTC population of frail residents in whom we have a track record of successful
enrollment, 2) inclusion of a newly approved potent dual action agent feasible in LTC, 3) assessments of
bone structure, 4) point of care vertebral fracture images, 5) mobile lab allowing onsite participation, and 6)
electronic alerts for real time adverse events. Despite the call by national consensus groups for the past
2 decades to address osteoporosis in frail elderly, trials and treatments are sparse. This study will
challenge the current paradigm of avoiding anti-osteoporosis therapy and provide an innovative approach for
geriatric osteoporosis, and help target robust responders."

New treatments for anxiety disorders are critically needed as numerous individuals fail to respond to current
treatments. A more complete understanding of pathological anxiety at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels
will provide a foundation for new treatment development. In this regard, nonhuman primate (NHP) models are
invaluable for understanding mechanisms underlying maladaptive anxiety relevant to stress-related
psychopathology. An important recent advance is the use of chemogenetic methods to modulate the primate
amygdala. This work serves as an initial foundation for treatment development directed at the regulation of
subcortical regions relevant to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.
 As a translational bridge, our laboratory employs methods that provide an in-depth mechanistic
understanding of brain alterations associated with extreme anxiety, including behavioral phenotyping, functional
and structural neuroimaging, RNA sequencing and viral vector-mediated gene delivery. Findings from our
chemogenetic studies using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activation by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) point to
basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons as potential treatment targets. The BLA processes threat-related
information received from cortical and subcortical sources and transmits this information to the extended
amygdala (central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), which activates threat-
related responses via its downstream targets. Within the BLA, inhibitory interneurons modulate the function and
output of longer-range projecting excitatory neurons, which project to the Ce, other subcortical structures, and
posterior orbitofrontal cortex (pOFC). The overall aims of this proposal are to further understand the implications
of amygdala modulation in relation to treatment development focusing on BLA neurons. Neuroimaging and RNA
sequencing (RNA-Seq) will provide insights into mechanisms related to therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, these
studies will serve as a proof-of-concept to understand the feasibility of developing chemogenetic approaches for
the future treatment of severe and refractory psychiatric disorders."

Randomized trials demonstrate aerobic training (AT) attenuates treatment-induced impairments in physiological
and psychosocial outcomes in a broad number of cancer patient populations. However, whether AT specifically
impacts the tolerability of cancer treatment is largely unknown. To address this fundamental knowledge gap in
exercise-oncology research, the objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of AT on treatment
tolerability and related outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) initiating total
neoadjuvant therapy (TNT). LARC is an ideal model in which to conduct a definitive trial of AT on treatment
tolerability for several reasons: (1) high rate of LARC diagnoses annually in the U.S. (>40,000), (2) poor
tolerability of TNT (<60% of patients complete the recommended regimen), and (3) strong biological rationale
(TNT-induced impairment in hematological function is the major cause of poor tolerability, and AT is
demonstrated to enhance hematological function in preclinical and clinical studies). Therefore, in this phase 2
randomized trial, a total of 225 inactive (<60 mins of moderate-intensity exercise/wk) patients with LARC
scheduled to initiate TNT will be stratified by sex (male vs. females) and age (<55 years vs. >55 years) and
randomly allocated (1:1:1 ratio) to receive: 90 mins/week, 150 mins/week, or 300 mins/week from pre-treatment
to pre-surgery (~32 weeks). All AT dose regimens will be prescribed according to standard AT principles and
implemented using our digital AT platform permitting all sessions to be performed in patients’ homes with remote
real-time monitoring. We will address 3 specific aims: AIM 1: Determine dose-response of AT on TNT treatment
tolerability. AIM 2: Evaluate AT dose-response on hematological function. AIM 3: Explore AT dose-response on
tumor clinical outcomes. The proposed study directly addresses an unmet clinical need by testing, for the first
time, the dose-response effects of AT on multiple treatment-related outcomes in patients with LARC receiving
TNT. The proposed study will improve behavioral intervention protocols for patients undergoing cancer treatment
by using our digital exercise approach that expands access to AT for patients not residing within close proximity
of a research site. Receiving cancer treatment is not a qualifying condition for exercise therapy and, as such,
exercise is not currently considered a standard aspect of cancer management. Therefore, if successful, findings
from this investigation will also shift clinical paradigms regarding exercise therapy in cancer by adding to a
growing body of evidence supporting integration of AT into standard clinical cancer care."

10933039,"Mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a dormant state; they are immotile and unable
to fertilize the egg. Upon ejaculation, sperm begin swimming and initiate a process called
capacitation, where they become competent to fertilize. An initial event in capacitation and
activation of motility is the HCO3- induced stimulation of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC: ADCY10).
Men and male mice with the sAC gene knocked out are infertile, and pharmacological inhibitors
specific for sAC block in vitro fertilization and temporarily render male mice infertile. Thus, sAC is
a genetic and pharmacologically validated, non-hormonal target essential for male fertility. The

10803164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of this revised proposal is to address the important unmet need for noninvasive detection
and assessment of liver fibrogenesis, the pathologic process resulting in liver scarring and fibrosis. Fibrosis
is the cumulative end-result of all chronic liver diseases (CLD) that affect ~1.5 billion people globally. This study
will be enabled by using positron emission tomography (PET) through specific in-vivo targeting of the activated
(fibrogenic) hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the cornerstone of liver fibrogenesis and fibrosis.
 While non-invasive techniques for assessment of fibrosis have been developed and validated (e.g., magnetic
resonance elastography, MRE), there is lack of a much-needed non-invasive biomarker to measure fibrogenesis,
which is especially significant in the setting of drug-discovery. Development trials and eventual clinical im-
plementation of antifibrotic drugs require non-invasive detection and quantification of active fibrogenesis. As a
current limitation, assessment of treatment response through measuring fibrosis requires several months due to
the time lag between reduction in fibrogenesis and subsequent decrease in fibrosis. Moreover, even if a drug is
effective, MRE may not detect a change in liver stiffness despite improvement in histologic, serologic, and/or
other imaging markers. Hence, non-invasive assessment of liver fibrogenesis is urgently needed.
 We have demonstrated successful non-invasive preclinical assessment of liver fibrogenesis through a
fundamentally innovative strategy using PET. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is specifically expressed by
activated HSCs. We have demonstrated that in our human-sized model of alcohol-induced liver injury, uptake
of radiolabeled FAP inhibitor (FAPI) on PET directly correlates with fibrogenesis and fibrosis. Moreover, mouse
studies have demonstrated reduced FAP expression with fibrosis reversal. However, there is need for sys-
tematic evaluation of the relationship between FAPI PET and tissue markers of fibrogenesis (1) across all
grades of liver injury, and (2) in both presence and absence of the hepatotoxin. This requires further preclinical
evaluation of FAPI PET in a controlled setting and subsequent translational evaluation in patients. We aim
to (1) Determine the relationship between liver FAPI uptake and tissue markers of fibrogenesis across all stages
of liver injury in our swine model of liver injury; (2) demonstrate that decreasing liver FAPI uptake is a biomarker
for decrease in fibrogenesis and its tissue markers, preceding any reversal in fibrosis; (3) determine the rela-
tionship between liver FAPI uptake and tissue markers of fibrogenesis in a pilot clinical study in CLD patients.
 Successful completion of these aims by our unique and highly qualified multidisciplinary team will lay
the foundation for future clinical trials for definitive validation in patients and to fulfill the unmet need of a non-
invasive biomarker for liver fibrogenesis. The development of this biomarker will have a meaningful impact on
the care of ~1.5 billion people with CLD through (1) facilitating the development of antifibrotic pharmacothera-

10803163,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a highly morbid condition (50% mortality) that occurs in 160,000 Americans each
year, often as a complication of acute myocardial infarction. The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (VA ECMO) is a promising therapy that can provide full cardiopulmonary support to these
patients, enabling survival. VA ECMO may also paradoxically cause harm to the failing heart by flowing 5+
liters per minute of blood retrograde up the aorta against the normal flow of blood out of the heart. The optimal
way to manage patients on VA ECMO for CS is not yet known. The addition of a second device to unload or
decompress the left ventricle of the heart, such as an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), has been shown in
observational studies to improve survival these patients. Future mortality trials are necessary to confirm this
finding, but prior to a mortality trial, the physiologic pathway whereby LV unloading could mediate this survival
benefit needs to be determined—as this is unknown. Preliminary data suggest that LV unloading causes
multiple physiologic effects, including improvements in cardiopulmonary congestion, acute cardiovascular
function, and possibly durable myocardial recovery. These findings have direct implications on the clinical use
of LV unloading and on future trial design, but are limited by sample size, selection bias and confounding. This
R01 proposal will use randomization and high-volume centers to overcome these limitations and accomplish
the following goals: (Aim 1) determine the physiologic effects of adding LV unloading to VA ECMO on
cardiopulmonary congestion; (Aim 2) determine the effects of adding LV unloading to VA ECMO on acute
cardiovascular function; (Exploratory Aim 3) determine whether adding LV unloading to VA ECMO improves
biomarkers predictive of durable myocardial recovery. These data will define the physiologic effect of LV
unloading on cardiopulmonary congestion, cardiovascular function and biomarkers of long-term recovery,
directly informing optimal design for a mortality outcome trial of LV unloading during VA ECMO for CS.
This is an application for a R01 award for Dr. Joseph Tonna, an emergency medicine trained intensivist at the
University of Utah, who was recently promoted to Associate Professor and awarded Tenure. Dr. Tonna is a
young investigator in his last year of a NIH NHLBI Career Development Award (1K23HL141596) who is
establishing himself as a clinical trialist in the application and validation of rescue therapies such as ECMO.
This R01 award uses pragmatic outcomes and an innovative and rigorous design to mechanistically answer
the question of how LV unloading works; the results will define the physiologic pathways by which LV
unloading affects the observed outcome differences from observational studies. To achieve these goals, Dr.
Tonna has assembled a diverse and complementary team comprising experts in critical care, cardiogenic
shock, myocardial recovery, LV unloading, echocardiography, biomarkers and clinical trials."
10803237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All of brain function, from sensory perception to behavior, is derived from the pattern and properties of the
synaptic connections among billions (in humans) of individual neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to
understand molecular pathways that regulate electrical synapse formation in vivo. Electrical synapses are sites
of direct communication between neurons, formed by gap junctions, that allow the passage of ions and small
molecules. They contribute extensively to neural circuit formation and function, both during development as
well in adulthood, acting in sensory perception, central processing, and motor output. Moreover, they are
thought to be disrupted in numerous human disorders, such as autism, epilepsy, and myopia. A major gap in
the field is that the molecular mechanisms controlling the formation of electrical synapses are poorly
understood. This proposal utilizes the zebrafish Mauthner circuit to investigate the genetics, cell biology, and
biochemistry of electrical synapse formation and function. Mauthner neurons are individually identifiable and
their pre- and postsynaptic partners, synapses, and function are exquisitely visualized in a living, vertebrate
embryo. Using the genetic accessibility of zebrafish, we have found that a family of membrane-associated
guanylate kinase scaffolds, the “ZO-family”, are required for gap junction channel localization and electrical
synapse function. These findings suggest that electrical synapses are comprised of an emerging molecular
complexity, and our goal is to uncover the cellular and molecular functions of the ZO-family in building
functional neuronal gap junctions. Aim1 will determine how the ZO-family proteins direct the cell biological
construction of electrical synapses in vivo. Aim2 will identify the molecular interactions utilized by the ZO-family
proteins in directing electrical synapse formation in vivo. Aim3 will reveal the functional impacts of ZO-family
proteins on synaptic transmission and behavior. The proposed studies will provide novel insight into the
mechanisms of electrical synapse formation and provide a foundation for the identification of therapeutic
targets for complex neurodevelopmental disorders."

Laband real-world validation of a system for monitoring ingestive behavior
Project Summary:
Population-based and short-term laboratory findings demonstrate eating behaviors linked to overeating and
excess body weight can be modified to reduce energy intake and enhance satiety. These findings suggest that
slowing specific ingestive behaviors (IB; bites, chews, oral processing) may thus be effective for healthy body
weight management. However, no accurate automated methodology exists to measure these combined IB
outside laboratories, in people's free-living, real-world settings. Thus, the central goal of the proposed project
is to validate and test a wearable device assembly pairing two validated instruments that can provide these
measurements with good accuracy and low participant burden. One is a wrist-worn bite counter, which detects
the wrist-roll motion associated with placing food in the mouth, tracking bite number and bites per minute for
each eating episode. The other is a discreet chewing sensor adhered to the skin over the condyle bone, to
detect chewing frequency and duration, as well as oral processing. Combined, these sensors can provide data
on chew-to-bite ratio (which has implications in energy intake and satiety) and can capture overall eating
episodes and IB with more precision than a single device alone. The project includes laboratory aims,
supported by two studies for device assembly validation across a range of foods, beverages, utensils and
eating styles, along with real-world aims, supported by three studies that progress from semi-controlled to true
free-living settings in people's everyday lives. These will include restaurants, cafeterias, work, school, and
home lives. Device assembly data will be compared to multiple established ground truth measures such as
video, the universal eating monitor, observation, and self-reports. Participants will represent a broad range of
body mass index, adult ages, genders, and race/ethnicity, with over-representation from LatinX communities,
who experience higher incidence of obesity and associated health conditions. Our multi-disciplinary team
includes a nutritionist specializing in eating behaviors associated with obesity, a psychologist specializing in
behavior monitoring through wearable technologies and longitudinal analysis, and a computer engineer
specializing in wearable devices to detect IB. Scientific
automated
impacts f this project lie in developing a tool to enable
long-term free-living data collection on behaviors vital for weight management.
o
Health impacts lie in
potentially equipping people with a passive self-monitoring tool for improving eating behaviors and diet, with
minimal participant burden, yet optimizing impact through targeting key IB. Thus, promising multi-disciplinary
laboratory findings will be moved to free-living settings with a user-friendly non-invasive digital device
assembly, allowing for self-monitoring. The
management
ultimate goal is t o facilitate evidence-based personalized weight
programs leveraging real-world modification of eating behavior that are scalable to large
populations."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health problem in the United States, with overdoses and deaths
currently maintaining at epidemic levels. As risk of overdose is highest following relapse and treatment dropout,
improved mechanistic understanding of risk and protective factors in individuals currently receiving medications
for OUD (MOUD) is urgently needed. To address this, this Cutting-Edge, Basic Science Award (CEBRA)
application moves beyond the limitations of traditional case-control designs to rapidly advance our understanding
of the neural mechanisms of early MOUD treatment.
 For decades, clinical neuroimaging has relied on case-control designs in which individuals with a given
psychiatric disorder are compared to a group of matched healthy ‘control’ individuals, or a group of individuals
distinguished by another individual difference feature. While informative, these approaches by definition focus
on group average deviations from a presumed normative population and thus may have relatively limited real
world clinical utility. For example, recent findings from machine learning studies of addictions and other disorders
indicate that brain networks which distinguish patients from controls are often distinct from brain networks that
predict specific clinical outcomes within-group. This striking distinction suggests that person-specific
neurobiology is dissociable from group-specific patterns, and thus group-specific findings are unlikely to translate
to an improved understanding of person-specific pathophysiology or to treatment.
 Our innovation, the characterization of neural trajectories during MOUD treatment using dense sampling
(i.e., repeated longitudinal assessments of the same individual) will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight
into the neurobiological basis of OUD remission. Dense sampling is an emerging methodology that aims to
overcome limitations with cross-sectional research that inherently assumes the brain is static and unchanging.
This approach is particularly relevant to studying MOUD treatment: MOUD is multiphasic, comprised of
medication induction, stabilization, ongoing treatment and eventual discontinuation phases. However, with a few
small exceptions, existing neuroimaging efforts are almost exclusively single time-point assessments which, by
definition, fail to capture dynamic trajectories of individual risk and resilience that can be used to mechanistically
inform treatment advancements. This pilot project therefore applies dense sampling to characterize early
trajectories of MOUD recovery at unprecedented temporal resolution—i.e., bi-weekly over three months. To
maximize mechanistic insight, complementary clinical and behavioral computational data will also be acquired
longitudinally. Borrowing from basic human neuroscience, our dense sampling neuroimaging approach
represents a paradigm shift for psychiatry research in general, and holds enormous potential to inform
understanding of opioid use disorder remission specifically."
10806992,"The Ramapough Turtle Clan Chief states that, “Return of healthy soil on our farm will allow healthy plant
production, resulting in healthy foods to nurture our bodies and mind with optimum results.” Native Tribes have
been, and continue to be, exposed to disproportionate amounts of toxic waste as a product of decades of
environmental injustice. Emerging from this disastrous situation are Native Americans (NA) who face an even
greater risk of adverse health outcomes from contaminated soil that grows tainted traditional food sources,
degraded recreational water sources leading to isolation and a loss of sovereignty, community strength and
resiliency. Such is the case for the Ramapough Lunaape Turtle Clan members in northern NJ who live on a
500-acre toxic waste site generated by over a decade of industrial dumping of thousands of gallons of paint
sludge with high levels of heavy metals and solvents. As no culturally-meaningful solutions have been
implemented for the Ramapough community that could promote public health and well-being to date, we will
build on our equitable 8-year-long Tribal-academic partnerships with this Tribal Nation to advance tradition-
centered, evidence-based best practice strategies for sustainable environmental food systems that address
food insecurity, nutritional deficiency, and chronic disease health outcomes among this community
disproportionately affected by environmental contamination. Three Specific Aims and several sub-aims are
proposed to test the hypothesis that a complex array of factors including soil, water and plant contamination,
psychosocial stressors, displacement and environmental assaults to the land have led to a loss of food
sovereignty and sustainability; and, that food security and cultural food practices can be renewed through a
community-engineered farming system and educational strategies to: 1) Assess the extent of environmental
contamination, individual toxicant burdens and micronutrient levels and health disorders in Ramapough Tribal
members of both sexes; 2) Adapt and implement a community-centered farming program on the Munsee
Three Sisters Medicinal Farm land informed by a design studio approach; and 3) Assess the development
process and early outcomes of the farm program using an implementation science framework and refine the
public health action plan for dissemination to reduce food insecurity, regain food sovereignty, and improve
community health. This project will identify and implement safe and nutritious farming practices and restore
food sovereignty among an environmentally-impacted and marginalized semi-urban Tribal Nation through
development of a farming system program supported by the Turtle Clan-founded Munsee Three Sisters
Medicinal Farm. This innovative study will integrate a culturally-centered, environmental road map created from
community input for food sovereignty and sustainability that can be shared and disseminated to other
environmentally-impacted Nations leading to an environmental public health action plan based on our research
findings."
10784564,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ascaris (roundworm) is the most prevalent helminth in the world infecting millions of people living in poverty-
stricken, parasite-endemic regions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ascaris infects children early
in life and has a highly immunogenic larval migratory phase through the lungs before returning to the intestines
and developing into adult worms. High Ascaris worm burden and significant re-infection rates in children causes
profound life-long morbidity. Using our Ascaris mouse model, our lab discovered that transient Ascaris larval
migration through the lungs leads to chronic structural and functional changes consistent chronic lung disease.
Chronic lung disease in the mouse model was associated with sustained concentrations of Th2 and Th17 cells
in the lungs suggesting on-going immune activation despite infection resolution. The data suggest Ascaris may
be a contributing risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease in parasite-endemic areas. However,
despite our robust Ascaris mouse model findings, mice are a non-native host for ascariasis. Evaluating Ascaris-
induced chronic lung disease in human clinical trials is ideal but challenging due to the complexity of the parasitic
life cycle and the lack of sustainable long-term resources in parasite-endemic regions. In addition to humans,
domestic pigs are a native host for Ascaris spp. Additionally, due to similar lung anatomy, physiology and
immunologic responses pigs are used routinely as animal models of human disease. Furthermore, like human
ascariasis, Ascaris is the most prevalent helminth infection in pigs and has significant consequences on porcine
health. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a novel, translational porcine model of ascariasis to
evaluate the long-term consequences of Ascaris larval migration through the native host lungs. We hypothesize
that Ascaris larval migration through the lungs of a native host will cause Ascaris-induced chronic lung disease.
The first aim will evaluate the impact of Ascaris larval migration on lung function and structure longitudinally in a
porcine model. We will use human grade physiologic monitoring systems and histopathology to determine
Ascaris-induced chronic lung disease. In the second aim we will characterize the immunologic milieu in the lungs
longitudinally following Ascaris larval migration in a porcine model. Using immunologic assays and RNA
sequencing we will identify key immunologic pathways involved in Ascaris-induced chronic lung disease. This
“One Health” model will provide important information regarding the impact of Ascaris larval migration on both
humans and pigs, leading to improved health within the shared environment. Our findings will be used to identify
novel therapeutic targets to prevent ascariasis in both humans and pigs in parasite-endemic regions globally."
10800045,"Abstract: The L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2 is responsible for the excitation-contraction
coupling of bladder smooth muscle (BSM), making it an attractive drug target for the treatment of lower urinary
tract symptoms (LUTS). Nifedipine, a Cav1.2 antagonist, inhibits BSM contraction. However, trials of nifedipine
and other calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for LUTS patients were unsuccessful. On the contrary,
cardiologists and epidemiologists have consistently reported that intake of CCBs like nifedipine causes higher
voiding frequency and worsen the severity of LUTS in patients. The mechanism of this mystery has never been
answered, which hampers its application as a useful drug target for LUTS treatment. We have discovered that
ketamine functions as a Cav1.2 antagonist to cause ketamine cystitis - a painful bladder syndrome presenting
as frequency, small voids, and incontinence. We have discovered that intravesical infusion of nifedipine or
ketamine directly induces voiding frequency in mice. Conversely, Cav1.2 agonist induces fewer but larger
voids, suggesting Cav1.2 agonists as potential novel therapeutics for LUTS. In addition to BSM, we have
further discovered the presence of Cav1.2 in urothelium, and urothelial specific deletion of Cav1.2 (UCav1.2-/-)
in mice results in dramatic voiding frequency, small bladder capacity, and diminished voiding efficiency, a
phenotype closely resembles that produced by intravesical infusion of nifedipine in mice, and the symptoms of
patients with ketamine cystitis or CCB users, indicating a crucial role of Cav1.2 in urothelial function and
bladder pathology. We propose that disruption of Cav1.2 signaling causes deficient urothelial exocytosis and
reduced bladder capacity, which leads to abnormal mechanosensation by elevated ATP signaling and result in
voiding frequency. We will test our hypothesis by the following two aims: Aim 1. We will define bladder storage
abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice by studying Cav1.2 regulated umbrella cell (UC) exocytosis. We will use
videocystometry and electrophysiology to determine UC exocytosis and bladder urodynamics, and test its
Cav1.2- and AC-cAMP-PKA- dependence. We will further manipulate Cav1.2 expression by gene silence or
knockin specifically in UCs, to determine whether it can rescue the voiding abnormalities observed in UCav1.2-
/- mice or induces a phenotype resembling UCav1.2-/- in wild type mice. Aim 2. We will define urothelial
mechanosensory/voiding abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice. We will test whether mechanosensation is altered in
UCav1.2-/- mice by abnormal urothelial ATP signaling. We will further test whether elevated urothelial ATP
signaling by ablation of ATP hydrolase Entpd3 in urothelium leads to voiding frequency as proposed in
UCav1.2-/- mice. In brief, our data indicate a crucial role of Cav1.2 in regulating bladder storage and voiding
function, supporting a novel mechanism on urothelial Cav1.2-mediated exocytosis and ATP signaling. A
complete understanding of this mechanism should answer the longstanding question of why Cav1.2
antagonists are of no benefit for LUTS patients, and potentially leads to novel therapeutics for LUTS treatment."
10800046,"Metasurface based chromatic confocal endoscope
Endoscopy is an indispensable diagnostic tool for imaging hard-to-reach regions inside the body. Confocal endo-
microscopy, with its capability of cellular imaging resolution, optical sectioning, and three-dimensional imaging,
has proved to be a valuable tool in health diagnosis, including cancer screening. However, the traditional design
approach used in current confocal endo-microscopes, which involves using multiple discrete optical elements
such as objective lenses and prisms, leads to bulky size and high cost. Moreover, the lateral mechanical
scanning in the distal end presents a significant challenge, limiting the imaging speed and hindering its broader
applicability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a meta-photonic design approach that empolys a
metasurface, an artificial ultrathin metamaterial consisting of subwavelength nanostructures, to realize spectral
encoding for wavelength division multiplexed confocal imaging and to integrate all necessary functionalities,
including high-numerical-aperture focusing, into a single ultracompact device. This new type of metasurface-
based chromatic confocal endo-microscope will have a miniature distal end that can be integrated with a
conventional endoscope, and it will have a low cost potential for mass production. Importantly, the proposed
confocal endo-microscope has high imaging speed by eliminating one lateral scanning (Aim 1) or both lateral
scannings (Aim 2). We will develop a metasurface that integrates the dual functions of an objective lens and a
grating. The metasurface will be directly fabricated on a silica coreless fiber spacer that is epoxied to a
cantilevered single-mode fiber, resulting in a miniature confocal endo-microscope probe of just 400 μm in
diameter. Different wavelengths of broadband illumination light delivered through the single-mode fiber (which
also behaves as a confocal pinhole) will be focused by the metasurface linearly along a selected lateral direction,
enabling parallel confocal imaging of multiple lateral points simultaneously. The other lateral direction will be
scanned by using a piezotube to achieve real-time imaging speed (30 frames per second). We will also design
a spatial-spectral encoding metasurface that focuses each wavelength to form a random array of focal spots
across a two-dimensional (2D) area. Different wavelengths sample the 2D image with different random sampling
focal spots. The proposed strategy is thus an analogue of the compressive single-pixel camera, in which each
wavelength is an effective single-pixel detector, and a spectrum represents a series of multiplexed
measurements. The proposed metasurface will enable 2D compressive confocal imaging and eliminate lateral
scanning, leading to a detector-limited imaging speed (up to KHz). The proposed metasurfaces will be fabricated
and characterized. Lateral and axial resolutions of the proposed confocal endo-microscope will be quantified.
Imaging speed and field of view will also be characterized. We will also demonstrate and validate the proposed
systems by imaging tissue phantoms."
10792868,"Abstract
 There is a fundamental gap in understanding how mutations on P301 of tau cause memory impairment in
fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). One pathological mechanism involves the association of aberrant tau with
ribosomal complexes. However, the consequences of this interaction are unknown. The long-term goal of this
work is to better understand the link between tau P301 mutations and memory impairment in FTD. The objective
of this proposal is to determine the impact of mutant tau on translation. We will use human brain tissues as well
as in vitro and in vivo models to study ribosomes in isolation, translation in cells, and brain pathophysiology in
mice. Our preliminary results substantiate that the association between tau and ribosomal complexes impair
protein synthesis. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that pathological tau inhibits translation of proteins critical
for memory. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the tau-mediated mechanism of
ribosomal dysfunction will aid in the design of therapeutic targets for FTD, which currently afflict a vast amount
of individuals. Our strong preliminary data serves as support for testing the hypotheses that 1) pathological tau
engages with different parts of the ribosome, 2) translational repression is present in various in vivo tau
models. and 3) the ribosomes’ affinity for transcripts, capacity, and efficiency are impaired in human FTD
brains. These aims have the potential of extrinsic merit to be used as screening tools for modulators of ribosomal
function. Our approach is innovative because it incorporates novel assays, which offer excellent sensitivity that
is not achievable by more traditional approaches. This work is significant because it departs from the status quo
by testing a new mechanism in which translation dysfunction mediates tauopathic symptoms. This work is
expected to advance the field by filling the gap in understanding of tau-mediated brain dysfunction. This
knowledge will serve to better characterize the link between tau and memory impairment in order to develop
novel therapeutic strategies."

10793608,"PROJECT SUMMARY (BASIC SCIENCE CORE)
Developing new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics to combat the TB epidemic requires increased
understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. Achieving these goals will require an influx of new
investigators trained in basic and advanced TB methods, as well as access to highly specialized facilities and
equipment. The primary goal of the Basic Science Core is to provide the consultation and training necessary to
equip investigators with the expertise and tools needed to advance the field. The Basic Science Core will focus
on new investigators (NIs) at the start of their careers and more established scientists who are new to TB

conducting research in clinical epidemiology, clinical trials, implementation science, and disease modeling, while
also developing strong global health programs and partnerships in TB-endemic countries. The Clinical and
Translational Science Core (“CTSC”) will educate and train new and early-stage investigators, including people
working in TB-endemic countries, and individuals from underrepresented minority groups, in critical areas of
clinical TB research. The CTSC will coordinate with the other SEA-TRAC Cores to leverage the multi-disciplinary
expertise available and engage non-TB investigators who may bring novel perspectives and advanced methods
to TB research. The CTSC will leverage existing biorepositories to catalyze TB research and generate
preliminary data using the vast UW research network that includes field sites in Latin America, sub-Saharan
Africa, and Asia. The CTSC will be to provide expertise for a broad array of clinical research topics, provide
shared research support for resources, services and training, and to strengthen TB clinical research through
domestic and international collaborations through three specific aims: (1) to strengthen clinical and translational
TB research through training and consultation in clinical science methodology and support of local collaborations;
(2) to strengthen TB clinical research by developing and expanding partnerships with national and international
collaborators conducting clinical and translational research in TB; and (3) Aim 3. To foster and catalyze
collaborations with investigators with established cohorts, robust clinical databases, and biospecimens for
advancing basic, translation, and clinical TB research. The CTSC will also maintain an intensive one-week
advanced TB research summer course. Overall, the CTSC will foster collaborations between SEA-TRAC

in generated pilot study data, and more collaborative TB grant submissions over a 5-year period."
10798162,"Endothelial cells (ECs) form a dynamic interface between the blood and underlying tissue. Consistent with 
their specialized functions across vascular beds and the ability to rapidly respond to different 
(patho)physiological stimuli, ECs are both remarkably heterogeneous and highly metabolically active. 
Furthermore, given its strategic location the endothelium plays a key role in inflammation, which underlies 
many human diseases. Recent studies have shown that inflammation-induced EC dysfunction coincides with 
changes in metabolic pathways, particularly enhanced glycolysis. As a result, cells can accumulate metabolic 
intermediates such as acetyl-CoA. In addition to their known roles in metabolism, these metabolites are also 
important in mediating epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation, and thereby regulate cell function. 
While histone modifications are in principle reversible, they can be retained and lead to cellular memory. This 
is not only important for cell type identity, but also plays a role in innate immunity. However, whether 
inflammation-induced metabolic reprogramming in ECs can directly affect epigenetic modifications and cell 
function, and/or lead to cellular memory, is not known. Therefore, this project proposes two specific aims to 
test the hypothesis that inflammation-induced endothelial cell dysfunction is mediated by increased glycolysis 
and histone acetylation, which can subsequently lead to a sustained epigenetic signature. Aim 1 will evaluate 
the in vivo effects of acute inflammation on cellular function in an EC-specific manner using various metabolic 
phenotyping and high-throughput sequencing approaches, both in the absence and presence of a glycolysis 
inhibitor. In addition, targeted spatial transcriptomics will be employed to determine the contribution of distinct 
EC subsets in inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. In aim 2 we will perform in vitro assays using 
human ECs to further study the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic 
modifications under inflammatory conditions, and determine whether these modifications can be retained and 
lead to cell memory. The results obtained in this project will provide valuable insights into EC (dys)function, 
and have the potential to identify therapeutic targets for metabolism- and/or epigenetic-centric treatment of 
inflammation-related disorders."
10795667,"This proposal will investigate the role of the selenium (Se)-recycling enzyme, selenocysteine lyase 
(Scly), in combination with high fructose and dietary Se deficiency impacts cardiac function. Se 
deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders including type 2 
diabetes (T2D) and atherosclerosis. A driver of cardiometabolic disorders such as T2D in humans is the 
overconsumption of fructose. High dietary fructose has been shown to induce insulin resistance, oxidative 
stress and cardiac lipid species such as triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols that are associated with 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), In most tissues, Se maintains redox homeostasis by controlling the 
levels of selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidases 1 and 4 (GPX1 and GPX4) and thioredoxin 
reductases 1 and 2 (TXNRD1 and TXNRD2), that curb reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in the case 
of GPX4, regulates ferroptosis. However, it is unknown if Scly modulates Se and selenoprotein levels in 
the heart, especially upon exposure to a high- fructose diet. In Se-dependent tissues such as the liver, 
especiallywhen Se is limiting, selenoprotein degradation may become a source of Se for selenoproteins, 
i.e. Se recycling, a reaction carried out by the enzyme selenocysteine lyase (Scly). The experiments in 
this proposal will determine how the heart metabolizes and recycles Se, impacting selenoprotein levels 
and activity, and overall heart function in Se- deficient states combined with a high fructose diet. Aim 1 
will determine if Se recycling is activated in the heart in response to a high fructose diet. Aim 2 will 
determine if Scly action reduces oxidative stress and ferroptosis in Se-deficient cardiomyocytes. The 
overall impact of this proposal is to understand how Se metabolism and recycling in the heart regulates 
local Se levels and modulates heart physiology in a high fructose environment. This will guide 
improvements on nutritional recommendations with Se supplementation or aid in the use of nanoparticle 
therapeutics to treat CVD."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, monogenetic kidney
disorder, affecting approximately 300,000 Americans1, 2. ADPKD primarily results from mutations
in PKD1 and PKD23. The pathophysiology of ADPKD is incompletely understood and treatment
options are limited. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) – defined by a length >200 nucleotides and
absence of a long open reading frame – are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs implicated in a
range of disease4, 5. They have emerged as an exciting new drug target category for many
common conditions6. However, the role of lncRNAs in ADPKD has been understudied. In a recent
study, we found that the lncRNA Pvt1 is highly upregulated in mouse and humans with ADPKD7.
Pvt1 is a known oncogenic lncRNA that is overexpressed in many cancers and regulates Myc,
other transcription factors, and multiple miRNAs, some of which have major functions in ADPKD8-
11. The role of Pvt1 in ADPKD is not known. We developed a Pkd1-mutant mouse metanephric
organ culture (MOC) as a cost-effective model to manipulate gene expression and identify targets
that modulate cystogenesis7. We discovered that self-complementary adeno-associated virus
(scAAV), serotype DJ, is highly effective in transducing epithelial cells of the mouse MOC. We
used scAAV/DJ shRNA to knockdown Pvt1 in Pkd1-null MOCs. We noted that knockdown of Pvt1
markedly reduced cyst index and downregulated c-MYC protein levels in Pkd1-null kidneys.
Based on these promising findings, we propose the following aims: 1) test whether ablation of
Pvt1 ameliorates cystogenesis in mouse ADPKD, and 2) determine the contribution of PVT1 in
human ADPKD by silencing PVT1 in kidney organoids derived from PKD1-mutant hESCs. If
successful, results from this study will confirm pathogenic upregulation of PVT1 in-vivo ADPKD,
which will form the basis of R01 application."
10789051,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than two million individuals are currently incarcerated in correctional facilities in the United States, and
over half these individuals have a significant mental health problem. Despite the widespread need for mental
health treatment in prisons, resources in this setting are extremely limited and most facilities are unable to
provide adequate care. Hence, low-cost and scalable mental health treatment options are urgently needed for
the prison population. Self-help workbooks are one such viable option. In non-incarcerated populations, self-
help workbooks have shown efficacy in decreasing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as
increasing mindfulness and acceptance skills. Moreover, our preliminary data on treatment preferences among
incarcerated individuals indicate a preference for self-administered workbooks relative to other treatment
formats (e.g., group or individual therapy with counselors). A self-help workbook for Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be particularly well suited to the prison environment. ACT aims to increase
psychological flexibility, the ability to choose prosocial and value-based behavior, even if psychological barriers
(e.g., anger, shame, maladaptive beliefs, etc.) are present. ACT self-help workbooks have been proven
efficacious in reducing mental health burden in non-incarcerated populations. Moreover, studies of ACT group
therapy in correctional settings have demonstrated feasibility as well as a variety of positive mental health
outcomes. Hence, an ACT self-help workbook may be highly feasible, acceptable, and efficacious format for
mental health treatment in the prison setting. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pilot test of an ACT
self-help workbook tailored specifically for the prison setting. Based on feedback from key stakeholders
(incarcerated people and prison officials), we will make two main adaptations to the most widely used and
empirically supported ACT workbook, in order to make it more acceptable and effective for the prison
population: 1) reduce the reading level and 2) increase the personal relevance of the content (e.g., examples
and exercises that are relevant to the prison setting). This project features a unique partnership between
stakeholders (incarcerated individuals and corrections staff) and academic experts in forensic psychology and
ACT. Our proposed research is directly responsive to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PAR-21-131,
as it will adapt and test an intervention with demonstrated efficacy in a broader (and severely underserved)
target population. As per the FOA, our study will include a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to inform a future larger-scale study. This study is novel in its use
of stakeholder input to tailor a self-help intervention specifically for the prison setting. Successful completion of
this pilot project will support a future larger-scale RCT evaluating the effectiveness of the workbook in prison. If
proven clinically effective, widespread dissemination of the workbook could dramatically increase access to
mental healthcare for a severely underserved population."
10934494,"Traumatic injuries caused more than 200,000 deaths and the loss of 2 Million potential life years in the US in
2019. Black, Hispanic, rural, and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of injury incidence
and mortality. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting systematic inequities in access to trauma
care are a substantial driver of these injury disparities, but current evidence does not identify or quantify
specific system-level interventions that might reduce health disparities. We propose the following aims to
identify strategies to mitigate disparities in trauma outcomes:
Aim 1: Examine approaches to trauma system planning in states without disparities in trauma
outcomes. We will conduct a series of in-depth case studies with a purposive sample of state trauma systems
(n=10) identified based on injury mortality trends from 2000-2020. Using document review and semi-structured
interviews with stakeholders responsible for trauma system planning in each state (e.g., medical directors,
nurse managers), we will examine the overall approach to trauma system planning, and specifically probe for
planning decisions intended to address disparities.
Aim 2: Identify modifiable trauma system characteristics associated with injury disparities and
decompose the structural pathways causing injury disparities. We will conduct a national survey of state
trauma systems to identify existing trauma system resources (e.g., infrastructure, personnel), then link survey
responses with outcomes data from the Centers for Disease Control and the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality. After identifying trauma system characteristics associated with injury outcomes among disparities
populations, we will use mediation pathway models to decompose the effects of trauma system resource
allocation as a determinant of injury disparities.
Aim 3: Identify and prioritize strategies to mitigate injury disparities through trauma system planning
and resource allocation. We will conduct a Delphi consensus panel with national stakeholders, in partnership
with the Coalition for National Trauma Research (CNTR). We will ask panelists to evaluate and prioritize
recommendations trauma system interventions to mitigate disparities, drawing from the results of Aims 1 and
2, and from the literature.
Impact of proposed work: Our proposed work will facilitate equity in trauma care by contextualizing current
approaches to trauma systems planning, identifying specific trauma care resources that mediate injury
disparities, and identifying actionable strategies to address disparities at the trauma system level. Our
partnerships with national trauma leaders will support dissemination and implementation throughout the US."

My lab studies the mechanistic basis, and functional consequences, of ion channels, particularly inward
rectifier (Kir) and ATP-sensitive (KATP) potassium channels, found throughout the cardiovascular system. Our
work integrates studies at multiple levels, from the fundamental molecular basis of channel activity to animal
models of pathologies associated with human disease. We are interested in how channels are constructed and
function, how they regulate individual smooth and cardiac muscles, and how altered channel function
contributes to the pathological consequences of aberrant function in the cardiovascular system. We have
developed the capability to purify and to analyze channel proteins structurally, biochemically and functionally. This
allows us to develop and address exciting new questions and hypotheses regarding the fundamental basis of Kir
and KATP channel activity. KATP channels link metabolism to electrical activity in cardiac and smooth muscle and we
have discovered how mutations in these KATP channel genes cause distinct human diseases. Cantu syndrome is
caused by gain-of-function in vascular KATP channels, and associated with multiple pathological consequences,
including reduced systemic vascular resistance, increased cardiac size and output, persistent fetal circulation,
pericardial effusion, lymphedema, decreased vascular compliance and decreased gut motility. Unique cellular and
animal models, as well as a unique research clinic, provide the tools for us to explain such features, and to
develop appropriate therapies. Our recent work leads us to new hypotheses which will be explored using multiple
cell biological and physiological approaches in cells, animals, and humans to reach a full understanding of the
nature and role of KATP dependent excitability in regulation of cardiovascular function. These studies form the
background to the development of novel pharmacological approaches and of appropriate specific therapies for
KATP-dependent pathologies."
10790921,"Abstract
The CDC reports that ~10% of pregnant women drink alcohol (exposing the fetus to prenatal
alcohol exposure) as do ~26% of 12th grade students (adolescent alcohol exposure). Either
exposure alone induces a variety of persistent outcomes in cognition and proinflammatory
signaling in humans and animal models. Prenatal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for
adolescent and adult drinking, adolescent drinking is a risk factor for adult drinking, and adult
drinking is a risk factor for prenatal alcohol exposure, thereby creating a cycle of exposure and
use that can perpetuate alcohol use disorder and harmful drinking across the lifespan. Emerging
studies show that two developmental insults (“double-hit”) in an individual exacerbate outcomes.
We propose to test the hypothesis that the “double-hit” of prenatal + adolescent alcohol
exposure worsens cognitive outcomes in rodent models and to investigate two potential
mechanisms that underlie these effects: loss of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain
that are critical for cognition and gliosis indicative of neuroinflammatory priming. Dr. Mooney’s
lab has experience with the prenatal alcohol exposure model and studying gliosis and Dr.
Robinson’s lab has experience with the adolescent alcohol exposure model and the role of
acetylcholine-positive neurons. This project will generate the “double-hit” model of prenatal +
adolescent alcohol exposure in mice and rats. After phenotyping the effect of exposure on
cognitive behavior, brain sections will be assessed for differences in cholinergic and glial
phenotype. The models developed in this proposal will be of use to us and other researchers to
investigate mechanisms that underlie or contribute to the cycle of alcohol use and exposure
across the lifespan, and understanding the mechanisms will allow identification of therapeutic
targets and optimal windows for interventions to break the cycle."

This project focuses on whether the COVID-19 pandemic has put the well-established Hispanic
infant health advantage in peril. The U.S. Hispanic population has been one of the hardest hit by
the COVID-19 pandemic with some of the highest rates of hospitalization, death, and illness,
due in large part to overrepresentation in frontline occupations. The adult mortality impact on the
Hispanic American population has been stark—Hispanic life expectancy experienced the largest
decline across all racial/ethnic groups, with the exception of non-Hispanic AIAN population. The
impact on infant health, however, is not yet known. We leverage U.S. Natality data (2015-2022)
to first determine whether Hispanic perinatal outcomes have been impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, for the overall population and disaggregating by three critical sources of
heterogeneity in the Hispanic population—nativity, region-of-origin, and maternal education
level. Second, given pronounced temporal and geographic variation in the pandemic’s
progression, we determine whether impacts vary at the county-level and by county-level disease
burden. Third, we assess whether either county poverty level and/or Hispanic concentration
moderates the identified impacts. Determining if, for whom, and in what context, the Hispanic
birth advantage has been impacted by the pandemic is critical for determining where to focus
resources, not just at birth, but also at other stages of child development. Establishing these
patterns is a fundamental piece of a full accounting of the extent of the pandemic’s toll on our
country, particularly how it altered the health of such hard-hit U.S. sub-populations as Hispanic
Americans."

Core 3: Biocontainment Research Support Services Core
The objective of the Biocontainment Research Support Services Core (BRSSC, Core 3) is to provide sustainable
research resources that facilitate the pre-clinical development of medical countermeasures against emerging
and re-emerging pathogens. To achieve this, the BRSSC provides world-class resources in the priority areas of
aerobiology, animal modeling, immunology, imaging, and microbiology for BSL-3 bacterial and viral pathogens.
The BRSSC serves the needs of MU as well as NIAID and the RBL-NBL network by focusing its capabilities to
provide technical expertise under BSL-3 containment for NIAID priority pathogens and the evaluation of novel
vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics. The BRSSC closely collaborates with other relevant Research Services
at MU, including but not limited to the NIH-funded Resource and Research Centers for Mutant Mouse, Rat, and
Swine to develop and refine novel transgenic animal models for priority pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The
technical staff of the BRSSC is a dedicated team for conducting and supporting experiments using advanced
technology, high-precision instrumentation on live samples. Added layers of primary and secondary containment
allow for safe handling and usage of the unique support services that are offered in the BRSSC. For example,
direct access from the vivarium to the class III glovebox and its inhalation exposure chamber eliminates the need
to move infected animals through corridors or other space that may expose people. In addition, there is a high-
speed cell sorter, housed within a manufacturer-supplied class II BSC, that allows recovery of live cells infected
with a BSL-3 pathogen for downstream analysis. The Lionheart fluorescent microscopy system allows real-time
imaging of environmentally-controlled live BSL-3 samples in multi-well format, and is useful for optimization of
viral growth conditions and other live and in vitro assays without need for pathogen inactivation. Further imaging
and other instrumentation available in the ABSL-3 allows for longitudinal monitoring of the infection, blood
chemistry and immune responses without need to chemically inactivate sample, thereby reducing time and
unwanted impact for the procedure. All of these examples illustrate the capabilities for safe conduct of BSL-3
research using advanced technology instrumentation that is available through the BRSSC. The collaborative
effort between the dedicated teams of Cores 1, 2 and 3 of this UC7 application combined with regular interactions
with the NIAID RBL-NBL network will maximize best practices and usage of these unique resources. To create
sustainability, the BRSSC is committed to training diverse technical professionals and scientists in BSL-3/ACL-
3/ABSL-3 research. Through management of the critical resources at the LIDR, the BRSSC helps advance the
development of novel medical countermeasures against BSL-3 pathogens."

The purpose of this application is to obtain funding for five years to support research training of 35
trainees per year in the Undergraduate Research Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) program
at UMBC. The aim of U-RISE is to develop a diverse pool of undergraduates who complete their
baccalaureate degree, and transition into and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree
programs (e.g., Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.) and pursue biomedical research careers. The U-RISE trainee pool
will include students underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM);
specifically, racial and ethnic minorities, students of low socioeconomic status, and students with
disabilities. The program will provide a combination of activities to assure: (i) excellence in academic
science, (ii) understanding and adapting to the intensity and rigor of contemporary scientific research,
(iii) student interest in pursuing a Ph.D. degree and a career as a researcher in the biomedical
sciences, as well as (iv) selection of graduate school, and developing successful admission
applications, and (v) an emphasis on student mental health and wellness. U-RISE at UMBC will provide
comprehensive financial support to ensure that trainees can focus on preparing for a smooth and
successful transition from UMBC to competitive graduate programs at highly ranked institutions.
Students with relevant majors will be recruited from UMBC and community colleges during the second
semester of their sophomore year, and successful applicants will be appointed to U-RISE at the
beginning of the following summer. Admission eligibility will require a 3.2 cumulative GPA, a minimum
of 60 college-credits, and commitment to a research career in biomedical research. Trainee
participation will begin with a summer research internship and continue in the junior and senior
academic years with academically challenging courses, plus 8-10 hours per week in research with a
faculty mentor at UMBC or a nearby institution. Trainees must also enroll in required development
courses (i.e., scientific writing, and research ethics and policy), designed specifically for U-RISE
participants. Trainees must comply with program requirements to remain in good standing. Program
design and participant selection will be guided by the U-RISE Advisory Committee and administered by
the U-RISE Program Director (who has trained more than 50 undergraduate students in her lab) with
the assistance of the full-time U-RISE Associate Director. The efficacy of the program will be monitored
regularly by analysis of performance and student and alumni surveys."
10919827,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Technology is rapidly expanding our knowledge of the human genetic code and the alterations which
predispose to disease; however, minority populations (e.g., African Americans) are rarely included in the
discovery arms of genomic studies. As a particular genomic region, the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) that encompasses the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and variations are critically important for
their role in presenting foreign antigens and initiating adaptive immune responses. However, previous MHC
genomic resource and relevant disease gene findings were mostly enriched for non-Hispanic White individuals.
This area has been intractably difficult to decipher even with the most commonly used short-read shotgun
sequencing. This impedes the process for identification of functional HLA variants underlying immunologically
relevant mental health conditions in diverse populations. New sequencing technology (long-read) and
population-scale African samples are needed to address this knowledge gap. Recently we have gained
access to All of US (AoU) controlled tier data (e.g., long- and short-read whole-genome sequencing, WGS) and
UK Biobank (UKB) WGS data, consisting of >24,000 participants of African descent. Our overall goal is to
identify HLA long haplotypes and create the most detailed reference map of the MHC region for individuals of
African descent, and to leverage this new knowledge for fine-mapping HLA locus for suicidality phenotypes. In
the first aim, we hypothesize that a hybrid assembly approach with both short- and long-read sequencing data
provides a solution to the phasing ambiguity problem. We will generate African-specific HLA haplotype
assembly, then call, impute, and phase HLA variants and haplotypes for all African/Black samples in AoU and
UKB. In the second aim, we assume both direct and indirect HLA genetic effects are present in suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (STB). In addition to discover HLA variations and genes associated with STB and its
related inflammatory markers in AoU, we will further replicate top associations in UKB and annotate HLA
functional units by integrative omics approaches. More fully characterizing HLA variation in African populations
is both a significant and important innovation, and its implication for suicide genomics has never been done
before at such a resolution. The cloud-tailored analytical pipeline and MHC resources generated is expected
to support large projects in the AoU Researcher workbench that incorporates HLA effects in precision
medicine. In addition to our intended research goal of fine-mapping variants and genes which contribute to
STB, identifying HLA alleles that are exclusive to individuals of African descent also has the tangible benefit of
improving clinical care for transplantation and serious mental illness."
10797210,"Proper synaptic function relies on a dedicated assembly of pre- and postsynaptic proteins. Neurexin1 is a
principal presynaptic organizing protein essential for synaptic function. Mammalian neurexin1 has three
isoforms (α, β, and γ). While neurexin1α and β have laminin/neurexin/sex hormone (LNS) domains, 1γ lacks
LNS domains. This is important because LNS domains of neurexin1 bind to post-synaptic partners such as
neuroligins, which recruit proteins for proper synaptic function. Deleting neurexin1α globally or neurexin1 α and
β in hippocampal neurons impairs postsynaptic receptor activation without affecting presynaptic function at
CA3-CA1 synapses. Thus, whether and how neurexin1 organizes presynaptic terminals is unclear. Recently,
we made the surprising discovery that all three neurexin1 isoforms are covalently attached to a complex
glycan, heparan sulfate (HS). We generated a Nrxn1ΔHS mouse line to block HS attachment to all three
neurexin1 isoforms and found severe deficits in presynaptic function and synapse ultrastructure. In this
proposal, we have generated a Nrxn1-/- mouse line to delete all three isoforms and found similar presynaptic
deficits at CA3-CA1 synapses in Nrxn1ΔHS and Nrxn1-/-. These findings now suggest that the neurexin1 protein
backbone alone is insufficient for presynaptic function and that additional factors, which act through HS, are
involved in presynaptic development. Furthermore, the presynaptic deficit observed in Nrxn1-/- was not found in
neurexin1 α and β mutants, raising the exciting possibility that neurexin1γ is sufficient to maintain presynaptic
function. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the HS modification has a specific role in neurexin1-mediated
presynaptic assembly and function and is essential for the roles of neurexin1γ and a novel HS-binding growth
factor pleiotrophin in presynaptic assembly and function. To test this hypothesis, we will examine the specific
role of HS in neurexin1-mediated pre- and post-synaptic assembly (Aim 1), the sufficiency of neurexin1γ and
its HS in presynaptic assembly and function (Aim 2), and the role of pleiotrophin in presynaptic assembly and
function (Aim 3) in mouse brains. To understand the synaptic assembly within an intact brain circuit, we will
utilize innovative Expansion Microscopy to visualize synaptic proteins in the higher order at individual
synapses. Given the critical role of neurexin1 in synapse development, the expected outcome of this work will
provide novel molecular insights into presynaptic development and function. Mutations in neurexin1 and
abnormalities in the biosynthesis of HS have been linked to schizophrenia and autism. Therefore, our work will
shed light on how mutations in neurexin and heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes affect synapse
development and function in autism and schizophrenia and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies for these diseases."
10797393,"In the United States, nearly 1 in 6 adults filled an opioid prescription in the past year and 10 million adults are
opioid tolerant. Compared with opioid naïve patients, individuals with opioid tolerance experience greater
challenges in managing acute pain especially after having surgery and poorer outcomes following surgical
care. For example, opioid exposure before surgery has been shown to lead to greater rates of opioid
consumption after surgery. Further, patients with opioid tolerance frequently encounter high-risk prescribing
practices and delays in returning to their usual prescriber after surgery, as well as greater rates of morbidity
and mortality after surgery. Evidence-based care pathways have been developed to improve opioid prescribing
before and after surgery for opioid-naïve patients, but little is known about the postoperative needs of patients
with opioid tolerance. Specifically, important knowledge gaps exist regarding the appropriate amount of opioids
to prescribe after surgery, best practices in coordinating opioid therapy during the perioperative period, and the
effectiveness of care coordination pathways to prevent high-risk prescribing practices and optimize clinical
outcomes in this vulnerable population. To address these gaps, we will prospectively capture patient-reported
opioid use and pain outcomes among individuals with opioid tolerance undergoing common surgical
procedures and develop a clinical care pathway to optimize outcomes across a large network of hospitals in
the state of Michigan that are diverse with respect to geography and case mix. In 2016, we established the
Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN), a federal and state funded quality improvement program
focused on developing and disseminating best practices in surgical opioid prescribing and pain management
for opioid-naïve patients. In this proposal, we will extend this work to examine patient-reported pain outcomes
and opioid prescribing practices after surgery among opioid tolerant patients in order to calibrate current
prescribing guidelines for common general surgery procedures (Aim 1). We will then conduct qualitative
interviews with surgical patients who have opioid tolerance; their providers; and healthcare leaders. This data
will inform the development of a clinical care pathway for perioperative pain management for patients with
opioid tolerance (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a prospective randomized trial to determine the effectiveness
of the care pathway on coordinating care and reducing high-risk prescribing practices after surgery, length of
stay, and readmissions, as well as optimizing patient-reported pain (Aim 3). We hypothesize that
implementation of the care pathway will increase alignment with guideline-concordant prescribing without
adversely impacting patient-centered outcomes. Given the high prevalence of individuals with opioid tolerance
undergoing surgery each year in the United States, interventions to reduce high-risk prescribing practices,
adverse postoperative events, and optimize postoperative pain management will lead to safer perioperative
care."
10803315,"ABSTRACT
Hispanic populations in the US have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
compared to non-Hispanic white populations. These disparities are partially driven by higher intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs) among Hispanic adults. Warning labels on product packaging are a widely used
public health strategy that could reduce SSB intake. Initial research on SSB warnings is promising. However,
the effects of SSB warnings on behavior are unknown among Hispanic adults, a priority population for
prevention of obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Our overarching objective is to estimate
the impact of sugar warnings on SSB purchases among Hispanic adults. In Aim 1, we will examine the impact
of sugar warnings on SSB purchases in an RCT with Hispanic adults in North Carolina (n=550). The RCT will
take place in the Mini Mart, a small convenience store designed to conduct research studies, allowing for
experimental control in a realistic setting where participants spend actual money on real products. Participants
will be randomly assigned to one of two trial arms: SSBs with sugar warning labels or SSBs with neutral control
labels. At each of four visits over four weeks, participants will shop for beverages for their household. We will
estimate the impact of sugar warnings on the primary outcome: total sugar purchased from SSBs as well as
secondary outcomes, such as purchases of juice or drinks with non-caloric sweetener. Additionally, we will
identify the psychological mechanisms explaining how sugar warnings influenced beverage purchases using
in-depth qualitative interviews with a subset of RCT participants and longitudinal survey data from the RCT. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate a sugar warning policy implemented in Mexico in 2020 to examine whether warnings
were associated with reduced SSB purchases in the real world. We will use a longitudinal panel of 9,300
households over 5 years (2017-2021), with weekly beverage purchases linked to nutrition data. Using
structural demand models, we will estimate the policy-linked changes in SSB purchases after Mexico's sugar
warning policy was implemented. We will also estimate how much of the changes in SSB purchases were
attributable to changes in consumer behavior (e.g., consumers switching products) or industry response (e.g.,
the food industry lowering the sugar content of beverages to avoid warning labels). This evaluation will allow us
to move beyond the lab to understand how consumers react in the real world over a longer time, and also to
measure the additional effects of warning policies on SSB purchases via changes to the products themselves.
Together, the two studies will provide estimates of how sugar warnings could affect SSB purchases as well as
mechanisms of the impact of sugar warning policies. To leverage the complementary data of both projects, we
will bring together our Mexican collaborators and local Hispanic community partners to identify findings across
aims that are most likely to have an immediate impact on obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease in US Hispanic populations."
10803076,"Summary
Colonic motility is the product of myogenic and neurogenic factors that regulate the excitability of smooth muscle
cells (SMCs). Part of the myogenic component of regulation is due to interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) that have
critical functions in gastrointestinal (GI) motility. ICC form gap junctions with SMCs and convey regulatory inputs
to a syncytium of SMCs and PDGFRa+ cells (SIP syncytium). Some ICC generate pacemaker activity that is
responsible for phasic contractions in some regions of the GI tract. ICC are closely associated with motor
neurons, express receptors for major neurotransmitters and transduce inputs from enteric motor neuro-
transmission. The physiology of ICC is important because multiple studies have suggested that defects in ICC
develop in patients and may be responsible for a range of motility disorders. While much has been learned
about ICC in other organs of the GI tract, far less is known about ICC in the colon. During the past funding period
we characterized the basic behaviors of 3 of the 4 types of colonic ICC. Little is known about ICC in the myenteric
region (ICC-MY) that do not act as conventional pacemakers, yet we hypothesize they drive major propulsive
contractions in the colon. This hypothesis will be addressed by pursuing three specific aims: 1. Determine
mechanisms responsible for propagated Ca2+ waves in ICC-MY. 2. Determine the role of ICC in generating
patterned and propulsive contractions in the colon. 3. Characterize mechanisms of action of major
neurotransmitters on activation of ICC-MY. To pursue these aims we will use imaging, optogenetic,
transgenic, electrophysiological and contractile techniques that allow in depth testing of cellular mechanisms in
ICC without disruption of their anatomical and functional interactions with other cells in colonic muscles.
Integration of ICC behaviors with SMCs and PDGFRa+ cells will also be investigated to learn how subcellular
Ca2+ signaling in ICC can generate whole organ motility patterns. The impact of enteric motor neural inputs on
Ca2+ handling mechanisms in ICC-MY will also be investigated to understand previously overlooked mechanisms
of neural regulation of colonic motility. Parallel studies will be conducted on human colonic muscles to test the
role of signature ICC conductances and Ca2+ handling mechanisms in colonic motor activity. These comparative
studies will help develop a generalized concept of ICC functions in colonic motility and determine the validity of
using mice to help clarify the functions of ICC in human motility. This project will determine the role of ICC-MY
in patterned and propulsive contractions in the colon, and studies of animals with defects in ICC will demonstrate
how/why motility is negatively impacted by defects in or loss of ICC."
10806018,"Background: Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer and the fifth most common cancer in the US population.
Most melanomas are diagnosed at an early, localized stage, but approximately 10-15% of these melanomas
eventually metastasize despite appropriate treatment. This progression of localized melanoma to metastatic
disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In addition, the cost of treating metastatic disease has
risen rapidly over the past decade. No treatment exists for melanoma patients who are at high risk of future
metastasis, but whose clinical stage does not qualify for existing adjuvant treatments. Thus, there is a clear
need for treatments that would decrease metastasis while being tolerable and cost-effective.
Significance: This proposal uses VA specific datasets (Corporate Data Warehouse, Million Veteran Program)
to evaluate the efficacy of statins as a treatment to reduce melanoma metastasis and mortality. Multiple
orthogonal approaches are proposed in order to generate robust data that will serve as a foundation for a
future clinical trial of statins in the prevention of melanoma metastasis.
Innovation: This proposal is based on an innovative approach to drug discovery for high-risk melanoma.
Statins were identified as a promising treatment candidate based on gene expression profiling. This proposal
will use advanced statistical methods in order to assess the correlation of statin use with melanoma metastasis
and mortality rates in the Veteran population and create the foundation for a future clinical trial. In addition, this
proposal will use Mendelian randomization paired with germline genetic data from the Million Veteran Program
(MVP) in order to assess potential causal effects between HMGCR enzyme function and melanoma
metastasis.
Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) is associated with incident statin
use in a retrospective Veteran cohort. 2) Determine which statin-intrinsic properties correlate most strongly with
melanoma mortality. 3) Evaluate the effect of common variants in the HMGCR gene on overall and metastasis-
free survival in patients with melanoma using germline genetic data from the Million Veterans Program (MVP).
Methods: Aim 1 will use data extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to assess the association of
incident statin use on melanoma distant metastasis free survival. Aim 2 dissects the effects of the mevalonate
pathway on melanoma metastasis by comparing statins to downstream inhibitors. In addition, Aim 2 evaluates
the relative correlation of dose and statin intensity on melanoma mortality. Aim 3 uses Mendelian
randomization (MR), a biostatistical technique, to assess the relationship between HMGCR variants and
melanoma mortality. MR mimics a randomized clinical trial, and thus, data generated by this Aim would
potentially support a causative relationship between HMGCR protein function and melanoma metastasis.
Taken together, this proposal may support and inform the design of a future clinical trial of statins for
prevention of melanoma metastasis.
Next Steps: This work will lead to the submission of multiple independent funding proposals including Merit
Review and NIH R01 applications. In addition, this work may lead to future clinical trials through collaborative
groups such as the VA Cooperative Studies Program."
10807976,"The childhood obesity epidemic has been strongly associated with environmental factors. Family aggregation studies in humans and transgenerational studies in animal models show that obesity is highly heritable, and ancestral exposures can predispose offspring to the risk of various metabolic disorders. Our laboratory was the first to show the role of paternal exercise in programming “thrifty phenotype” in offspring. Our published and preliminary OXPHOS efficiency analyses using Drosophila and mouse models indicate that the “thrifty phenotype” is caused by an alteration in the offspring's mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency. 
Preliminary proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that developmental changes in bioenergetic efficiency were due to mitochondrial proteome remodeling associated with alterations in somatic and germ cell microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby providing a potential mechanism for the transgenerational transmission and programming of metabolic risks. The central hypothesis of the project is that miRNAs play a key role in the developmental programming of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency. Based on published and preliminary data, a secondary hypothesis is that changes in mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency are inherited via spermatozoal cells as alterations in miRNAs. To test these hypotheses, we propose to take advantage of the physiological simplicity and genetic manipulability of fruit fly Drosophila. Therefore, the specific aims for this project are:
Aim 1. Determine the functional consequences of altered miRNA expression in programming offspring metabolic state. 
Aim 2. Determine the spermatozoal epimutations responsible for the transgenerational programming of the bioenergetic phenotype. 
The methodological innovations of this project include the application of a multiplexed assay platform with a variable energetic clamp technique recently adopted to flies, a novel proteomics-based approach to merge mitochondrial flux data with in-house proteomics to reveal molecular markers of transgenerational phenotype. This study is expected to significantly advance our understanding of the epigenetic origins of childhood obesity. Deciphering primary molecular mechanisms of developmental metabolic programming will provide a better understanding of how childhood obesity and related metabolic diseases could be more effectively targeted."
10807103,"Project Summary
Most bacterial diseases of public health significance are caused by pathogens with an intracellular lifecycle
that is integral to their virulence. These microorganisms exploit a variety of host cell functions to ensure
their intracellular survival and proliferation, via delivery of effector proteins or toxins that modulate specific
host processes, including intracellular membrane transport by vacuolar pathogens. The Golgi apparatus
plays a central role in the host secretory traffic of cellular components and is targeted by many bacteria for
the purpose of vacuole biogenesis and maintenance or intracellular nutrient acquisition. Little is known,
however, about the bacterial effectors that exploit this essential organelle, nor how pathogens subvert its
functions for pathogenic purposes. Bacteria of the genus Brucella, which cause the global zoonosis
brucellosis, generate a replication-permissive organelle derived from the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
the Brucella-containing vacuole (rBCV), which is essential to their pathogenesis. rBCV biogenesis requires
VirB Type IV secretion system (T4SS)-mediated delivery of effector proteins that modulate specific host
secretory functions. We identified several of these effectors, among which BspB targets the conserved
oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, a master regulator of Golgi-associated vesicular trafficking, to promote
rBCV biogenesis and bacterial replication. Additional T4SS effectors (BspD and BspF) modulate Golgi-
associated trafficking functions, further supporting a previously unsuspected role of the Golgi apparatus in
the Brucella intracellular cycle. Our findings also suggest that T4SS effectors (BspB/RicA and BspF/BspD)
functionally cooperate in their modulation of membrane transport pathways, arguing that Brucella
modulation of Golgi-associated processes results from the integration of multiple effector functions. Here
we will test the hypothesis that Brucella delivers an array of T4SS effector proteins that modulate
membrane transport functions at the Golgi interface to coordinately promote bacterial proliferation. We will
use genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches to first characterize the Golgi transport pathways that
contribute to Brucella proliferation and define the targets and functional network of Golgi-targeting T4SS
effectors. Second, we will determine the molecular modes of action of the Golgi-targeting T4SS effectors
BspB, BspD and BspF. Last, we will define i) how BspB and RicA coordinately modulate ER-Golgi vesicular
transport to promote rBCV biogenesis and ii) how BspF and BspD co-modulate TGN-associated transport
to promote Brucella replication. The successful completion of this project will uncover bacterial effector-
driven mechanisms of modulation of Golgi-associated membrane transport functions and define new
paradigms of effector functions and coordination in bacterial pathogens, broadly impacting the research
areas of microbial pathogenesis, cell biology and innate immunity."
10807109,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been applied in clinical trials in patients with different disorders.
Although successful in clinical studies, one of major concerns for broader AAV vector application for patients is
high prevalence of neutralizing antibody (Nab). In the general human population, over 95% of individuals have
been infected by AAV and, on average, approximate 50% of them have Nabs. Several approaches have been
explored to evade AAV Nabs, including epitope masking with PEG or exosome, different serotype of AAV
vector, rational design and combinatorial mutagenesis of the capsid in situ, as well as biological depletion of
Nabs (empty capsid utilization, B cell depletion, plasma-apheresis and IgG cleavage enzymes). Generally,
these approaches have low efficiency or side effects or AAV tropism change. Therefore, it is imperative to
develop ideal strategies to evade Nabs, but without a change in tissue tropism from capsid engineering or
negative side effects from pharmacological treatment. Recently, we have developed a vector independent
protein based strategy to universally block Nabs and demonstrated that this approach is effective against a
broad range of pre-existing Nab concentrations by use of a unique mycoplasma derived protein and it’s
analogues, termed Protein-M. Protein-M is able to interact with immunoglobulin from any species without
antigen dependence. We have found that protein M protected AAV vector neutralization over 100 fold in vitro
and 1000 fold in mice with adoptive transfer of Nab positive serum, so far, the most effective strategy to evade
AAV Nabs. However, the wild type protein M is structurally unstable at body temperature (37°C), making it
challenging for clinical application. The protein unfolding at body temperature may correspond with decreased
Nab blockade when using the protein in vivo. In order to improve PM stability, we have rationally designed in
silico a library of 150 individual protein mutants engineered for improved thermal stability. At least 10 mutants
were identified with enhanced thermal stability and high biological activity. In this proposal, we will further
characterize the efficacy of these mutants in vitro and in mice with adoptive transfer of Nab positive serum
(Aim 1). Next, we will study the role of protein M in AAV re-dosing in mice with pre-immunization (Aim 2). Then
we will move forward to a disease model to test the ability of the best protein M variants to block AAV Nabs in
animals for phenotypic correction with AAV vector mediated gene delivery (Aim 3). The long term objective is
to develop a more effective strategy to evade Nab activity in future gene therapy with AAV vectors in patients
with Nabs."
10804882,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune disease which affects 2.5 million people in the US,
many of which are VA military personnel. One in four veterans has arthritis (25.6%), compared to one in five
civilians. RA is a chronic, disabling autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its tissues. As RA progresses,
performing simple daily activities becomes increasingly difficult for patients suffering from the disease. Presently,
there is no cure for RA and up to 50% of patients diagnosed with RA do not respond to current treatments or
lose their responsiveness over time. Findings that lead to new therapy will benefit the VA personnel by reducing
the cost of medical and surgical care; in addition to the secondary RA complications including depression,
cardiovascular disease, and psychosocial stress. Consequently, effective RA therapy will improve the pain & the
life quality of veterans.
My laboratory focuses on identifying the mechanisms that lead to joint inflammation, immunometabolism, bone
erosion in immune cells, and their ability to cross-regulate joint vascularization. Our research at Jesse Brown VA
Medical Center has focused on discovering a unique TLR7 endogenous ligand in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
synovial fluid exosomes, which exclusively bind to myeloid TLR7. The TLR7 endogenous ligand, miR-Let7b,
remodels the naïve RA myeloid cells into inflammatory MΦs and erosive osteoclasts. Intriguingly, we show that
IRAK4 inhibitor therapy disrupts miR-Let7b-mediated inflammatory and metabolic imprints in RA macrophage,
fibroblasts, and preclinical models in part via HIF1α and cMYC downregulation. This work is very relevant to the
Veteran's health, as the IRAK4 inhibitor is at phase 2 for RA therapy and could reduce the cost of medical and
surgical care and improve the life quality of the veterans.
Currently, we aim to identify novel therapeutic targets for patients that do not respond to biotherapies. As such,
we have uncovered novel pathways that can markedly alleviate pannus formation by intercepting the unique
networks interconnecting RA inflammatory macrophages to joint neovasculature via metabolic reprogramming.
Unlike the current RA standard of care, the mechanism of action is not limited to a specific inflammatory factor
and its function will impact multiple cell types in the RA pannus and their metabolic crosstalk. We are proposing
a unique way of negating RA pannus formation which has not been examined previously.
Intriguingly, we are examining the inflammatory & metabolic profiles of RA circulating blood and synovial tissue
macrophages in response to an identified endogenous factor to delineate if blockade of hypermetabolic activity
will reverse the inflammatory phenotype by RNA-sequencing and CyTOF. We are also uncovering the impact of
the identified synovial fluid endogenous factor on endothelial cell metabolic reprogramming and their cross-
regulation with RA macrophages by carbon isotype labeling for tracing glucose, analyzing the structure and
function of mitochondria, and real-time ATP quantification of joint cells. Last, we will utilize RA synovial tissues
in 2D or 3D culture format as well as arthritis preclinical models to determine the effectiveness of blocking the
metabolic intermediates activated by the identified endogenous factor compared to RA biotherapies through
phenotyping the metabolic and oxidative signatures. In short, the excellent intellectual infrastructure in Jesse
Brown Medical Center, combined with the highly productive research team and easy access to RA clinical
specimens offers a strong environment for understanding the metabolic crosstalk between RA macrophages and
endothelial cells and the ability to translate the findings from bench-to-bedside."
10805580,"SUMMARY
 Veterans with fractures suffer from injury-associated pain as well as post-operative surgical pain. The
occurrence of a fracture contributes to acute pain and is largely manifested by mechanical, inflammatory, and
neuropathic components. The LEAP study of high-energy lower extremity trauma showed that acute pain, in
the recovery period after severe trauma, is the single largest predictor of long-term chronic pain 5-10 years
after injury. There are 2 main strategies to treat trauma-induced and post-surgical pain: opioids and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Neither drug class completely alleviates pain, and both have
negative side effects. Opioids, beyond eliciting cognitive impairment, are commonly associated with tolerance
and addiction. NSAIDs are commonly used in combination with opioids following thoracic/abdominal surgery
but use of this drug class for fracture pain is discouraged in the U.S. due to negative effects on skeletal health
and healing of the injured skeleton. It is unclear which drug class is less destructive to the bone repair process
but prevention of nonunion is paramount in the treatment of fractures as it places additional burden on the
patient and the healthcare system due to prolonged pain and disability. Therefore, identification of therapies
which improve both the bone healing process and diminish the fracture-associated pain is warranted. Our
group has previously shown that the main megakaryocyte (MK) growth factor, thrombopoietin (TPO), can
improve bone healing. In preliminary studies we demonstrate that fracture targeting thrombopoietin mimetic
peptides (TMPs) also markedly improve fracture healing, and that high levels of platelet derived growth factor
(PDGF) are observed at the fracture site with TMP treatment. As both osteoblasts (OBs) and endothelial cells
(ECs) express the receptor for PDGF (PDGFRβ), actions of PDGF on these cells could be responsible for the
improvements in bone healing observed. On the other hand, PDGF expression is also known to increase pain
behaviors, and PDGFRβ is also expressed on sensory neurons. Based on these observations we
hypothesize that short-term administration of TMP will increase PDGF at the fracture site, stimulating OB
and EC activity, leading to accelerated bone healing. Because inhibition of the PDGF-PDGFRβ axis has been
shown to attenuate pain behaviors, we further hypothesize that inhibition of PDGFRβ-signaling subsequent
to the inflammatory phase of fracture healing, at 8-30 days post-surgery, will decrease chronic pain and
inflammation without compromising fracture healing. Three specific aims will address this hypothesis. In Aim
1, we will determine if systemic versus targeted TMP can accelerate post-fracture bone healing and reduce
inflammation and pain behaviors. In Aim 2, we will determine if PDGFRβ signaling in OBs and/or ECs is
required for TMP-stimulated bone healing. In Aim 3, we will determine if inhibiting PDGFRβ-signaling
following TMP treatment reduces chronic pain behavior. Identification of novel inhibitors of chronic pain could
also decrease the use of opioids for pain management of musculoskeletal injuries and serve as an important
step in mitigating the opioid crisis."
10805080,"Myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection, long COVID syndrome and COVID mRNA vaccination have
emerged as urgent unmet clinical needs. Two recent studies involving >80-million persons including national
healthcare databases from the US Department of Veteran Affairs confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or
mRNA vaccination significantly predispose patients from high susceptibility as cardiovascular disease to
myocarditis. Our group recently reported that levels of cardiac low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are
elevated in patients with heart failure, as well as in autopsy samples from a hyper-inflammatory long COVID
case. Considering this evidence, high levels of cardiac LDLR might induce lipid metabolism disorders and
cytotoxic effects by increasing lipid species. In published and preliminary results described below we identified
the cardiac LDLR as a myocarditis-facilitating SARS-CoV-2 receptor and a novel therapeutic target for
myocarditis; our evidence includes: 1) LDLR binds the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD with an in vitro affinity
comparable to that of NRP1 binding to a synthetic S1 peptide, 2) LDLR complexes with hACE2, 3)
Overexpression (OE) of cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific hLDLR in wild type causes deposition of lipid species in
the heart especially Diacylglycerol (DAG) and induces severe myocarditis with typical immune cell infiltration 4)
OE of CM-specific Induced Degrader of LDLR (hIDOL) in K18-hACE2tg mice infected with chSARS-CoV-2
reduces cardiac immune cell infiltration. 5) hLDLR OE increases chSARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, 6) IDOL
activator and LXR agonist GW3965 reduces chSARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, 7) p-AKT inhibitor Triciribine
(TCN), reduces LDL-cholesterol uptake and chSARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Together, these findings provide
a new mouse model of COVID-induced myocarditis and inspire investigating the LDLR blockers as therapeutic
targets (Aim1), and the mechanisms of action via LDLR-mediated chemoattraction of OPN+ve monocytes (Aim2)
or DAG lipid deposition (Aim3)."
10805895,"Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major problem among military veterans and civilians alike, yet
despite ongoing improvements in our understanding, its pathophysiology requires further intensive
investigation. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) is an ideal setting for study of this
problem, and we have led first a highly productive Cooperative Studies Program project (CSP#575B) in the
MVP context to identify genetic risk factors relevant to PTSD and related traits; then, the first iteration of our
MERIT project (MVP025), for which this is a competing renewal. From our prior work, we published PTSD
genetics data in multiple high-impact journals; and other products of the project relating to anxiety, depression,
alcohol use, and other traits. Over the course of the research, we assembled an expert team well-qualified to
continue productively. To continue and extend this work, we propose analyses of PTSD and related traits in the
growing MVP sample, including epigenetics and whole genome sequence (WGS) data, considering additional
kinds of genetic variation, and more extensive post-GWAS analysis. Some of our key findings have concerned
the relationship of PTSD to other psychiatric and medical disorders, for example, cardiovascular disease – we
will expand upon this work also. Other work pertaining to PTSD (e.g. study of resilience traits, individual PCL-
17 item phenotypes, and sex-specific analyses) is underway. We will continue to explore PTSD subtypes and
individual signs and symptoms from a genetic perspective. Discerning subtypes will be critical for the
advancement of precision treatment of PTSD: genetic subtype may predict treatment response.
With more MVP subjects there will be increased power to map relevant traits. We will continue GWAS of traits
related to PTSD in the expanded sample. There is very high comorbidity of PTSD with substance use disorder
traits; we propose to explore substance use-related traits as well, including alcohol, opioid, nicotine,
stimulants, and other substances. We will also study additional traits phenotypically associated with PTSD,
such as cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s disease, persistent post-concussive symptoms, and other traits with
higher or lower risk or differing course in PTSD subjects than in the general population. We will investigate
polygenic overlap between PTSD and related traits. We will use approaches that permit testing of causality
among these correlated traits (e.g., Mendelian Randomization) and that can help establish the genetic
relationships between sets of traits, such as genomic structural equation modeling. We will apply methods
such as MiXeR to identify unique and shared polygenic components.
To maximize the scientific value of these data we will undertake meta-analyses and replicate our findings in
collaboration with other EHR-linked biobank consortia and collaborate with and share data with the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD Workgroup and UKBiobank investigators, among others. Large sample
size, detailed genomic and epigenetic data, and deep phenotyping, all move the field forward. The latter are
characteristics of the MVP sample while the first – largest-possible sample size – is best accomplished via
wide collaboration. Finally, the MVP sample is suitable for advancing work in many populations that are
generally understudied. We will investigate psychiatric trait-relevant population genetics of African, Latino, East
Asians, and other American populations in the MVP system, and will work to maximize information from all
populations."
10888403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease and better therapies are urgently needed. The
pancreatic tumor microenvironment is complex, and stromal and immune cells induce an inflamed,
desmoplastic response that hinders proper blood vessel formation, resulting in poor nutrient and oxygen
delivery. Therefore, PDA cells must rewire cellular metabolism to maintain their biosynthetic and energetic
requirements. The stromal and immune cells do not simply change tumor architecture, they also support
cancer metabolism, suppress anti-tumor immune responses, and blunt treatment efficacy. Having previously
identified a new pathway of metabolic crosstalk between cancer cells and cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs), I now propose to extend this paradigm to discover how the immune and nervous
systems support tumor metabolism to identify new therapeutic opportunities.
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise the bulk of the immune compartment in a pancreatic tumor
and support malignant progression and therapeutic resistance. In accordance with this, our group previously
demonstrated that TAMs release the pyrimidine deoxycytidine (dC), which, based on its molecular similarity, is
able to inhibit the cytotoxic activity of the frontline chemotherapeutic gemcitabine. Since the amino acid
aspartate (Asp) is required for pyrimidine production, and Asp is produced by the glutamate oxaloacetate
transaminases (GOTs), I generated macrophage-specific Got1 or Got2 knockout models to study the role of
the GOTs in TAM metabolism. In Aim 1a, I will evaluate how Asp synthesis and dC release in TAMs impacts
PDA sensitivity to gemcitabine using syngeneic tumor models. My preliminary data also suggests that GOT
activity and dC modulate T cell function. Therefore, in Aim 1b, I will determine how loss of Got1 or Got2 in
TAMs affects tumor infiltrating T cells and tumor response to immune-based therapy.
During the K00 phase, I will apply knowledge gained during graduate school in cancer biology and metabolism
to an independent postdoctoral project. Pancreatic tumors are highly innervated and neural ablation impairs
tumor regression. The metabolic underpinnings by which neurons support cancer cells require further
investigation. Therefore, my goal as a postdoctoral fellow is to understand how dysregulated PDA metabolism
impacts neuronal recruitment and function as well as metabolic pathways in neurons that are critical for pro-
tumor signaling. I plan to use genetic mouse models of PDA, in vivo isotope tracing, genome CRISPR libraries,
and ex vivo neuron-PDA co-culture models to answer these questions. Lastly, in addition to the proposed
studies, this training plan includes activities important for career development, mentorship, networking, and
scientific communication to prepare me for successful transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and my career as
an independent investigator studying cancer metabolism."
10806953,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposed study is to pilot test and evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of a school-based
suicide prevention intervention tailored specifically for Black youth and those connected to Black youth (e.g.,
families and school personnel). Suicide was recognized in 2018 as the 2nd leading cause of death for 10 to 14-
year-old Black adolescents in the U.S., yet there are few evidence-based suicide prevention interventions
designed to account for the cultural factors that influence Black youth's risks for suicidality. Further – although
universal school-based suicide prevention programs have great potential to alleviate disparities in access to
mental health resources – most school-based suicide prevention interventions are administered to high school
students. Some researchers have begun to implement prevention interventions among middle school-aged
youth, but we know little about the effect universal school-based suicide prevention interventions could have
for Black students residing in underserved communities. To redress this gap, we propose modifying an existing
intervention with culturally adapted content by conducting a pilot RCT to assess preliminary effectiveness,
tolerability, and feasibility. The Signs of Suicide (SOS) program is a school-based intervention that has
demonstrated reductions in suicide attempts among middle and high school students by identifying knowledge
and attitudes towards depression and suicide as key mechanisms that mediate the relation between
intervention participation and a significant reduction in suicide attempts. Thus, it is important to consider how
prioritizing these two mechanisms – knowledge and attitudes towards depression and suicide – may differ for
Black youth whose perceptions of knowledge and attitudes of suicide may be culturally bound and influenced
by stigmatized beliefs regarding help-seeing for mental health concerns. Parents views about stigma and
school personnel's familiarity with suicide prevention resources may also influence Black youth's knowledge
and attitudes, thus affirming the necessity of a multilevel suicide prevention intervention. We therefore propose
a cultural adaptation of the SOS program that aims to: 1) Tailor the SOS intervention videos to include
culturally adapted strategies for navigating stigma of receiving mental health treatment; (2) Develop culturally
adapted curricula that trains parents and school personnel to (a) recognize suicide risk factors for Black youth;
and (b) refer students to local mental health treatment services; and (3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled
trial (n=300) to assess feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of reducing suicidality among Black youth
across three intervention conditions (standard SOS condition; culturally adapted SOS condition; culturally
adapted SOS + parent and school personnel training condition). Pre-test scores will be compared at post-test,
3-month, and 1-year follow up. Results from this study will advance our understanding of factors that contribute
to and protect against suicidality in Black youth, while also providing a foundation to test and refine study
procedures to implement the intervention in a larger cohort of students."
10806962,"VARIANTS IN HUMAN SKIN DISEASE
PROJECT SUMMARY
 Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA to control differentiation genes in normal and
diseased tissue, including cutaneous epidermis. We mapped regulatory DNA active in human
epidermis and found it enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”)
linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to inflammatory skin diseases in which altered
epidermal differentiation contributes to pathogenesis, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis
vulgaris (PV). AD and PV-linked eSNPs alter DNA motifs and transcription-directing activity in human
keratinocytes, suggesting they serve as binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) for TFs whose modified
activity at these sites pathogenically dysregulates target genes (eGenes). Such eSNP regulatory
variants, the TFs whose binding they alter, and the eGenes whose expression they dysregulate, form a
regulatory risk framework for polygenic disease. This proposal will elucidate features of such regulatory
risk frameworks in the context of human tissue, using AD and PV as polygenic disease prototypes.
 First, we will define phenotypic impacts of disease-linked eSNPs in human skin tissue, focusing on
the epidermis-intrinsic component of AD and PV. We will assess disease eSNP impacts on the gene
expression, architecture and function of intact human epidermal tissue. To do this, we will generate
otherwise identical, isogenic human skin xenografts that differ only by the single regulatory DNA
nucleotides studied using a hybrid gene editing approach. eSNPs will be studied singly and in
combination. Aim I will define the impacts of AD and PV-linked regulatory variants in human tissue.
 Second, we will identify the TFs whose DNA binding and function is changed at specific eSNPs to
extend understanding of disease-linked regulatory DNA variants to the level of biochemical mechanism.
To do this, we will use new proteomic and genetic methods. The first method, DNA Protein
Identification Detection (DAPID) uses DNA-tethered proximity proteomics to detect and quantify TF
binding to any DNA sequence of interest in living cells. The second, Perturb-MPRA, couples CRISPR
screening to the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify the TFs essential for the
transcriptional activity directed by any DNA sequence. Aim II will identify the TFs whose DNA binding
and activity is affected by disease-linked eSNPs in AD and PV.
 This project will use new methods and a human tissue context to define the eSNP, TF, and eGene
regulatory risk frameworks in common human polygenic skin diseases."
10807097,"SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity
squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage,
perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins
are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients
are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk
patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy)
in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received
PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these
patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally
advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients
may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to
develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or
high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.
 Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC)
that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of
H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was
trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease
specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis).
In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating
new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge,
density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized
as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate
OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who
would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit
from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.
 This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi
group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt
University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a
tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients."
10803507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human high-affinity Na+-driven dicarboxylate transporter NaDC3 plays critical roles in physiology. The gene
of the transporter, SLC13A3, is expressed in the brain as well as other tissues. Located in the plasma membrane,
the transporter imports various dicarboxylates into the cell, including succinate, a-ketoglutarate (aKG) and N-
acetyl-aspartate (NAA). In addition to being intermediates of the TCA cycle, dicarboxylates imported by NaDC3
also function as signaling molecules in the cell. In the brain, NAA functions as a precursor for the synthesis of
both neurohormones and lipids and as an osmolyte in cell volume regulation and in axon-glial signaling. The
transporter is involved in a number of disorders, including the lethal Canavan disease, an early-onset CNS
condition with “spongiform” vacuolation of white matter in the brain, caused by the overloading of NAA in glial
cells. Inhibition of the dicarboxylate transporter is a possible treatment, and small-molecule inhibitors have been
identified. In this project, we aim (1) to characterize the structural basis of NaDC3’s substrate specificity. (2) to
study inhibition mechanisms. (3) to investigate the conformational changes between the outward- and inward-
facing transitions. (4) to understand the sodium—substrate energy coupling. By accomplishing these aims, we
will be able to understand the molecular mechanism of the human NaDC3 over its complete transport cycle,
including its Co—Ci conformational transition and substrate—sodium coupling mechanism. Comparison of the
inhibitor-binding sites in NaDC3 and other proteins will aid in the design of NaDC3 specific inhibitors to help
patients suffering from Canavan disease."

Following a stroke, hand dexterity does not recover fully for most patients, significantly reducing quality of life.
Optimal and effective assessment and therapies for achieving hand dexterity are currently lacking due, in part,
to limited scientific knowledge of human hand dexterity in health and disease. Hand dexterity hinges on
multiple essential behavioral components embedded in a highly interactive neural circuit. How the behavioral
components interact and how they are supported by descending neural pathways are still unclear. The long-
term goal of this research is to build a predictive model and identify key behavioral and neural principles for
designing targeted therapies to facilitate the reacquisition of hand dexterity to improve quality of life. The
current objective of this project is to investigate behavioral and neural mechanisms of hand dexterity and its
impairment and recovery after stroke. The central hypothesis is that three essential components of hand
function, finger individuation, precision grip, and power grip, largely rely on three distinct control variables,
flexibility, coordination, and strength, and separable descending pathways: direct- and indirect-corticospinal
tract (CST), and reticulospinal tract (RST). The rationale for this project is that directly comparing different
components of dexterity using kinematics/kinetics at the same levels of granularity, combined with the most
advanced measures of descending neural pathway structure and function holds promise in a new model of
hand dexterity. Two specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis: 1) characterize effect of stroke
on individuation, precision grip, and power grip; and 2) determine if stroke-related disruption in the structure
and function of three descending neural pathways are associated with three behavioral components. Under
Aim 1, chronic stroke patients and healthy controls’ Individuation and Precision Grip will be directly compared
using isometric forces recorded in high resolution at all ten fingertips in 3D, and their interaction with Power
Grip will be examined. Under Aim 2, high-resolution tractography using diffusion-weighted MRI will be obtained
to assess structural integrity of the three descending pathways. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
paired with peripheral nerve stimulation will be used to assess functional involvement of the three pathways
using short-, long-, and extra-long interval modulation of Hoffmann-reflex. Under Aim3, a model will be built to
map severity of impairment in behavioral measures to neurophysiological markers derived from Aim 1&2 to test
the hypothesis that stroke survivors’ direct-, indirect-CST and RST measures will be predictive of individuation,
precision grip, and power grip behaviors, respectively. The proposal is innovative because it reconceptualizes
dexterity by, for the first time, directly assessing essential components of dexterity behaviors and descending
pathways with cutting-edge techniques and build a neural model from these findings. It is significant because
findings from this project will guide the creation of sensitive clinical assessments and redefine therapeutic
interventions for optimal hand rehabilitation after stroke to enhance patients’ quality of life."

Among the more than 39 million people who live near ports in the United States (U.S.) are residents of the fourth
most populous city, Houston, Texas. Houston is home to Port Houston, one of the busiest ports in the nation.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) estimated marine vessel diesel engines contributed
more than 11,000 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 300 tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and 1,800 tons of
sulfur dioxide (SO2) to air basins in Harris, Galveston, and Brazoria Counties in 2014, which added to the region’s
difficulty in meeting the national ambient air quality standards for O3 and PM2.5. Concerns about potential health
effects for residents who live near ports and bear the greatest burden of ship emissions have been rising. The
overarching goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the impact of the mandatory reduction of vessel fuel
sulfur content in the North American Emission Control Area (NA ECA) that went into effect on January 1, 2015,
on air quality and health. Our overall hypothesis is that total and cause-specific (non-accidental) mortality and
hospital admissions associated with Port Houston shipping emissions exposures decreased in Harris County,
TX due to the policy and regulatory change to low sulfur fuel oil for marine vessels transiting the NA ECA. For
exposure assessment of shipping emissions, we will employ a spatially enhanced advanced source
apportionment method (Bayesian spatial multivariate receptor modeling) that incorporates spatial correlation in
multi-site multipollutant data into the estimation of source profiles and contributions, which enables the prediction
of unobserved source-specific exposures at any location, monitored or not, and significantly reduces spatial
misalignment errors. Our objectives are three-fold. First, we will estimate shipping emissions spatial fields along
with their uncertainty estimates and construct maps of latent shipping emissions over Harris County that can be
used for identifying hot spots as well as for visualizing the changes before and after the intervention (NA ECA).
Second, we will estimate the effects of the intervention along with uncertainty estimates, including effect
estimates of shipping emissions on mortality and morbidity for Harris County residents. Third, we will examine
the effects of the intervention for subpopulations of different racial/ethnic groups and by neighborhood
disadvantage, sex, and age. This proposal responds to the NIEHS mission of evaluating disproportionate risks
of diseases due to combined environmental exposures. Tangible outcomes will include temporally- and spatially
resolved source-specific air pollution surfaces due to shipping emissions and other major pollution sources that
can be adapted in future investigations both in Houston and elsewhere in the nation and used to develop targeted
interventions to mitigate health risks."

 2 Children with speech sound disorders (SSD) produce speech sound errors beyond a developmentally-
 3 appropriate age, make up a significant portion of school-based speech-language pathologist (SLP) caseloads.
 4 Currently, we know that difficulties with speech production are often associated with other learning disabilities
 5 (6-7), particularly reading (8-11) and spelling (12-13) disorders. Speech sound therapy is effective at
 6 improving speech sound production (25) and has downstream effects on additional phonological
 7 knowledge required for word decoding, speech perception, phonological working memory, and spelling (6-13).
 8 There are features of the school-based speech sound therapy environment that are considered active
 9 ingredients for change. For example, session dosage positively impacts speech sound accuracy (25); however,
10 group format has been largely neglected as a malleable feature of the therapy environment in clinical research
11 despite the ubiquitous provision of group therapy in schools (20). The dynamics between characteristics of the
12 speech sound therapy environment is currently unknown, but is a daily decision for school-based SLPs.
13 The overall objective of this exploratory, pre-implementation proposal is to study the active ingredients of
14 school-based speech sound therapy for children with SSDs. The project will investigate features of the speech
15 sound therapy environment (e.g., group format, dosage, session frequency/duration, therapy approach) as
16 they relate to individual differences in children’s speech sound production skills and their more generalized
17 phonological knowledge, required for successful word decoding and spelling. The central hypothesis to this
18 work is that features of the speech sound therapy environment proximally improve speech sound production,
19 and distally improve phonological knowledge. Therefore, speech sound therapy outcomes extend beyond “just
20 speech” (46) and into academic performance. Crucially, phonological knowledge varies for individual children.
21 This innovative investigation will comprehensively examine the dynamics between features of the speech
22 sound therapy environment and their effect on phonological learning from a large sample of school-based
23 SLPs (N = 80) working with kindergarten, first, and second grade children (N = 400) with SSDs, in four non-
24 overlapping cohorts.
25 The proposed project will provide necessary pre-implementation evidence to determine “what works for whom”
26 within a school-based setting. There is a crucial need to understand the nature of the associations between the
27 school-based therapy environment and each child’s individual phonological knowledge profile to: 1) determine
28 efficient pathways to improving speech sound production accuracy and 2) mitigate long-term difficulties on
29 academic performance for this heterogeneous clinical population. Understanding these malleable features is
30 crucial to determining how therapy may be individually tailored to optimize outcomes for children with SSDs."
10803534,"After decades of intense effort, two disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been recently
approved by the FDA: aducanumab and lecanemab. Although these drugs represent a major advance in AD
therapeutics, they have limitations: modest clinical benefit and side effects (brain edema and hemorrhage).
Additional therapies targeting new AD mechanisms are desperately needed to improve clinical benefit and
reduce side effects. Moreover, precision medicine for AD will require a panoply of drugs targeting different AD
mechanisms that will allow tailoring a combination therapy to the individual patient. The goal of this R01 is to
explore the therapeutic potential of inhibiting one such AD mechanism, that of Aβ-induced membrane damage.
Amyloid plaques consisting of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of
hyperphosphorylated tau protein are hallmarks of AD brain. Amyloid plaques accumulate many years before
NFTs arise. Aβ appears to be toxic to neurons surrounding plaques, causing molecular and cellular alterations
that lead to tau pathology, synapse loss, neuron death, and ultimately memory impairment and dementia.
However, the mechanism connecting Aβ with tau hyperphosphorylation and pathology is unknown and one of
the great mysteries of AD. A clue could come from dystrophic neurites (DNs), an understudied AD pathology
that is mostly of axonal origin and tightly associated with the borders of amyloid plaques. DN morphology
suggests that direct axon contact with the Aβ plaque is necessary for the formation of DNs. Our results indicate
that Aβ interaction with the axon plasma membrane causes plasmalemma damage, Ca2+ leakage, kinase
activation, microtubule disruption, axonal transport impairment, tau hyperphosphorylation, and DN formation.
Importantly, our preliminary results show that overexpression of the membrane repair protein annexin A6 in the
5XFAD mouse model of amyloid pathology reduces the formation of DNs and the accumulation of tau
phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), an early biomarker of amyloid pathology in AD. Other work suggests
that DNs are crucibles of AD tau phosphorylation, seeding, and spreading. In this R01, we will investigate annexin
A6-mediated membrane repair following Aβ-induced membrane damage and DN formation (Aim 1) and reduction
of p-tau accumulation and the seeding and spreading of AD tau (Aim 2) in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we will
investigate recombinant annexin A6-mediated membrane repair and reduction of DN formation, p-tau
accumulation, and AD tau seeding and spreading (Aim 3). We will use a combination of molecular (immunoblot
analysis, biochemical assays), cellular (laser injury, dye penetration, immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging,
EM), electrophysiological (LTP) and cognitive (water maze, fear conditioning, novel object recognition, Y-maze)
approaches to accomplish these Aims. These experiments will serve as therapeutic proof-of-concept supporting
annexin A6 for the prevention or treatment of AD."
10803606,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the most common and second deadliest non-skin cancer in American men, accounting for
26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. Active surveillance, radical prostatectomy and
radiotherapy are commonly used treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, current risk
stratification methods cannot be used effectively to avoid subjecting patients with clinically indolent cancers to
unnecessary interventions, causing significant morbidity and cost. The primary components currently involved
in screening are the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum biomarkers, such as PSA, PCA3, PHI, and 4Kscore.
Unfortunately, despite advances in these tests, overdiagnosis remains a major problem due to limited
specificity. As a result, 90% of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer receive treatment, even though up to
60% of those patients could be candidates for active surveillance. Such treatment often results in long-term
reductions in functional outcomes.
The research objective of this R01 is to develop novel markers and models to both more accurately detect
aggressive cancer and to forecast its arrival. Using a large cohort of patients, we first plan to identify novel
pathomic and germline features that indicate the presence of aggressive cancer or its precursors. We then
plan to implement an integrative graph convolutional network (GCN) combined with a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to generate new multi-modal representations of underlying cancer state within the entire
prostate. The framework will combine multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), digital histology
images, germline features, biomarkers, and other predictors. We will also implement a baseline nomogram risk
model for comparison, as well as several new nomogram models that incorporate our newly identified features."
10803782,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Age and female sex are independent risk factors for stroke and dementia due to atrial fibrillation. Why women
are more susceptible to dementia when they have atrial fibrillation is unclear. This proposal aims to identify the
underlying pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation that leads to dementia, in animals of both sexes.
We will use four core genotype and wild type mice to study sex differences in atrial fibrillation related dementia.
The four-core genotype mouse model will be used to dissect the role of sex hormones from that of the sex
chromosomal complement. In this model, the testes determining gene, Sry, is present on autosome instead of
being on the Y chromosome, therefore, we obtain the four core genotypes; XX and XY males and; XX and XY
females. We will use state of the art mouse ambulatory electrocardiogram, trans-esophageal atrial pacing and
optical mapping to detect sex differences in atrial fibrillation burden and cardiac electrophysiology. To study
inflammation/fibrosis in the atrial substrate, we will use MRI, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry
to quantify myeloid cells. We will assess sexual dimorphism in chronic atrial fibrillation induced inflammatory
injury in the brain using MRI, behavioral tests, histology and flow cytometry (to assess microglia). These studies
will help us identify XX/XY gene directed inflammatory pathways that may be important sex specific drug targets.
Our study will also use aged mice with fibrin gene deletion, and wild-type mice treated with a pharmacological
inhibitor of fibrosis. We will use Pirfenidone, (a drug that is currently approved for use in pulmonary fibrosis), to
identify the complex sex specific role of atrial inflammation and fibrosis on atrial fibrillation burden and
inflammation of the neurovascular unit which may lead to dementia.
The ultimate goal of this study is to prevent the morbidity from atrial fibrillation related dementia in elderly women.
Patients with atrial fibrillation use anticoagulants for stroke prevention, but those have a high bleeding risk, are
incompletely protective and have unclear benefits on cognitive decline from atrial fibrillation. It is important to
understand the contributions of sex chromosomal complement in the atrial fibrillation related heart brain axis, as
this would assist in the development of new sex-specific atrial fibrillation and dementia preventative therapies."
10788286,"Dental caries is a polymicrobial disease that affects much of the human population worldwide, where the
harmony of a cooperative eco-organization shifts towards a dysbiotic framework with overrepresentation of
pathogenic microorganisms, particularly by Streptococcus mutans (SM). For planktonic SM, adhesion to tooth
surface and/or dental biofilms is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of dental caries, and SM has evolved (i) SM-
host and (ii) SM-microbial interactions, which are mediated through its surface proteins (adhesins).
SM’s adhesion mediated interactions include: (A) The recent discovery of redundant high affinity binding of
SM’s adhesins to the scavenger receptor cysteine rich domains (SRCR) of the salivary glycoprotein 340 (Gp340),
which promotes caries susceptibility in the SM-host interface; and (B) The revelation of SM’s adhesin required
for the SM-Candida albicans (CA) biofilm formation and acid production, which enhances cariogenicity in early
childhood caries in the SM-microbial interface. Together these have revealed previously unknown interactions
by once thought to be well-known and well-characterized adhesins on SM. Yet the key unanswered question
remains, “how does SM mediate such redundant, but specific binding to host proteins and to other microbes?”
The goal of this application is to determine the specific motif(s) and/or molecular mechanism(s) that drive
SM’s adherence, particularly how they enable binding to multiple ligands. Our structural and functional studies
show that SM’s surface adhesins mediate these attachments primarily via two major structural domains, the V-
and C-fold. We hypothesize that “the V- and C-fold present on the surface adhesins of SM mediate specific
interactions through common binding motif(s) that are crucial for biofilm formation and microbial colonization”.
We will address our hypothesis through three specific aims (SAs) by (a) mapping the adherence motif(s) on the
V-fold (SA1) and (b) C-fold (SA2) of oral streptococcal adhesins, and (c) investigating the role of SM’s adhesins
in the SM-Candida albicans (CA) interface (SA3).
The results from this multi-PD/PI study will (i) Determine the binding-motif(s)/mechanisms globally adopted
by the V- and C-fold among SM’s adhesins; (ii) Determine the presence of distinct and/or overlapping adherence
sites for various ligands; (iii) Provide a comparative analysis of the V- and C-fold of various adhesins from mutans
and viridans streptococci, revealing species-specific differences in their binding-motifs/mechanisms; (iv)
Characterize the role of SM adhesins at the SM-CA interface; and (v) Elucidate alternations in the microbial
ecology modulated by SM’s V- and C-folds, particularly as they relate to dental caries.
Our proposed structural analyses, genetic manipulation of key adhesion motif(s) and animal model studies
will determine the adherence mechanisms and address the knowledge gap on SM’s V- and C-fold, particularly
their crucial role in promoting colonization and virulence. The results will enable future development of selective
combinatorial therapeutics to prevent SM’s adherence to host and microbes."
10788289,"Suicide death rates in the United States have increased 35% since 1999. In 2018, there were over 48,000
suicide deaths, and an estimated 1.4 million adults attempted suicide. In response, health systems are
adopting suicide risk prediction models to guide delivery of suicide prevention interventions.
Suicide prediction models estimated from health care records may perpetuate current disparities in health care
access, quality, and outcomes. Suicide prediction models may not accurately identify high-risk patients from all
racial and ethnic groups. Suicide rates vary by race and ethnicity, and both the highest and lowest rates are
seen in traditionally underserved populations. Suicide rates are highest among American Indians and Alaskan
Natives (22.1 per 100,000 people) and lowest in Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic populations
(7.0-7.4 per 100,000 people) compared to 18.0 per 100,000 people for White non-Hispanics.
Differences in performance of suicide risk prediction models across racial and ethnic subgroups have three
possible sources. First, predictors of suicide risk may be measured with error, and this error may be different
for racial and ethnic subgroups. Second, suicide attempts and deaths may be misclassified, and
misclassification rates may differ by race and ethnicity. Third, the association between predictors and
outcomes may vary by race and ethnicity, i.e., risk modification.
Existing methods for estimating prediction models are not designed to address racial and ethnic disparities in
performance. Estimation procedures focus on optimizing performance across the entire population, not within
subgroups, and performance in less prevalent subgroups has little impact on overall accuracy. While machine
learning methods, like random forest, explore interactions between predictors and race or ethnicity, suicide
attempt and death are rare events, which limits the information available to identify race- and ethnicity-specific
risk factors. There is also insufficient guidance on sample size calculations for prediction studies.
We will develop novel statistical methods for random forest models that reduce racial and ethnic disparities in
performance of suicide prediction models by addressing gaps in current methods. Aim 1 will develop new
procedures for prediction model estimation that maximize predictive performance within racial and ethnic
subgroups, rather than maximizing average performance across the entire population. Aim 2 will integrate
methods to adjust for differential outcome misclassification in prediction model estimation and evaluation. Aim
3 will design sample size calculations to determine if a study is able to accurately predict outcomes within
racial and ethnic subgroups. We will use existing data on suicide risk factors and outcomes for 15 million
outpatient mental health, 10 million primary care, and 2 million emergency department visits from the NIMH-
funded Mental Health Research Network to implement our methods and estimate suicide prediction models for
each setting that accurately identify patients at highest risk of suicide across all races and ethnicities."

Adverse patient safety event rates remain stubbornly high in hospitals. For children, adverse events are 1.5-2
times more common than in adult inpatients (40.0 vs. 25.1 harms/100 admissions). This proposal uses an
untapped source of safety event reporting—patients and family members of hospitalized pediatric patients—to
address knowledge gaps identified by the NICHD: the epidemiology of pediatric safety events; strengths and
limitations of current methods of error reporting systems; methods to prevent pediatric medication errors; and
the development of learning health systems to address inpatient pediatric safety. Text messaging and mobile
phone applications technologies offer the opportunity to gather patients' and families' safety reports in real-time
and anonymously, addressing limitations of prior work. Our mobile phone-based approach, Family Input for
Quality and Safety (FIQS), was developed in partnership with families and clinicians, and was pilot-tested on a
pediatric medical-surgical unit, with enthusiastic engagement from participants and staff. The objectives of this
proposal are to address the rigor of prior work in the following aims, while testing the approach in other hospital
units (e.g., ICU, hematology-oncology) and in a safety net hospital. Aim 1: Describe variations in safety events
across care settings and populations using family- and patient-generated safety reports (N~6,500 participants;
N~3000 FIQS Reports). This will use the real-time mobile phone tool to determine differences in family and
patient safety reports by hospital setting, medical complexity, language, health technology literacy, and patient
and family-member demographics. Aim 2: Compare FIQS reports to clinician-generated safety reports
documented in incident reports and in the medical record. This will employ mixed-methods, quantifying the
number of overlapping and unique events from each source, and using qualitative analysis to describe unique
domains covered in each source. Aim 3: Evaluate an improvement collaborative focused on incorporating
family and patient reports issues into safety efforts. The collaborative will include all participating units;
domains of focus will be medication and communication. Mixed-methods will be used to evaluate the
collaborative using the theory-driven RE-AIM implementation science framework. The proposed research is
innovative in its paradigm-shifting conceptual model of 1) patient-engaged quality improvement, 2) its use of
mobile phone technologies to gather real time data, and 3) its use of an improvement collaborative to develop
robust implementation strategies for incorporating family and patient reports into safety efforts. The contribution
of the proposed research will be a description of family and patient safety reports across multiple types of
inpatient settings in two diverse health systems; a comparison of family and patient safety reports to other
methods of detecting adverse events; and cross-setting implementation tools and strategies to incorporate
family and patient safety reports into care. These contributions will be significant because they are key steps in
implementing and evaluating a potential new approach to improving pediatric inpatient safety."
10792878,"The long-term goal is to understand the fundamental basis of complement signaling in the eye, and how
misregulation in this process leads to pathology, to ultimately aid in the development of therapeutic ap-
proaches for devastating blinding diseases. BrM, a pentalaminar extracellular matrix compartment, contains
a middle elastic layer (contains elastin, EL). Thickness and integrity of this EL is thinner and less abundant
in the macula than in the periphery; a discrepancy that is more severe in early AMD and active choroidal
neovascularization (CNV). AMD patients have elevated serum EL-peptide and anti-EL antibody levels; and
EL-peptides can increase choroidal endothelial cell migration, overall suggesting that abnormalities in EL
homeostasis play a role in AMD. We have characterized a mouse model of smoke-induced ocular pathology
(SIOP) in C57BL/6J mice. These mice exhibit increased serum levels of anti-EL antibodies (Abs, IgG2a),
and show a complete loss of integrity of the elastic layer. Conversely, mice immunized with oxidized EL
(neoepitope) develop more severe vision loss and pathology in BrM when compared to those immunized
with control EL (self-protein). We are guided by our overall hypothesis that age- and/or stress-dependent
increase in elastase activity leading to elastin degradation and coordinated production of (anti) α-elastin Abs
are early events in AMD. We further hypothesize that α-elastin Abs binding to FcγRs trigger antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, exacerbating AMD pathology, a mechanism that is amplified by com-
plement-dependent cytotoxicity. Also, we suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), an endogenous elastase
inhibitor, can be utilized to retain BrM integrity as a potential early AMD therapy. Three specific aims are
designed to determine the involvement of antibodies against elastin in BrM pathology in mouse models, and
second to test the prediction that A1-AT reduces pathobiology in mouse and man, using A1-AT for thera-
peutic purposes in mouse models and analyzing the MarketScan Database for A1-AT use and AMD onset.
The novelty of the idea is that elastase activity results in structural pathological changes (elastin loss, in-
flammation), and it is highly innovative that an existing elastase inhibitor will be tested for its ability to pre-
serve BrM integrity, as a treatment paradigm to slow down the progression of disease early in the process."
10792896,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Staphylococcus aureus is capable of infecting nearly every vertebrate organ system, triggering the formation
of characteristic tissue lesions known as abscesses. Understanding how S. aureus survives within abscesses is
critical to the development of new therapeutics, as these lesions represent the pathogen niche during infection.
In this application, we will leverage a powerful mass spectrometry-based imaging platform to identify host and
bacterial factors that contribute to staphylococcal disease. By defining how tissue niche and host biology drive
molecular heterogeneity in abscesses, we will uncover new targets for tailored anti-staphylococcal therapeutics.
 Historically, it has been technically challenging to study the bacterial and host factors that contribute to
abscess physiology for two primary reasons. First, approaches that seek to preserve abscess architecture within
a tissue sample are inherently limited to the study of known microbial and host targets. This applies to techniques
such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, which can define the spatial distribution of
analytes in a tissue but rely on pre-existing knowledge of targets. These approaches, by definition, cannot be
used to discover unknown bacterial or host factors that contribute to disease. Conversely, discovery-based
methods such as RNA sequencing or proteomics can identify novel, disease-associated analytes, but require
destructive tissue processing that eliminates information regarding the spatial orientation of microbial and host
molecules. To overcome these technical limitations, we created a mass spectrometry-based imaging platform to
identify host and microbial analytes in abscessed tissue during invasive S. aureus infection. Because imaging
mass spectrometry (IMS) does not require probes or detection reagents, this platform can define the localization
and abundance of abscess-associated analytes in a spatially-defined manner, thereby enabling the discovery of
microbial and host factors that contribute to disease pathogenesis. When applied to a model of disseminated S.
aureus infection, this IMS-based platform enabled three-dimensional molecular imaging of the staphylococcal-
host interface and powered the discovery of bacterial proteins that mark the pathogen niche within abscesses.
 Although individual abscesses typically have a similar histologic appearance, our IMS-based analysis
revealed significant molecular heterogeneity between S. aureus lesions. We hypothesize that abscesses display
molecular heterogeneity in response to tissue niche, antibacterial immune responses, and comorbid host
conditions. To test this hypothesis, we will couple our IMS platform with laser capture microdissection to enable
spatially-resolved proteomics of the staphylococcal-host interface. The proposed Aims will define the molecular
architecture of abscesses across S. aureus infected tissues and determine how innate immune effector cells and
host comorbidities drive heterogeneity in bacterial physiology and abscess molecular architecture in situ. In total,
these experiments will decipher how host biology drives molecular heterogeneity during invasive infection."

The objective of the proposed Center for Pre-Clinical Cancer Research (Cancer COBRE) at 
Louisiana State University (LSU) is to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of human 
cancer using specialized disease models that are predictive of disease in humans. The 
Administrative Core (AC) will oversee overall administrative management of the Cancer 
COBRE to ensure successful implementation and to provide the Promising Junior Investigators 
(PJIs) with essential support to achieve their research and career goals. The Cancer COBRE is 
headquartered at the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine (LSU SVM) but also will oversee 
projects and facilities located in the main LSU campus within walking distance to LSU SVM. 
SVM trains both future veterinarians and biomedical scientists and offers M.S. and Ph.D. 
degrees in Biomedical and Veterinary Medical Sciences, thus the COBRE will greatly enhance 
the research training of future scientists. The overall objectives of the AC is to provide cohesive 
management and coordination of COBRE activities, to promote a strong mentoring environment, 
and to provide a centralized infrastructure and management that will provide specialized pre- 
clinical evaluation and technology to support PJI achievement and research independence. 
The following specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1. To promote the academic success and 
research independence of PJIs through a dynamic and comprehensive mentoring program. 
Aim 2. To provide fiscal oversight and administrative support for the COBRE projects and 
scientific cores. Aim 3. To promote a research environment that will advance 
scientific discovery and foster collaborative research opportunities between the Cancer 
COBRE and the scientific community at LSU and in Louisiana."
10786587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cellular senescence is an age-related process, affecting cells that have either divided too much or
suffered significant damage to their DNA, which involves both a halt to further proliferation and the elaboration
of a secretory program that activates the immune system, presumably to flag these cells for immune clearance.
Although this is likely an important mechanism to prevent cancer, it is also a two-edged sword. Growing
evidence indicates that the accumulation of uncleared senescent cells drives a steady, age-dependent
increase in basal inflammation, termed “inflammaging”, that causes cumulative damage in many tissues,
contributing to their age-related degeneration. Importantly, senescent cells can induce new senescence in
adjacent normal cells via their secreted factors, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells is a self-
amplifying, exponential process. The role of the immune system in this vicious cycle is complex and particularly
important, as based on available evidence it both mediates the inflammation-related destruction and may
contribute to the vicious cycle via senescence within the immune system itself.
 T cells in the human immune system can be very long-lived, and have the ability to infiltrate almost any
tissue and cause destruction in various ways, but the role of senescence within the T cell repertoire is still
poorly understood. Several recently developed flow cytometry-based assays can readily measure in blood-
derived immune cells the lysosomal dysfunction known to be strongly associated with cellular senescence in
other cell types, but it is not yet clear if that means these cells are truly senescent. Nonetheless, such
lysosomal stress may still be indicative of potentially destructive cellular phenotypes, based on our own
preliminary data and other published studies. This matters because the lysosomal dysfunction, if it is causative
of these destructive properties, can be targeted by a variety of available interventions that may provide benefit
regardless of whether or not the pathogenic cells affected are canonically senescent. Conversely, if the cells in
question are truly senescent, other classes of drugs (i.e. senolytics, senomorphics) may induce their clearance
or reverse their pathogenicity. Understanding how these cellular phenotypes arise in the T cell repertoire, how
they can be detected in blood samples, and how they may be related to immune dysfunction in older
individuals, is therefore an important undertaking for public health. This proposal seeks to advance these aims
by bringing to bear a suite of state-of-the-art flow cytometry, proteomic, and gene expression profiling-based
techniques, combined with functional readouts, to definitively identify which lysosomally stressed T cells may
have pathogenic potential, and to map their occurrence across a cohort of 120 young and old donors of both
sexes. This work when completed will have generated a number of new diagnostic tools to detect specific
aging-related populations of T cells with potentially harmful properties, as well as having developed some early
preclinical leads as to what classes of drugs may clear them or mitigate their pathogenicity."

Herpesviruses are ubiquitous human pathogens worldwide. Though herpesvirus infections are
often asymptomatic in normal individuals, they cause significant morbidity and mortality in
immune-compromised individuals. Antivirals have been successfully developed to target the viral
thymidine kinase for the past nearly half-century. In the presence of such antivirals, drug-
resistance of herpes simplex viruses (HSV), including HSV-1 and HSV-2, is rapidly emerging,
particularly in those immune-compromised individuals such as AIDS patients. Thus, new antivirals
are desperately needed to cope with the dire situation.
We have previously identified the HSV-1 UL37 deamidase that deamidates and inactivates
cytosolic RIG-I and cGAS, thereby muting host innate immune defense. The enzymatic activity of
UL37 represents an “Achilles heel” that can be targeted to restore host immune defense.
Continuing our original discoveries on protein deamidation, we synthesized series of glutamine
analogues to identify inhibitors of selected protein deamidases. In this study, we have identified
three lead compounds that selectively inhibit UL37-mediated protein deamidation, but not those
mediated by cellular deamidases. Ground on these preliminary results, we will characterize the
mode of action of these UL37 inhibitors in protein deamidation and innate immune response
during HSV-1 infection. We will further employ a combination of mass spectrometry, structural
and pharmacological analysis to improve these lead compounds via iterative synthesis and
functional assays. The resulted best inhibitors will be assessed by pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamic studies as well as antiviral efficacy using mouse model. This pilot study will
not only provide proof-of-concept to counteract HSV-1 infection via inhibiting a viral deamidase
and restoring host immune defense, but also develop important tools that enable further
investigation into protein deamidation in fundamental biological processes."

Persistent immune activation is the defining feature of HIV-1 infection in vivo and a driver of progression to end-
stage AIDS. Systemic immune activation in people living with HIV has been hypothesized to account for higher
incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).
Importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that populations living with opioid-use disorder (OUD) have
a higher occurrence of comorbid HIV infection, suggesting both potential socio-economic and neurocognitive
influence. This comorbidity of OUD and HIV has also been shown to increase neuroinflammation and exacerbate
the progression of HIV infection and HAND. While some studies have investigated the interactive effects of OUD
and HAND in few cell types in isolation, the molecular mechanisms linking the two conditions is still largely
unknown, especially in primary human microglia, neurons and astrocytes. Hence, we believe that this proposal
fulfills a critical unmet need by establishing primary human neuronal cell cultures and an unbiased, systematic
single cell transcriptomic survey of these cultures in the context of co-exposure of opiates and HIV-1 infection.
In this proposal, we will establish 3D spheroid cultures consisting of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
human microglia, astrocytes and neurons, derived from 10 independent donor lines established at BUMC, that
will recapitulate spatial complexity of cell-to-cell interactions in the brain, and interrogate the effect of HIV
infection and morphine exposure on persistent innate immune activation. We will utilize cutting-edge single cell
transcriptomics analysis to identify the microglia-intrinsic pathway that promotes induction of pro-inflammatory
responses upon co-exposure to HIV and opiates and the neurodegenerative pathways contributing to neuronal
cell injury. Finally, information from these transcriptomic studies will be leveraged to inform CRISPR/Cas-based
knock-out strategies to selectively delete key pathways in iPSC-microglia to alleviate neuroinflammation. We
believe that results from these studies will inform future therapeutic development to prevent HIV and opiate-
induced neuroinflammation and prevent development of HAND in HIV+ substance use population."

 Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to a profound loss
of brain and cognitive functions. There is an urgent need to identify factors that can decrease risk, including
modifiable lifestyle behaviors. Exercise and physical activity (PA) have shown promise in reducing rates of
cognitive decline, brain structural atrophy, and risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and other related
dementias. However, despite decades of work, and recommendations to improve exercise participation, levels
of PA and engagement in purposeful exercise have not increased greatly. In contrast to PA, the effect of
sedentary behavior (SB) or time spent sitting on Alzheimer’s disease risk has received less attention. SB may
have independent physiological effects on health which may not be fully ameliorated by engaging in PA, and
there is growing evidence that SB may have detrimental effects on cognition and brain structure. Understanding
the effects of SB on Alzheimer’s disease risk may provide a key target for behavioral modification since reducing
time spent sitting may be easier to implement compared to increasing exercise levels in older adults.
 In this proposal, we will determine whether time spent in SB is associated with brain health and the risk of
developing Alzheimer’s disease and all-cause dementia. Here, we focus on the effects of SB on cognition, brain
structure, and Alzheimer’s disease incidence in the largest prospective cohort analyzed to date, the UK Biobank.
We will analyze associations between markers of SB including self-report and objective measures from wearable
accelerometers, and cognition, brain health, and incident Alzheimer’s disease and all-cause dementia. This
unique dataset will allow us to determine the best SB predictors of brain aging outcomes, including Alzheimer’s
disease incidence so that interventions can focus on reducing the most harmful aspects of SB in older adults.
Using this dataset along with three replication datasets, we will test our overarching hypothesis that high levels
of SB are associated with increased cognitive decline, poorer brain health, and increased Alzheimer’s disease
risk that is not fully mitigated by complementary engagement in PA. To test this hypothesis, this proposal will
address the following specific aims: 1) to determine how SB is associated with incident Alzheimer’s disease and
all-cause dementia, 2) to evaluate the cross-sectional and prospective relationships between SB and aspects of
cognition and brain structure associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, and 3) to investigate how displacing SB
with time spent in different PA levels modifies the association between SB and Alzheimer’s disease risk. By
evaluating a novel, comprehensive set of SB markers and testing their associations with cognition, brain
structure, and Alzheimer’s disease risk, this proposal provides a unique opportunity to obtain key data needed
to help advance efforts in developing effective interventions for Alzheimer’s disease prevention."

Population cohort studies funded by the National Institute of Health, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Com-
munities (ARIC) Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), are widely used in cardiovascular
research and have provided fundamental knowledge for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention strategies and
public health policies. Pooling data across multiple cohorts provides a unique opportunity for in-depth investiga-
tions of emerging CVD research questions, such as optimal blood pressure threshold values triggering initiation
of antihypertensive treatment for young adults, that heretofore would not have been possible. While forming a
fertile ground for innovative research, the methodological issues associated with the pooled cohorts data cannot
be as effectively addressed by existing statistical methods. There are three main analytic challenges. First, many
discrete or continuous longitudinal variables have missing values with various missing data patterns. Existing
methods either are susceptible to misspeciﬁcation biases or do not provide coherent estimates of imputation un-
certainty, and cannot handle missing not at random. Second, current causal inference methods either require
aligned measurement time points or parametric assumptions about forms of causal pathways, neither of which
can be satisﬁed in complex longitudinal health data. Third, violations of the “sequential ignorability” assumption
embedded in causal inference methodology can be a potential source of bias. The sensitivity analysis methods
for time-varying confounding with censored survival outcomes are underdeveloped. To overcome these chal-
lenges and improve statistical and CVD research, we propose a suite of generalizable statistical methods utilizing
machine learning. We propose to develop a scalable Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework to impute con-
tinuous or discrete missing at random longitudinal covariates while providing coherent uncertainty intervals, and
address the missing not at random mechanism via sensitivity analysis. We will apply the developed method to
address missing data issues for several longitudinal CVD risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels
(Speciﬁc Aim 1); to develop a robust and computationally efﬁcient BNP causal inference method (Speciﬁc Aim
2) and a new continuous-time marginal structural survival model from a Bayesian perspective (Speciﬁc Aim 3) to
study and validate the survival effects of time-varying antihypertensive treatments for young adults and the frail
elderly; to develop a ﬂexible and interpretable survival sensitivity analysis method to assess the sensitivity of the
causal effect estimates to varying degrees of sequential unmeasured confounding (Speciﬁc Aim 4); and to create
usable R software packages for all proposed methods and develop tutorial papers and short courses to bridge
theoretical and practical knowledge and promote use of our methods (Speciﬁc Aim 5)."

A distinguishing feature of SIV infection in African green monkeys (AGMs), a natural host species for SIV, is
the absence of viral dissemination in the lymphoid B-cell follicle (BCF) and the presence of strong NK cell-
mediated control of viral replication in the BCF and T-cell zone of secondary lymphoid tissues (SLT). In
SIVagm-infected AGMs, we identified the expansion of NK cells with a terminally-differentiated phenotype
expressing (i) high levels of CD16, an activating Fc receptor that mediates antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC), and (ii) low levels of NKG2a, an inhibitory receptor that modulates NK cell education via
interactions with MHC-E. This terminally-differentiated NK cell (NKTD) subset (NKG2alowCD16+) exhibited
adaptive-like properties and showed high cytolytic activity against target cells presenting SIV-Env peptides in
the context of MHC-E. In contrast, the formation of NKTD cells was blocked in pathogenic SIVmac infection in
rhesus macaques (RMs), and not improved with ART, in favor of a subset (NKG2ahiCD16+) with pro-
inflammatory function, such as production of IFN-γ. Remarkably, we demonstrated in SIVmac-infected, ART-
treated RMs that AGM-like profiles of adaptive NKTD cells are rescued in blood via treatment with interleukin-21
(IL-21) as a monotherapy following ART initiation. In IL-21-treated RMs, the frequency and responsiveness of
blood NKTD cells to target cells presenting SIV peptides in the context of MHC-E strongly correlated with a
reduction of SIV DNA in the gut and of replication-competent virus in SLT. Yet, we were not able to determine
if IL-21 induces NKTD cells in tissues and we showed that, after analytical ART treatment interruption (ATI) in
absence of IL-21 administration, the NKTD cells rapidly vanished, and virus then concomitantly rebounded in all
RMs. The main objectives of this proposal are (i) to define at an unprecedented level the function and
distribution of NK cells in tissues from SIV-infected, ART-treated RMs after IL-21 administration; an analysis
which in parallel will be extended to other immune cells that either produce (e.g. TFH) or are sensitive to (e.g.
antigen-presenting cells and CD8+ T cells) IL-21 signaling (Aim 1); (ii) to evaluate if the levels of NKTD cells that
are induced by early IL-21 administration can be durably prolonged after ATI in the presence of IL-21, bNAbs,
or both (Aim 1 and 2); and (iii) to test if IL-21-induced NKTD cells will synergize with a cocktail of SIV-Env
targeted broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to induce ADCC-mediated clearance of infected cells and to
durably control viral rebound after ATI (Aim 2). Based on a large set of preliminary data, we hypothesize that
the proposed approach will allow differentiation into NKTD cells with IL-21 followed by improved bNAb targeting
and ADCC-mediated killing of those infected cells that support viral rebound following ART cessation. Using a
pre-clinical model reproducing the complex virus-host interactions in PLWH, our studies will allow us to
determine the mechanisms and synergistic potential of the “differentiate, target, and kill” approach in
intercepting and killing virus-infected cells to strongly promote viral remission."

TRD-2
TRD project 2 will develop imaging platforms based on novel circular ranging (CR) architectures of optical
coherence tomography. Specific Aim #1 addresses long-standing challenges to using OCT in open surgery.
Conventional approaches burdened the surgeon with cumbersome equipment and required disruptions in
workflow. We will leverage the depth-independence of CR to enable a head-mounted OCT microscope that
can continuously survey the surgical field. This OCT loupe platform will be specifically developed to provide
improved visualization of nerves to prevent accidental injury to these delicate and critical tissues, and thereby
avoiding some of the most feared surgical morbidities. Specific Aim #2 integrates recent advancements in
quantitative flow imaging with extremely rapid retinal CR-OCT technology to enable a platform for wide-field
angiography and quantitative flow mapping in the human retina. Quantitative flow imaging will enable
comprehensive, pulse resolved maps of the non-capillary retinal vascular networks, positioning investigators to
decipher the interaction of retinal perfusion and disease. Wide-field angiography will reduce barriers that have
limited clinicians and scientists from reliably and routinely imaging the peripheral retina Through these aims,
TRD-2 will develop, validate, and deliver innovative technologies to our collaborating investigators and to the
broader biomedical community."

TRD 3
The goal of this TRD project is to enhance the power and functionality of endoscopic and probe-based OCT.
The small form factor of fiber-optic OCT probes affords the capacity to reach remote organs of the human
body, enabling OCT to be routinely used for clinical investigation of the coronary arteries, the gastrointestinal
tract, and the lung. However, many strategies to improve image contrast through advanced OCT signal
collection and processing are incompatible with the spatial and practical constraints of probe-based OCT. This
impairs diagnostic performance and feedback to guide interventions. The focus of TRD 3 is to address some of
these limitations.
OCT derives image contrast from variations in the tissue’s backscattering properties, but subtle differences in
the scattering properties can be difficult to identify because the signal from subsurface microstructure adds up
coherently, resulting in speckle. Polarization offers a complementary endogenous contrast mechanism that can
afford contrast between tissues that are indiscernible in OCT’s backscattering signal. Many tissues with a
fibrillar architecture exhibit birefringence and delay light depending on the alignment of its polarization state
with the fibrillar tissue components.
Specific Aim 1 capitalizes on tissue’s intrinsic birefringence to measure the orientation of fibrillar tissue
elements in all three spatial dimensions through fiber-optic imaging probes. This is specifically relevant for
imaging birefringent white matter tracts during stereotactic neurosurgery in the brain. Imaging probes
containing two imaging channels at distinct illumination angles and interfaced through a multi-channel motor
drive unit will be fabricated. Algorithms that leverage the multiple imaging angles and observe additional
continuity constraints will be developed to reconstruct 3D vectorial birefringence. Visualizing the 3D orientation
of axonal tracts surrounding an intracranial probe will enable microscopic guidance of stereotactic procedures,
such as the implantation of stimulation electrodes for deep brain stimulation.
Specific Aim 2 responds to the persistent challenge of speckle in OCT by leveraging machine learning to
encapsulate the physical meaning of hardware-based speckle suppression into a trained algorithm. A novel
method to generate ground truth speckle-suppressed tomograms using sample tilting for angular compounding
will be developed to enable supervised training of a deep neural network. The specific challenge of deploying
the trained algorithm to new imaging systems will be addressed by developing both a supervised and an
unsupervised method for domain adaptation. Improved image contrast and speckle suppression are critical for
interpretation of many tissue pathologies, including, e.g., the diagnosis and staging of skin and oral cancer.
Combined, these efforts will improve the contrast achievable with probe-based OCT, thereby enhancing its
practical use and extending its utility to new applications where decisive contrast has been lacking."

 The three human alleles of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) differentially impact individual risk for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), with the APOE4 allele significantly increasing risk in a dose dependent manner. The mechanisms
by which APOE4 elevates AD risk are not fully understood. As compared to other alleles, APOE4 may reduce
clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) from the central nervous system. Moreover, in mice with targeted replacement (TR)
of APOE or APOE3, APOE4 TR mice show a relative reduction in dendritic complexity and impaired learning.
This is significant in that these mice do not deposit Aβ, suggesting that APOE4 might independently reduce
cognitive reserve and thus enhance vulnerability to AD and cognitive decline. Consistent with this is a more
recent study of sharp wave ripple (SWR) abundance, in which SWR abundance was reduced in APOE4 TR
mice. SWRs are events in which assemblies of hippocampal neurons, sequentially activated as a function of
time and place during a learning experience, are sequentially replayed in an accelerated fashion during quiet
restfulness and slow wave sleep. Replay is critical to memory consolidation and to transfer of hippocampal
encoded experience to cortical areas for long term storage. Accumulating evidence suggests that deficits in
neuronal plasticity, including reduced pyramidal cell arborization and SWR abundance, may be due in part to
alterations in brain extracellular matrix (ECM) including perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are a specialized form
of ECM predominantly localized to the soma and proximal dendrites of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)
releasing parvalbumin (PV) expressing inhibitory interneurons, and they facilitate GABAergic inhibitory
transmission to constrain excitatory neuroplasticity. Indeed, maturation of PNNs coincides with the closure of
critical periods of enhanced physiological plasticity. Conversely, drugs that attenuate PNN abundance can
increase long term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal neurotransmission, plasticity of glutamatergic
neurotransmission, cognitive flexibility and SWR abundance in adult rodents. In the present proposal, we outline
plans to test the hypothesis that APOE4 is linked to a dysregulation of the balance between PNN deposition and
proteolysis, and that it is this imbalance that leads to deficits including reduced SWR abundance. This hypothesis
is based on published and preliminary data discussed in the background. In this proposal, we also outline plans
to test the hypothesis that two FDA approved compounds, venlafaxine and maraviroc, will normalize ECM levels
and physiological changes observed in APOE4 TR mice including reduced SWR abundance. Venlafaxine is an
antidepressant medication with the potential to increase matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels and
attenuate the PNN, while maraviroc is instead an antagonist for CCR5, a hypothetical regulator of the ECM. The
CCL5 receptor, CCR5, restricts LTP and post-stroke neuroplasticity, while both LTP and plasticity are instead
increased in CCL5-receptor antagonist treated mice."

 Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and related chronic degenerative dementias may
begin as long as 20 years before clinical symptoms become evident. There is increasing evidence that
unobtrusive monitoring of older adults' performance of complex daily activities of living may allow us to detect
some of these subtle early changes in cognition. The rapidly increasing use of sensors not only in commercial
vehicles, but also in passenger vehicles, and large number of older drivers on U.S. roads suggest that sensor
data may be reconfigured to provide this early warning system. In this longitudinal mixed methods study, we
will recruit and enroll 750 older drivers, establish their baseline cognitive function and driving behavior
profiles, and repeat the cognitive testing and in-vehicle sensor data downloading every three months for three
years (12 data points). Over this time, we expect approximately 200 participants to have experienced
measurable cognitive decline either from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment levels and/or mild
cognitive impairment to early stage dementia levels. We propose to install a sensor system which will include
unobtrusive cameras, on-board diagnostics (OBD), GPS and inertial measurement units (IMU) configured to
track and record driver behavior in the passenger vehicles of these 750 older adult (≥ 65) drivers. The recorded
changes in driver behavior will be compared to results from a battery of cognitive tests (global cognition,
executive function, memory, visuospatial, visual attention and language) with demonstrated ability to detect
early cognitive changes and to predict driver risk. The innovation of this research project lies in the rigorous
testing of an unobtrusive, rapidly and readily available in-vehicle sensing and monitoring system for its ability
to detect early changes in cognition in older drivers. There is an estimated 4 to 8 million older drivers with
mild cognitive impairment on the roads in the U.S. This significant number of older drivers poses a major
concern for public safety. Moreover, the majority may be unaware of the cognitive changes occurring. Current
dementia screening programs are able to test only a small number of older adults and the wellness visits
covered by Medicare do not detect these early, subtle changes. Yet early detection offers many medical,
emotional and financial benefits for the individual, family and society, opening a “window of time” to intervene
in the progression of the disease in the future (Alzheimer's Association 2019 Report). The proposed testing
and evaluation of a readily and rapidly available, unobtrusive in-vehicle sensing system could provide the first
step toward future widespread, low-cost, early warnings of change for the large number of older drivers in the

Education”
Abstract
The typical undergraduate Biomedical Engineering (BMED) curriculum includes a broad base of
coursework in math, biology, chemistry, physics, and general engineering – typically serviced by
other departments, before beginning – what students often call – their “real” BMED education in
their third year in the program. We have developed a Biomedical/Clinical Engineering
Partnership (BiCEP) program to provide clinically-relevant team-based design experiences at
every level of the curriculum. Projects and experiences seed and germinate, feeding additional
entrepreneurial opportunities beyond the core undergraduate curriculum. At the core of the
BiCEP program consists of two parts: i) Summer Immersion in Design Experience (SIDE)
course focusing on the device design and development process and entrepreneurship in the
biomedical space, and ii) a Clinical Immersion Experience (CLINEX) program that engages
students with clinical mentors in a hospital setting.
Combining these experiences for students between their 2nd and 3rd years of the program
provides a contextual bridge between their varied lower-division coursework and their more
integrative upper-division core courses in the BMED program. Observing procedures in clinical
and hospital settings, and engaging with their clinical mentors, students will develop a project
idea and carry it through needs finding, ideation/brainstorming, and prototyping phases. SIDE
coursework will scaffold their clinical experiences, providing a forum for sharing clinical
observations and aid the development of their projects.
Multiplying the impact of the SIDE, students and faculty will develop projects to integrate in to
coursework at every stage of the BMED program. Clinical observations and ideation activities in
first year introductory major courses, prototyping activities in second year design and
manufacturing coursework, modeling projects in third year simulation and analysis coursework,
and most importantly, SIDE participants and clinical mentors will act as “clients” for our
capstone senior design projects in the fourth year of the program. Successful projects at the
capstone level are further expanded into graduate level projects through our Master’s Project
Track and/or engaged with the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for student-led
business creation, acceleration, and incubation.
The goal of this program is to integrate the clinical and medical context with design experiences
throughout the BMED curriculum."

Zambia, which spans the southern and central Africa region, contains the full continuum of malaria endemicity
(hypo-, meso-, and holoendemic), positioning it as an ideal environment for the development of enhanced
surveillance tools with broad applicability. Malaria control and elimination in Zambia requires optimizing
strategies for current and novel interventions, and the lessons learned will be applicable elsewhere in sub-
Saharan Africa with similar endemicities. The World Health Organization emphasizes the need to refocus on
reducing morbidity and mortality and identifying the optimal set of interventions for areas of hyper- and
holoendemic malaria. Increasing urbanization of human populations and the incursion of urban malaria vectors
into sub-Saharan Africa present an additional new threat, particularly in mesoendemic areas. In low-transmission
settings, subnational malaria elimination is challenging to achieve, verify, and sustain. Integrated surveillance
approaches linked bidirectionally to interventions and tailored to local contexts are required to inform and support
the implementation of existing and forthcoming interventions. We propose multiple approaches to quantifying
and characterizing malaria transmission by combining traditional and novel data sets using mathematical
modeling and machine learning-supported computational approaches. We will establish data streams and
operationalize surveillance platforms in Zambia that will enable the development and integration of measurement
and computational tools to transform malaria surveillance into a key intervention and address outstanding
scientific questions on the barriers to control and elimination in high, medium, and low transmission settings.

10837341,"ABSTRACT
Malaria control and elimination are stymied by incompletely understood drivers of transmission by both the
human reservoir and vector mosquitoes. Although the specifics of these drivers and the barriers they present
are not uniform across transmission settings, there are common gaps in knowledge that, if filled, could lead to
more effective control strategies and surveillance systems. The first of these fundamental gaps is the
spatiotemporal risk of malaria transmission created by interaction of the anopheline vector and human host.
We will address this at the household level by assessing when and where mosquito and human behaviors
enable the interaction between parasites, vectors, and humans. The second gap is in understanding who is
most at risk. Individuals differ not only in their risk behaviors but also by how attractive they are to mosquitoes.
Lastly, where malaria transmission is low and nearing elimination, surveillance strategies based on detection of
parasite-positive vectors or gametocytes in human hosts are not efficient for targeting hotspots. Different
metrics and tools are needed to achieve and sustain malaria elimination. Serological surveillance of residual
blood at rural health facilities coupled with a near real-time data visualization dashboard could guide malaria
elimination interventions at fine spatial scales.

10837092,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a sub-gingival Gram-negative bacterium that is closely associated with
periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disorder. Found in low numbers in healthy sites, its prevalence increases
during disease, indicating it is well equipped to survive hostile inflammatory conditions. Animal models have
demonstrated that P. gingivalis infection causes microbial dysbiosis in sub-gingival plaque with an ensuing
increase in inflammation, which are the hallmarks of periodontal disease, marking it as a keystone pathogen.
P. gingivalis evades the powerful innate immune response mediated by the receptor TLR4 by modifying its lipid
A structure and has the unusual ability to elicit copious amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) armed
with select virulence factors such as innate host protein destroying proteases. We have identified the crucial
lipid A modification genes which are responsible for lipid A structural changes that elicit TLR4 evasion, and,
additionally, contribute to OMV formation. These genes are a lipid A deacylase gene encoded by PGN_1123,
and PG1773 and PG1587, which encode lipid A C1- and C4'-phosphatases respectively.
In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate that all three of these genes are expressed higher in vivo in human
plaque samples than in vitro and also exhibit higher expression in diseased sites than in health. However,
nothing is known concerning how these genes are regulated in response to differing environmental conditions.
We next demonstrate that lipid A phosphatase mutants have opposing effects on vesicle formation, suggesting
regulation of PG1587 and PG1773 modulates the amount of OMVs produced.
Therefore, in this application the following hypothesis will be tested: “P. gingivalis modifies its lipid A structure
in response to local environmental conditions and this contributes both to its ability to survive in vivo and

10932292,"Diagnostic error is thought to be common, costly, and associated with substantial patient harm
in the United States (U.S.). A recent report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) highlighted the importance of addressing diagnostic error in emergency care and called
for additional research examining contemporary diagnostic errors rates in U.S. emergency
departments (EDs). ED visits are common, with 1 in 5 Americans visiting the ED, leading to over
130 million ED visits annually. Diagnostic accuracy for emergency conditions is essential for
optimal patient outcomes. Yet, the very nature of the ED, including unpredictable patient
volume, limited time and available information, as well as frequent interruptions, can make
diagnostic accuracy in the ED challenging. While there has been substantial attention paid to
the variation in the quality of emergency care, there has been relatively less research on
diagnostic safety in the ED, as highlighted by the recent AHRQ report. This project will use
representative national claims data to provide detailed evidence on the landscape of diagnostic
error in U.S. EDs. We will quantify the rate of diagnostic error for high-risk emergency conditions
as well as the common symptoms associated with these diseases. Additionally, we will examine
the degree to which diagnostic error in emergency care is associated with patient harm. We will
identify the patient, clinician, and hospital factors associated with greater risk of diagnostic error.
Finally, we will examine if having an ambulatory follow-up visit after an ED diagnostic error can
mitigate the harms associated with misdiagnosis. This national study will enable frontline
clinicians and policymakers to understand the extent of diagnostic error in U.S. EDs and the
factors that may be targeted for quality improvement efforts to address this important public
health problem."
10933530,"ABSTRACT
Background. Sex-based differences, largely controlled by sex hormones, affect the natural and treated history
of HIV infection and HIV-specific immune responses. Our previous work has shown that estrogen potently
represses HIV transcription, thus decreasing cellular HIV RNA in women compared to men. Unexpectedly,
women undergoing reproductive aging have a progressive increase in levels of inducible HIV reservoir, while
estrogen declines. This observed expansion of the reservoir as women age is in sharp contrast to the steady
decline in the reservoir size observed in men. Given the increasing number of women aging with HIV, it is critical
to determine the interplay of HIV persistence and declining sex hormones during reproductive aging to design
effective HIV cure strategies.
Our goal. Our study is specifically designed with samples from both cisgender men and women across the
reproductive aging spectrum. We will first define the impact of reproductive aging on multiple features of the
reservoir including size, transcriptional activity, along with a novel exploration of clonal expansion (Aim 1). Next,
we will precisely define the immunologic changes over the course of reproductive aging, using single cell
sequencing combined with immunophenotyping using DNA-barcoded antibodies (Aim 2). The data will be
integrated, and key features established using advanced statistical analyses.
Study Cohort: Longitudinal samples (viable cells, plasma), collected, processed, and stored using standardized
protocols in the multi-site Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)
cohorts will be utilized for all proposed experiments. First, we will carefully select 25 cisgender WWH on
suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) with biologic samples representing four reproductive
stages (reproductive/pre-menopause, menopausal transition/early and late perimenopause, post-menopause).
Then, we will identify 25 MWH as controls using a multivariate propensity score based matching algorithm. After
matching, stored samples collected between 2009 and 2019 will be selected based on similar time-intervals
across both groups.
How will we advance the field? To date, the majority of HIV cure research has used male participants and
therefore a significant knowledge gap exists between men and women. We do not know if the same immune-
modulatory interventions will be effective in promoting HIV RNA transcription in men and women and how
declining sex hormones will impact their efficacy. Agents that are designed for “kick and kill” strategies may be
impacted by estradiol-mediated mechanisms as women undergo reproductive aging. A better understanding of
these differences will assist in the design of future cure approaches that can be applied across sexes."
10839877,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) demonstrate heterogeneous cognitive,
functional, and behavioral responses to disease progression, yet underlying sources of these variations remain
poorly understood. Fluctuations in communication abilities in particular have important implications for care and
attitudes toward individuals with ADRD. Of particular interest is the occurrence of episodes of lucidity (EL) in
advanced disease stages, which are characterized by the manifestation of spontaneous, meaningful, and
relevant communication abilities that were previously believed to be irretrievable. Reports suggest EL are
transient and most likely to occur near end of life, yet empiric evidence documenting these events is extremely
limited. Efforts to better understand, and ultimately define EL, are hindered by underdeveloped methodological
approaches for capturing and characterizing these events. While underutilized in ADRD research, audiovisual
observation is well-suited to addressing these gaps, as these data provide an objective data source and enable
a robust assessment of verbal and nonverbal communication, the primary means through which EL are
observed. Our long-term objective is to clarify conceptual, operational and epidemiologic understandings of EL
in ADRD. Our short-term objective is to establish the necessary foundational data and infrastructure to accelerate
systematic investigation of EL. To advance these goals, we will develop feasible and acceptable procedures to
enable capture of longitudinal audiovisual data of targeted populations and timeframes to maximize opportunities
for detecting EL; these rich data sources will then be analyzed via computational linguistic and sequential
analysis (timed-event) methods, to assemble a robust, fully characterized understanding of the linguistic, non-
linguistic, and non-verbal communication features of EL along with the specific temporal qualities of these events.
In the R21 Phase, we will demonstrate the feasibility of collecting and sharing longitudinal audiovisual data
among PLWD near end of life through a mixed-methods feasibility study to determine key ethical and practical
considerations (R21 Aim 1); and evaluate usability, reliability and capture rate for coding of verbal/nonverbal
indicators of EL from collected audiovisual data using computational linguistic and timed-event methods (R21
Aim 2). The R33 Phase will harness procedures optimized in the R21 phase to expand data collection and
develop more robust estimates of EL frequency. Specifically, we will expand longitudinal audiovisual
observations of persons with ADRD near the end of life to obtain initial estimates of EL frequency, describe event
attributes, and inform the development of definitions for EL (R33 Aim1); and establish a repository of longitudinal
audiovisual observational data and a secure data sharing platform (R33 Aim 2). Impact: Findings from this
research will set the stage for extension and validation of urgently needed objective measurement for EL in
ADRD and provide a critically needed foundation for future systematic investigation of lucidity in ADRD. The
objectives of this proposal are directly responsive to national ADRD research priorities and the NIA mission."
10839878,"Sequential Multiple Assessment Randomized Trial of Exercise for PAD: SMART Exercise for PAD
 Supervised exercise therapy (SET), consisting of treadmill exercise conducted 3 times/week at a center
in the presence of healthcare personnel, is first line therapy for people disabled by lower extremity peripheral
artery disease (PAD). However, travelling to a center for SET is burdensome. As of 2018, only 1.3% of
patients with Medicare and symptomatic PAD had enrolled in SET. Home-based exercise is more accessible
and less burdensome than SET. Yet, guidelines recommend SET over home-based exercise for PAD.
 Clinical trials have identified three characteristics of home-based exercise interventions that are highly
effective for people with PAD: 1) incorporation of behavioral change methods; 2) regular contact with a coach,
and 3) an exercise intensity that elicits ischemic leg symptoms during exercise. Recently we reported in JAMA
that a home-based exercise intervention that included these characteristics significantly and meaningfully
improved 6-minute walk in PAD, compared to an attention control group. However, no randomized trials have
directly compared SET to a highly effective home-based exercise intervention for people with PAD. In addition,
45% of people with PAD do not meaningfully respond to exercise, defined as failure to improve six-minute walk
distance by > 20 meters (a clinically meaningful improvement). This phenomenon occurs for both supervised
and home-based exercise. Our Phase II trial showed that nitrate-rich beetroot juice, which increases plasma
nitrite, limb perfusion, and exercise intensity, significantly reduced rates of non-response to exercise,
compared to placebo, in PAD. Therefore, we will use a Sequential Multiple Assessment Randomized Trial
(SMART) to address two major barriers to benefit from exercise for PAD: First, the recommendation for
supervised exercise. Second, the lack of treatment for non-response to exercise in PAD.
 In SMART Exercise for PAD, 250 participants with PAD will be randomized to home-based exercise or
SET for 12 weeks (Stage I). At 12-week follow-up, participants will be classified into ‘responders’ (> 20 meter
improvement in 6-minute walk) or ‘non-responders’ (< 20 meter improvement in 6-minute walk). In weeks 13-
24 (Stage II), all participants will continue their originally assigned exercise condition (SET or home-based),
and non-responders will be re-randomized to either augmentation with beetroot juice or placebo while
continuing their original exercise. We will test two primary hypotheses. First, whether our home-based
exercise intervention improves 6-minute walk more than SET at 12-week follow-up (Primary Aim #1). Second,
whether biologic augmentation of exercise with beetroot juice improves 6-minute walk in PAD patients
unresponsive to exercise after 12 weeks (Primary Aim #2). In Secondary and Exploratory Aims, we will identify
the optimal exercise strategy to maximize gains in walking distances for all patients with PAD, thereby
improving mobility in the millions of older people disabled by PAD."
10839879,"During the progression of most chronic kidney diseases (CKD) podocytes are lost, and injury to glomerular
endothelial cells, and changes in the composition of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) lead to
alterations of the structure and function of the glomerular filtration barrier. Understanding the mechanisms
that induce glomerular cell damage could possibly pave the way to the discovery of new pathways that
can be targeted to slow kidney disease progression or possibly reverse it.
Data presented in this proposal, using the glomerulus on a chip platform and the FUCCI mouse model that allows
tracking of the cell cycle changes in vivo, show that podocytes present an altered binding to their GBM, they exit
their quiescent state, and are lost during disease progression in Alport Syndrome (AS) mice, our model of CKD
characterized by a defective GBM. We have evidence that miR-193a is upregulated specifically in mouse and
human AS podocytes and that its inhibition favors podocyte survival and modulate podocyte interactions with
their GBM. Based on our data, we hypothesize that re-establishing glomerular function by modulating
important molecular pathways that are responsible for podocyte survival prevents further injury, thus
slowing kidney disease progression.
Using multiple transgenic AS FUCCI mice and in vitro human systems, we will study the molecular mechanisms
that regulate the podocyte cell cycle and their interaction with a defective GBM, typical of AS. Specifically, in Aim
1 we will study in vitro how modulation of miR-193a can “re-program” cellular signaling networks that influence
podocyte biology. In Aim 2 we will perform in vivo studies to determine the therapeutic effect of miR-193a inhibitor
delivered as cargo of an innovative delivery vehicle based on peptide amphiphile micelle nanoparticles
specifically designed to target podocytes in our AS colonies. Successful completion of this proposal will provide
novel insights into key factors critical for maintenance of glomerular structure and function. Importantly, this
knowledge would likely be applicable to other forms of CKD and possibly facilitate the discovery of new
therapeutic agents tailored specifically to sustain podocyte survival and minimize glomerular damage."
10879074,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Small non-coding RNAs including microRNAs and tRNA-related fragments (tRFs) are important
regulators of global gene expression and have been shown to play key roles in normal development. Recent
evidence suggests small RNAs (especially tRFs) can be regulated via modifications, however global analysis
of small RNA modifications in cancers is still lacking due to lack of tools. In this proposal I will test whether
dysregulation of small RNA modifications play a role in cancer biology. I will focus on glioma/glioblastoma
(GBM), vicious cancer types that are barely treatable.
Research: The candidate's preliminary results indicate that tRFs are novel regulators of gene expression and
cell phenotypes in gliomas and their activity could be regulated by small RNA modification status. The
candidate already detected such small RNA modifications in GBM and GSC (glioma stem-like cells) cell lines
and also GBM patients. This proposal aims to understand the biological functions of these newly identified
small RNA modifications and tRFs in gliomas. If completed, this will bring novel insights to the field and be a
perfect niche to launch an independent lab. Three aims are proposed, each based on preliminary data, and
taking into the independent phase. Aim 1 will determine the glioma-relevant small RNA modification factors.
Aim 2 will define the functional roles and targetome of glioma-prognostic tRFs. Aim 3 will elucidate novel RBP-
based mechanisms of small RNA modification regulating tRF targetome and pathways in gliomas. GSC
cultures and mouse xenografts, genomics and bioinformatics will be employed to tackle these questions. The
proposed research plan will reveal a novel gene regulatory mechanism by small RNA modifications and
identify potential therapeutic targets for glioma treatment.
Candidate: The candidate's long-term goal is to utilize her background in biochemistry, small RNA and
molecular biology to understand new gene regulatory mechanism in cancer biology. She already processes a
lot of the skills needed to conduct proposed experiments, however she is in great need to obtain additional
training in glioma biology in order to further test her hypothesis (with co-mentor who is an expert in GBM field).
The K99 mentored phase will allow her to build on her current data, expand on several new areas, and learn
new techniques to launch her own lab. A mentoring committee of 6 is proposed to ensure the candidate get
guidance to help her achieve independence.
Environment: The proposed project will be conducted at University of Virginia, which has an outstanding
environment for the proposed training and research."
10837920,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Persistence of HIV-1 in tissue reservoirs of therapy-suppressed, aviremic individuals is a major challenge
to HIV-1 cure. The viral reservoir consists of myeloid and lymphoid cells that harbor the virus through long periods
of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Until recently, it was thought that HIV-1 provirus remains in a
transcriptionally-silent, latent state in these reservoir cells and only resumes viral transcription and virion
production upon activation from endogenous or exogenous stimuli. However, it is now evident that in a subset
of reservoir cells, the virus remains transcriptionally-active even under cART and continues to generate some
levels of viral RNAs and/or proteins. Even in absence of complete viral replication, persistent viral RNA and
protein production in these “active” reservoirs pose significant adverse immunologic and virologic consequences.
They can contribute to the chronic immune activation as well as impact viral rebound upon treatment interruption.
Along with the transcriptionally-silent, latently-infected cells, elimination of these viral transcriptionally-active
reservoirs would be necessary to achieve a cure for HIV-1.
 Most of our current knowledge of active HIV-1 reservoirs is limited to studies of CD4+ T-cells in the
peripheral blood. The nature of active reservoirs in myeloid cells within tissue compartments have remained
largely uncharacterized. In our preliminary studies, we have shown that alveolar macrophages (AMs), which are
the predominant HIV-1-infected cell-type in the lung, continue to transcribe viral RNAs under long-term cART.
We have also shown that, unlike CD4+ T-cells, the levels of viral RNA-positive AMs do not decrease even after
years-long therapy. In this study, we propose to comprehensively characterize these active AM reservoirs in
therapy-suppressed individuals by addressing three specific questions: (1) how the proviral landscapes and
profiles of viral RNA transcripts in AMs compare between cART-naïve and treated individuals, (2) how does the
ongoing viral transcription affect immunological functions and survival of the active macrophage reservoirs and
(3) do active reservoir macrophages impact viral rebound and replication in the neighboring reactivation-capable
AMs and CD4+ T-cells. We will utilize state-of-the-art molecular, cellular and immunological methods and a well-
characterized human subject cohort to examine the specific aims. The study will provide fundamental scientific
knowledge about a new layer of complexity in HIV-1 persistence and reveal the biological significance of active
AM reservoirs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of continued viral transcription in active AMs and its
adverse cellular effects will help in devising tailored strategies for eliminating these myeloid reservoir cells."
10842747,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The increasing appreciation of RNA’s structure-function relationships has led to a demand for new
technologies that enable targeting of specific RNA structures. However, discovery of molecules that are capable
of binding RNA structures with high affinity and selectivity has proven challenging using current approaches,
resulting in a technological gap that precludes the development of new research tools to study RNA function and
therapeutics to treat RNA-mediated diseases. Thus, development of new technologies that enable structure-
specific targeting of RNA remains an important challenge in many fields.
 The central vision of my research program is to address the deficit of structure-specific RNA-binding reagents
using a radically different type of nucleic acid affinity reagent: L-aptamers. L-Aptamers are unique because they
are comprised of L-(deoxy)ribose-based nucleic acids (L-DNA and L-RNA), which are mirror images
(enantiomers) of natural D-nucleotides. Because oligonucleotides of opposite stereochemistry (D versus L) are
incapable of forming contiguous Watson-Crick base pairs with each other, we are able to evolve L-aptamers that
adaptively bind structured D-RNA targets through tertiary interactions (shape) rather than primary sequence.
This unique “cross-chiral” mode of recognition occurs with high affinity and selectivity, and these interactions can
modulate the function of RNA targets through several modes of action. These properties, coupled with the
intrinsic nuclease resistance of L-oligonucleotides, provide L-aptamer technology a broad range of opportunities
in biomedical research and disease intervention.
 During the next five years, my research group aims to further develop L-aptamer technology to realize its
promise as a practical research and therapeutic tool. We aim to improve the RNA-binding properties of L-
aptamers using new in vitro selection strategies and to improve our understanding of cross-chiral recognition by
providing the first three-dimensional structure of an L-aptamer-RNA heterochiral complex. Building on our prior
work, we will continue to develop L-aptamers as inhibitors of oncogenic microRNAs, representing a promising
therapeutic strategy for related cancers. However, we will also pursue several novel applications of L-aptamer
technology, including RNA-targeted small molecule drug discovery and intracellular RNA imaging, thereby
substantially broadening the impact of this work. Finally, we aim to comprehensively characterize the behavior
of L-oligonucleotides in living cells — how they interact with these environments and the potential consequences
— the results of which will have a broad impact on the development of all future L-oligonucleotide-based
biotechnologies, including L-aptamers."
10842748,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin and a vibrant signaling hub for our genomes. Combinatorial
patterns of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chemical modifications to DNA establish local
epigenetic landscapes that regulate genomic processes, including gene expression, replication, and DNA
damage repair. As genomic processes are critical to the maintenance of cellular identity and genomic integrity,
they are frequently misregulated in diverse diseases like cancer and developmental disorders. Despite clear
relevance to fundamental molecular biology and human health, the molecular mechanisms through which
histone PTMs are curated by nuclear enzymes that write and erase the PTMs in a nucleosome context are still
largely unknown. Moreover, outside of a small number of test cases, it is unclear how combinations of histone
PTMs recruit readers of histone PTMs to specific genomic loci. These knowledge gaps limit the development of
therapeutics targeting chromatin signaling for cancer or other diseases. We address these fundamental
questions using designer nucleosomes with chemically defined sets of histone PTMs which allow us to explore
how epigenetic signatures tune chromatin interactions proteome wide. In addition, to answering long-standing
questions about chromatin signaling, these nucleosome interactome screens uncover new biologic processes
that lead our research program in unexpected directions. In parallel, we solve near atomic resolution structures
of writers, readers, and erasers of histone PTMs bound to nucleosomes. These studies provide molecular
snapshots of the regulators of genomic processes in action in a physiologic chromatin context. Our structures
enable mechanistic hypothesis testing in cellular models with precision structure-guided mutations. Currently,
we are exploring how large multi-subunit complexes coordinate multiple enzymatic activities to regulate gene
expression by pairing structural biology with biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, and genomics. Finally, we
are determining how the Anaphase Promoting Complex, a megadalton ubiquitin ligase that is a master regulator
of the cell cycle, functions on chromatin to control gene expression and histone homeostasis. Overall, we expect
to define universal patterns of chromatin recruitment through epigenetic landscapes and elucidate molecular
mechanisms through which chromatin proteins function to regulate gene expression and other genomic
processes. These studies will enable hypothesis-driven functional studies in disease model systems and uncover
new avenues for drug discovery."
10842795,"Summary
 In vertebrates, genes directing cell-type specific programs and embryonic development are frequently
controlled by cis-acting enhancers located several hundreds of kilobases away from their target promoters.
Disruptions or misregulation of long-distance enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions have been implicated in a
growing number of human pathologies, including developmental abnormalities and cancers. Accordingly, the
mechanisms that regulate EP interaction specificity and quantitative efficiency have a central role in establishing
gene expression patterns: they constitute a new yet largely unexplored level of regulation of genome activities.
 The folding of the genome in different 3D structures has been proposed to help organize these distant
regulatory relationships. Notably, the structural partition of vertebrate genomes in distinct 3D domains (TADs)
has been shown to play an important role in defining the effective range of enhancer action. However, within
TADs, enhancers distribute their activity in complex patterns that are not explained by the current models.
Furthermore, because of the lack of proper tools to accurately assess the function of genomic architectural
elements, we barely know anything about the genetic sequences that determine their activity. Thus, despite
significant progress, the specific elements and features that organize and regulate within TADs the functional
interactions that link distant regulatory elements to target genes remain mostly unknown. Consequently, we are
too often unable to predict the consequences of non-coding and structural variants present in human genomes.
 To address these critical gaps, we will develop a set of complementary research initiatives combining state-
of-art large-scale genome engineering in human cells and mouse models, innovative genomic screens and
quantitative genomics and transcriptomics analyses to 1) identify the genetic instructions (e.g. insulators,
tethering systems, relay elements) and processes (e.g. looping, non-coding transcription) that fold a linear
genomic locus into a dynamic 3D regulatory ensemble and determine the specificity and efficiency of long-
distance EP interactions 2) determine the regulatory grammar governing the activity of these different
architectural elements 3) measure quantitatively how genetic variants found in these elements may influence
their activity and contribute to phenotypic traits 4) integrate these different data to predict the impact of structural
variants better and in the future design synthetic approaches to regulate EP interactions. Altogether, these
complementary approaches will shed much-needed light on this additional yet poorly characterized layer of
regulation of gene expression and provide unique insights to understand better how non-coding genomic variants
may influence gene expression and lead to human pathologies."

Health disparities in AI/AN communities exist throughout the lifespan and include morbidity and deaths from
cardiovascular disease, smoking related illnesses, obesity, diabetes, infection, chronic liver disease/cirrhosis,
substance abuse, and trauma, among others. AI/AN people die at a younger age with 25% of AI/AN deaths
occurring before age 45, compared with 15% of African Americans and 7% of Whites. Eliminating health
disparities, requires the identification, recruitment, education, and training of the most talented scientists in the
U.S. Our holistic and comprehensive Native American Summer Research Internship program in
Cardiovascular, Pulmonary, and Hematology diseases (NARI-NHLBI) was developed, based on principles of
community engagement, to support AI/AN students (who are underrepresented and underserved in both higher
education and healthcare) with an ultimate goal of increasing AI/AN representation and leadership in
science/medicine and thus narrow the gap of significant AI/AN health disparities. During the last renewal, we
expanded to include the NARI-MD/PhD Program. NARI-NHLBI and MD/PhD undergraduate participants
receive research, cultural, and professional mentorship and training with committed community members and
renowned scientists. With the help of this NARI-NHLBI initiative, the NARI-MD/PhD is now a sustainable
partner within the NARI program. To date, 65 NARI-NHLBI participants represent 35 tribal nations, 35
colleges/universities, and 20 home states and 10 NARI-MD/PhD participants represent 5 tribal nations, 9
colleges/universities, and 6 home states. Of the 65 NARI-NHLBI Program participants, 56 (86%) have
completed a bachelor’s degree and the remaining 9 (14%) are current undergraduate students. Of the 10
NARI-MD/PhD Program participants, 7 (70%) have completed a BS degree and the remaining 3 (30%) are
current undergraduate students. No one has dropped out of college. To date, 17 (26%) NARI-NHLBI
participants and 6 (60%) NARI-MD/PhD participants have worked in biomedical science fields as research
assistants. Upon obtaining their undergraduate degree, 28 (50%) of the 56 NARI-NHLBI graduates and 2
(29%) of the 7 NARI-MD/PhD graduates are continuing their education in the health/science fields: 16 NARI-
NHLBI and 1 NARI-MD/PhD participants were accepted into a graduate program; 12 NARI-NHLBI and 1 NARI-
MD/PhD participants were accepted into medical school. Our current NARI participants continue to report that
cardiovascular disease, obesity, and smoking related illness were the top health concerns of their families.
Thus, we hope to continue the current NARI-NHLBI research experiences for NARI trainees in the field of
cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematology research. It is with this proposal, that we hope to continue our
successful summer research support for twelve AI/AN participants interested in NARI-NHLBI research and
expand our professional development opportunities to better engage NARI-NHLBI participants in basic
laboratory and clinical skills."

 Aneuploidy (gain or loss of a chromosome) and partial aneuploidy (gain or loss of a chromosome arm)
have long been observed in cancer cells and are the cause of several congenital diseases. Interestingly,
advances in next-generation sequencing have more recently demonstrated the presence of aneuploidy in healthy
cells. The goal of this research proposal is to uncover the downstream effects of individual aneuploidies.
 We developed new computational algorithms to identify aneuploidy events from genomic and
transcriptomic data. Our methods allow for identification of small populations of aneuploid cells from bulk
sequencing data. In addition, single-cell sequencing of healthy tissues will allow for identification of even rarer
aneuploidy events. By leveraging existing comprehensive efforts to characterize single cells from across the
human body, we will build an atlas of aneuploidy events occurring in healthy tissue.
 To directly test the effects of aneuploidy alterations in human cells, I developed a genome engineering
approach for targeted deletion of chromosome arms in vitro. We previously used this approach to generate
isogenic cell line pairs with and without chr3p deletion and found that chr3p deletion leads to cell cycle arrest.
Some of our cell lines adapted to chr3p deletion by duplicating their wildtype copy of chr3, transitioning to a state
of chr3q gain. Cells with chr3q gain showed differential dependency on genes involved in DNA replication. Here,
we will use these cells to identify the mechanisms of these cell cycle phenotypes, as well as determine which
chr3 genes contribute to these phenotypes. In addition, we will create a library of cell lines for each chromosome
arm deletion. These cell lines will be critical to compare and contrast the downstream effects of different
aneuploidy events in human cells. With this work, we will firmly establish a research program dedicated to
understanding the consequences of specific aneuploidies in human cells."

10829378,"Summary
 Blocks to regeneration of hair cells by an unknown mechanism exist in the adult mammal, but we have
recently shown that cochlear hair cells have a capacity for spontaneous regeneration in the first few postnatal
days. We have recently discovered that Wnt signaling stimulates generation of hair cells from progenitor cells
in the newborn cochlea, and we hypothesize that downstream targets of the Wnt pathway become less
accessible with age of the cochlea. Our preliminary data show that histone deacetylase inhibitors, which
preserve acetyl groups on histones, increase the proliferation of newborn cochlear supporting cells and
promote hair cell differentiation in the newborn and to a lesser extent the adult inner ear. We seek to learn both
the nature of chromatin changes and the potential to reverse them with epigenetic drugs and CRISPR dCas9
mediated epigenetic modifications.
 Although our recent work has provided an important proof-of-principle for hair cell replacement in the adult,
regeneration was limited. Here, we assess the response to inhibition of epigenetic modifiers of both the
newborn and adult cochlea with a focus on the control of expression of transcription factor Atoh1 and its
downstream targets. We assess the effects of 3 epigenetic modifiers that we propose to be key to enhancer-
based activation of genes required for HC differentiation. In Aim 1, we assess the effects of these modifiers,
Tcf4, Setd7 and Lsd1, on epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility in cochlear organoids and we ask
whether manipulation of their level of expression can reverse chromatin inaccessibility and increase
differentiation of hair cells. In Aim 2 we assess chromatin modification mediated by Lsd1 and HDAC inhibition
for effects on Atoh1 activation and differentiation of hair cells. In Aim 3, we test our hypothesis that
manipulation of epigenetic changes through these modifiers of chromatin will increase hair cell differentiation in
the damaged cochlea. We test the epigenetic modifiers and inhibitors for their effect on hair cell regeneration in
a noise damage model of mouse deafness. Through these experiments, we ask a crucial series of questions
on epigenetic mechanisms in hair cell regeneration and recovery of function."

The Human Biological Sampling and Immunocytometry core will provide essential clinical and immunological
support for both projects in this proposal. The core encompasses personnel with appropriate technical
expertise to accomplish the proposed studies, and the resources/facilities with which to do so. Vital to the
entire program project is obtaining human samples for experimentation, which is the first of three functions of
the core. This is particularly critical with regard to subjects who fit the criteria for severe asthma since these
individuals account for only 5-10% of all asthmatic subjects while exhibiting the most debilitating forms of the
condition. The Cellular Processing component is aimed at all of the procedures related to initial processing,
proper storage, and efficient, timely delivery of materials to appropriate laboratories for further experimentation.
The core is designed with careful integration of the aims for Projects 1 (A. Ray) and 2 (S. Wenzel) and Core C
(W. Chen) in order to ensure that proposed critical studies efficiently utilize available biological material.
Finally, the third aspect of the core, the Immunocytometry component consolidates into one unit all of the
conventional flow cytometry techniques (high dimensional fluorescence flow cytometry and cell sorting) and
analytical tools required for the performance of the proposed projects. Specialized professionals are included
to carry out all of the diverse yet interrelated functions of the core."

Movement is a fundamental component of behavior that is established and refined throughout development into
adulthood. Over the course of a lifetime, our capacity to move is susceptible to neurological disorders and injuries
that can pose significant and sometimes fatal risks to human health. This proposal aims to elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanisms governing the establishment, maintenance, and adaptation of locomotor
behaviors and their disruptions in disease. Utilizing advanced techniques, including genetics, imaging, neuronal
tracing, and circuit manipulations, I will investigate motor regulation in awake, behaving animals. My predoctoral
and postdoctoral research training will provide a solid foundation for me to become an independent investigator
equipped with the knowledge and expertise to uncover essential principles governing motor regulation in health
and disease. My predoctoral research focuses on developmental pathways that guide the formation of neural
circuits capable of producing rhythmic locomotion. I have chosen the model organism C. elegans for my
predoctoral research due to its strengths, including a well-defined time course of development, a collection of
powerful genetic tools, a fully resolved connectome, and an array of naturalistic behaviors available for study.
Research in Aim 1 (F99 phase) will elucidate the development and regulation of rhythmic locomotion in C.
elegans. I hypothesize that individual Wnt pathways have specific roles in programming neural circuits for
locomotion and gait transitions in juvenile and adult animals. My predoctoral studies will introduce technical and
intellectual innovations to the investigation of locomotor regulation, providing critical insights into the genetic
programs necessary for the establishment and maturation of rhythmic locomotion at various developmental
stages. In Aim 2 (K00 phase), I will identify a postdoctoral program focusing on mammalian neural circuits for
motor control. Research training in the K00 phase will allow me to gain expertise in mouse models of motor
regulation and dysfunction. I will work with my supervisory committee and sponsor to identify postdoctoral labs
with a supportive environment for my progression into independent research. Upon completion of these Aims, I
will have acquired the skills and knowledge to transition into an independent scientist role, where I will conduct
foundational research in motor circuit development and regulation, uncovering motor disorder processes and
potential therapies."

 Project Summary
 Diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have significantly high rates of limb amputation and mortality.
CLI is featured by extremely low blood perfusion and degenerated skeletal muscle. Accordingly, regeneration of
vasculature and skeletal muscles will salvage the limbs. Yet the poor endothelial and skeletal muscle cell survival,
and inferior cell functions under the hyperglycemia and ischemic conditions of diabetic CLI impair the limb repair.
Currently, there is no effective treatment available although growth factor therapy represents a promising strategy.
However, growth factor therapy has relatively low therapeutic efficacy in regenerating both vasculature and skeletal
muscles, as multiple growth factors are simultaneously needed for vascularization and myogenesis, and these cannot
be readily delivered by current approaches.
 In this project, we propose to use a novel TRIM72 protein with both pro-angiogenic and pro-myogenic properties
to regenerate vasculature and skeletal muscles in diabetic CLI. The TRIM72 will be engineered to have longer
retention time (slower diffusion rate) in ischemic tissue, thus exhibiting longer therapeutic effect. To deliver the
engineered TRIM72 (ETRIM72), it will be encapsulated into ischemic limb-targeting nanoparticles, followed by
delivering via clinically attractive IV injection. The nanoparticles will then predominantly accumulate in the ischemic
limbs and gradually release ETRIM72. The released protein will promote vascularization and myogenesis by (1)
improving the survival of endothelial cell and skeletal muscle cell through cell membrane repair, and activation of cell
survival kinase; and (2) stimulating endothelial cell and skeletal muscle cell migration and morphogenesis under the
hyperglycemia and ischemic conditions of diabetic CLI.
 In our preliminary studies, we have developed ETRIM72 by genetically fusing TRIM72 with peptide CSTSMLKAC
that targets ischemic environment of ischemic limbs. This first version of ETRIM72 was able to retain in the ischemic
limbs significantly longer than TRIM72. After IV injection of ischemic limb-targeting, ETRIM72-releasing nanoparticles,
the released ETRIM72 significantly promoted regeneration of both vasculature and skeletal muscles in diabetic
ischemic limbs. The function of TRIM72 in promoting vascularization and myogenesis under hyperglycemia and
ischemic conditions has not been reported before.
 Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that controlled release of ETRIM72 will simultaneously increase
endothelial and skeletal muscle cell survival, migration and morphogenesis under hyperglycemia and ischemic
conditions, leading to accelerated regeneration of both vasculature and skeletal muscles in diabetic ischemic limbs.
 Aim #1 will test the hypothesis that optimal ETRIM72 release profiles will significantly promote survival, migration
and morphogenesis of endothelial cells and myoblasts under high glucose and ischemic conditions. Aim #2 will test
efficacy of the ETRIM72-releasing nanoparticles using diabetic murine limb ischemia model.
 This project is innovative because it engineers a novel proangiogenic and promyogenic protein to
simultaneously regenerate vasculature and skeletal muscles in diabetic ischemic limbs. The longer tissue retention
time of the engineered protein, together with localized and controlled release are expected to significantly improve
therapeutic efficacy.

10834169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enhancing remyelination is a critical strategy for restoring brain function after demyelination in multiple
sclerosis (MS) patients; however, despite concerted efforts, the ability to stimulate remyelination in MS brain
has remained elusive. While signaling pathways that promote oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation have
been identified, the experimental milieux under investigation do not replicate the mechanisms limiting
remyelination following MS-specific inflammatory CNS injuries. The current proposal builds on our new models
of demyelination/remyelination using pathogenic recombinant antibodies (rAbs) generated from MS patients.
Myelin-specific MS rAbs direct complement-mediated demyelination in vivo and ex vivo, all of which
spontaneously repair in association with microglial activation. However, demyelinated explants that are
continuously exposed to myelin-specific MS rAb fail to activate microglia, and oligodendrocyte maturation is
inhibited. Similarly, targeted depletion of microglia following rAb-mediated demyelination blocks
oligodendrocyte maturation preventing active remyelination. Using single cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) on
microglia isolated from remyelinating explants, we identified transcriptionally distinct microglial subsets that are
associated with successful or failed remyelination. Hence, we hypothesize that microglial signals are critical
for oligodendrocyte responses during the transition from early myelinating to actively myelinating
oligodendrocyte, and myelin-specific MS autoantibody modulates these signals to arrest remyelination. To test
our hypothesis, we propose three complementary specific aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate microglial and
oligodendrocyte responses in in vivo models of MS rAb-mediated demyelination and compare those responses
to those seen in toxin-mediated demyelination. Intrathalamic or corpus callosum injection of myelin-specific MS
rAb plus HC will be performed in conjunction with pharmacologic microglial depletion and chronic
administration of MS rAb to validate the impact of microglial responses on remyelination in the intact nervous
system. Comparable studies will be done following lysolecithin-induced demyelination, which has a very
different time course of microglial activation and remyelination. In Aim 2, we will study the dynamics of
demyelination, microglial responses and oligodendrocyte regeneration in situ using intravital imaging following
cortical demyelination. This real-time analysis of myelin loss, microglial activation and remyelination will be
compared to that seen following cuprizone-mediated demyelination. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the
mechanisms by which microglia impact remyelination using ex vivo cerebellar slices demyelinated with myelin-
specific rAb plus human complement (HC). We will focus on investigating the role of several microglial genes
identified by scRNASeq that are expected to promote or impair remyelination. Normal appearing white matter
and MS lesion tissue with varying degrees of demyelination and remyelination will be evaluated to determine
the abundance and localization of functionally-important microglial subsets. The results of these studies will
provide insights into novel mechanisms controlling remyelination after inflammatory injury. In addition, the
knowledge gained may identify novel therapeutic approaches that will result in clinically-meaningful myelin
repair."

 The fundamental gap existing in understanding the origins of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) is centrally responsible for the lack of any disease-modifying therapies for this highly prevalent and
lethal disease. Developing and testing such therapies will require defining the biologic process occurring in the
human lung that induce small airway abnormality (SAA), the earliest COPD pathology, and which cause
transition from potentially reversible SAA to irreversible emphysema or airway remodeling. Our long term goal
is to arrest COPD progression by understanding its earliest stages. Our Central Hypotheses are: SAA
(detectable by chest imaging) identifies susceptible younger smokers at heightened risk of anatomic disease
progression. SAA results, in part, from distinctive types of auto-aggressive host immune reactions (detectable
by measuring epithelial gene signatures and immune cell function) and from altered airway surface liquid
(detectable by analyzing airway mucin). These processes collectively lead to SAA detectable by a novel high-
resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) metric (PRMfSAD) we have developed. The knowledge gained
in this project will allow us to identify individuals with disease progression noninvasively, while also defining
pathophysiological mechanism(s) that can be therapeutically targeted. In this project we will leverage the
infrastructure of SPIROMICS, an NHLBI funded COPD program, to recruit a new cohort of individuals aged 35-
50 years, a group which are not represented in the current cohort. Subjects will be analyzed at clinical visits at
enrollment and after three years of follow-up. At each visit, they will undergo clinical data collection, post-
bronchodilator spirometry, HRCT, induced sputum, and exhaled breath condensate. One hundred subjects will
also undergo a single research bronchoscopy. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between HRCT-
defined SAA and disease progression in early COPD. Specifically we will define the relationship between
baseline PRMfSAD and development of radiographic disease progression to PRM defined emphysema over
three years. In Aim 2 we will explore the biological basis of SAA in early COPD by analysis of lung-derived
biomarkers. To achieve this we will collect biospecimens by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and from
segmental & distal airways. We will correlate baseline PRMfSAD with an IL-17 gene signatures in airway
epithelium. Secondary analyses will explore correlations of baseline PRMfSAD with the activation states and
functional capacity of BAL leukocytes, as well as with total airway mucin concentration. In Aim 3 we will
determine whether sputum can serve as a non-invasive biomarker of early COPD. Specifically we will: a)
correlate baseline sputum total mucin concentration with baseline SAA; and, (b) correlate baseline sputum total
mucin concentration and its change over 3 years with progression of HRCT abnormalities. This approach
enables us to link HRCT and pathologic abnormality to define potentially targetable mechanisms laying the
foundation for developing disease-modifying therapies."
10834962,"Project Summary Abstract:
Our perceptions, behaviors, emotions, memories and intelligence depend on the appropriate synthesis and
release of specific neurotransmitters in the brain. Transmitter identity is initially established by genetic
programs. It has been thought that transmitters are fixed and invariant throughout life and that the plasticity of
the nervous system consists largely of changes in the strength and number of synapses. We have found that
experimental perturbations of spontaneous electrical activity and natural changes in sustained sensory stimuli
such as ambient light or odors respecify transmitter identity in the spinal cord and brain in the developing
nervous system, leading to matching changes in postsynaptic transmitter receptor specification and changes in
animal behavior. Strikingly we found that transmitter switching and receptor matching also occur in the adult
mammalian brain in response to sustained sensory stimuli and can regulate behavior. These discoveries
contrast sharply with the general view of transmitter constancy and identify another way that the nervous
system adapts to the environment.
Here we describe experiments to determine how many transmitter switches are induced by a single
environmental stimulus and how many brain regions are affected. There is increasing understanding that the
brain is a widely linked network and that single perturbations alter activity throughout the brain. It is important
to address this issue in order to understand better the basis of changes in behavior in response to the
sustained stimuli that are major determinants of our conduct. A major part of our behavioral and cognitive
repertoire is habitual and results from sustained experience. We will also analyze the mechanisms that
promote and modulate transmitter switching. Although it is clear that neurotransmitter switching is activity-
dependent, the features of activity that are necessary to achieve switching remain unknown. In the future this
knowledge may have clinical utility for driving or preventing transmitter switching in patients.
The immediate goals of this research are to test specific hypotheses about the effect of activity in generating a
novel form of plasticity that involves changes in transmitter identity in the adult mammalian brain. The long-
term goals are to understand the role of neurotransmitter switching in regulating behaviors."
10835096,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The US maternal mortality ratio (26.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths) is the highest among developed
nations, with wide variation across states and racial/ethnic groups. The state of Georgia has the second
highest maternal mortality (66.3 per 100,000), with a 60% higher rate for black vs white women (95.6 vs 59.7
per 100,000). Nearly 100 times more common than maternal mortality, however, is severe maternal morbidity
(SMM). Maternal mortality and SMM are highest among women who are black, publicly insured or uninsured,
and deliver in safety-net hospitals. In Georgia, nearly two-thirds of maternal deaths and SMM are deemed
preventable, with chronic health conditions, obesity, delays in accessing and fragmentation of care as key
contributors. Current data indicate that postpartum SMM is increasing at a faster rate than SMM during the
delivery hospitalization. Proposed solutions to the maternal health crisis in Georgia include improved prenatal
and postpartum follow-up and case management, control of chronic health conditions, and extension of
Medicaid coverage. However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding whether such strategies can improve
maternal health or reduce racial disparities in SMM or mortality. The proposed study will begin to fill this void
with a multidisciplinary, mixed-methods approach. We will first analyze Georgia linked vital records, hospital
discharge, and claims data to provide an overview of the extent, location and determinants of differences in
SMM among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white women at delivery and 3 to 12 months postpartum.
Using regression-based decomposition methods we will highlight the portions of the racial/ethnic differences
explained by observable and unobservable factors. We will use these findings and in-depth interviews with
postpartum women and their health care providers and case managers to contextualize the analysis of two
postpartum interventions targeting women at risk for adverse outcomes – an existing Medicaid policy and a
newly designed health system intervention. The Georgia Medicaid Planning for Healthy Babies (P4HB)
Medicaid program provides postpartum women with a very low birth weight delivery primary care inclusive of
nurse case management and Resource Mother outreach to link women to social supports. This study will be
the first to evaluate the effects of this Medicaid policy on SMM disparities. These analyses will then be used to
inform the design of the new postpartum care system for women who deliver at a safety-net hospital in Atlanta,
Georgia, and are at increased risk for SMM. Women (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to either this
enhanced postpartum care system vs. standard care, with assessment of outcomes within 12 weeks and 12
months postpartum, including attendance of postpartum care visits, receipt of recommended care, and adverse
outcomes such as hospital readmissions. The insights gained from the proposed work will fill critical knowledge
gaps regarding policy and practice approaches for reducing maternal health disparities and can serve as a
foundation for future prevention and intervention strategies within the state and nationally."
10835098,"The interactions between lysosomes and lipid droplets represent the processes of mobilization of lipids
and energy required for cell metabolism and lipid homeostasis. Lipophagy, for lipid degradation, is a
known type of lysosome-lipid droplet interaction. Our preliminary studies and results from others suggest
there is a second type of lysosome-lipid droplet interaction, which mediates lipid transport from
lysosomes to lipid droplets for lipid synthesis and storage. This process is probably mediated by the
organelle membrane contact sites (MCS), which are recently defined as tethered organelles, organized
by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. MCS provide vectorial transport of lipids between
heterologous organelles and are increasingly appreciated for their role in lipid homeostasis. Our group
will study lysosome-lipid droplet interactions with a focus of lysosome-lipid droplet MCS in the context of
fatty acid metabolism. Regulation of free fatty acids within the cell is critical for normal cell functions, as
excess cytosolic free fatty acids cause toxic effects to cells and tissues (named lipotoxicity) and thus
have been recognized as a causative factor in many metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). One source of cytosolic free fatty acids is the lysosome, which releases free fatty
acids after digesting endocytosed extracellular lipids and autophagic intracellular membranes and lipids.
Increasing the transport and storage of free fatty acids into lipid droplets protects cells, including liver
cells, from lipotoxicity. Therefore, lysosome-lipid droplet MCS may play an important role in prevention of
lysosomal free fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity. However, it is not clear whether MCS exist between
lysosomes and lipid droplets and whether lysosome-lipid droplet MCS transport free fatty acids.
Moreover, it is not known whether lysosome-lipid droplet MCS play a role in preventing lysosome-
triggered lipotoxicity and regulating fatty acid metabolism. Our recent studies support the existence of
lysosome-lipid droplet MCS in human liver cells, and we identified the protein-protein interactions at
lysosome-lipid droplet MCS through a genetic screening in yeast. In the next five years, we will define the
principal components and function of lysosome-lipid droplet MCS, and test if promoting MCS formation
will prevent or reduce lipotoxicity and thus NAFLD progression in a mouse model. By investigating the
features, mechanisms, and physiological functions of lysosome-lipid droplet MCS, our work will reveal a
previously undefined interaction between lysosomes and lipid droplets and uncover a novel mechanism
of free fatty acid transport. This mechanism will deepen the understandings to fatty acid metabolism,
lipotoxicity, and the pathology of NAFLD."
10835459,"Project Summary: Mitotic cells assemble two key cellular structures to segregate the chromosomes equally
between the two daughter cells - the mitotic spindle and the kinetochores. Kinetochores are multi-protein
complexes that form at the centromeres of the chromosomes during mitosis and serve as attachment sites for
microtubules [MT(s)] of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) interface generates force that
drives chromosome alignment and segregation. The current focus of the Varma lab is on understanding the
molecular mechanisms involved in kMT attachments and their contribution to accurate chromosome segregation.
During early mitotic prometaphase, kinetochores initially attach to the MT lattice laterally. These lateral
attachments are subsequently converted into end-on attachments when sister kinetochores become stably
attached to the plus-ends of spindle MTs in metaphase. Studies have shown that the initial capture and lateral
sliding of kinetochores on MTs is driven by dynein, a minus-end-directed motor. The end-on kinetochore-
microtubule (kMT) attachment formation and its stabilization is mediated by the MT-binding kinetochore complex,
Ndc80. Our 1st major goal is to determine how the kinetochore complexes required for these two alternate
modes of MT attachment coordinate to produce dynamic kMT attachments required for proper
chromosome alignment. Our recent work has provided evidence for an antagonistic relationship between
dynein and the Ndc80 complexes in humans during mitosis. Our unpublished results suggest that dynein and
the Ndc80 complex synergize for efficient chromosome capture and for stabilizing kMT attachments during
metaphase, but the mechanism for this coordination is unclear.
 The centromere-distal region of the Ndc80 complex at the N-terminal domain of the Hec1 subunit has
been identified as the MT-binding site required to stabilize kMT attachments. Phosphorylation of this region by
Aurora B kinase negatively regulates the strength of kMT attachments. Our work has discovered that in addition
to the N-terminal domain, the more internal loop domain has a major role in attachment. The attachment
requires the loop domain-mediated kinetochore recruitment of the replication licensing protein Cdt1, which we
find is a novel MT-binding protein at kinetochores. Our work also demonstrates that the binding of Cdt1 to MTs
is negatively regulated by Aurora B. Our unpublished studies demonstrate that Cdt1 synergizes with another
MT-associated protein (MAP) at kinetochores, the Ska complex that has been shown to promote efficient binding
of the Ndc80 complex to kMTs. Our 2nd major goal is to determine how different kinetochore MAPs mediate
robust interaction between the Ndc80 complex and MTs for the stabilization of kMT attachments during
metaphase to drive accurate chromosome segregation. In the long term, our lab aims to identify novel
mechanisms controlling kMT attachments and the pathways that regulate this process, while also establishing
novel model systems and approaches to study these processes."
10836385,"Project Summary
Gram-positive bacteria process and release small peptides, or “pheromones”, that act as critical signals for the
induction of adaptive traits including those involved in virulence. One class of small signaling pheromones is
the cyclic auto-inducing peptide (AIP), which regulates the expression of genes that orchestrate virulence and
persistence in Staphylococci, Listeria, Clostridia, and Enterococci. Defects in cyclic AIP production and
signaling can compromise virulence traits of these microbes, underscoring the relevance of peptide-based
signaling to health and disease. Staphylococcus aureus harbors a cyclic peptide signaling system known as
the accessory gene regulatory (Agr) system. This “quorum sensing” system depends on the synthesis,
processing, and export of a cyclic AIP, derived from its precursor protein, AgrD, for function. AIP signaling
through Agr leads to the production of S. aureus virulence factors, whereas disruption of signaling causes
significant attenuation in skin and lung infection models. Despite clear connections between Agr and S. aureus
pathobiology, there exist major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanics of AIP biosynthesis. Most notably: (i)
the proteins needed for peptide processing of AIP have not been elucidated; (ii) a transporter for AIP or its
leader peptide has not been identified; (iii) differential processing of AIP variants has not been investigated;
and (iv) conservation in cyclic peptide processing events between bacterial species is not known. In this grant,
we provide data related to our discovery of a putative peptidase in S. aureus, MroQ, that we hypothesize acts
directly or indirectly on Agr system components to promote the final steps in the processing and/or export of
AIP. The overall goals of this grant are to interrogate the previously unknown mechanics of cyclic peptide
maturation in S. aureus and provide insight into the potential conservation of function in Gram positive
pathogens. Aim 1 will define how MroQ promotes AIP processing, export, or both. Aim 2 will interrogate the
extent with which MroQ interacts with Agr system or other membrane components and will use biochemistry to
test if MroQ directly cleaves AgrD. Aim 3 will determine the extent with which MroQ promotes activity of Agr
variants both within species and among other species and identify the AgrD sequence characteristics that
dictate MroQ specificity."
10836386,"Background: Chronic pain and negative consequences of long-term opioid therapy are related public health
concerns associated with significant functional impairment, high psychiatric comorbidity, and premature
mortality, particularly among Veterans. Clinical Practice Guidelines for opioid prescribing and pain
management recommend using non-pharmacological approaches as first-line treatments. Psychosocial
interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) have strong evidence supporting their ability to improve pain
outcomes. Patient beliefs about the stigma associated with psychological interventions, opioid analgesics,
ability of psychosocial intervention to improve pain among others can greatly interfere with the patients’ ability
to initiate and maintain engagement in psychosocial interventions and other non-pharmacological approaches.
Significance/Impact: Without a concerted effort at affecting beliefs that impede engagement in treatment,
Veterans who may benefit from the treatment, will not receive it. This can result in continued risk for negative
consequences associated with long-term opioid therapy and inadequate pain management. Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Treatment Seeking (CBT-TS) is an evidence-based intervention that directly intervenes
on beliefs that act as barriers to treatment initiation and retention. By intervening on these beliefs, this study
has the potential to improve engagement in psychosocial pain interventions and other non-pharmacological
pain treatments, which will improve pain-related interference and functioning and reduce reliance on opioid
analgesics. This study addresses VHA/VA Veteran care priorities including opioid use, pain management, and
access and directly addresses priorities of the HSR&D Targeted Solicitation for Service Directed Research on
Opioid Safety and Opioid Use Disorder.
Innovation: The proposed study is the first application of CBT-TS for Veterans with chronic pain who are
receiving opioid analgesics–a notably high-risk, treatment-resistant population. This is the first study to directly
intervene on thoughts about psychosocial interventions.
Specific Aims: The specific aims are to: test the effects of CBT-TS to increase initiation of psychosocial
interventions for pain among Veterans receiving opioid analgesics for chronic pain (Aim 1), test the effects of
CBT-TS to increase the retention in psychosocial interventions for pain among Veterans receiving opioid
analgesics for chronic pain (Aim 2), and evaluate the effects of CBT-TS in improving pain and substance use
outcomes among Veterans receiving opioid analgesics for chronic pain (Aim 3). We will also test the effects of
CBT-TS on the initiation of and retention to other non-pharmacological pain treatments (Exploratory Aim).
Methodology: Participants (N = 300) will be randomized to either the CBT-TS condition or an education
control condition. Participants in both conditions will complete assessments on pain, treatment engagement,
and opioid use at baseline, and 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-treatment to assess primary, secondary, and
exploratory outcomes.
Implementation/Next Steps: Results from this study will provide critical information on increasing
engagement of psychosocial interventions for pain, which can be used to inform future implementation and
dissemination efforts. The research team will work with the VHA National Pain Management and Opioid Safety
office and the VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation to identify implementation and
dissemination efforts. CBT-TS is undergoing current implementation research to increase mental health
functioning and this effort could be expanded to also increase treatment engagement of psychosocial
interventions for pain and other non-pharmacological pain treatments."

Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), are
neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein. Furthermore, it is well
known that α-synuclein exists in multiple structural forms (i.e., monomers and oligomers) that contribute to
neurotoxicity by distinct mechanisms. While there is substantial evidence that accumulation of α-synuclein
broadly impairs synaptic vesicle endocytosis, the effects of distinct α-synuclein species on synaptic endosomal
trafficking are largely unknown. The proposed studies will be the first to investigate in detail how accumulation
of different oligomeric α-synuclein species affect endosomal trafficking at vertebrate synapses and the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Using the lamprey synapse model, a classical vertebrate
model, we can deliver precise amounts of purified -synuclein species directly into synapses. This allows us to
independently test the effects of different -synuclein species on presynaptic ultrastructure and function. Our
preliminary studies suggest that excess monomeric -synuclein impairs endosomal trafficking, as shown by a
reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and concomitant increase in the number of atypical large vesicles,
reminiscent of endosomes. This provides an excellent model for the proposed studies. In Aim 1 (K99), we will
determine how monomeric human -synuclein affects endosomal trafficking at synapses. In Aim 2 (R00), we
will determine how oligomeric human -synuclein contribute to -synuclein-mediated endosomal dysfunction at
synapses. The focus will be on different oligomeric -synuclein species including dimers, small oligomers and
larger oligomers from PD/DLB human brains. These studies will provide critical understanding for the
development of therapies for improving synaptic function in synucleinopathies."
10810768,"SOUTH CAROLINA (SC) PRAMS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The SC PRAMS program will collect data from mothers that have recently delivered live-born
infants about their behaviors, experiences, and attitudes before, during, and after pregnancy. The
broad, long-term objectives of this project are to improve the overall health and outcomes for SC
mothers and infants.
More specifically, data collected by SC PRAMS will be used to monitor progress toward the
Healthy People (HP) 2020 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) objectives, identify cost-efficient
ways to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and inform and evaluate the SC
Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) MCH programs. Improving the health
status of pregnant women, newborn infants, and post-partum women are important components
of the DHEC mission, which is to improve the quality of life for all South Carolinians by
protecting and promoting the health of the public and the environment.
SC PRAMS data collection will be conducted by taking a stratified, systematic monthly sample
of SC mothers with a live birth, who will then be surveyed about their behaviors, experiences,
and attitudes before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. Data collection will be primarily done
by mailed surveys, with a telephone follow-up phase for mail non-respondents. A combined mail
and telephone response rate of 55%, which is set by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), will be a primary data quality goal.
Data collected will be weighted by the CDC to be representative of the population of SC women
delivering live births in the state annually. Collected data will be analyzed by qualified staff
within DHEC to assess maternal and infant health trends, characteristics of mothers and infants
with selected morbidities, and the performance of programs. Data collected will also be available
to CDC staff as well as to university, government, and private researchers across the United
States (US).
For the upcoming project period, the SC PRAMS program looks to improve response rates in
coordination with our contractor, improve messaging and outreach, and improve collaborations
within SC so that SC PRAMS data and information can truly inform programs and policies in SC
related to maternal and infant health."
10840628,"PROJECT SUMMARY—ABSTRACT
The combination of quantitative experimental studies and ordinary differential modeling has yielded great
insight into how biological switches and oscillators can and do function. Implicit in both the experimental and
theoretical approaches is the assumption that the systems in question are essentially homogeneous bags of
enzymes, which of course is incorrect. Here we propose studies aimed at understanding two intriguing aspects
of regulation in spatially organized cytoplasm. The first is the mechanism underpinning self-organization of the
cytoplasm, and the second is the propagation of activity states through the cytoplasm via trigger waves. The
main experimental system we will use is Xenopus egg extracts, which are more manipulable than intact cells,
but more complex and realistic than in vitro systems. The main modeling approaches will be partial differential
equations and agent based models that explicitly account for spatial dynamics. Over the next five years we
plan to focus on four basic aspects of cellular organization and dynamics:
1. Self-organization. Incredibly, it turns out that crude, heterogenous interphase Xenopus egg extracts self-
 organize into sheets of cell-like compartments. The mechanism underpinning this self-organization is not
 yet understood. We plan to use inhibitors and depletions in extracts, reconstitution in vitro, and
 mathematical modeling to gain insight into the basis of this biological self-organization.
2. Trade-offs, speed, and homeostasis. We will use self-organized extracts to determine how basic aspects
 of cell physiology are affected by the crowding of the cytoplasm, initially focusing on ATP production and
utilization.
3. Trigger waves. Trigger waves are self-regenerating fronts of chemical activity that can propagate without
 diminishing in amplitude or speed. Action potentials are trigger waves; so are calcium waves, mitotic
 waves, and apoptotic waves. We are examining the robustness of mitotic and apoptotic trigger waves in
 Xenopus egg extracts, and are testing hypotheses about the possible compartmentalization of trigger
 waves and bistable states.
4. Reconstitution of transcription. Under the right conditions, Xenopus egg extracts can carry out cell
 cycles for many hours, with DNA replication alternating with mitosis. Recently we have found that extracts
 appear to undergo the midblastula transition once 13-15 cell cycles have taken place. We plan to use the
 extract system to study the mechanism of the midblastula transition and to develop extracts as a new
 system for studying transcription."

The Children's Heart Program of South Carolina is a statewide consortium of pediatric cardiologists who provide
pediatric cardiac care for >90% of the 5.1 million residents in the state. The Pediatric Heart Program at MUSC
performs all of the cardiac surgery and interventional cardiac catheterizations for this racially and ethnically
diverse patient population. Clinical outcomes are consistently among the best in the country. MUSC has all the
critical elements to be a successful contributor in the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN): adequate patient volume,
established clinical research infrastructure, a track record of outstanding subject enrollment, and a dedication
to hypothesis driven research. These elements have allowed our site to be a highly successful and
administratively active participant in the PHN and one of only 5 core centers to be continuously funded since its
inception in 2001 The combined resources of patient volume, research infrastructure and dedication have
enabled MUSC to be among the top subject enrollers in the PHN. During this period, we have introduced
numerous trainees and junior faculty to the PHN and mentored them toward successful careers in clinical
investigation. MUSC faculty, nurse practitioners, and ancillary staff have participated as Pls in a wide variety of
multicenter studies, including many NIH-funded trials, analyses of clinical registry data, and industry
sponsored/FDA regulated trials. Our nationally recognized team of investigators have an extensive track record
of extramural funding, national presentations, publications in leading journals, and an extensive network of
diverse collaborators across North America. MUSC faculty also currently direct numerous local clinical research
protocols. In this application, we have submitted a concept proposal for a novel and highly impactful study of
the impact of environmental neurotoxins on early clinical and 18-month neurodevelopmental outcomes of
neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. The aims and hypotheses in this proposal are supported by strong pilot
data generated by our research team in collaboration with external investigators that demonstrate significant
exposure to cyclohexanone, phthalates, and volatile organic compounds in neonates undergoing cardiac
surgery. These exposures occur both in the hospital setting and/or the home environment and have the potential
to explain some of the disparate outcomes observed in this patient population. Our preliminary work has
established the feasibility of the project and the directionality of the findings in terms of impact on patient
outcomes. Given the prior success of PHN centers in enrolling neonates undergoing cardiac surgery in clinical
trials, the project is likely to be completed in a timely fashion and lead to actionable changes in patient care."

The main focus of our lab is on deciphering key mechanisms involved in cell-cell signaling through the
vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways, which are essential for embryogenesis, adult stem cell
maintenance, and are deeply involved in cancer and birth defects. A secondary focus is the development of
chemical probes for various biological molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids) in cells and tissues; these
probes are critical in our work on cell signaling, but they are useful beyond.
In Hh and Wnt signaling, we primarily study the events at or near cellular membranes, because of the larger
questions still unanswered in this area. We are interested in understanding how cells send Hh and Wnt signals
(proteins referred to as Hh and Wnt ligands), how the signals travel to faraway cells, and how the target cells
receive and interpret these signals.
Both Hh and Wnt ligands are attached to lipids, a feature that makes them stick to cellular membranes, raising
the question of how they are released from producing cells. The same lipids are also essential for the signaling
activity of the ligands, by mediating binding to receptors on target cells; however, it has been unknown how the
lipid-modified ligands are delivered to their receptors and how they activate signaling.
In recent work, we discovered that both Hh and Wnt ligands have dedicated release pathways, resulting in the
formation of complexes between ligands and specific carrier proteins, that shield the water-repelling lipids from
the extracellular environment. We found dedicated pathways that receive these carrier-ligand complexes on
the surface of target cells, to allow ligand-receptor binding. We also discovered a unique mechanism by which
cholesterol plays a critical role in Hh signaling, and built novel chemical tools to study how cholesterol functions
in this context.
Our findings open several fundamental questions, which we propose to answer in the next 5 years, using a
combination of biochemistry, structural, chemical and cell biology. We propose to elucidate how the lipid
modifications of Hh and Wnt ligands are handled during the packaging of carrier-ligand complexes, which is
currently unknown. We will also determine how the target cells unpack the carrier-ligand complexes, and how
they promote ligand-receptor binding, to trigger signaling. Finally, we will dissect the role of cholesterol in Hh
signaling, which has remained mysterious.
These studies are important for the following reasons: A) They will advance understanding of the Hh and Wnt
pathways, by elucidating critical molecular mechanisms involved in signaling; B) They will identify novel targets
for blocking oncogenic Hh and Wnt signaling; and C) Our novel chemical probes will be broadly applicable to
study cholesterol in health and in disease."

The microtubule cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of cell differentiation and must be spatially organized by
subcellular sites called microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) to fulfill cellular functions. Since the discovery
of MTOCs over 50 years ago, the majority of MTOC research has focused on the centrosome, an organelle
that organizes microtubules during animal cell mitosis. However, MTOC function is reassigned to non-
centrosomal sites during cell differentiation: non-centrosomal MTOCs (ncMTOCs) form at the apical membrane
of epithelial cells, the axons and dendrites of neurons, and the nuclear envelope in skeletal muscle cells, and
non-centrosomal microtubules are critical for the development and function of the tissues that these cell types
comprise. The generation of non-centrosomal microtubule networks is associated with the simultaneous
inactivation of MTOC function at the centrosome and defects in centrosome inactivation are prevalent in
epithelial cancer and linked to invasive cell behavior. Thus, a dramatic reorganization of the microtubule
cytoskeleton is a fundamental aspect of cell differentiation, and my lab has used support from NIGMS over the
last 5 years to uncover mechanisms of ncMTOC establishment and centrosome inactivation. We established
C. elegans as an in vivo model of non-centrosomal microtubule organization, identifying and characterizing
ncMTOCs at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells and at the tips of the dendrites in sensory neurons.
By developing tools for tissue-specific degradation and proximity labeling, we found that essential MTOC
proteins can vary across subcellular locations and cell types and identified novel ncMTOC components,
including the spectraplakin protein VAB-10B and primary microcephaly protein WDR-62. We uncovered the
modes and mechanisms by which MTOC function is removed from the centrosome and identified an essential
SPD-5-based module of proteins required for centrosomal MTOC function across cell types. With these
technical and conceptual advances in hand, our goal over the next 5 years is to answer fundamental questions
related to microtubule organization: 1. How do differentiated cell types build specialized microtubule
networks? We will use VAB-10B and WDR-62 as genetic handles to define comprehensive proximity maps of
ncMTOCs across cell types with the goal of understanding how ncMTOCs first arise during differentiation; 2.
How and why is MTOC function inactivated at the centrosome? We will uncover the molecular mechanism
by which SPD-5 transforms the centrosome into an MTOC and test the physiological relevance of centrosome
inactivation; 3. How do compound microtubules form? Using novel genetic tools, we will determine how
microtubules build onto one another to form doublet microtubules, conserved features of organelles called cilia.
These questions are fundamental to our understanding of cell differentiation and leverage unique properties of
C. elegans to address this important, but understudied topic in cell and developmental biology."

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and characterize
the range of molecular transducers that underlie the effects of exercise in humans. MoTrPAC was launched in
2016 with six adult clinical centers and a pediatric center that have collaborated to generate extensive Manual
of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of the clinical operations (Phase I). Phase II
began in the fall of 2019 with all human clinical centers showing excellent progress towards initial recruitment
goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by NIH was to recruit 270 children (10-17
years of age) and 1980 sedentary adults (age 18 years or greater) that are randomized to endurance training
(170 youth, 840 adults), resistance training (840 adults), or non-exercise controls (50 youth, 300 adults). An
additional group of highly active endurance (50 youth, 150 adults) and resistance (150 adults) trained individuals
serve as comparators and are not participating in the MoTrPAC exercise training programs. The recruitment and
enrollment approach are sex balanced and with participants across a wide range of ages (10-17, 18-39, 40-59
and >60-year age groups) and of different races. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MoTrPAC activities were
suspended for over a year (beginning in March 2020) with continued constraints through 2022. Despite the
numerous challenges encountered as a result of the pandemic, recruitment activities at the adult and pediatric
clinical centers have accelerated to a rate that is projected to successfully achieve the target enrollment numbers
by the end of the new award period. This led to the NIH Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-
23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including
finishing mechanistic randomized controlled trials of sedentary adults and children and observational studies of
highly active adults and children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to understand exercise
adaptations and heterogeneity across age, gender, and minority groups. Altogether, this extension will allow
MoTrPAC to complete the intended goals as originally envisioned and will provide a more complete public
database of the health benefits of exercise and provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease."
10843181,"This award will train dentist-scientist Dr. Kyle Vining in immuno-oncology and help him transition to
an independent research career focused on developing novel strategies to re-program myeloid fate in head
and neck cancer. Several immunotherapies are approved for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), but despite these advances, the reported response rate was only 13% in patients treated with
checkpoint blockade monotherapy with nivolumab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. There is an unmet clinical
need to identify mechanisms of immune resistance in solid tumors. To address this problem, we focus on the
yet unknown role of mechanical cues on myeloid cells in fibrotic tumors. Solid tumors are surrounded by
a rigid stroma of extracellular matrix (ECM). A significant gap of knowledge remains of how mechanics can
directly impact the fate of immune cells in tumors. This application will dissect the role of mechanics on
myeloid cells in tumors, building on strong preliminary data that showed the stress-relaxation, or
viscoelasticity, of ECM regulates immature monocytes in vitro. An artificial ECM system was developed to
independently tune fibrillar collagen matrix to stiffness similar to solid tumors, with either more fluid-like,
viscous or more solid-like, elastic properties. Viscous, stiff matrix maintained immature monocytes, whereas
elastic, stiff matrix directed differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells and upregulated secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest the hypothesis that monocyte fate is directed by mechanical
regulation in human solid tumors. The first Aim will be conducted under mentoring at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute by immuno-oncologists Dr. F. Stephen Hodi and Dr. Ravindra Uppaluri, as well as cancer
immunologist Dr. Kai Wucherpfennig. These supporting data and artificial ECM will be used to identify
mechanically-transduced transcriptional programs of monocytes and determine whether these molecular
signatures are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patient samples of oral SCC. Dr. Vining
will participate in Harvard Medical School workshops and courses to learn R-programming and bioinformatics
analyses, as well as work with a collaborator in bioinformatics. Finally, in the independent phase in Aim 2,
Dr. Vining's lab will determine the effects of targeting mechanical regulation of monocytes fate in vitro and in
vivo. The artificial ECM system will identify targets to control monocyte fate, which then will be tested in an
animal model of oral cancer. In conclusion, these Aims together will determine the regulation of monocytes
by mechanical cues and will develop new strategies to target myeloid cells for the treatment of HNSCC.
Further, these findings will potentially launch new areas of investigation into how mechanical cues
regulate myeloid cells in homeostasis, disease, and regeneration."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent condition, found in 20% of people aged 50 years and
older. While it is well known that CKD is strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality, recent work has
demonstrated an association with cancer risk that also merits consideration for preventive strategies. Cancer is
the leading cause of death in mid-life patients afflicted by early stages of CKD, and the 2nd leading cause
across all CKD patients under 65 years. Specifically, kidney cancers occur three times more often in patients
with CKD, including a hazard ratio of up to 3.4 in younger men (40-52 years) with moderate CKD (15-60
mL/min/1.73 m2). Indeed, the incidence of kidney cancer in mid-life patients with CKD is similar to that of
colorectal cancer in the general population. Risks of bladder cancer are similarly increased in CKD. Current
guidelines recommend that CKD patients undergo monitoring of common renal and cardiovascular risk factors
that overlap with those of urinary tract cancers such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Thus, the lack of
clear cancer screening recommendations represents an important gap in CKD practice guidelines, and may be
due to the complex weighing of benefits and harms for a population with wide-ranging health status.
 Our team of experts in decision science, epidemiology, urologic oncology, nephrology, radiology, and
internal medicine will apply complementary experience to assess the potential of screening strategies. We
previously developed and published a computer simulation model of kidney tumors and comorbidities,
supported by an NCI K award, the Renal Anatomy and Function for Renal Masses (Re-AFFiRM) simulation
model. Our model is capable of simulating outcomes of subpopulations defined by CKD severity and kidney
tumor natural history. We will transform the model to incorporate bladder cancer natural history as well as
kidney and bladder screening pathways. We will assess whether cancer screening pathways benefit life
expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy based on age, CKD stage, strong co-existing risk factors, and
comorbidity burden. Middle-aged adults without other significant cardiovascular comorbidity and multiple
established risk factors may warrant more intensive screening, whereas patients with cardiovascular disease
and few risk factors may warrant less intensive screening. In addition, Black men and women with CKD have
been shown repeatedly to suffer higher all-cause and cancer-specific mortality compared to non-Black CKD
patients, an important consideration in forming screening recommendations. Our findings will be evaluated by
a group of independent stakeholders in primary care, nephrology, urology, and patient advocacy to consider
the acceptability and barriers to screening as supported by the model results. Cost-effectiveness will also be
explored for key factors that affect or elevate the value of screening. Our goal will be to establish the context in
which urinary tract screening recommendations could benefit the large population with CKD."

Driven by international open scientific collaboration through groups such as the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC, in which co-I Mullins is a leading analyst) both genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) and whole exome and genome sequencing studies of neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are
rapidly increasing in sample size. With this increased sample size comes increased statistical power to
detect many more, smaller genetic effects on disease risk, known as the polygenic component. The
challenge now is to understand what these findings tell us about NPD risk, etiology and biology. Here we
propose a suite of methods for multi-trait analysis to determine underlying latent structure, causal
networks of genes and traits, and enriched data-derived regulatory pathways. We make extensive use of
convex optimization methods that allow both computational efficiency and guarantees on reproducibility.
In Aim 1 we will decompose a wide range of NPDs and their subphenotypes into shared and unique
genetic components using a novel convex formulation of observed-weighted principal components
analysis (PCA) and develop extensions to handle sample overlap, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and
different ancestries. In Aim 2 we will extend and customize our existing work on causal network inference
using biconvex optimization to estimate both cis and trans gene regulatory networks in the brain using
large-scale uniformly processed chromatin accessibility and expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We
will regularize estimates of cis interactions using chromatin conformation data, model latent genetic
confounders in these networks using an expectation-maximization (EM) approach and estimate networks
over both genes and NPDs in order to determine the most direct causes (“core” genes in the omnigenic
model). In Aim 3 we will analyze both rare and common genetic associations in their gene regulatory
network context. Borrowing from cancer genomics, we will use heat diffusion models to propagate
statistical information on the local network over both genes and regulatory elements (REs) and then use
graph clustering algorithms to extract “hot” subnetworks, corresponding to pathways implicated in the
NPD under study. The methods we develop for these analyses will be made publicly available under
source licenses with extensive support in terms of documentation, tutorials, and vignettes. Through this
we hope to empower future “post-GWAS” analyses that can leverage the genetic, subphenotype and trait
networks underlying human neuropsychiatric health, and eventually point the way to therapeutic
interventions."

Dengue, a potentially life-threatening disease, has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years. In Indonesia, 1 in 3
children have had a dengue infection by 5 years old. Islands in the Indo-Pacific are highly vulnerable to climate
change and water insecurity, two key drivers of arbovirus spread. Predicting and mitigating arbovirus
transmission in the Indo-Pacific is critical to addressing the increasing risk of arboviruses in the U.S. In the next
several decades, half the U.S. may have habitat suitable for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, mosquitos
which spread dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses.
Revitalizing Informal Settlements and their Environments (RISE) is a cluster randomized control trial evaluating
the benefits of upgrading local water infrastructure in urban slums in Indonesia and Fiji. The RISE intervention
is a prototype for future slum upgrading to address climate change and water insecurity throughout the Indo-
Pacific. Although the World Health Organization recommends permanent environmental modification as an
arbovirus control strategy, this has never before been rigorously tested. RISE provides an important
opportunity to evaluate whether this model decreases or inadvertently increases arbovirus transmission.
In addition to evaluating a new paradigm for mitigating arbovirus transmission, RISE is an ideal platform to
assess gaps in knowledge about environmental drivers of arbovirus transmission. My hypothesis is that
modifiable environmental conditions drive arbovirus transmission in these communities. To test this hypothesis,
I will leverage the RISE platform to study arbovirus risk factors in this region and evaluate the impact of
permanent environmental modification on arbovirus transmission in urban slums. I will also create a
mathematical model to simulate arbovirus transmission in this region under a range of climate change and
intervention scenarios.
I have developed a customized career development plan that aligns with my proposed research. It incorporates
both formal and informal training under the mentorship of Drs. LaBeaud and Luby. This training plan draws
upon my existing expertise in global health, tropical medicine, and epidemiology; it will enhance my expertise
in laboratory diagnostics, geospatial analysis, and mathematical modeling. The planned didactics and technical
training included here will provide the foundation necessary to achieve my goal of becoming an academic
physician focused on mitigating the spread of infectious diseases in the era of climate change."

This project seeks to understand how T-B collaboration and specific autoantigens drive
inflammation and fibrosis in IgG4-related disease. In order to define antigenic drivers of IgG4-
related disease this proposal examines autoantigens that define IgG4-related disease. The
antigen-specificity of clonally expanded CD4+ cytotoxic T cells that are likely drivers of the
disease will also be determined. Cognate B cells will be identified in an antigen specific manner
and T and B cells interactions will be examined. Based on information on specific autoantigens
already obtained, autoantibodies and antigen specific B cells will be identified that are not only
seen initially at the time of diagnosis but that also return at the time of relapse following B cell
depletion induced remission. The autoantigens that dominate at the time of relapse are the likely
source of peptides that disease-related memory CD4+ T cells recognize. Autoantibodies will be
identified using HuProt protein arrays and validated by the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation
System assays and by ELISAs. Autoantigens will be dually labeled in order to identify and
characterize antigen-specific B cells. Overlapping peptides from key autoantigen proteins will be
used to activate autoantigen specific T cells, which will be characterized by flow cytometry and
transcriptomics. Mechanisms of inflammation and fibrosis driven by adaptive immune cells in
tissues will be characterized by imaging tissues and using systems biology approaches for
analysis."

Cytokinesis, the physical separation of one cell into two daughter cells, is the final stage of cell division, and
although it is the least well understood, it is central to development and tissue homeostasis. Correctly timing
cytokinesis so that it occurs only after chromosome replication and segregation is necessary to prevent
catastrophic genomic instability, and accordingly, cytokinesis is strictly regulated in concert with other cell cycle
events. Using a powerful model organism, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, my lab has
conducted pioneering research to identify proteins essential for cytokinesis and to learn how the myriad
proteins that comprise the cell division machinery are coordinated to ensure the exquisite spatial and temporal
control of cell division. We propose to continue our work pursuing fundamental questions in this field using a
multi-disciplinary approach in two directions. In one direction, we will tackle how CK1 protein kinases are able
to inhibit cytokinesis during a delay in spindle assembly by pursuing their regulation. We will determine whether
CK1 activity is regulated by cell cycle cues. Understanding CK1 regulation in the context of the mitotic
checkpoint will establish general mechanisms of regulation for this enzyme family, which are conserved,
multifunctional kinases with roles in numerous human diseases. In a second direction, we will advance our
understanding of the assembly and architecture of the contractile ring using a combination of microscopy,
biochemistry, and genetics. We will continue to build our knowledge of the major scaffold of the contractile ring,
the F-BAR protein Cdc15, by defining how it oligomerizes on the plasma membrane, and how other contractile
ring components including the phosphatase calcineurin are organized on the Cdc15 scaffold. These focused
mechanistic studies will be complemented with proteomic and genetic screens designed to establish a
functional interaction network of contractile ring components. Together, these studies will have a major impact
for understanding how cytokinesis is orchestrated in eukaryotic species from yeast to humans."

 The goal of our proposed research program is the design of new catalytic methodology for the
synthesis of complex organic building blocks via site-selective activation of carbon-hydrogen
bonds in simple organic molecules. Our approach makes use of a class of dipyridylarylmethanes
as supporting ligands in iridium-catalyzed sp3 C-H borylation catalysis. This family of ligands was
recently identified in our laboratory and is designed to borrow features of previous diimine and
pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands for the same transformation while offering the advantage of
modular synthetic routes for their preparation. Our initial studies on this ligand class identified one
of the best catalysts for sp3 C-H borylation yet known, which has led us to design a research
program that takes advantage of the improved functional group tolerance of this system to expand
the scope of suitable substrates. Our proposed work will address challenges presented by the
need for selectivity in sp3 C-H borylation, and in so doing will provide access to functionalized
alkylboronic ester products with functional groups that were previously inaccessible through C-H
activation. Further applications to the synthesis of linker molecules and biologically relevant cyclic
boronate esters are proposed. We will also explore applications of dipyridylarylmethane ligands
to C-H silylation catalysis, a class of chemical reactions that is substantially underdeveloped by
comparison to C-H borylation.
 In total this program provides enabling technologies in the form of chemical methodology for
the synthesis of complex building blocks from simple precursors. These methods will empower
synthetic chemists in the synthesis of drug candidates and biological probes by providing tools to
address the necessary complexity of molecules that interface with biological systems."

Hispanic/Latino sexual minority men (HLSMM) account for 24% of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. and are
understudied in HIV prevention research. Although methamphetamine use is one of the most significant drivers
of HIV infections among sexual minority men and is highly stigmatized, little is known about how intersecting
drug use stigma and sexual minority stigma impact methamphetamine use and HIV vulnerability among HLSMM.
As a result, HIV prevention interventions may not be equipped to address the converging impact of intersecting
stigma on social, psychological, and biological processes that contribute to HIV risk in this critical population.
This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support the exceptional candidate during his
upcoming years of research and training and support his transition toward research independence. The
candidate’s proposed research aims to test a social-ecological model of structural- and network-level
manifestations of intersecting drug use stigma and sexual minority stigma. This innovative research incorporates
social, psychological, and biological processes influencing drug use and HIV vulnerability among HLSMM. To
accomplish these goals, the candidate requires training and expert mentorship in three critical areas: 1) network
science and network determinants of health, 2) inflammatory biomarkers of HIV vulnerability, and 3) designing
and testing multilevel intersectional stigma interventions. In addition to mentorship from leading experts in HIV
prevention research, training will be accomplished through coursework, training institutes, working groups,
scientific productivity, and career development activities. Training in these areas will be applied through several
mentored research projects. The specific aims of the proposed research are to 1) Determine the independent
and intersecting impact of structural drug use stigma and structural sexual minority stigma on methamphetamine
use and HIV behavioral vulnerability among HIV-negative HLSMM in the U.S., 2) Assess the network-level
effects of independent and intersecting drug use stigma and sexual minority stigma on methamphetamine use
severity and HIV behavioral vulnerability via emotion dysregulation and social support in HIV-negative HLSMM
who use methamphetamine; and 3) Examine the network-level effects of independent and intersecting drug use
stigma and sexual minority stigma on rectal inflammatory biomarkers (rectal cytokines) that may be linked to
enhanced HIV biological vulnerability. Aim 1 will be accomplished by analyzing data from five waves (2017-2022)
of a cohort study of HLSMM. Aims 2 and 3 will be achieved by conducting a longitudinal pilot study of 200
HLSMM who use methamphetamine. This high-impact research will fill a critical gap in HIV prevention among
HLSMM and inform the development of a multilevel intervention for HLSMM who use methamphetamine,
accelerating the progress toward ending the HIV epidemic among HLSMM in the U.S."

Up to 90% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients exhibit hypertension, which accelerates kidney damage
and kidney function decline. Despite many anti-hypertensive drugs, blood pressure (BP) often remains
uncontrolled. In fact, CKD is the strongest predictor of treatment-resistant hypertension. Critically, CKD is a
silent killer: An alarming 96% of those with early, asymptomatic CKD are unaware of their condition. Thus,
there is pressing need for novel strategies to combat the detrimental cycle of hypertension and kidney
damage. Importantly, Zn deficiency has been linked to impaired renal Na+ excretory function, hypertension,
and kidney damage. Notably, the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), a critical determinant of
whole-body Na+ balance and BP homeostasis in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT), has been shown to be
Zn-sensitive. Specifically, Zn-deficient mice showed upregulated NCC, enhanced Na+ reabsorption, and
elevated BP; but Zn repletion reversed these derangements. However, other reports show that, as CKD
progresses through stages, fractional urinary excretion of Zn increased as plasma levels of Zn decreased,
with a sharp increase in urinary excretion of Zn at stage 3. Critically, this is before most patients are even
diagnosed. Thus, Zn supplementation may be effective to restore BP homeostasis in early stages of CKD;
but its effects may be limited if later-stage kidney damage diminishes Zn bioavailability.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to fill the critical gaps in therapeutic knowledge of Zn supplementation
and mechanistic knowledge of the Zn-sensitive renal pathways. The overall objectives of this proposal are
to (i) assess Zn supplementation as a therapy to restore BP regulation in early and late stages of CKD, and
(ii) identify the mechanisms of Zn-sensitive DCT Na+ handling, with the ultimate goal to identify novel
therapeutic approaches effective for all stages of CKD. This will be done via these 3 Aims:
Aim 1. Assess efficacy of Zn to delay hypertension and disease progression in early CKD:
Calcineurin inhibitor-treated mice and Akita diabetic nephropathy mice will serve as CKD models to
rigorously test the novel working hypothesis that Zn supplementation in early CKD restores Zn homeostasis,
limits renal Na+ reabsorption, reduces hypertension, and slows CKD progression.
Aim 2. Assess efficacy of Zn plus a Zn ionophore to restore Zn homeostasis, renal Na+ excretion,
and BP regulation in late-stage CKD: The same mouse models at later stages will test the working
hypothesis that Zn supplementation with a Zn ionophore, promotes Zn bioavailability to overcome Zn
wasting, stimulate renal Na+ excretion, and restore BP homeostasis - despite late-stage kidney damage.
Aim 3. Establish signaling molecules underlying Zn sensitivity of DCT-dependent Na+ handling and
BP homeostasis: Developed mouse models and mouse DCT cells will be used to identify Zn-sensitive
signaling molecules that limit DCT Na+ reabsorption pathways and promote Na+ balance and BP
homeostasis."
10835997,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are severe diseases arising from mutations in critical enzymes and
collectively have an estimated incidence of 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 5,500 live births. Patients with LSDs are at
increased risk of serious perinatal morbidity and mortality, with some not even surviving to birth. The current
treatment for pediatric patients, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is limited by three aspects: the
progressive development (sometimes in utero) of organ-specific manifestations, the development of anti-ERT
antibodies, and the inability of ERT to cross the blood-brain barrier to address neurologic effects. Thus, there is
an unmet medical need to develop more effective therapies for patients with LSDs, starting before birth. In a
mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS7), we showed that in utero ERT (IUERT) followed by
postnatal ERT improved survival, crossed the blood-brain barrier, ameliorated disease, and induced tolerance
to the ERT. Based on these results, we obtained an IND to perform a first-in-human, non-randomized, single
site phase 1 clinical trial of IUERT and seek funding to support this clinical trial. Since each individual LSD is
rare, but they share similar pathophysiology, we have included eight different LSDs (and their specific ERT)
under this protocol: MPS Types 1, 2, 4a, 6, and 7, Infantile-onset Pompe Disease (IOPD), Neuronopathic
Gaucher (Types 2 and 3), and Wolman disease. We will enroll 10 maternal-fetal pairs for infusion of the ERT
via the umbilical vein every 2-4 weeks, starting after 18 weeks of gestation. We will evaluate the safety and
feasibility of this prenatal therapy, as well as the efficacy of ERTs in resolving fetal manifestations (if present)
and improving long-term outcomes including neurologic and cardiac function, mobility, and growth. (Aim 1). We
will also examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IUERT by evaluating enzyme trough levels
throughout gestation, as well as levels of disease-specific lysosomal accumulations before and after birth (Aim
2). Finally, we will evaluate whether in utero exposure to the recombinant enzyme will induce tolerance, as
determined by lack of anti-drug antibodies and generation of enzyme-specific regulatory T cells (Aims 3). In the
past year, our team has successfully treated a fetus with IOPD (whose two previous siblings had severe
cardiomyopathy and suffered perinatal demise); this patient was born at term after multiple prenatal enzyme
infusions and has normal cardiac function. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team and partnered with
several experts on biochemical analyses for LSDs. Since we anticipate identifying fetuses based on a known
family history, we have also been collaborating with multiple national and international patient advocacy groups
to include patients and families in the design and execution of this trial. We conducted a parent survey to
evaluate their attitudes and found that the majority of respondents would choose to enroll in a phase I clinical
trial for fetal ERT for a future pregnancy affected by an LSD. Ultimately, we seek to improve the options
available to families and patients with LSDs."
10836003,"Hypertension is a common chronic disease with a significant impact on public health, yet its basic pathogenesis is not fully understood, and new therapeutic targets are needed. A beneficial role for prostanoids in hypertension was suggested because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which block the production of all prostanoids, can cause sodium retention and exacerbate hypertension. Among prostanoids, PGE2 and its EP4 receptor (EP4R) have been implicated in blood pressure control, but these mechanisms are unknown. Our previous work showed that conditional deletion of EP4R from all tissues in adult mice dramatically exacerbated Ang II-dependent hypertension. However, the elimination of EP4R from vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages had no impact on hypertension development. By contrast, specific removal of EP4R from whole renal epithelia recapitulated the phenotype of exacerbated hypertension, indicating that EP4R attenuates hypertension by direct actions in the renal epithelium. Recent single-cell sequencing studies demonstrated that EP4R expression in renal epithelia is enriched in the collecting duct (CD). CDs have pivotal roles in final urinary sodium excretion through the actions of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Our preliminary studies showed that mice with EP4R deletion in renal epithelia throughout the nephron had increased responsiveness to ENaC inhibitor, and PGE2 inhibits the ENaC activity in isolated CDs. Thus, we hypothesize that EP4R resists the development of hypertension through actions in the CD to reduce sodium reabsorption via ENaC. The project’s objective is to identify mechanisms underlying the anti-hypertension effects of EP4R and to exploit them for new treatments of human hypertension. Our Aims are: 1) Identify cell specificity for EP4R actions in kidney epithelia to resist hypertension. We will generate mice with EP4R deleted from entire CDs, principal cells, or intercalated cells, respectively, to assess the consequences of these genetic alterations on blood pressure, sodium homeostasis, and ENaC function in hypertension; and 2) Determine the mechanisms of ENaC regulation by EP4R. We will perform patch-clamp electrophysiology in isolated CDs to characterize EP4R downstream signaling pathways that mediate its powerful effects on attenuating the development of hypertension. Successful completion of the proposed research is expected to identify the mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive actions of EP4R. The long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets for essential hypertension."
10836008,"Transcriptional regulation is fundamental to most basic molecular and cell biological processes. Our
long-term goals are to determine how 10 and 30 nm chromatin fibers fold into large-scale chromatin domains,
how these chromatin domains are moved and positioned within nuclei relative to specific nuclear bodies and
compartments, and what this means for DNA functions such as transcription and replication.
Our first Aim is to dissect both transcription independent and transcription dependent mechanisms for
genome positioning relative to nuclear speckles. Our rationale is that gene positioning relative to nuclear
speckles modulates levels of gene expression possibly for thousands of genes, and therefore dissection of
these mechanisms will reveal novel aspects of gene regulation. This Aim builds on strong preliminary work.
During the last grant cycle, we discovered gene expression amplification after nuclear speckle contact. We
also discovered a surprising conservation of genome distance to nuclear speckles, with small distance shifts
relative to speckles highly correlated with large changes in gene expression and with many inducible genes
“pre-positioned” near nuclear speckles even before transcriptional activation.
Our second Aim is to map, visualize, reconstitute, and then dissect cis and trans determinants for large-
scale chromatin domains with distinct levels of compaction; these domains can be visualized by live-cell
microscopy and electron microscopy but are not yet measured by current genomic methods such as Hi-C and
are not well-preserved by conventional FISH methods. Our rationale is that this level of large-scale
compaction modulates both transcriptional initiation and elongation rates and therefore our analysis of
chromatin domains with different levels of large-scale chromatin compaction will reveal novel aspects of gene
regulation. This Aim also builds on strong preliminary work. During the last grant cycle, we used high slopes
of TSA-seq scores to identify unusually decondensed large-scale chromatin domains (DLCDs). DLCDs
mapped predominately to Hi-C compartment, subcompartment, and TAD boundaries separating active and
repressed chromatin domains. Acidic activators and chromatin factors recruited by acidic activators showed
the highest enrichment over DLCDS among hundreds of chromatin-modifying factors. Strikingly, this observed
enrichment connects with results from the early years of this grant showing that among four classes of
transcriptional activators, only acidic transcriptional activator domains showed the common activity of inducing
large-scale decondensation of an engineered heterochromatic chromosome region. During this last grant
cycle, we also made technological advances in developing TSA-MS to identify proteins localizing to
immunostained nuclear bodies and in the manipulation and transgenesis of large DNA constructs."

10836359,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 50-80% of all pediatric patients are non-adherent.3-6 Extensive pediatric adherence research
exists in solid organ transplant, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. However, there are only
three known studies in children with HSCT, and all report suboptimal adherence rates (52-78%) that worsen
over time.7-9 Additionally, in pilot study, 70% of HSCT providers reported adherence as a major concern for
their outpatient pediatric HSCT recipients.10 Currently, no HSCT specific interventions exist to improve
adherence and clinical outcomes. There is a critical need to evaluate novel mHealth approaches to improve
adherence and clinical outcomes among children receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) to
prevent morbidity and mortality. The rationale is that a mHealth app designed to send medication reminders to
caregivers will increase adherence to immunosuppressant medication, thereby potentially reducing GVHD,
readmissions, and mortality. The app will also obtain reasons for non-adherence adding to our knowledge of
barriers to adherence in this population. This K99/R00 application describes the background and experience of
the applicant, Micah A. Skeens PhD, RN, and her plan to acquire the knowledge and training necessary to
become a leading independent clinical investigator in adherence and mHealth interventions that improve
clinical outcomes for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The overall goal during
the K99 is to gain advanced research training in mHealth interventions, adherence and conducting randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) to develop and test a mHealth application for adherence of pediatric HSCT patients in
the acute phase post-transplant. Using a behavioral economics approach, the goal of this new mHealth
application will be to improve adherence and ultimately clinical outcomes as well as collect information
regarding barriers. The research specific aim during the K99 phase is to develop an adherence mHealth
application using a mixed methods approach and to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the mHealth
application for pediatric HSCT patients in the acute outpatient phase post-transplant. To meet the K99 training
objectives, a comprehensive training plan has been developed in concert with an internationally recognized
interdisciplinary mentorship team of senior research experts. The overall goal during the R00 phase is to
conduct a pilot RCT with 40 caregivers to assess acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of the newly
developed mHealth app. The research specific aims during the R00 phase are to: 1) evaluate the acceptability
of a newly developed mHealth app and the feasibility of enrolling and retaining 40 caregivers of children in the
acute outpatient phase post-HSCT and 2) evaluate the potential efficacy of the mHealth app on adherence to
immunosuppressants in children who have been discharged home during the acute phase post-HSCT. The
results will directly support an R-01 application to conduct a multi-site RCT efficacy trial of the mHealth
application on adherence and clinical outcomes in children during the acute phase post-HSCT."

Applicant: I am a consultation-liaison psychiatrist keenly interested in delirium and the role that sleep-wake
disturbance (SWD) plays in delirium vulnerability, its pathogenesis, and its relationship with subsequent
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). My mission is to improve the care and clinical outcomes
of those with and at risk for delirium and to be a champion for excellence in care for older adults. This
application is designed for me to obtain expertise in longitudinal study conduct and design, assessment of
SWD, neuropsychological training relevant to delirium and the two neurocognitive disorders associated with it
(Alzheimer’s disease and vascular neurocognitive disorder), and a solid background in statistical methods to
become an independent physician-scientist.
Project: I am proposing a prospective cohort study of subjects undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement
with the goal of investigating objective SWD before surgery—both actigraphy and unattended type II home
sleep tests (HST)—for its association with postoperative delirium and subsequent ADRD. This study
represents a novel application of type II HST, which provides comprehensive assessment of sleep architecture,
to characterize preoperative SWD as a marker of delirium risk and evidence in support of a mechanistic link
between delirium and subsequent Alzheimer’s disease or vascular neurocognitive disorder.
Professional development: I will obtain practical experience in empirical methods by conducting a longitudinal
study with expertise in assessing SWD using unattended methods, neuropsychological testing, and relevant
statistics. My training plan incorporates hands-on experiences in sleep medicine, neuropsychology, and
statistics, complemented by coursework and directed readings that will provide the necessary theoretical
foundation.
Goals: My career goals are to establish an interdisciplinary research program at URMC with cardiac surgery
and sleep medicine, to explore how SWD is mechanistically involved in delirium risk, onset, and its dire
outcomes, and to advance the science of delirium pathophysiology and subsequent risk of ADRD."
10836361,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Only a handful set of signaling pathways (FGF, BMP, Wnt, Hh, Notch, etc) are repeatedly utilized to control
almost all aspects of cell-cell communication from early embryonic development to adult tissue homeostasis.
How this small set of pathways controls such a large number of phenomena is poorly understood. We and others
recently showed that signal response is not binary, and that gene expression depends on many parameters of
a cell’s signaling history, including duration, timing, and rate of signal change. Therefore, different responses to
the same signaling molecules may be in part attributed to different time courses of exposure. The primary goal
of the proposed research is to develop a predictive understanding of how the signaling history of a cell
controls its fate, focusing on early cell fate decisions in human pluripotent stem cells. To decipher how
information is encoded in dynamic signals we will take a highly interdisciplinary approach that combines gene
editing, quantitative fluorescence microscopy, engineering of the stem cell environment, computational analysis,
and mathematical modeling. The proposed interrelated goals build on previously published work combining these
approaches by the PI and recent preliminary data from the laboratory. First, we will determine population level
signaling dynamics in response to FGF. The quantitative characteristics of FGF signaling are not well understood
despite playing a crucial role in pluripotency maintenance and mesendoderm differentiation, and this information
is important in laying the foundation for the second project. Second, we will go beyond population level dynamics
of a single pathway, and measure signaling through multiple pathways simultaneously in individual cells to
identify precise features of combinatorial signaling that are predictive of fate. Specifically, we will create a single
cell line expressing four of our published constructs to visualize each of the paracrine pathways involved in early
cell fate (Wnt, BMP, Activin/Nodal, and FGF), and utilize our custom image analysis software for tracking cells
through many days of differentiation. This will generate unique high-dimensional data in the form single-cell multi-
pathway signaling histories linked to cell fate. We will then use data science methods to determine signaling
features that predict cell fate. Third, we will investigate the interplay between tissue mechanics and cell signaling.
Mesoderm differentiation is closely linked to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and dramatic changes in
intercellular forces. By combining our signaling assays with force manipulation and force measurement, we will
gain biophysical insight into how FGF regulates intercellular tension and adhesion, and how tension and
adhesion modulate the Wnt response. The ultimate goal is to obtain a quantitative understanding of the complex
interplay between signaling dynamics, cell mechanics, and cell fate, and exploit this knowledge for wide ranging
therapeutic applications including optimized protocols for directed stem cell differentiation and more effective
use of drugs that target signaling pathways."

Older Americans experience approximately 29 million falls and 13 million hospitalizations per year. These
intervening health events (IHE - episodic falls, injuries, illnesses, and hospitalizations) are strong precipitants of
disability in older adults. Because of their episodic nature, IHEs are extremely difficult to study. Continuous,
long-term monitoring with remote capabilities using wearable technology is an ideal solution for capturing
information surrounding an IHE and in particular, preceding it. This R21/R33 project aims to develop a
sustainable research infrastructure built on the foundation of a smart watch application and server called
ROAMM (Real-time Online Assessment and Mobility Monitor). It will offer long-term and continuous
connectivity, bidirectional interactivity and remote programming. ROAMM will create a detailed narrative about
mobility (activity patterns, walking speed, life space), patient reported outcomes/symptoms (pain, poor mood,
fatigue, disability), cognition (working memory, processing speed, and executive functioning) and reports of
health events (falls and hospitalizations). The infrastructure is composed of a diverse group of investigators
with expertise in mobile technology/data science and applied/medical sciences who will serve in the following
cores: Wearable Technology, Phenotyping, Clinical Outcomes, Data Science Management & Quality, and
Recruitment, Retention & Compliance. In the R21 phase, we will create the ROAMM framework consisting of
the watch application and accompanying server. We will also assess test-retest reliability, convergent validity
and participant usability/acceptability. Each year, an Independent Advisory Panel and External Advisory
Committee will evaluate milestone-driving activities and our Go/No-Go checkpoints for transitioning to the R33
phase. Work proposed in the R33 phase will showcase the ROAMM infrastructure by conducting a
prospective, longitudinal study (range 1.25-2.5 yrs) in 200 community-dwelling persons aged 70+ yrs. This
phase will test a field deployable version of ROAMM in real world settings to address the following hypotheses:
1) Pre-event patterns of low mobility, disability, fatigue, pain and depressive mood collected by ROAMM are
independent predictors of incident IHE's; 2) IHE's will negatively impact the course of ROAMM measures; and
3) Additional value will be gained for explaining the change variability and recovery trajectories. An exploratory
aim will evaluate safety while using ROAMM features and identify predictors of ROAMM adherence using both
key-informant interviews and examine demographic and health histories to create boundaries for using
ROAMM and other systems like it for long-term, continuous monitoring in research and practice. We will
sustain ROAMM by targeting grant opportunities for the wearable technology surge for remote patient
interaction, adopting licensing fees, and aligning our services with larger entities to become the go-to place for
remote data capture. These activities will create a sustainable infrastructure to ensure research on older adults
is keeping pace with the state-of-the-art “smart and connected” health with wearable technology."

10839987,"SINGLE CELL CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Single Cell Core will provide state-of-the-art experimental technology for single-cell multi-omic profiling. Two
major limitations of conventional scRNA-seq for immunophenotyping include the lack of correlation between
mRNA levels and surface protein expression and the lack of clonal identity from immune receptor sequence.
The Core will provide access to technologies for simultaneous profiling of mRNA, immune receptor sequence,
and surface protein expression from individual cells at scale. For experiments with limited cell numbers, we will
also provide scPLATE-seq, a fully automated platform for index sorting and scRNA-seq that is cost-effective for
low cell numbers. Given the focus on analyzing virus-specific immune responses longitudinally and across
tissues, the ability to associate immunophenotypes such as surface protein expression, the transcriptome, and
TCR sequence with antigen specificity is also highly desirable. This information will allow us to determine the
phenotypic subset and clonal identity of each cell in a virus-specific T cell population, to anchor virus-specific T
cells from different individuals, ages, and tissue sites to our reference map, and to investigate their functional
capacities with single-cell resolution. The Core will provide scalable technology for associating antigen specificity
and T cell receptor sequence with targeted mRNA and surface protein profiles of individual cells (TetTCR-

10840003,"Project Summary
Maintaining cognitive health has become a topic of increased importance with population aging, given the
criticality of cognition to quality of life and independence. Unfortunately, changes in life circumstances, health
declines, and other factors such as mobility limitations, limit opportunities for cognitive, social and activity
engagement for older adults, all of which are important to cognitive health. Virtual reality (VR) systems have
evolved, are more powerful and accessible to consumers, and present unique opportunities to foster cognitive
and social engagement among older adults in their own homes. VR systems provide an immersive and engaging
experience that give users the realistic impression of being present in a context or situation outside their home,
alone or with others. Despite the significant potential of VR, few studies have examined usability and acceptance
of VR applications or their efficacy with older adults. Further, most studies of VR involving older adults have
targeted physical functioning or cognitive rehabilitation; few have examined social or cognitive engagement
applications. Both researchers and system developers underscore the need for more rigorous research in this
area with adequate control conditions, across a wider range of VR applications, and with larger, diverse samples
of older adult populations in home settings. This highly innovative cross-site Stage 1 Intervention Development
Project (NIH Stage Model) [18] will apply the CREATE systematic approach to the design and evaluation of an
immersive VR program, Cognitive Activity Social Technology (CAST), for older adults. The program will provide a
suite of virtual cognitive, social and activity engagement applications; and allow for virtual interactions. Phase I,
akin to NIH Stage 1a [18], will involve focus groups and usability testing across the three CREATE sites with
older adults, and heuristic analysis to gather information on user preferences, usability problems, implementation,
and training protocols. Phase II, akin to NIH Stage 1b, will involve a cross-site pilot randomized trial with a large
and diverse sample of aging adults (N =216). Participants will be randomized, following a baseline assessment,
to the VR CAST condition or a table control condition, where participants will be exposed to similar context in 2d
(e.g., online museum tours). Following training on the VR program/tablet, they will use the VR program/tablet in
their home for two months. The battery of measures will be re-administered at 1 and 2-months post
randomization. The battery will include demographic and technology experience, attitudes, and proficiency
measures; measures of usability, safety/comfort, perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and measures of cognitive
abilities, social connectivity, loneliness, well-being, and quality of life. VR participants will also complete
measures of “presence” and cybersickness. We will collect real time data on use of the VR program/tablet. The
planned project represents one of the largest and most rigorously controlled study on the topic to date. It will yield
significant and timely information on the feasibility of using VR support for older adults, delineate potential
mediator and moderators of the benefits of VR, and design guidelines for VR interventions for older adults."
10839870,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Radiomics, or imaging biomarkers, are an active area of research and development that is increasing in breadth
with more widespread access to large, patient image databases. Radiomics models have been applied in a wide
range of diagnostics, classification tasks, and disease scoring; with advantages for efficient radiology workflow,
reducing errors and highlighting important features, and providing additional information in challenging diagnostic
cases. Accuracy of radiomics is dependent on a number of factors. The variability associated with the imaging
chain including the particular imaging device/vendor, acquisition protocol, data processing, etc. is undesirable
and can have a dramatic effect on a radiomics model’s performance. Successful radiomics models generally
require careful data curation and standardization of protocols – often preventing successful or efficient modeling
in large aggregations of patient data across institutions, vendors, etc. Moreover, even with careful attention to
protocol, many imaging devices, like x-ray computed-tomography CT have patient- and scan-specific image
properties that continue to add undesirable variability to a radiomics computation. In this work, we propose a
framework for end-to-end modeling of a CT imaging system – integrating radiomics calculations as an
explicit stage and imaging system output. This kind of rigorous modeling extends previous efforts to under-
stand and control the performance of imaging systems. In this context, the proposed mathematical framework
provides not only a mechanism for prediction of radiomics values based on the various system depend-
ences that degrade their accuracy; but also informs recovery approaches to estimate the underlying “true”
radiomics based on the underlying biology uncorrupted by the particular image properties (noise/resolution) of
the patient image. We hypothesize that this new paradigm for radiomics computation will both standardize met-
rics and improve quantitation. We will test these hypotheses and apply standardization methods to radiomics for
interstitial lung disease (ILD, an application where lung textures provide substantial diagnostic information about
the disease) through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a mathematical framework for radiomics
standardization, wherein both predictive “forward” models and “inverse” recovery models for ILD radiomics will
be developed, characterized, and evaluated. Aim 2: Apply and validate prediction and standardization
framework in physical systems using custom phantoms with lung textures and including a series of investiga-
tions on well-characterized CT benches and CT scanners from all major vendors. Aim 3: Investigate the impact
of standardization on radiomics modeling performance in clinical CT data. A multi-site study will establish
the performance of standardized radiomics using the proposed framework in radiomics models for both regional
and whole lung characterization. Successful completion of these aims will establish a new paradigm for stand-
ardized radiomics computation that is applied and validate in multi-site data. This opens the doors to larger, more
diverse imaging datasets and the potential for more efficient recovery of subtle imaging biomarkers."
10931689,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 15% of women in the United States are impacted by depression during or after pregnancy. Untreated
perinatal depression dramatically impairs maternal quality of life and, in its most extreme form, can lead to suicide
which remains a leading contributor to maternal mortality. Despite recognition of its importance, multiple barriers
exist in the depression care cascade. One of these barriers is the existing health system structure, wherein
obstetric and psychiatric care exists in silos and social determinants of mental health (SDoMH) are not
systematically integrated into care plans. Without a synergistic approach to the whole woman, both physically
and mentally, screening for depressive symptoms occurs inconsistently. Even when screening occurs and
depression is diagnosed, treatment is often not initiated, depressive symptoms are not tracked, and care is not
escalated with the goal of symptom remission. This lack in coordinated and personalized care has left thousands
of women vulnerable each year in the United States. Moreover, there are significant inequities in perinatal
depression care which contribute to the widening racial and ethnic disparities in quality of life, maternal morbidity,
and maternal mortality. It is imperative that we identify alternative mechanisms to adequately identify and treat
perinatal depression in an equitable manner and incorporate mental healthcare as a component of interventions
designed to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity.
The collaborative care model (CCM), when implemented in the primary care context, leads to improvements in
mental health outcomes. However, the perinatal context is unique on the patient, clinician, and systems levels.
Thus the perinatal CCM (pCCM) requires its own validation. One small (n=168), randomized trial suggests the
pCCM is efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms. Despite these data, pCCM remains rarely utilized due to
two existing gaps in the research-to-practice continuum. First, the existing efficacy data lack generalizability
needed for broad dissemination. Second, no studies have been published to inform best practices with respect
to an implementation strategies package for pCCM, with attention to the unique aspects of the perinatal context.
Moreover, while the pCCM is an equity-centered intervention, the persistent disparities observed in pregnancy
outcomes and perinatal mental health require an intentional, innovative, inclusive, anti-racist approach that builds
upon the traditional equity-centered CCM foundations and centers identification and mitigation of SDoMH.
We will leverage existing clinical algorithms and databases developed for an established and successful pCCM
to perform a rigorous stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the effect of an equity-enhanced pCCM
[COMPASS-PLUS (Collaborative Care Model for Perinatal Depression Support Services – Population-Level
Health Equity-Centered Structural Changes)] on maternal mental health outcomes and mental health disparities.
We will optimize an implementation strategy package tailored to perinatal care via a hybrid type 2
implementation-effectiveness design with the goal of broad dissemination of the pCCM."
10839964,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective antidepressant non-invasive brain stimulation
therapies for adults with major depression. However, a number of patients fail to respond despite adequate trials,
and while clinically beneficial, ECT can produce adverse cognitive effects including amnesia, executive
dysfunction, and verbal dysfluency. Previous single- and multi-site ECT-imaging investigations have been limited
by insufficient sample size and/or non-standardization of methodology. Therefore, in answer to NIMH Strategic
Objective 3.2 “Develop strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,” our investigative
teams have conducted clinical studies to develop standardized methods for acute ECT course administration,
antidepressant and cognitive measures for phenotyping, optimal neuroimaging protocols and E-field modeling,
and sophisticated analytic models to integrate and interpret the antidepressant-response and cognitive-
impairment biomarkers. In this prospective study we propose the first investigation integrating multiple units of
analysis including clinical and cognitive phenotyping, whole-brain neuroimaging, EEG, and E-field modeling to
establish the mechanisms underlying ECT-induced antidepressant response (response biomarkers) and
cognitive adverse effects (safety biomarkers), as well as to find the “sweet spot” of ECT dosing for optimal
antidepressant benefit and cognitive safety. Adult patients with major depressive disorder (n = 230) will receive
a standardized acute ECT course, complete clinical and cognitive measures and undergo structural and
functional MRI at three time points (baseline, after ECT #6, and following treatment completion) and one-month
naturalistic follow-up. All MRI data will be processed and harmonized identically at a central imaging core to
ensure uniformity. We have three primary aims: 1) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, ictal
power, and biomarkers; 2) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and antidepressant
outcomes; and 3) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes. An
exploratory aim will contrast antidepressant-response and cognitive-impairment biomarkers identified in the
current proposal with magnetic seizure therapy and healthy comparison subjects. The overarching hypothesis
of this investigation is that the E-field variability will explain antidepressant and cognitive outcomes.
Public Health Significance: Successful completion of this project will verify the optimal ECT dose (the “sweet
spot”) of 112 V/m within the right hippocampus which can then inform precision and individualization of ECT
amplitude with “E-field informed ECT”. The standardized algorithms for E-field modeling can be generalized and
widely disseminated. This proposal will result in a paradigm shift from “trial and error” approaches of ECT
parameter selection to individualized, precision dosing to improve patient outcomes."
10839965,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this research is to understand how chemokines recognize their binding partners in order
to develop new molecules that alter chemokine signaling for therapeutic benefit. Chemokines and their cell-
surface receptors form a network of signaling proteins that orchestrate the development and function of the
cellular immune system by guiding the migration of white blood cells and homing of stem cells. Many of these
proteins have been validated as drug targets for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, HIV-AIDS,
cardiovascular disease and cancer. Our previous work revealed the structural basis and functional importance
of self-association, glycosaminoglycan binding, and receptor sulfotyrosine recognition for the chemokine
CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4, and demonstrated that engineered CXCL12 variants can be used to block
cancer progression in animal models of metastatic disease. Atomic resolution details of other chemokine-
receptor complexes are needed to guide the development of new small molecule and biologic drugs. With 46
chemokine ligands and 23 receptors, the human chemokine network represents the largest GPCR family with
respect to the number of endogenous ligands and receptors. Across the chemokine family, ligand-receptor
specificity varies from strictly monogamous to highly promiscuous, but the molecular determinants of selectivity
are unknown. Until recently, details of the full chemokine-receptor interface were lacking due to the extreme
challenges presented by crystallization of active GPCR complexes. However, the availability of a rich
sequence database and multiple structures of chemokine-receptor complexes reported since the last renewal
of this R01 now enable us to address the most pressing question in the chemokine field: how is selective
promiscuity embedded in a collection of highly conserved chemokine and receptor structures? In the first
specific aim of this competing renewal application we propose a comprehensive analysis of this complex
signaling network, in order to decipher the ‘chemokine code’ governing receptor-ligand selectivity and
promiscuity. The second aim will test the hypothesis that selective chemokine promiscuity is encoded across a
broad protein-protein interface using the chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12 and their receptors ACKR3,
CXCR3 and CXCR4 as a model system to test the validity of the hierarchical model developed in aim 1. Aim 3
tackles the puzzle of extreme promiscuity in the chemokine family with the atypical receptor ACKR1 as an
experimental testbed. ACKR1/DARC is a scavenger receptor on red blood cells that binds many different
chemokines but also plays an essential role in hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. We hypothesize that
ACKR1 uses an elongated disordered N-terminal domain to bind many protein ligands with distinct but
overlapping binding sites. Completion of the work proposed here will provide a new foundation upon which the
molecular determinants of chemokine-receptor recognition can be precisely and systematically elucidated."
10839966,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Toward Connectomic Deep Brain Stimulation in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide with about 10% of patients that are
refractory to conventional treatment while suffering from substantial burden of disease. Deep Brain Stimulation
(DBS) is a treatment option for these patients, but while some respond excellently to this invasive procedure,
not all patients do. One reason could be that we conceptualize DBS to modulate a brain region, rather than a
brain network. The goal of this project is to causally link symptom specific improvements in OCD to the
stimulation of specific brain networks. By doing so, we will be able to derive symptom-specific network targets
for treatment in DBS. In our preliminary research, we identified a specific network target that was associated
with optimal response following DBS to four different surgical targets applied world-wide. Our findings were
based on the largest multi-center OCD cohort with DBS studied to date (N = 50) and have been confirmed by
four additional centers since they were published. While results are promising, three gaps remain before
moving toward prospective clinical trials. The aim of this R01 will be to close these gaps. First, we have defined
optimal networks by means of structural and functional connectivity but, so far, it remains unclear which of
these two modalities (or a combination of both) is best suited to guide DBS. Second, while modulating the
network leads to optimal response on a group level, OCD is a heterogeneous disease and symptoms in each
patient are different. We will determine which specific symptoms (obsessions, compulsions, depression and
anxiety) map to which specific components of the network. This will pave the way to personalize DBS and to
define symptom-specific targets tailored to individual patients. Third, while most of our preliminary research is
based on normative connectome atlases of the human brain, connectomes of patients with OCD present with
individual differences. We will test how much additional variance in clinical outcomes can be explained when
using patient-specific instead of normative connectomes. Completion of these aims will validate and refine our
OCD response network. If successful, this study will facilitate future trials directly targeting our brain circuit with
DBS for OCD."
10830299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application builds upon the expertise in my laboratory to develop and apply foundational methods for
analyzing and engineering cell signaling in human health. The overall vision of our research program is to create
tools that enable more detailed mechanistic understanding of signaling processes that can further facilitate the
design of more effective therapies. The broad goals for the next five years are to develop tools that will provide
novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions and to analyze signaling dynamics
that arise when conflicting receptor signals are simultaneously activated. In receptor biology, there is an implicit
bias in what receptors are biochemically characterized: only those proteins that can be stably expressed in
functional form are amenable to established biochemical assays that are used to identify the molecular basis for
interaction with ligands. However, there are major classes of receptors that are biologically and clinically
important but have proven highly recalcitrant in their heterologous expression. We propose to develop alternative
methodologies to overcome conventional expression challenges, facilitate paratope mapping, and enable
receptor re-engineering to alter ligand specificity. In ligand biology, there are established high-throughput
methods for parsing the contributions of individual amino acids to receptor binding but not corresponding
approaches for determining whether amino acids contribute to signal transmission. We propose to develop a
methodologies that will enable mapping of a signaling ‘hot spot’ on a ligand and enable rapid engineering of
novel agonists and antagonists. Finally, the initiation of signals via cell-surface receptors must be viewed through
a holistic lens in order to understand the ultimate effect on cell response. This is most effectively illustrated by
considering the simultaneous application of two ligands that, individually, drive mutually exclusive outcomes on
a given cell, which is an underappreciated, but common, problem that cells in the body most resolve. Through a
combination of quantitative experiments and computational modeling, this cellular ‘conflict resolution’ will be
analyzed, providing new insights into the robust functioning of signal transduction networks. Collectively,
advances in all of these areas will provide essential new tools for answering fundamental biological questions
relevant to human health while also facilitating the design of novel molecular and cellular therapeutics for the
treatment of a range of diseases."

Our research program aims to understand how cells control intracellular signaling to respond and adapt to their
environments. We will focus on three processes: Project 1 will examine the chemotactic migration of cells in
extracellular chemical gradients, Project 2 will look at DNA repair after oxidative, genotoxic, and mechanical
stress, and Project 3 will investigate the reprogramming of cell proliferation signaling in response to receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibition.
Project 1: GTPases are crucial for signal transduction in many cellular activities. Recently, we discovered an
unforeseen, evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which GDP-bound Rho GTPase activates mTORC2, a
critical serine/threonine kinase, in Dictyostelium and human cells. We will investigate the fundamental
mechanism underlying this novel regulation of small GTPases using the robust chemotactic signaling in
Dictyostelium cells as a discovery tool supported by an array of cutting-edge technologies. Successful
outcomes will broadly impact tissue development, wound healing, neuronal wiring, and immune responses, as
chemotaxis is crucial for these essential processes.
Project 2: PTEN protects the genome from stress in the nucleus. PTEN accumulates in the nucleus upon
stress via ubiquitin signaling. Identifying the ubiquitin ligase that controls PTEN after stress represents a critical
knowledge gap in our understanding of PTEN's stress signaling. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we
will comprehensively test the function of E3 ligases under various forms of stress, such as oxidative, genotoxic,
and mechanical stress. We will subsequently investigate how stress regulates the ubiquitin ligases.
Project 3: Cells can adapt to unfavorable surroundings and weakened physiology by rearranging signal
transduction pathways. We will analyze how cells alter signaling networks when the activity of vital signaling
components is inhibited using innovative approaches, including AI-based multiplexed biosensor barcoding. We
focus on the EGF receptor, which is essential for physiology and development. Outcomes will reveal the basic
mechanisms by which cells can rewire signal transduction pathways and bypass the inhibition of essential
signaling elements."

10850715,"Microbial communities drive important biogeochemical cycles, from the ocean to the soil to the human gut. High
rates of cell turnover provide these ecosystems with an enormous potential for rapid evolutionary change: billions
of new mutations are produced within each of our gut microbiota every day. We and others have recently shown
that these genetic changes can sweep through resident populations of gut bacteria on timescales ranging from
a few months to a few days. This rapid pace of evolution is hypothesized to have important practical
consequences, from the spread of antibiotic resistance mutations to the success of fecal microbiome transplants
and other personalized therapies. Despite the potential importance of these effects, we currently know very little
about the evolutionary forces that operate within complex communities like the gut microbiota, or how they
influence (or are influenced by) the composition of the surrounding community. A central challenge is that we
lack a population genetic framework for predicting how mutations spread in communities with large numbers of
ecologically interacting strains. This limits our ability to predict how microbiota will evolve in response to
environmental perturbations such as drugs or diet, or to interpret functional changes that we observe in these
communities over time. My lab aims to address this gap in our understanding by combining biophysical and
population genetic modeling with the development of computational tools for measuring in situ evolution in both
natural and synthetic gut communities. Our long-term goal is to decipher the population genetic “rules” that
govern the short-term evolution of the gut microbiota, and to use these insights to guide future experimental and
therapeutic efforts. In the next five years, we will pursue this goal through a multi-pronged strategy: First, we will
develop new time-series methods for analyzing the trajectories of linked mutations in longitudinally sampled
human gut metagenomes. These methods will allow us to address key open questions about the strength and
duration of natural selection on sweeping genetic variants, and whether they are correlated with broader shifts
in taxonomic or functional composition. Second, we will develop new methods for leveraging widely deployed
transposon insertion libraries to measure the rates and fitness effects of spontaneous beneficial mutations in
vivo in ex-germ-free mice, and we will quantify for the first time how this landscape varies across species, diets,
and community contexts. Finally, to interpret these new data and to craft driving hypotheses, we will develop a
mechanistic modeling framework for predicting how ecological diversity influences short-term evolutionary
dynamics in highly diverse communities that compete for common metabolites. Together, this work will provide
unprecedented insight into the short-term evolution of our gut microbiota, and will constitute a crucial step toward
the development of truly predictive models of microbial community dynamics."

The Immunogenomics and Systems Biology Core (ISCB) at University of Michigan will support the data analytics,
management, and disease translation to meet the goals of the entire AMP AIM Network. The ISCB will be based
on our extensive experience in the development of genetics and systems biology approaches, working with a
broad range of multi-omics data including genetic, epigenetic, single-cell and spatial-seq data, to increase our
understanding of the factors that contribute to disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity. The premise of our
approach is that integrating genetic information with other -omic data, collected through the AMP AIM Network,
will facilitate and accelerate discovery of critical pathogenic mechanisms and help unravel the biologic processes
contributing to disease heterogeneity. This approach will utilize advanced analytical approaches in causal
mechanism inference, modeling and single cell and spatial genomics data integration. To achieve this we will i)
deploy highly customized, scalable, and robust data processing capabilities and standardized pipelines for
curation, processing, management, and sharing of multi-omics and integrated clinical datasets; ii) build
comprehensive disease specific roadmaps, and define shared and unique molecular mechanisms of AMP AIM
target diseases utilizing statistical genetics and genomics approaches; iii) identify, characterize, and refine
biomarkers shaping disease heterogeneity and intervention response by integrating multi-omics and clinical data
through statistical and computational modeling."
10850982,"Amblyopia is widespread form of human visual disability caused by a disparity in visual quality between the
two eyes during early postnatal life. This disparity drives ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex to
favor the stronger eye at the expense of the weaker (amblyopic) eye. Consequently, synapses in the visual
cortex downstream of the amblyopic eye are weakened, a process that is difficult to reverse unless
treatment is initiated during infancy or early childhood. Recent work in animal models has suggested
several strategies for promoting recovery from amblyopia. While the pathophysiology underlying amblyopia
has been well studied, the synaptic, cellular, and circuit changes underlying recovery are less clear. This
proposal focuses on a treatment strategy that rapidly promotes visual recovery following experimental
amblyopia via temporary inactivation of the retinas. A temporary period of retinal inactivation leads of a
stable enhancement of visual cortical responses once vision is restored. The previous mentored research
focused on understanding how retinal inactivation promotes recovery at through synaptic and cellular
plasticity in the primary visual cortex. The current proposal shifts the focus to how recovery manifests in the
statistics of neural activity within visual circuits, and whether this recovery can be controlled through
reproducing these activity regimes. The long- term objective of this research is to understand how cortical
plasticity is engaged to promote recovery and to inform clinical interventions for treating human amblyopia."
10851441,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Dissecting the non-growing-but-active state of a hybrid bacteria-material microdevice
Recent work has been interested in engineering commensal bacteria to address various biomedical
challenges, such as specific drug delivery, gene-editing using CRISPR-Cas, and continuous synthesis of drugs
at disease sites. In contrast to non-living devices, bacteria can address these unmet needs because they
already live in the human body and at disease sites, move actively towards stimuli, detect and respond to
stimuli, and synthesize drugs continuously. However, a significant challenge is to prevent the uncontrolled
proliferation of bacteria, while keeping their active functions. To address the challenge, the community must
have a foolproof safety measure that prevents the replication of therapeutic bacteria in any condition. This
measure will ensure that the bacteria cannot replicate in patients and the large ecosystem. Without replication,
mutation is also rare, and mutants cannot spread. Furthermore, a non-replicating entity can be dosed more
precisely than an auto-replicating entity. Thus far, however, attempts to stop bacterial replication also
compromise the therapeutic activity of bacteria. To address this critical bottleneck, my lab has created bacteria
that cannot grow but keep high metabolism by integrating synthetic materials with bacteria. The non-growing-
but-active bacteria continue to synthesize proteins, move, and respond to chemical stimuli. My research will
further investigate the underlying mechanisms that govern the non-growing-but-active state of the bacteria.
The new understanding will then be used to boost and enable specific features of the non-growing-but-active
bacteria relevant for future biomedical applications. I will leverage my prior work about synthetic gene
expression, bacterial information processing, and CRISPR-dCas9 molecular tools. The work will reveal a new
material-protein paradigm for inhibiting growth but preserving the activity of living cells. Furthermore, the work
will enable a superior, safe, and active hybrid bacteria-material microdevice for broad biomedical applications."
10836071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) causes death or neurological disability in up to 50% of those affected and is
particularly devastating in people living with HIV (PLHIV). There is an urgent need to improve therapy as current
first-line TBM treatment, including standard dose rifampin (10 mg/kg daily), results in low concentrations in the
Central Nervous System (CNS). In HARVEST, a phase III trial in Uganda, South Africa, and Indonesia, we
currently test whether high dose (35 mg/kg) rifampin will reduce mortality and disability compared to standard
dose (10 mg/kg) rifampin in people with TBM. HARVEST will answer key clinical research questions, but
important knowledge gaps are not directly addressed. There is scanty data on exposure to first-line TB drugs in
the CNS and the extent to which this is influenced by brain injury and inflammation and drug transport
mechanisms. Optimal targets for drug exposure are lacking and it is unknown whether patient subgroups, such
as PLHIV, critically ill patients or pediatric patients, require tailored doses of TB drugs. It is also unknown whether
higher doses of rifampin require a change in dose of co-administered antiretroviral drugs in PLHIV.
 We propose HARVEST-PK to test our central hypothesis that plasma and CNS concentrations of TB drugs
are the key intermediary link between administered doses and disease outcome. We will measure concentrations
of TB/HIV drugs as well as inflammatory and brain injury markers in carefully timed and collected samples from
HARVEST and apply state-of-the-art modelling and simulation techniques to build a comprehensive exposure-
response model that will fill aforementioned knowledge gaps. More specifically, we will define the relationship
between administered doses and concentrations achieved (pharmacokinetics, PK), identify predictors of TB drug
exposure and CNS drug entry, and elucidate the relationship between TB drug concentrations achieved and
response (pharmacodynamics, PD). HARVEST-PK will determine critical exposure thresholds associated with
improved TBM survival and identify corresponding optimal drug doses in adult TBM patients and patient
subgroups. Finally, HARVEST-PK aims to demonstrate that high dose rifampin compared to standard dose
rifampin does not significantly compromise exposure to anti-retroviral drugs, and does not impact virological
outcomes in TBM patients living with HIV.
 HARVEST-PK uniquely leverages our existing phase III TBM trial to gain key pharmacological insight in the
PK-PD of TB drugs in TBM treatment. This will result in the identification of optimal exposure targets for high
dose rifampin and other drugs in adults and children with TBM. Members of our consortium have studied TBM
in Asia and Africa for more than 15 years and we have a longstanding interest in optimization of TBM treatment
based on PK and PD principles. HARVEST-PK will enable optimal dosing recommendations based on PK and
PK-PD evaluations, which seeks to impact U.S. and international treatment guidelines."

 This proposal directly addresses a high-priority research topic, “Enabling precision medicine for
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias through deep molecular phenotyping”, for PAR-19-070, Research
on Current Topics in Alzheimer's Disease and Its Related Dementias, by beginning to develop precision dietary
approaches for AD prevention through integrating multiple molecular data types. The potential for healthy
dietary patterns to maintain cognitive health is supported by cohort studies and a randomized trial. However,
these healthy dietary patterns were developed based on population averages and may not be best suited for a
given individual. Preliminary data from our group and others support the rationale to study personalized
approaches tailored to individual gut microbiomes to improve dietary prevention of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD).
However, no study has examined modifying and mediating roles of the gut microbiome in the diet-cognition
association. The few human studies of the gut microbiome in AD were limited by small size, cross-sectional
design, and lack of high-resolution microbial functional profiling. This background supports our central
hypotheses that 1) healthy dietary patterns contribute to cognitive health partly through modulating the gut
microbiome; and 2) associations of the dietary patterns with cognitive function vary by individuals’ gut microbial
profiles. This proposal represents a highly cost-efficient, prospective study leveraging existing fecal
samples/microbiome data and cognitive function assessments in three studies with complementary strengths
in study design, and diet and outcome assessments: the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII, n =1,500) with
decades-long repeated dietary assessments and extended follow-up, the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) Trial with randomized dietary interventions (n =604), and the ASPREE-XT
Study (n =13,000) with adjudicated incident AD endpoints. To gain more advanced mechanistic insights, we
will take a multi’omic approach to combine shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to profile the
microbial composition and enzymatic function, and fecal metabolomics to measure the microbiome metabolic
activity. We will investigate roles of gut microbial composition and enzymatic function in the associations of the
Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and the MIND Diet with cognitive function (Aim 1) and examine the
interrelationships among the two healthy dietary patterns, the metabolic activity of the gut microbiome and
cognitive function (Aim 2) in the NHSII. We will replicate findings from Aims 1 and 2 in ASPREE-XT and the
MIND Trial (Aim 3). This project will generate reproducible, translational evidence on gut microbial and fecal
metabolomic features that explain inter-individual heterogeneity in response to healthy dietary patterns and
provide foundational knowledge for maximizing the benefits of dietary approaches, discovering novel predictive
biomarkers, and ultimately contributing to precision prevention of AD."

The goal of this research is to make a class of RNA aptamers that act as AMPA receptor inhibitors, and
test the efficacy and safety of these aptamers in a mouse model. These RNA aptamers could become a
new, potential drug candidate for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain,
brainstem and spinal cord. Currently none of ALS drugs effectively alters the disease course. Developing
better inhibitors to control the excessive AMPA receptor activity is a promising strategy for the discovery
of new and more effective ALS drugs. This is because Ca2+ influx through abnormally expressed, Ca2+-
permeable AMPA receptors in motor neurons leads to selective cell death. Riluzole, one of the two FDA-
approved ALS drugs, actually has anti-glutamatergic properties. Using an in vitro evolution approach, we
have identified a group of 14 potent RNA aptamers targeting AMPA receptors. These aptamers are more
potent, highly selective and water soluble, as compared with conventional small-molecule inhibitors.
These properties should enable us to use aptamers at the lowest dose possible to achieve therapeutic
efficacy by more tightly and selectively blocking AMPA receptor activities in vivo with minimal or even no
dose-dependent side effects. The hypothesis to be tested is that a combination of using aptamers as
better AMPA receptor antagonists and testing them in the AR2 mouse model will allow us to assess the
therapeutic efficacy and safety of our aptamers. The AR2 mouse is a unique animal model where an
abnormally Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor subunit is expressed in motor neurons, causing eventual cell
death. Thus, the AR2 mouse model is ideal to test our AMPA receptor aptamers in blocking abnormal
AMPA receptor activity. In Aim 1, we propose to make a large quantity for each of the 14 chemically
modified aptamers. These aptamers will be pure, stable and biologically functional assayed by whole-cell
recording. In Aim 2, we will test each of these 14 aptamers, both individually and in combination, in first
in AR2 mice. Aptamers will be administrated through intracerebroventricular injection to bypass the blood-
brain barrier. Aptamer-treated and -untreated mice will be compared for changes in TDP-43
immunohistochemistry, behaviors, loss of motor neurons and body weight, and survival rate to assess
the efficacy and the safety of the aptamers. The outcome of this research is to identify a set of aptamers
that are efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. If successful, this research should lay ground work for clinical
testing of some of these aptamers as a potential new ALS therapy."
10837707,"Preterm birth indicates an end to the rich fetal supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Arachidonic Acid (ARA) which are a critical building blocks for brain and eye development and an important inflammatory modulator. Yet, for almost 40 years, enteral supplementation of DHA and ARA to replace lost fetal accretion has failed to translate into long-standing clinical benefit. The failure to understand the metabolism and induced molecular changes of fatty acid supplementation during the postnatal period has led to erroneous assumptions and replacement strategies that are, at best, not clinical beneficial and, at worst, harmful. The overall study objective of this proposal is to investigate the induced metabolism and downstream molecular mechanisms of enteral DHA and ARA supplementation from birth to 36 weeks' postnatal age in the extremely preterm infant. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in neonatal-perinatal medicine and biostatistics/bioinformatics. The team of neonatologists are clinical and research leaders in nutrition, growth, and fatty acids and represents five level III/IV neonatal intensive care units with diverse demographic populations. We hypothesize that metabolism of DHA and ARA enteral supplementation is developmentally regulated and the impact of lipid derived metabolites on biology is dependent on the health state of the infant (context specificity). To interrogate our hypothesis, we propose a multi-center, randomized clinical trial to evaluate lipidomic actions of combined DHA and ARA supplementation from birth to 36 weeks postmenstrual age in 280 extremely low gestational age newborns born between 25 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks of gestation. The following aims will be evaluated: Aim 1 – Identify the impact of combined enteral DHA and ARA supplementation on fatty acid metabolism including derivation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and oxylipin production and, Aim 2 – Determine the multisystemic change in circulating markers of inflammation and organ development and integrity as a function of enteral DHA/ARA supplementation. Successful completion of these aims will define developmentally regulated fatty acid metabolism in the immature host and impact of fatty acid supplementation on critical biological functions. Mechanistic data is required to bridge the scientific gap to appropriate clinical translation that is effective and safe. These data will inform a biologically rational approach to fatty acid delivery in preterm infants and identify molecular read-outs that may serve as biomarkers in future trials of clinical efficacy."

discoveries into actions that improve digestive health of people and populations and who will assume
leadership roles in digestive disease epidemiology and health services research. Trainees are at the
postdoctoral level: a mixture of MDs and PhDs supported for 2 years. The program places strong emphasis
on epidemiology and health services research, the rationale being the critical need for “bench to bedside”
translational research. There is also a need for “bedside to clinic”, or “efficacy to effectiveness, and patient
centered comparative effectiveness” translational or outcomes research. The mentors (3 MDs, 3 MD/MPH, 1
MD/MSHS, 2 MD/PhD and 3 PhDs) represent a multidisciplinary group of experienced investigators from
various departments at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), all with well-funded research programs that cover
broad areas of clinical research including epidemiology (e.g., clinical, molecular, genetic, and microbiome),
health services research, decision making, and implementation research related to several digestive
disorders. Existing faculty members have outstanding mentoring histories, and excellent track records of
participation in our training program activities. The Program Director, Hashem B El-Serag, MD, MPH, will
continue on the grant, and Dr. Fasiha Kanwal, MD, MSHS will join as co-Director. They will jointly maintain
ultimate authority for the program and manage day-to-day operations. Together, they will coordinate
recruitment and selection of candidates, oversee the curriculum, and be responsible for the selection and
evaluation of the mentoring team. Major administrative decisions (e.g., selection of trainees) are handled by
the Training Advisory Committee, composed of the Program Director, co-Director, and three other program
faculty. Trainees have individual research mentoring committees, must prepare a written research proposal
to be defended to the committee, and have periodic reviews that include academic and career assessment.
Trainees attend and present at a weekly research seminar series and a monthly journal club. They are
selected from a highly competitive applicant pool that already exists at BCM. In the past 4 years, admission
to the program has been very competitive, and all available slots were filled with high quality candidates.
The trainees have performed well, with the two post-doctoral graduates obtaining master’s degrees in Public
Health, remaining in academia, publishing several first author original research papers in peer reviewed
journals and presenting at national research conferences. The current proposal includes new features
designed to enrich and enhance the existing program, including new mentors, the creation of two distinct
training tracks (epidemiology and health services research), and the expansion of enrichment activities,
such as team training, a monthly seminar on success in academic careers, and a wellness program."
10837709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Educational attainment, often conceptualized and measured as a human capital attribute, is one of the strongest
predictors of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) among older adults and perhaps the most
important protective factor against cognitive impairment and dementia. Recently documented declines in
prevalence and incidence of dementia have been attributed to historical increases in educational attainment. As
trends in rising educational attainment slow, it is expected that reductions in the prevalence of ADRD will as well.
While it is true that variability in levels of educational attainment has diminished over time, older adults
experienced vastly different educational contexts across birth cohorts and by race, particularly Black older adults
who grew up in the U.S. South. Consider that from 1920 to 1980, per-pupil spending increased 6-fold, funding
allocation became more evenly split between state and local governments, and de jure school segregation was
declared unconstitutional. Thus, even if educational attainment remains steady in more recent cohorts, inequities
in early life educational contexts may serve to differentiate individuals in their risk for cognitive impairment and
dementia. Our project addresses this neglected area of dementia research by addressing four questions: (1)
what were the state and local educational contexts experienced by Black and White older adults across birth
cohorts; (2) does education operate differently to reduce risk for cognitive impairment or dementia when it is
attained under more (or less) advantaged educational contexts among Black and White older adults; (3) do life
course pathways encompassing occupation, marriage, behavior, and health explain the relationship between
educational contexts and cognitive impairment and dementia and does this vary by educational attainment; and
(4) how does state-level variation in the timing of school desegregation efforts and in the extent of court mandated
desegregation orders relate to cognitive impairment among Black and White older adults who lived in the U.S.
South during school? We will answer these questions through the creation of a rich, longitudinal data resource
of state and local educational contexts that we will link to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally
representative longitudinal study of U.S. adults over 50. We will estimate variation in these relationships by birth
cohort and race. Expected outcomes of this study include (a) the development of the Education Contextual Data
Resource (ECDR) that we will make available to the scientific community to answer other timely questions about
educational contexts and ADRD, significantly expanding the reach of our project’s impact; and (b) insights into
broader population trends in ADRD prevalence and racial disparities in ADRD, allowing us to identify the
subgroups at greatest risk for cognitive impairment and dementia."

Novel method for constructing axially chiral N-heterocyclic molecules can have a
significant impact on the manufacture of pharmaceutical-active compounds and other
useful organic complexes. Our research program will develop a visible light induced
catalytic reaction approach that leads to the direct formation of chiral N-heterocycles that
were otherwise challenging to produce. The approach uses chiral semiconductor
perovskite materials as the catalyst which are directly derived from well-explored solar
cell materials that are bench-top achievable and economical to produce. In the proposed
strategy, organic substrates approach perovskite’s chiral surface for charge transfer,
leading to the key step for discriminate chiral configuration and thereby resulting in a
direct light-induced asymmetric ring-closure reaction. The unprecedented reaction
strategy described here is among the first of its kind, has the potential to introduce a wide
range of new asymmetric reactions for important axially chiral bio-relevant compounds,
and may be considered reliable linchpin reactions suitable for pharmaceutical synthesis."
10828796,"Chronic viral infections remain major threats to global health, with pathogens such as hepatitis B virus (HBV)
responsible for millions of deaths annually. Despite availability of an HBV vaccine and suppressive antiviral
treatment, the worldwide burden of chronic HBV infection has remained unchanged. Short-term therapies
capable of producing at least functional cure for chronic HBV are therefore a high priority. Exhaustion of the
immune system, most obvious in HBV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, is a key factor in HBV persistence and
disease. The PD-1:PD-L1/2 inhibitory receptor pathway regulates many key aspects of cellular immunity,
including T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancer. Blockade of this pathway has produced dramatic
effects in the treatment of advanced cancer and unleashed an immunotherapeutic revolution. However, little is
known about the effect of PD-1 blockade in chronic infections in humans, the mechanisms by which responses
are invigorated, and how a reinvigorated HBV immune response impacts the intrahepatic HBV replication
landscape. We propose to comprehensively investigate how blockade of PD-1 in humans affects the layers of
molecular regulation of the antiviral immune response, and how this impacts viral replication in situ. The overall
hypothesis of this project is that blocking PD-1 in humans will alter the magnitude, quality, regulation and
composition of pre-existing antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, leading to more effective viral control, will
modulate other aspects of cellular innate immunity, notably macrophages, and will lead to diminished viral
replication in hepatocytes. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will
test whether and how PD-1 therapy invigorates exhausted virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses
in the blood and liver. We will utilize liver fine needle aspirates and PBMC samples for a comprehensive and
in-depth analysis of changes in the phenotype, function, clonal composition, and transcriptional state of HBV-
specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. In Aim 2 we will test whether PD-1 therapy diminishes active HBV
transcription in hepatocytes. Using an integrated platform of single-cell laser capture microdissection and
droplet digital PCR on frozen liver tissues, we will quantify cccDNA and pre-genomic HBV RNA in hundreds of
individual hepatocytes from participants before and at the completion of PD-1 blockade. Finally, in Aim 3 we
will define the recovery of macrophages through PD-1 blockade in persons with chronic HBV infection.
Here using FNA and PBMCs from patients with chronic HBV, we will assess whether αPD-1 treatment shifts the
composition of macrophage populations toward an antiviral phenotype and test whether the functional
responsiveness of monocyte/macrophages correlates with αPD-1 treatment outcome. Collectively, we expect
these data to dramatically enhance our understanding of the mechanism of αPD-1 mediated immune recovery
that can be utilized not only for the design of pathogen-specific immunotherapy, but also to enable further
improvements in the efficacy of immunotherapy in general."
10828799,"RNA interference (RNAi) was originally described as a gene silencing mechanism triggered by the experimental
introduction of double stranded (ds)RNA into the nematode C. elegans (Fire et al., 1998). The term RNAi now refers
to a diverse set of gene-regulatory mechanisms that share common features, including the involvement of short 21- to
30-nucleotide (nt) RNAs and protein cofactors of the Argonaute (RNase H-related) protein family. As an
experimental tool, RN Ai is of broad relevance to basic biomedical research, and RN Ai therapeutics are now approved
and under development for several clinical applications. RNAi-related mechanisms function in conserved generegulato1y
pathways that are of basic and fundamental importance to human cellular and developmental biology.
Remarkably, RNAi-related mechanisms in C.elegans keep inventory of all mRNAs and license gene expression in the
germline, passing this information via the egg and sperm from one generation to the next. Distinct Argonaute
pathways function in the transgenerational inheritance of small-RNA signals that constitute the CSR-1
""self'/protective (RNAa pathway) and the WAGO ""non-self'/silencing (RNAe pathway). A third Argonaute pathway,
the PRG-1/Piwi pathway scans germline mRNA for foreign sequences. Aim 1 will explore how these Argonaute
pathways identify their targets and recruit downstream factors. Aim 2 will investigate how these Argonaute pathways
interact to mediate genome-wide transcriptional surveillance. And finally, Aim 3 will use genetic screens to identify
new genes required for RNAi and the related RNAe, RNAa, and newly identified ""intronless-silencing"" pathways.
The ability to combine classical genetics with technology, including deep-sequencing, facile CRlSPR-mediated
genome editing, and proteomics, make C. elegans an ideal system for these studies. The mechanisms and protein
families that mediate RNAi are highly conserved in animals and therefore insights from the proposed studies will be
directly relevant to human biology and disease. These studies will shed light on an ancient gene-regulatory mechanism
whose correlates in humans are likely to play important conserved roles in the protection of the human genome and
the maintenance of stem cells."
10828802,"ABSTRACT
Hypertension is a leading cause of global mortality and is the primary modifiable risk factor for renal and
cardiovascular disease. In 50% of patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure increases in response to
salt. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying salt-sensitive hypertension remain poorly understood. Our studies
in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats have shown that proteinuria is indicative of the initiation of salt-sensitive
hypertension, whereas renal inflammation is involved in the amplification of the disease. To date, the link
between proteinuria and renal inflammation in salt-sensitive hypertension has not been elucidated, moreover the
mechanisms by which renal T-cells amplify salt-sensitive hypertension have not been fully determined. Based
on our previous work and preliminary data we hypothesize that exposure of the renal tubule to excess protein
(proteinuria) causes its “inflammatory activation” and the release of the chemokines CCL4 and CCL5. We
anticipate that this tubular production of CCL4 and CCL5 initiates renal inflammation by attracting CCR1 and
CCR5 positive immune cells to regions of injury. We hypothesize that once in the kidney, T-cells amplify
hypertension by promoting renal injury, sodium retention and oxidative stress. Therefore, we predict that
antagonism of CCR1 and CCR5 may provide a novel treatment for hypertension. Our hypothesis is supported
by our compelling preliminary data indicating: 1) overexpression of CCL4 and CCL5 and their receptors, CCR1
and CCR5 in the hypertensive kidney of SS rats, 2) localization of CCL4 and CCL5 in the renal tubules of salt-
sensitive rats fed high-salt for 12-days and 3) increased p67phox (indicative of oxidative stress) and col1a1
(indicative of fibrosis) in the kidneys of SS rats with T-cells relative to those without, in the absence of differences
in blood pressure. This proposal has two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the role of the chemokines CCL4 and
CCL5 and their receptors CCR1 and CCR5 in the initiation of renal inflammation during the development of salt-
sensitive hypertension. 2. Use a unique pressure-matching approach in salt-sensitive (SSCD247+/+) and T-cell
deficient (SSCD247-/-) rats to isolate the pathological effects of renal T-cells, in vivo, on renal function."

The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, is pleased
to submit an application for funding assistance under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings (R13 Clinical Trial Not Allowed), FOA Number: PAR-
19-306.
The NEHA Annual Educational Conference (AEC) & Exhibition was first held on June 25, 1937, and
there have since been 85 AECs convened in North America, including Hawaii, Alaska, Rhode Island,
and Canada. The AEC is designed to train, educate, and advance environmental health professionals
by providing the means to build a network of colleagues, exchange information, and discover new, best,
and practical solutions to food safety and other environmental health issues. The AEC brings together
over 1,400 state, local, tribal, territorial, and federal environmental health and public health
professionals from health and environmental protection agencies, as well as from the private sector,
academia, the uniformed services, and international jurisdictions. The AEC provides a means to
translate field-based research into action on retail food safety, program standards conformance,
foodborne outbreak prevention, data and technology, emergency preparedness, and much more. Like
many others, NEHA transitioned to a hybrid format in recent years out of necessity, yet we have
continued the virtual component because of our commitment to small, rural and frontier environmental
health programs that are otherwise unable to travel.
The vision of the Office of Regulatory Affairs within FDA is that “all food is safe…and the public health
is advanced and protected,” as well as its mission to protect consumers and enhance public health by
maximizing compliance and minimizing risk, aligns with our mission to build, sustain, and empower an
effective environmental health workforce. Both missions are embodied in the AEC.
We request funding assistance to develop, administer, and conduct the AEC. NEHA anticipates an
annual estimated cost of $750,000–$850,000 per year over the next 5 years and requests funding to
off-set the virtual platform and audio/visual costs necessary to provide high-quality education to meet
the current and evolving needs of environmental health professionals who can attend in person and
those participating remotely."
10828725,"Cytoplasmic protein accumulations of the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43 are found in affected neurons in
almost all instances of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and approximately 50% of frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). Nuclear clearance of TDP-43 has been widely observed in affected neurons in sporadic
ALS/FTD, evidence strongly supporting the proposal that TDP-43 loss of function is a key aspect of disease
mechanism underlying ALS/FTD pathogenesis. We have identified that the mRNA encoding stathmin-2 is 1) an
essential factor for axonal regeneration of axotomized iPSC-derived motor neurons and 2) the mRNA most
affected by reduction in TDP-43 function, with a striking loss from motor neurons in sporadic ALS and inherited
disease from GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72. Stathmin-2 is an abundant, direct binding partner of α/β-tubulin
dimers in neuronal perikarya, axons, growth cones, and synapses, including neuromuscular junctions (NMJs).
Using genome editing, we will identify the mechanism of TDP-43-dependent premature polyadenylation/cryptic
splicing that suppresses stathmin-2 synthesis when TDP-43 levels are lowered. We will use genome editing of
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived human motor neurons grown in compartmented chambers (that
separate neuronal cell bodies, axons and growth cones) to determine how stathmin-2 functions in a) motor
neuron maintenance/repair, b) axonal microtubule stabilization and/or dynamics, c) neuromuscular junction
formation and/or stabilization, and d) how palmitoylation of stathmin-2 affects its axonal function(s). Genome
wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens using flow cytometry and optical methods will be undertaken to identify factors that
control stathmin-2 synthesis or accumulation. Finally, we will determine the consequences in mice of reduction
or loss of stathmin-2 on motor neuron function and muscle innervation/denervation and whether reduction in
stathmin-2 synergizes with TDP-43 mutation to drive motor neuron disease. Outcomes of these efforts will
provide key insights for understanding basic aspects of axonal and synaptic neurobiology and for evaluating
whether maintaining or restoring stathmin-2 is an attractive therapeutic option in sporadic ALS/FTD and
ALS from its most frequent genetic cause, repeat expansion in C9orf72."
10828884,"Abstract:
Inflammation is a defense mechanism triggered by innate immune system against any foreign invasion to restore
homeostasis, but when it sustains for a prolonged period of several months to years, it transforms into a chronic
condition resulting in several harmful diseases. The inflammasome is a hetero-multimeric protein complex known
for activating inflammatory caspases followed by subsequent processing of cytokines, which makes it one of the
key players during inflammation. Abnormal activation of inflammasomes can initiate undesirable inflammatory
responses associated with the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases. Several studies have investigated
nanomaterial interactions with immune cells to understand their role in various biological applications and tailor
them to different needs. Indeed, several types of nanomaterials have been widely explored to target the immune
cells at the disease site to modulate the immune responses. However, our recent studies and several recent
reports suggest that many of these nanomaterials activate inflammasomes in immune cells non-specifically,
potentially exacerbating the disease. But the comprehensive characterization of the nanomaterial-immune cell
interactions that results in inflammasome activation and the unwanted innate immune response is poorly studied
due to a lack of appropriate investigative tools. The overall vision of my research program is to design
immunoengineering platforms bridging nanoscience and engineering design with manipulation of the immune
system to address fundamental and translational questions in immunology. We focus on developing effective
immunotherapy strategies by understanding the interactions between different immune system components,
between various nanomaterials and immune cells. Specifically, we aim to address fundamental questions in
inflammasome biology and how nanomaterial properties affect their interactions with innate immune cells and
inflammasome activation. To accomplish this, we propose to engineer a library of multiparametric polymeric
nanomaterial platform with various surface and core characteristics in a single system. This will allow us to test
the effect of these nanomaterial properties on inflammasome activation, tweaking one property at a time to
develop nanomaterial structure-property-function relationships. We have developed novel high-throughput
imaging platform to enable monitoring of inflammasome activation in real time. We have also engineered novel
imaging probes to monitor inflammasome activation in vivo in real time. Using these tools, over next five years,
we aim to understand the interactions between nanomaterials (polymer-based) and immune cells (macrophages,
monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils) in the context of inflammasome activation and uncover the
mechanisms of this activation in vitro and in vivo. In summary, the information obtained from these studies could
provide design criteria that guide the development of next-generation of nanomaterials to control, prevent or
mitigate inflammasome signaling pathways and also provide a predictive framework for modulation of the
inflammasome activation for potential applications in diagnostics and therapy."
10828885,"Currently, almost 10% of the US population (over 30 million people) suffer from type 1 or type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM or T2DM) and more than 30% have pre-diabetes. Approximately 1.4 million children and adults
have T1DM. Because the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, because both T1DM and T2DM markedly
increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and because CVD events occur at younger ages in patients
with diabetes, it is critical to understand how diabetes increases CVD risk and how CVD can be prevented.
Patients with increased CVD risk are generally treated with statins to lower LDL cholesterol. However, even
with statin treatment, patients with diabetes have residual CVD risk and a greater incidence of heart attack and
stroke than subjects without diabetes. This residual CVD risk in patients with T2DM and elevated triglycerides
(TGs) has been linked to abnormal metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). However, TG levels are
normal in most T1DM patients, and current dogma maintains that TRLs do not drive CVD risk in these patients.
We hypothesize that plasma TGs do not accurately reflect levels of the atherogenic remnant lipoprotein
particles (RLPs) derived from VLDL or chylomicrons because RLPs and small VLDL contain much less TG
than do TRLs. We have developed a new method to quantify RLPs and small VLDL. Furthermore, our data
show that elevated serum apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) levels predict CVD events in subjects with T1DM when
adjusted for diabetes severity and other traditional risk factors; this correlation was found in subjects with
normal TGs. APOC3 increases levels of TRLs and RLPs. We have previously reported that TRLs contribute to
atherosclerotic plaque instability in mouse models of diabetes. We have also found that diabetes leads to
suppression of glycolysis in macrophages, and that this in turn is linked to ER stress and plaque instability.
During the next 7 years, this project will reveal mechanisms behind increased CVD risk in humans, focusing on
RLPs and APOC3 as CVD risk factors in patients with T1DM and T2DM and TG levels in the normal range. By
using our mechanistic mouse models of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, we will also clarify the diabetes-
induced mechanisms that promote early and advanced atherosclerosis. As part of these mechanistic studies,
we will reveal how diabetes, APOC3 and RLPs alter lesion macrophages, by using proteomics, single cell
RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and functional assays. By combining prospective studies on CVD risk in
humans with diabetes and our mechanistic mouse models of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, we believe
we are in an excellent position to fill an important and clinically significant gap in our understanding of how
diabetes promotes CVD and to identify new treatment and prevention strategies."
10828886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE) is estimated to affect 5-7% of all pregnancies in the U.S. The initiating event in PE is
postulated to involve reduced placental perfusion that leads to widespread chronic immune activation and
maternal vascular dysfunction. Despite its position as a leading cause of maternal death and major contributor
to maternal and perinatal morbidity, there is no effective drug treatment to prevent preeclampsia, and current
management therapies have significant limitations. At present, the only effective treatment for preeclampsia is
early delivery of the baby and placenta. Based on recent studies and on preliminary data presented in this
application, we propose that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PE.
Recent studies have shown that NLRP3 protein expression is increased in women with PE. Our compelling
preliminary data indicating that chronic administration of a NLRP3 inhibitor significantly improves blood pressure
and intrauterine growth restriction in response to reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) supports the
concept that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may protect against the progression of PE. Additional
preliminary findings demonstrate that inhibition of NLRP3 decreases T-helper 17 cells (TH17s) and cytolytic NK
cell (cNK) activation, two important immune factors implicated in the pathophysiology of PE. We also provide
evidence that suggest the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway modulate IL-33 signaling to induce immune
dysfunction associated with PE in pregnant rats. Based on recent studies and on preliminary data presented in
this application, we propose that inhibition of NLRP3 activation may provide novel therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of PE. Our overall hypothesis is that placental ischemia activates NLRP3 and increases
caspase-1/IL-1β which in turn leads to decreased IL-33 and increased TH17s and cNK activation to cause
vascular and renal dysfunction, hypertension, and intrauterine growth restriction. To test this hypothesis,
we will use an established animal model of PE: Reduced Uterine Perfusion Pressure (RUPP) model of placental
ischemia. We will also utilize physiological and pharmacological approaches complemented with molecular,
biochemical, and in vivo techniques to address vertically integrated specific aims. We are confident that our
proposed studies will provide new and important information regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms
linking placental ischemia and maternal hypertension and intrauterine growth restriction in PE, but more
importantly help identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PE."
10829332,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adaptive immune responses are governed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which determines the fates and
activities of T cells (helper, effector, etc.). The TCR and its signaling partners integrate antigen-recognition
signals and second signals, which carry information about the context in which antigen presentation is
occurring. Second signals can be either stimulatory or inhibitory: stimulatory signals are essential for T cell
activation, whereas inhibitory signals (also called checkpoints) are responsible for T cell exhaustion and
antigen tolerance. Stimulatory second signals are generated by the innate arm of the immune system when, for
example, signaling by Toll-like receptors induces expression of the B7-family ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2
(CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. Expression of B7-1/B7-2 indicates that antigen presentation is occurring
within the context of an ongoing innate immune response. B7-1 and B7-2 are recognized by CD28, a TCR
coreceptor that potently enhances TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. Inhibitory second signals arise
during the course of chronic stimulation of TCR signaling. They are important for limiting the collateral damage
caused by an immune response and avoidance of autoimmunity, but they can also be deleterious. For
example, tumor cells commonly express the B7-family ligands B7-H1 (PD-L1/CD274) and B7-DC (PD-
L2/CD273), which are recognized by PD-1, a TCR coreceptor that inhibits TCR-generated T-cell activation
signals. B7-H1/B7-DC expression conveys immune privilege to tumor cells. For these and other reasons, it is
imperative that we improve our basic understanding of checkpoint signaling. Here, we propose to characterize
the dynamics of PD-1-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat E6-1, HuT 78, and TALL-104 cells,
CRISPR-engineered cells derived from these parental cell lines, and primary human CD8+ cells. We will apply
quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain an unbiased, nearly comprehensive picture of phosphotyrosine
(pTyr) site abundances with and without PD-1/CD28 coreceptor signaling in populations of T cells over time
and across conditions. Concurrently, using fluorescence microscopy and engineered SH2 domain affinity
reagents, we will characterize single-molecule patterns of multisite phosphorylation for TCR, CD28, and PD-1.
We will also measure membrane-recruitment lifetimes for individual cytosolic signaling partners of these
receptors. The resulting data will be used to drive the formulation and parameterization of a detailed
mechanistic model for TCR signaling accounting for the effects of CD28 and PD-1 coactivation. Although PD-1
is viewed as a platform for recruitment of phosphatases that counteract activation signals from kinases, we will
evaluate specific hypotheses about how PD-1 could potentially generate positive signals for T-cell activation.
These hypotheses are motivated by the fact that the best characterized signaling partners of PD-1 are protein
tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, which are known to promote cell activation in other contexts by, for
example, mediating the dephosphorylation of inhibitory pTyr sites. Model predictions will be tested."
10829383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sexual reproduction requires precise orchestration of expression of myriad genes in males and
females. These genes mediate interactions between the sexes at molecular, cellular, neural and whole-
organism levels, including the differential fertility success of sperm from two competing males that mate to a
single female. In the current funding period, we used the tractable Drosophila model system to dissect the role
of genes expressed in octopaminergic neurons in differential sperm use by a multiply-mated female. In this
renewal application, we propose as Aim 1 a set of experiments that identify genes and quantify their
effects on mating plug ejection, a proximal phenotype with a key role in sperm competition outcomes.
Mating plug ejection timing allows females to exert control over paternity of their future offspring. Early ejection
of a mating plug disadvantages the male by decreasing the number of his sperm that can be used; conversely
longer retention of the plug gives the male a paternity advantage. Both males and females contribute to the
mating plug and its ejection. After completing a GWAS for female and male determinants of mating plug
ejection timing and validating the resulting genes, we will perform a grid cross to determine whether variation in
mating plug timing is mostly determined by genetic variation in the male, or the female, or an interaction
between the two. Follow-up perturbation of those genes will begin to unravel genetic pathways linking male
quality or its perception with mating plug ejection. In Aim 2, we will pursue the implications of our recent
discovery that mating induces differential exon or promoter use by a large suite of genes in the female
brain. Intriguingly, two of these genes, desat1 and foraging, act in mating discrimination or other reproductive-
relevant behaviors. Each strongly activates one of four alternative promoters in response to mating. We will
survey the transcriptome to quantify how variation in male factors drive post-mating differential transcript use,
how the latter varies across female genotypes, and how this regulation occurs. In Aim 3 we extend and
generalize models designed to quantify and predict outcomes of pairwise interactions. The classical
Bradley-Terry model, widely applied in predicting outcomes of sporting contests between teams that have not
yet competed, has a direct analogy in sperm competition “contests.” Assessing fit to models of this class will
test whether the males’ fitness can be rank-ordered, and whether those rank orders produce accurate outcome
predictions. We will extend these models to the outcomes of the experiments in Aims 1 and 2, and those
performed in this project over the years, using the results to assess the overall importance of male x female
interactions in each case. Many of the processes that we will study show high levels of evolutionary
conservation, implying that our results will expand our understanding of male x female interactions in
reproduction that may have relevance to cases of idiopathic human infertility that may involve genetic
incompatibility between the partners."

10829387,"The majority of deaf children are at risk for impoverished and/or delayed exposure to language, spoken or
signed, because they have limited access to speech sounds and have parents who are not native users of a
sign language. Work on the critical period has shown that delayed exposure to a first language has lasting
effects on many aspects of development. The goal of this project is to understand how exposure to primarily
non-native language input during the critical period affects vocabulary acquisition. We focus on phonological
neighborhood density and iconicity—two factors that typically shape sign language vocabulary development
(Caselli & Pyers, 2017), but may be uniquely affected by impoverished linguistic input during the critical period.
Hearing parents, as second language learners of American Sign Language (ASL), are themselves affected by
the age at which they begin learning ASL. A hallmark of second language signing is a tradeoff between
phonology and iconicity, whereby their sign production is likely to approximate the iconic motivation of a sign
(e.g., illustrate the horns of a cow) at the expense of phonological accuracy. We ask whether children who
have hearing parents mimic this tradeoff, and are more sensitive to iconicity and less sensitive to phonological
neighborhood density than children with native ASL exposure. We also characterize deaf and hearing parents’
use of iconic signs during naturalistic interactions between parents and children, in an effort to uncover
mechanisms that may make learning contexts more or less informative for highly iconic signs than less iconic
signs. Among hearing children, early vocabulary is a robust predictor of later language development. We ask
whether similar relationships exist between early ASL vocabulary and later language development
(morphosyntactic acquisition and later vocabulary knowledge). In addition to significant advances in theories of
language acquisition and the critical period, this work will have immediate applied benefits. It will result in ASL-
LEX 2.0, the first early assessment of ASL that can be used widely in infants and young children to quickly
identify limited ASL proficiency. All of the ASL-CDI 2.0 reports data will be made publicly available via
WordBank, a cross-linguistic repository of data on children’s early vocabulary, and age of acquisition
information will be integrated into ASL-LEX, an interactive online database of ASL vocabulary. Together this,
project will provide a detailed view of early ASL vocabulary acquisition, and can help practitioners and
researchers develop interventions to mitigate the risks and effects of impoverished language exposure during
the critical period."
10829388,"Project Summary:
 In metazoan animals there is an incredible diversity of alternative transcript isoforms generated from
genes. The alternative parts making up a mature full length mRNA include alternatively selected transcription
start sites, 5′ UTRs, protein-coding exons, 3′ UTRs, and polyA sites. We have gained incredible insights into the
cellular conditions and protein factors that regulate these alternative choices, but these regulatory events are
usually studied in isolation. What is far less understood is how these alternative choices are coordinated together.
This is partly because of limitations in the molecular techniques to study full length transcript isoforms. Long-
read RNA sequencing technologies present a new tool to study how the alternative parts of a transcript come
together.
 The majority of genes in metazoans undergo alternative polyadenylation to produce alternative length 3′
UTR isoforms. Long 3′ UTR isoforms are enriched in neural tissues, whereas short 3′ UTR isoforms are enriched
in proliferating cells and in testis. In Drosophila, we recently identified that long 3′ UTR biogenesis and alternative
splicing of the Dscam1 gene are co-regulated by the RNA-binding protein Elav in neurons. We found that these
events are required for neuronal function in Drosophila. Our preliminary analysis shows that this coupling of
alternative splicing changes to alternative 3′ UTR selection affects other genes in Drosophila.
 How widespread is the coupling of alternative exon selection to alternative 3′ end formation? Due to
limitations in short-read RNA sequencing technologies, the genome-wide scope of such coupling events is
unknown. We will employ new long read RNA-sequencing technologies to uncover 3′ UTR-coupled alternative
splicing events genome-wide that are regulated by RNA-binding proteins such as Elav.
 What is the mechanism that coordinates 3′ UTR biogenesis with alternative splicing? In addition to co-
regulation of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of Dscam1 by Elav, we found that the presence
of the Dscam1 long 3′ UTR was necessary for Elav-regulated alternative splicing. What is the nature of this “at
a distance” regulatory event? A possible mechanistic explanation involves looping of the pre-mRNA such that
the long 3′ UTR interacts with upstream splice sites to deliver RNA-binding proteins. We will test this pre-mRNA
looping model through mapping RNA-RNA interactions, in vivo mini-gene reporter analyses, targeted screens,
and RNA-affinity chromatography. This mechanistic investigation will be expanded to other genes and cell types.
 The proposed research program will identify the rules governing coordinated alternative splicing and
alternative polyadenylation. The coordination of RNA processing steps to produce mRNAs with specific protein-
coding and regulatory properties is likely important for many cell types and eukaryotic organisms, including
humans."

Despite major improvements, significant disparities in healthcare and outcomes exist in type 1 diabetes (T1D) in
low vs high income countries. In our recent study of 68 African youth with T1D, patients were treated and
educated by trained pediatric endocrinologists, performed self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) an average
of 2.1x/day, and had access to sufficient quantities of insulin. Average HbA1c was 11%. Blinded continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) demonstrated extremes of both hyper- and hypoglycemia. Glucose percent time-in-
range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dl) was only 30%, and time-in-hypoglycemia (glucose <54 mg/dl) was 7%, with more
than 80% of subjects spending ~ 2 hours a day hypoglycemic. Current practices are failing these children, who
are at very high risk for diabetes acute and chronic complications.
This RCT aims to improve T1D care in East African youth age 4-26 years by testing the hypothesis that enabling
patients to continuously monitor glucose levels with flash CGM will improve glucose TIR, and that this therapy
will be cost effective in the setting of a low-resource country. All subjects will receive identical monthly diabetes
education. For the first 6 months, half of patients (n=90) will be given unblinded flash CGM so they can see their
glucose levels in real time, while half (n=90, the control group) will perform ≥3x daily self-monitoring of blood
glucose by fingerpoke (SMBG) while wearing a blinded CGM for endpoint measurement. The primary outcome
measure, TIR, is assessed at 6 months. After 6 months, the unblinded CGM cohort will continue on this treatment
for another 6 months to assess the impact of 1 year of unblinded CGM therapy. The control group will switch to
unblinded CGM months 6-12.
All patients in this study, including those in the control group, will receive more intensive education, greater
attention from the diabetes team, and more test strips than are commonly available today. If this approach results
in similar levels of improvement in glucose TIR in control subjects compared to patients who also receive CGM,
this study will have performed an important service by demonstrating that there is no need for CGM therapy and
that more focus, instead, needs to be placed on patient education and interaction with the medical team. But if
CGM leads to significantly greater improvement in diabetes metabolic control by reducing hyper-and
hypoglycemia, then the ethical question is not whether to provide this therapy in resource poor settings, but how
to make it affordable. Such decisions must be guided by data obtained from children in the specific and unique
settings found in low income nations. The goal of this protocol is to obtain these data."
10829924,"ABSTRACT- ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core of the NYU Langone Health ADRC will provide overall direction of the Center
and its resources to ensure optimal scientific productivity on AD/ADRD. The Core will promote a
specific focus on research related to our ADRC's theme of identifying biomarkers and characterizing
their roles in transitions from normal aging, subjective cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia, with an
aim to help develop novel interventions that will delay or prevent these transitions. The Administrative
Core provides scientific leadership and oversight of all ADRC activities, coordinates internal and
external communications, provides budgetary and financial support, and administers the
Developmental Project programs. All activities of the Administrative Core are tied to enhancement of
understanding AD heterogeneity and accelerating a path for a cure for AD/ADRD, in accordance with
NAPA research priorities. This will be accomplished by continuing to provide the functions developed
over the past 29 years with the enhancement of now including coordination of the Developmental
Project Program and the additional Biomarker and REC Cores. The Core will also organize, maintain,
and coordinate meetings of Center advisory panels, including an External Advisory Committee (EAC)
to annually evaluate the programs of the ADRC, and an Executive Committee (EC), composed of core
leaders and the administrator. These committees will assist the Director to make scientific and
administrative decisions relating to the Center, using advice and consultation both from within the
institution and from other institutions, to monitor and develop the scientific content and direction of the
Center. Overall the core will facilitate ADRD-related institutional activities to help meet NAPA research
priorities, and encourage development and application of new programs and technologies to cure AD."
10829928,"ABSTRACT- DATA MANAGEMENT & STATISTICS (DMS) CORE
The Data Management and Statistical (DMS) Core supports the NYU Alzheimer's Disease Research Center
(ADRC) and its Cores by providing state-of-the-art data and information management and statistical expertise.
The DMS Core aims to provide cutting edge research data management (AIM 1), by providing a customized,
comprehensive and scalable data acquisition and management platform in REDCap and provide scalable
technologies like Tableau for data visualization. The core will maintain unique linkages between the participants
and their data captured from other core's activities and from various collaborative/ affiliated studies, including
incorporating the global unique identifier (GUID) to streamline data collaborations between centers. DMS will
continue its inter core collaboration by, maintaining the database in collaboration; maintaining a dynamic registry;
maintaining standardized brain measures in the database; providing informatics and statistical collaboration for
the BMS core. The core will continue to provide scalable storage solutions and be the conduit to share data with
researchers and collaborators through latest tools and new systems. DMS will also interface with NACC to
implement data acquisition forms, submit UDS data in a timely manner and be swiftly handle query resolution.
DMS will continue to develop and implement innovative tools to incorporate various data sets including the vast
“-omics” data and also make the tools available to the wider research community through our website and social
media.
The DMS Core also aims to provide state-of-the-art statistical support (AIM 2) and promote scientific rigor,
by providing comprehensive statistical collaboration and consultation to all the Cores at NYU ADRC across the
entire spectrum of the translational research process of study design, conduct, analysis, visualization,
interpretation, and reporting of clinical, translational, and population-based research. DMS core will develop
innovative study designs and new statistical methods to address emerging research directions undertaken by
ADRC investigators that include developing new statistical models and methods to deal with latent
heterogeneities in ADRD, effective risk prediction models with variable selection, novel machine learning
methods for high dimensional data, and open platform computing algorithms and R packages. Finally, the DMS
Core mentors center affiliated young investigators and trainees in addition to promoting scientific rigor with
extensive statistical support, facilitating collaboration and optimizing resources with cutting edge data
management, and magnifying the impact of findings by promoting reproducible research and data sharing."
10829930,"ABSTRACT- NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE
The Neuropathology (NP) Core provides for diagnostic neuropathological evaluations of: 1) patients and control
subjects enrolled in the Clinical Core (CC), and 2) other clinically well documented patients with
neurodegenerative disease. The NP Core aims to enhance understanding of the heterogeneity of AD/ADRD
to develop better biomarkers and discover novel and effective therapeutic approaches that promote progress
towards achieving the NAPA research implementation milestones. The protocols used by the NP Core will
be state of the art and consistent with 21st century brain banking procedures. These will be essential to meet the
increasingly sophisticated needs of the AD research community. We will emphasize delineating the presence of
overlapping neurodegenerative syndromes. In this renewal, we will continue to emphasize the central theme of
the NYU ADRC: elucidating the clinico-pathological substrates that underlie the transitions between normal
aging, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and dementia to help develop novel interventions that delay or
prevent these transitions. The overall objectives of the NP Core of the NYULH ADRC are to provide staff,
technical resources, laboratory facilities, and expertise to investigate the structural and molecular properties of
the brains of both patients with ADRC and those of normal controls. Aims 1–3 of the NP core encompass the
key neuropathology functions of the NP Core. Aims 4 and 5 will develop innovative neuropathological
technologies. The emerging clinical evaluation system of ATN—which is proposed to underlie transitional stages
between normal aging to SCD, SCD to MCI, and MCI to early dementia—needs to be correlated with
comprehensive neuropathological measures that also reflect disease heterogeneity. In addition, while brain
tissue is an essential resource, it cannot be developed into dynamic cellular models. Hence, the NP Core has
launched a new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) program, providing investigators with an easily replenished
source of tissue to address key questions about the heterogeneous pathogenesis of AD/ADRC. Aims 6 and 7
focus on using NP Core resources to train the next generation of neuropathologists and translational
neuroscientists conducting research on AD/ADRD, support their studies to develop novel therapeutic targets,
and promote educational outreach about brain and biospecimen donation. The combination of these aims will
help the NP Core to develop better biomarkers and to discover novel effective, therapeutic approaches; hence,
accelerating progress towards achieving the NAPA research implementation milestones."
10829933,"The growing incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) and the
current demand and anticipated increase in the number of therapeutic trials and other ongoing investigations
demands for more effective and efficient outreach, recruitment, and engagement. Consistent with the major
goals of this FOA (RFA-AG-20-004), the AD/ADRD scientific and clinical community, and the New York
University (NYU) Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for early disease detection, identification of
disease heterogeneity, and developing effective therapies to prevent or delay disease progression, the Outreach,
Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core is well positioned to serve as the outward face of the NYU Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center (ADRC). The ORE Core will continue its collaboration with other NYU Centers,
ADRCs, and the larger scientific community in support of disseminating ADRC-related discoveries from the
Clinical, Biomarker, Neuropathology and Data and Statistical Cores. The ORE Core will also continue in its
primary mission as the vehicle for recruitment and retention of research participants in the Clinical Core and
affiliated AD/ADRD studies through community-based recruitment activities, through collaboration with NYU
clinical services especially within disadvantaged neighborhoods, and through deployment of several new
strategies to enhance recruitment and retention. To be most effective, we will develop innovative approaches
that may increase the effectiveness and efficiency of recruitment and retention activities. This is particularly
important for a culturally diverse population and will require multiple community organization collaborations and
deployment of community health workers who are culturally concordant with those we seek to recruit. We will
also utilize the myriad of Epic resources to conduct population-based recruitment through background analytics
within the electronic health record system as well as messaging of potential patient subjects through Epic's
MyChart while protecting patient confidentiality and avoiding the usual human subjects' requirements. We will
rely heavily on our growing registry to ensure a larger “study-ready” population through a well-characterized
group of subjects who may have specific participation interests and whose attention will be sustained by regular
messages and dissemination of new research developments. The ORE core will also serve as a learning
laboratory for these efforts to understand what is most effective and why. We will support national efforts in
AD/ADRD research through close collaboration with the National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's and related
Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center by sharing our recruitment infographics, educational
handouts, and video animations. The ORE Core will facilitate expansion of AD/ADRD research activities through
engagement across the NYU campus and collaborating institutions, through research presentations and training
sessions with professionals, and student-in-training workshops, while building relationships in underserved
communities through community-located health fairs and related events."
10829935,"ABSTRACT – BIOMARKER CORE
The primary objective of the newly configured Biomarker Core (BC) is to collect, bank, and distribute biofluids in
order to generate biomarker datasets that will address disease heterogeneity and clinical transitions to subjective
cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the
long term goal of developing novel interventions that will delay or prevent these transitions. During its more than
25 years of continued funding, the NYU ADRC has been in the forefront of improving diagnostic tools and defining
preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. In this renewal period, the dedicated BC will be reconfigured to serve as
a conceptual and technical core for established investigators and the next generation of students and
neuroscientists; and, to foster the use of plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as stool samples
for microbiome analyses, to understand biological mechanisms of disease progression and heterogeneity. We
propose the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will coordinate intake, processing and storage of biofluids from Clinical
Core (CC) participants in association with the Data Management & Statistics (DMS) Core. In Aim 2, we will
perform state-of-the-art analysis of known blood and CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction
of AD. Assays will include, but will not be limited to, Aβ40/42/38, phosphorylated/total tau and neurofilament
light-chain, all within the new amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework, in addition to markers of
cerebrovascular disease, inflammation, glial activation, as well as biological variables such as age, sex, ApoE4,
and sleep (among others), which will be key to increase our understanding of disease heterogeneity. In Aim 3,
we will use Simoa technology to develop novel ultrasensitive biomarker assays, guided in part by proteomic
findings by the Neuropathology (NP) Core and other emerging data from the ADRC network. Aim 4 is designed
to manage samples, perform quality control and analyses as well as link sample information obtained through
the DMS, CC, Neuroimaging (NIC), and NP Cores. As part of Aim 5, we will share biosamples with NCRAD and
other research collaborative efforts within NYU (e.g. NYU Metabolomics Lab) and outside collaborators from
other ADRC (e.g. Microbiome Project). Last, in Aim 6, we will collaborate with other ADRCs to harmonize and
optimize biomarker assays across centers. In summary, the BC will perform state-of-the-art biofluid biomarker
analyses within the new ATN framework, and work with the NIC and CC cores to help understand disease
heterogeneity and stage transitions to SCD, MCI, and AD. Further, it will help harmonize multiple biomarker
assays and develop scientific discovery of novel ultrasensitive biomarkers for AD."
10829940,"ABSTRACT- PSYCHOSOCIAL CORE
The NYU-ADC has pioneered in the development of comprehensive counseling for family caregivers of people with
AD, and has established a national reputation in this field. The Psychosocial Core will provide resources, including
data and participants, for the design and evaluation of new psychosocial interventions for all older adults who
participate in the NYU-ADRC, including those with early signs of cognitive impairment, and continue to support
its nationally known caregiver intervention research program. The affiliated Psychosocial Research Program
continues to develop and evaluate innovative projects to reduce the emotional consequences of cognitive
decline. New since 2016 is the affiliated Family Support Program, which serves caregivers throughout NYC.
Expanded research on supportive interventions will continue in the upcoming period. The Psychosocial Core will
continue to conduct comprehensive psychosocial assessments and to provide counseling and support to
participants in the ADRC and to the family members of participants with MCI and early dementia. The counselors
will maintain contact with family caregivers of participants with moderate to severe AD, after they are no longer
receiving in-person annual assessments, to increase the likelihood of autopsy of these participants. These
activities of the Core enhance the ability of the ADRC to retain its clinical population through autopsy. The
Psychosocial Core interacts closely with the other Cores and provides valuable support to the research projects,
clinical trials and pilot studies associated with the ADRC and with collaborating investigators. The Psychosocial
Core conducts a Psychosocial Assessment of all participants with normal cognitive function and MCI, and of
study partners of those with MCI and caregivers of participants in the early stage of dementia. The assessment
now includes measures to enable research about the relationships between psychosocial and cognitive changes
associated with aging and incipient dementia, and investigate causes for disparities between impairment in day-
to-day function and results of cognitive tests and brain imaging evaluations. The Psychosocial Core data,
together with the other data in the ADRC database, will provide a uniquely comprehensive dataset to inform the
design of innovative psychosocial interventions for older adults with age-associated cognitive changes and MCI.
Psychosocial data on individuals with normal cognitive function and MCI, and on the family members of people
with MCI and AD, can be integrated with information from the Clinical, Neuroimaging, Biomarker and
Neuropathology Core evaluations and become the basis for new studies in the affiliated Psychosocial Research
Program. The Core will continue to provide clinical and research training and mentor new investigators. The
breadth of research on psychosocial interventions is a defining attribute of the NYU-ADRC, and the Psychosocial
Core will continue to provide resources for research to understand and mitigate the psychosocial impact of memory
loss associated with both normal aging and disease."

Research education has long been a core mission of the NYU ADRC and its affiliated Center for Cognitive 
Neurology (CCN). Hence, we are pleased to expand our efforts with the formation of a new Research Education 
Component (REC). The REC will build on the extensive experience of numerous NYU ADRC/CCN affiliated 
researchers/clinicians and educators, who will nurture the careers of future AD/ADRD investigators. NYU 
Langone Health (NYULH) is uniquely positioned to provide trainees with the resources needed to develop and 
hone research skills by working in conjunction with world-class, established research programs and 
internationally renowned mentors. Our program will take advantage of the NYU ADRC cores' long history of 
training clinician scientists to become successful, productive investigators. We will recruit a scientifically and 
demographically diverse group of up to five fellows named: NYU ADRC REC Scholars. The REC Scholars will 
be given comprehensive mentoring and training, with funding for expenses such as travel to meetings and 
exchanges with other ADRCs. A broad multidisciplinary training program will be developed, providing instruction 
and training in cutting-edge research methods. A second group of REC Junior Scholars will be immersed in 
the training program and will include NYU's diverse program for students led by the Sackler Institute, the Summer 
Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). The REC specific aims are: Aim 1: Implement outreach, recruitment 
and selection of a scientifically and demographically diverse group who will be leaders in AD/ADRD research. 
We will select up to five individuals (REC Scholars) for an average of a two-year training period. Aim 2: Provide 
broad multi-disciplinary training and mentoring. REC Scholars will be dually paired with experienced 
investigators with clinical and/or basic research expertise. They will receive a comprehensive program of 
didactics, training in statistical and epidemiological methods, scientific rigor, responsible conduct of research 
training and career development. Each REC Scholar, with their mentors, will develop an individualized career 
development plan. In addition to the REC Scholars, REC Junior Scholars will be identified each year from among 
medical students, undergraduates, graduate students and residents at NYULH. Junior Scholars will participate 
in didactic programs that focus on AD/ADRD and brain aging, and will each receive mentoring by a REC Scholar. 
Aim 3: Augment inter- and cross-institutional partnerships to enhance research training in AD/ADRD. We will 
work with the Neuroscience Institute, NYU's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and its clinical 
research training, diverse NYU Colleges, other ADRCs, and Centers of Excellence in AD to provide REC 
Scholars with opportunities for rotations to increase the breadth and depth of their training. Aim 4: Implement 
methods for the measurement of the effectiveness of the NYU ADRC REC program, which will allow for 
continued enhancement and refinement of our training mission."

PROJECT 1: STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE VIF-APOBEC3 COMPLEX
SUMMARY
In Project 1 we will elucidate novel structural aspects of the APOBEC3 (A3) family of restriction factors and how
they are antagonized by the HIV accessory protein Vif. Primate Vif targets A3’s for degradation by the 26S
proteasome, but it is unknown how Vif intercepts A3 packaging complexes. It has been suggested that Vif binds
different A3 family members through three different interfaces, but whether these binding sites are independent
or dependent on one another is unclear. In previous studies, we uncovered that Vif forms functional interactions
with additional host factors, including regulatory subunits of PP2A, components of the chromatin-modifying and
transcriptional machinery, and regulators of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We will now investigate how Vif
neutralizes different A3 family members to promote efficient viral replication, and how adaptations in Vif enabled
neutralization of A3G in hominid primates and how these adaptations affect the ability of human A3G to escape
HIV-1.
We will determine the structure of A3G and PP2A regulatory subunits bound to Vif using cryo-EM (Structural
Biology Core), as well as deep mutational scanning (DMS) (Genetics Core), to uncover the mechanisms by
which Vif recognizes different substrates and multitasks the degradation of A3 and PP2A subunits. The functional
significance of structural observations will be further tested using viral and biochemical assays, and DMS in
primary CD4+ T cells will explore tradeoffs between the ability of Vif to neutralize specific A3 family members vs.
others. We will also use cryo-EM (Structural Biology Core), functional studies, and DMS (Genetics Core) to
determine how Vif’s ability to engage restriction factors is rewired by adaptations allowing cross-species
transmission. This is important because A3G and Vif undergo repeated bouts of positive selection and adaptation
in what has been termed a ‘molecular arms race’, a process which led to cross-species transmission and the
birth of HIV-1. Finally, we will investigate the mechanism of A3 packaging in the absence of Vif by determining
composition and architecture of A3 packaging complexes, a long-standing question in the field. We will use the
HEPS platform to discover host and viral proteins required for packaging of newly synthesized A3 family
members (Proteomics Core). CRISPR-Cas9 and mutagenesis will determine the functional significance of the
A3 packaging complex (Genetics Core). Cryo-EM studies will be performed on the packaging complex
(Structural Biology Core). These approaches will provide snapshots of A3 family members en route to
packaging and define how Vif intercepts these structures to promote viral infectivity. Discoveries made by
Project 1 will enable rational drug design to target HIV-1 from establishing replication-competent proviruses by
utilizing the restriction potential of A3 family members."

PROJECT 2: REGULATION OF HIV TRANSCRIPTION AND LATENCY
SUMMARY
The HIV regulatory proteins Tat and Rev play a crucial role in controlling HIV transcription and mRNA export,
respectively. In Project 2, we will functionally and structurally elucidate the roles of ubiquitin ligases that modify
Tat, reveal the architecture of the Rev/RRE nuclear export complex to understand the mechanisms regulating
HIV mRNA translation, and compare Rev and RRE evolution in SIV and HIV to identify viral factors that contribute
to zoonosis. To achieve this, we will determine the functional interactions between the E3 ligases UBE2O and
TRAF6 with Tat by cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography (Structural Biology Core) and investigate the mechanism
by which UBE2O promotes the release of the inhibitory 7SK snRNP by ubiquitination of the HEXIM1 subunit.
We will determine the high-resolution structure of the Rev/RRE/Crm1/RanGTP nuclear export complex by cryo-
EM and define genetic and protein interaction landscapes of the Rev/RRE complex. We will also compare its
protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces between HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV complexes. We will use the HEPS
platform (Genetics core, Proteomics core and Structural biology core) and deep mutational scanning to
functionally validate these interactions and define them biochemically and structurally.
The latent HIV reservoir represents a significant roadblock to eradicating infection. We aim to uncover factors
that drive HIV latency, including virus integration sites and the states of chromatin and chromatin interacting
proteins. Using CRISPR-Cas9 (Genetics core), we will integrate a minimal HIV-1 LTR reporter into CD4+ T cells
to address how integration into specific genomic loci may permit expansion of particular clonal cells without virus
expression, to understand mechanistically how a large fraction of latent cells expand in chronically infected
individuals over time. Using proteomics and a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods, we will identify
post-translational modifications on HP1 proteins, test the roles of specific HP1 modifications on their phase-
separation properties, and assess site-specific HP1 mutants for virus replication. This will elucidate how the state
of chromatin and heterochromatin impact HIV transcription. Finally, we will examine the role of non-canonical
(nc) NF-kB in enhancing latency reversal for shock-and-kill therapies. We will assess synergies between
inhibition of SAMHD1 and of the ncNF-kB pathway in latency reversal in monocytic and lymphocytic latent cell
models, resting CD4+ T cells (the major reservoir of latent HIV), and gut macrophages isolated from people living
with HIV (PLWH). In summary, Project 2 will uncover potential new interfaces as HIV drug targets and evaluate
latency reversal or induction of deep latency for cure strategies."
10834174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biomedical investigators are experiencing a limitation in their collective ability to translate the
remarkable basic science discoveries of the current era into the clinical arena—a divide
appropriately termed “the valley of death.” In our first two funding cycles, we have established a
strong T32 postdoctoral training program in bench-to-bedside research methodology designed to
train the next generation of clinical and basic researchers in translational approaches to
pulmonary vascular biology and medicine. The program has thus far trained twenty-three trainees,
who have had significant success in publication, grant funding, and securing academic positions;
thirteen of these trainees were women, three identified as under-represented minorities (URM).
Our program recognized the necessity for practical training in scientific entrepreneurship and
biotechnology, and our efforts in bolstering this aspect of training have resulted in three trainees
obtaining an MBA. In the third cycle of funding, we will continue to evolve and enhance our
training program. We are focused on strategies to increase the diversity among our trainees; and
in response to our trainees’ requests for entrepreneurship education without the commitment to
obtaining an MBA, we have added options for micro-credential programs and formed an
Entrepreneurship Educational Board. Further, to enhance the training of our post-doctoral
trainees and expand the scope of our program, we will informally include participation by local
pre-doctoral trainees in select components of our existing curriculum. Importantly, our post-
doctoral trainees will continue to be co-mentored by a faculty with complementary research
approaches to provide comprehensive training, and projects focused on patient-oriented bench-
to-bedside research, with constant attention to trainee career development. Our faculty include
translationally-focused physician-scientists and PhDs spanning basic science to
entrepreneurship, with a history of productivity in pulmonary vascular biology, excellent funding
support, successful mentoring, and expertise from molecular discovery to clinical trials to
biotechnology commercialization. Substantial institutional support is available through
endowments to the VMI. The proposed training program, leadership, advisory boards, training
faculty, and infrastructure at the University of Pittsburgh are strongly positioned to build on an
already rich bench-to-bedside translational training program and create a generation of
researchers committed to spanning the “valley of death” between basic research discoveries,
clinical application, and commercial viability in pulmonary vascular disease."

10834279,"Abstract
Excessive alcohol use remains a leading preventable cause of death and disability in the United States.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 95,158 alcohol-attributable
deaths (261 deaths per day) is reported only in the United States, with associated annual costs of $249 billion.
The goal of this project is to develop a wearable integrated device capable of continuously measuring, recording,
and storing ISF alcohol levels in real-time without the need for external calibrations. The National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) seeks a wearable alcohol monitoring device that can continuously
measure real-time alcohol levels in the blood or interstitial fluid (ISF), and this proposal is highly aligned with the
NIAAA’s mission. An accurate wearable alcohol sensor will serve useful purposes in different settings, including
research programs, clinics, forensic applications, and consumer use to promote responsible alcohol
consumption. The available transdermal alcohol monitoring devices, relying on alcohol detection in sweat or
sweat vapor, face significant problems such as long lag times (up to several hours) and tend to be cumbersome.
In this context, ActioX, LLC has developed a non-obtrusive wearable sensor platform to enable pain-free analysis
few hundred microns under the skin, directly in the ISF. The novel sensing technology relies on a biocompatible
array of microneedles, optimized for painless skin penetration, and thus to provide continuous access to
constantly revitalizing ISF. This fully integrated wirelessly operated device is composed of two components of a
reusable electronics and a disposable microneedle array, along with a successful demonstration of a custom-
designed app for data capture and visualization. Our preliminary data using the prototype device showed
successful real-time tracking of ISF alcohol in response to alcohol drinking episodes in multiple human subjects,
with the results well correlated to those from a breathalyzer. This SBIR Fast-Track project will leverage this
innovative technology to develop a discreet, real-time, continuous, and calibration-free continuous alcohol
monitoring device toward prolonged on-body operations to enable more comprehensive and accurate clinical
studies and allow efficient control and management of alcohol-related problems, including alcohol use disorder.
Phase I constitutes in-vitro feasibility studies to find the best chemical modification strategy with optimal
sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and extended 3-days stability. We aim in Phase II to execute a series of
clinical studies to develop a prospective calibration algorithm that can convert, in real time, the raw
electrochemical sensor signals to BAC. The data gathered through this work will support FDA clearance, and
subsequently, the commercialization of our real-time, continuous alcohol monitoring wearable system as a
reliable and accurate device ready to be used by end users, including hospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, drug
testing laboratories, government departments, and others."

with Alport syndrome. These genes encode the assembly of collagen IV α345 scaffolds, the major
constituent of the GBM. The pathogenic variants lead to a broad array of clinical manifestations,
ranging from microscopic hematuria to end stage renal disease. The underlying mechanisms
linking these variants with GBM abnormalities and renal failure remain obscure. Current therapy
is limited to treatment with ACE inhibitors to slow progression and new therapies are in urgent
need.
How genetic variants of the α345 scaffold cause Alport syndrome remains unknown. Here, we
focus on Z-variant causing Alport syndrome without loss of the α345 scaffold but rather reduction-
or loss-of-function effect (hypomorph variant). We use this variant as a vanguard to decipher the
pathogenic mechanism of the α345 collagen IV in Alport GBM and develop new forms of therapy.
In Aim 1, we will utilize a new Z-variant animal model to understand mechanisms of α345 collagen
IV dysfunction. In Aim 2, we will determine exact defects caused by Z-variant and similar
pathogenic variants at protein and cellular levels to identify specific targets for small molecule
therapies. In Aim 3, we will test protein replacement therapy and screen for pharmacological
chaperones correcting assembly and stability of the collagen IV α345 scaffold.
The completion of the Aims will advance our knowledge about Alport pathogenesis and lay out
foundation for therapy development addressing causative mechanisms in Alport syndrome."

In this project we have designed a soil enrichment screen using PCR amplification of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) gene, the first gene involved in sphingolipid synthesis,11,12 to identify sphingolipid producers. Follow-on lipidomic screening of SPT+ organisms on our laboratory’s QTOF LC-MS system will identify novel glycosphingolipids. By utilizing MS/MS fragment spectra analysis we will be able to identify sugar headgroups in our glycosphingolipids from neutral losses of the sugar monomers or the sugar fragment ions. Using GNPS-based molecular networking we will also be able to rapidly dereplicate known glycosphingolipid molecules, speeding up the process of identifying known chemistry to allow us to focus our efforts on novel sugar headgroups. With the novel organisms we isolate we will conduct Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) with the Oxford Nanopore Technology’s nanopore platform to create a genomic data set that can be searched for the SPT gene. Inspired by the 
“glycogenomic” approach of mapping sugar chemistry in secondary natural products to biosynthetic gene clusters,13 we will also interrogate our genomes compared against the glycosphingolipids identified by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify candidate genes in the biosynthetic pathway after the SPT gene. Though this poses some unique challenges as sphingolipids are primary metabolites and their biosynthesis is not organized in tight biosynthetic gene clusters as is common in secondary natural products, the use of gene knockouts or heterologous expression can help confirm the role of these genes in the production of complex glycosphingolipids. We will also be able to utilize the known promiscuity of bacterial SPT genes to feed in unnatural lipid molecules,1 using LC-MS/MS monitoring to detect the novel glycosphingolipids produced by the incorporation of these feedstocks, demonstrating what strains might be able to be manipulated into producing compounds with desirable changes to the lipid tail of the glycosphingolipids. Glycosphingolipids isolated from scale up of the cultures will be further characterized by NMR analysis to confirm our structure assignment by MS/MS fragmentation analysis. At the end of the project, our glycosphingolipids will be submitted to a bioassay for cytokine elicitation from macrophages as a first step towards showing the clinical relevance of our glycosphingolipid library."
10836387,"Background: Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are process measures that focus on the
interpersonal aspects of the care, and increasingly used to measure care quality and address inequities. The
number of women Veterans using VA health care continues to increase. In fiscal year 2015 over 400,000
women Veterans used VA health care. Women Veterans using VA health care are increasingly diverse in
terms of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation and gender identity, have complex medical and mental health
care needs, and a high prevalence of sexual trauma, including military sexual trauma (MST). These
characteristics and experiences, which are often overlapping, shape their experiences of health care within VA ,
which in turn influence patient-reported and clinical outcomes of care.
Significance: The proposed study will develop the first patient-reported experiences measure (PREM)
designed specifically to quantify women Veterans’ experiences with VA health care (WV_PREM). WV_PREM
can be used to monitor and inform on-going patient-centered quality improvement efforts such as the Women’s
Health PACT and anti-harrassment initiative in VA through partnerships with API and WHS. It will also enable
examination of equity in VA care across a variety of patient demographics including race/ethnicity and
gender/sexual orientation.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal is innovative due to its focus on patient experience and active
engagement of Veterans in the measure development process, and by intentionally incorporating diverse
voices of women Veterans, particularly those with marginalized identities. Unlike current PREMs used in VA,
WV_PREM will include domains of patient experience in VA that are uniquely important to women Veterans
such as safety, respect, and discrimination. WV_PREM will be a unique tool for monitoring the quality and
equity of VA reproductive health care and informing and accelerating quality improvement efforts.
Specific Aims:
1. Identify constructs salient to the experience of women Veterans using VA health care through a series of
 semi-structured interviews with diverse women Veterans with different health care needs.
2. Generate a preliminary WV_PREM instrument based on findings from Aim 1 and literature review of
 existing measures. Consensus on items and content validity will be reached using review and feedback
 from Veterans and VA stakeholders; clarity will be determined via cognitive interviews.
3. Psychometrically evaluate WV_PREM in a cohort of 600 women Veterans receiving health care at VA to
 refine the measure, assess and confirm the factor structure, and test construct validity.
Methodology: This proposal will use a sequential mixed methods approach. Aim 1 involves a series of semi-
structured interviews with women Veterans who used VA health care. Aim 2 will in clude development of a
preliminary PREM based on Aim 1 findings, and refinement based on iterative review and feedback from
Veteran focus groups, review by VA stakeholders, and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 will psychometrically
validate the final PREM from Aim 2 in a cohort of 600 women Veterans by assessing and confirming the factor
structure and testing for construct validity.
Next Steps/Implementation: Throughout the project, we will prepare briefings for our operational partners to
share key preliminary and final results, and with support of the VA Women’s Health Research Network pres ent
results to various Veteran’s groups. Findings will be presented to the VA and non -VA scientific community
through participation in national meetings and publication in peer reviewed journals. Starting in year four, we
will work with our operational partners to implement the final validated version of WV_PREM as a regular tool
for VA health care quality surveillance."
10836482,"Project Summary
The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains,
including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial
septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting
glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty
with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC-
hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta
and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain
stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career
Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of
novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the
electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the
candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his
current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology,
study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural
oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction
(pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2)
evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between
electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will
improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit
disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data
collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career
independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an
investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders."
10836405,"NEURONAL CIRCUITS SUPPORTING LEARNING-DRIVEN CHANGES IN AUDITORY PERCEPTION.
 Learning to discriminate sounds in noise is fundamental to auditory processing and is critically important for
everyday communication and navigation. Both the auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex have been shown as
involved in detection of sounds in noise, yet how the microcircuits within intra-cortical, cortico-thalamic and intra-
thalamic interactions facilitate detection of signal in noise remains unknown. Our goal is to close this gap in knowledge
and determine whether and how multiple microcircuits within the cortico-thalamic loop, including excitatory-inhibitory
circuits within the primary auditory cortex; feedback loop between the auditory cortex and the lemniscal and non-
lemniscal auditory thalamus; and the cortical feedback via the inhibitory thalamic reticular, contribute to the learning-
driven improvement in auditory perception in noise. We will train mice to detect or discriminate between auditory targets
in noise using operant conditioning. Detecting and discriminating sounds in noise activates multiple processes, including
selective adaptation to background noise and learned amplification of the target representation. We will change noise
contrast prior to target presentation to test how contrast adaptation interacts with target detection. We will record the
neuronal responses in the cortical and sub-cortical regions during behavior, and use temporally precise, cell specific
manipulations to establish the circuit that allows the mouse to learn and carry out this complex task. We will implement a
novel generalized linear-non-linear model to continuously estimate gain adaptation in neuronal responses to test whether
and how the distinct microcircuits adapt to contrast, detect the target and control neuronal gain. Combined, our results
will reveal novel circuit-level mechanisms for hearing in noise across micro-circuits within the cortico-thalamic loop."
10836532,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide is a major public health concern in the United States; nearly
50,000 individuals die by suicide annually and almost 1.5 million attempt suicide. To date, identification of
individuals at risk for suicide has relied on suicide risk screening practices, including using a variety of self-
report instruments. However, sensitivity of these measures are only moderate; more precise tools for
identifying patients at risk for suicide are needed. Suicide risk models, developed by our team, incorporate
health records data and historical self-report screening questionnaire responses to improve accuracy of risk
prediction. Our models have outperformed traditional clinical screening and similar risk models for adults
receiving care in outpatient mental health specialty settings. However, while accurate, they have not been
evaluated in real world care; whether the models actually increase identification or result in patients receiving
more suicide prevention services, fewer crisis services, or making fewer suicide attempts is unknown. There
is substantial clinical interest in implementing suicide risk models but little scientific evidence about the
effectiveness of these models in real world settings compared to standard screening practices alone.
Additionally, there is almost no guidance for their implementation in healthcare. The proposed project
leverages the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), a collaboration of large health
systems with established clinical data infrastructure to support multi-site studies. MHRN members Henry
Ford Health System, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and HealthPartners will participate in this project and
collectively serve >170,000 behavioral health patients per year. The patient populations are diverse,
including thousands of individuals with Medicaid and Medicare. Each of these systems has implemented a
suicide prevention care model in their behavioral health departments, including robust suicide risk screening
and assessment processes. However, none of these systems has implemented a suicide risk model. The
proposed project includes a pragmatic trial approach with randomization of behavioral health clinics across
the three participating health systems. It is innovative because it seeks to implement an MHRN suicide risk
model (intervention) into each system's existing suicide prevention care model (usual care) to increase the
reach and effectiveness of the suicide prevention care models. Sites will receive implementation planning
support based on stakeholder feedback from preliminary studies and deliverables include an implementation
planning tool kit to facilitate spread. This high-impact study has important clinical implications as health
systems consider whether it makes sense to enhance their existing suicide prevention care models with a
suicide risk model. It is timely because many health systems are advancing toward suicide risk model
implementation without evidence to support this innovation."
10836534,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma pathogenesis involves structural and functional changes in resident airway cells including airway smooth
muscle (ASM) cells. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in altered homeostasis in
airway cells provides opportunities to develop newer and effective anti-asthma drugs. Ubiquitination is an
evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated homeostatic process that ensures turnover of key signaling
intermediates. Alterations in E3 ligases have been implicated in human pathologies including cancer, aging,
neurodegeneration. This proposal is based on our solid preliminary data derived from human ASM cells and
mouse models using molecular and pharmacological approaches that suggest: A) an E3 ligase Ring Finger
Protein 145 (RNF145) is expressed in the human lung and ASM cells, with expression significantly increased in
fibrotic/remodeled airways and ASM cells derived from asthmatics; B) silencing or pharmacological inhibition of
RNF145 reduces ASM cell proliferation and extracellular matrix secretion through regulation of PI3 kinase and
AMPK signaling, respectively; C) profibrotic mediator transforming growth factor (TGF) b1 treatment upregulates
expression of RNF145 in ASM cells; D) inhibition of RNF145 reduces ECM secretion in vitro, cellular ATP levels,
and restores AMPK signaling; E) over-expression of RNF145 drives both ASM cell growth and ECM synthesis
independent of mitogen or profibrotic agent; and E) inhibition of RNF145 prevents house dust mite (HDM)-
induced airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and markers of airway remodeling. Our data are supported
by clinical findings from collaborator Dr. Frey who shows a single nucleotide polymorphism in RNF145
(rs10076782) is associated with neonatal lung function, more respiratory symptoms and wheezing at school age.
ASM cells play a pivotal role in the regulation of lung function, and increased ASM mass and hypercontractility
are associated with asthma symptoms. However, the role of E3 ligase RNF145 in ASM cells or in asthma is not
known. RegulomeDB analysis suggests that RNF145 regulates signaling molecules involved in metabolic, cell
cycle, matrix production, cell fate and oxidative stress pathways, all of which play a role in asthma pathogenesis.
Therefore, we hypothesize that RN145 plays a key role in regulating ASM functions such that inhibition of
RNF145 will prevent development of the allergen-induced asthma phenotype. Studies using ASM cells obtained
from healthy and asthmatic lung donors will delineate the role of RNF145 in ASM cell proliferation (Aim 1) and
extracellular matrix production (Aim 2) and establish the cellular and molecular pathways regulated by RNF145.
To further establish the role of RNF145 in airway functions and in asthma pathogenesis, we will use wild type
and global and smooth muscle-specific conditional RNF145 knockout mice subjected to allergen challenge (Aim
3). We will also test the effectiveness of a pharmacological inhibitor of E3 ligase, SMER in murine model of
asthma. Collectively, findings from the proposed studies will provide novel insights into an important and
previously unrecognized role of RNF145 in regulating ASM functions and in the pathogenesis of asthma."
10836536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Kidney stones (KS) are painful mineral deposits that affect 1 in 11 individuals in the United States. The economic
burden from KS is over $5 billion dollars annually and is predicted to rise due to increasing prevalence.
Approximately 80% of KS are comprised of calcium oxalate (CaOx). Several individuals with CaOx KS develop
recurrent KS. The reasons for recurrence are not well defined. Intake of meals containing high amounts of oxalate
are associated with increased KS risk. Oxalate-rich diets may induce CaOx crystal formation in the urine and
nephron, which can stimulate reactive oxygen species signaling and monocyte recruitment into the renal
interstitium. If crystals are not properly cleared by macrophages, this could result in the propagation of KS.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine important for regulating monocyte and macrophage
function. We previously reported patients with CaOx KS have reduced circulating monocyte cellular
bioenergetics and increased inflammation. We further determined that CaOx crystals can cause similar
responses in monocytes in vitro. We recently reported that intake of a single dietary oxalate load stimulates
nanocrystalluria and alters circulating monocyte cellular bioenergetics in a small cohort of healthy subjects. The
goals of this proposal are to examine the effects of low and high oxalate diets on nanocrystalluria and immunity
using human translational studies and experimental models. The central hypothesis of this proposal is oxalate
suppresses IL-10 signaling leading to reduced cellular bioenergetics, redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial
quality control in macrophages. We further propose this contributes to impaired macrophage clearance of CaOx
crystals from the kidney which may play a role in KS formation. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that oxalate
enriched diets stimulate nanocrystalluria and reduce monocyte cellular bioenergetics in healthy subjects and
patients with CaOx KS. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that oxalate reduces IL-10 signaling, cellular bioenergetics,
and mitochondrial quality control in macrophages. This project involves an interdisciplinary team and
multifaceted approaches to assess the effect of oxalate on nanocrystalluria and IL-10-mediated
monocyte/macrophage immune responses, which may play a role in CaOx KS formation. The results obtained
will generate new insights into the cellular mechanisms driving KS formation and should unveil novel strategies
for KS prevention."
10841529,"Neurodegeneration is an increasing public health issue and remains an unsolved
biomedical challenge. Genetic discoveries have provided news avenues for investigating the
molecular mechanisms of several neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a hexanucleotide
repeat expansion in a noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene was linked to the
neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia
(FTD). ALS is characterized by loss of motor neurons, and the C9orf72 mutation represents the
most common genetic cause of both familial and sporadic ALS. FTD is characterized by
degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and is the second most common
type of dementia for people older than 65; the C9orf72 mutation is also the most common
genetic causes for FTD. The C9orf72 mutation is also found to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease
and Huntington’s disease. Despite intense efforts and rapid advances, our understanding of the
disease mechanisms and treatment strategies for C9orf72-linked ALS/FTD are still at the early
stages. To help relieve the public health burden associated with these diseases, it is important
to understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis. We have recently discovered that
C9orf72 plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy and related metabolic processes,
suggesting that further studies of C9orf72 functions could shed light on the mechanism of
ALS/FTD pathogenesis. The goal of the proposed project is to elucidate the mechanisms
through which dysregulation of C9orf72 functions leads to molecular defects and neuronal
toxicity. The specific aims are to identify the central mechanisms through which C9orf72
regulates autophagy and related metabolism, to delineate the pathways through which the
pathogenesis is generated, and to identify potential intervention strategies. The proposed
studies, which combine biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches, are expected to
provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD that may
ultimately leads to novel approaches for treating these devastating neurodegenerative diseases."

10841535,"The complement system controls the balance between homeostatic and inflammatory processes. Although
abnormal complement activity is strongly associated with macular degenerations, inhibiting this pathway has
been unsuccessful in halting vision loss. To date, therapeutic approaches have focused on complete inhibition
of extracellular complement activity, with limited insight into how complement proteins modulate retinal health
and disease. This is particularly evident in approaches targeting the complement protein C3, the core effector
molecule of the complement system, which plays context-dependent roles in the retina. Countering the
conventional view of C3 acting solely in the extracellular space, recent studies from our group have identified
intracellular C3 activation as a novel mechanism that modulates health of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),
a primary site of injury in macular degenerations. In stressed or diseased RPE, increased uptake and proteolysis
of C3 generates biologically active C3a (“intracellular C3 activation”). C3a in turn activates mTOR, a master
regulator of cell health. Chronic mTOR activation is detrimental to cell health because it can reprogram cellular
metabolism and cell fate decisions. Based on these exciting studies, we hypothesize that abnormal intracellular
complement activation could drive disease pathology by compromising RPE homeostasis. We propose to
molecularly dissect the machinery, mechanisms, and consequences of dysregulated intracellular C3a activity in
the RPE, and identify potential points of therapeutic intervention to halt this cascade. We will identify the cellular
machinery responsible for increased intracellular C3a generation in diseased RPE (Aim 1); investigate the
dynamics of C3a signaling via its cognate receptor C3aR (Aim 2); and determine how persistent C3a-C3aR

10841667,"Abstract
Alarmingly, ~50 million couples worldwide are unable to conceive after 5 years of unprotected sex. Medically
assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) constitute important treatment modalities for infertile couples trying
to conceive. While generally considered safe, ARTs are associated with higher incidences of preterm birth,
intrauterine growth restriction, and low birth weight. Moreover, there are more Beckwith-Wiedemann, Silver-
Russell, Angelman and Prader-Willi Syndrome children in the ART population harboring imprinted methylation
errors compared to those in the general population. Since ART usage coincides with important stages of
imprinted DNA methylation programming during gamete and preimplantation development, it is possible that
ARTs lead to imprinting errors. Studies in fertile mice support this. Superovulation during oogenesis and/or
embryo culture during preimplantation, two nearly universal ART procedures, lead to significant numbers of
embryos with imprinted methylation errors. To date, little is known about the regulation of imprinted methylation
maintenance during preimplantation development, and moreover, how ARTs lead to disruption in this
maintenance. This proposal will address these knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesize that
embryos are predisposed to imprinted methylation errors because ARTs disrupt crucial maternal-effect
transcripts in oocytes that are required in embryos to maintain imprinted methylation. Candidate maternal-
effect transcripts will be identified using single cell RNA-seq on control and superovulated oocyte, 1-cell and 2-
cell embryos, representing the period of oocyte-to-embryo transition. Candidate function will then be
determined though protein degradation methods. Next, we will determine whether altered maternal-effect
transcripts in polar bodies, as a proxy for oocytes, correlates with imprinted methylation errors in resulting
embryos, ultimately leading to identification of transcript biomarkers that are predictive of imprinted methylation
errors. Aim 2 will test the importance of nuclear import in imprint maintenance using pharmacological and
protein degradation methods, and whether it is disrupted by ARTs. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that the 4 to 8-cell
stages represent a window of susceptibility when fast developing ART embryos acquire DNA methylation
errors, particularly in outer, trophoblast cells. We will determine when embryo development is altered by ARTs
using time-lapse analysis, and then compare DNA methylation perturbation in slow and fast developing
embryos using whole genome bisulfite mutagenesis. This will distill a molecular signature of DNA methylation
errors. Next, we will investigate this molecular signature during early development to determine when DNA
methylation errors arise and in which lineages of ART embryos, as well as in cells induced to trophoblast fate.
Finally, we will test the predictive power of developmental and morphokinetic parameters as a noninvasive
procedure for embryos with a molecular signature of imprinted methylation errors. Results from this proposal
will provide the biological basis for improvements to fertility treatments aimed at identifying at-risk embryos."
10842281,"Project Summary
Functional profiling of microbial communities is critical to understanding their overall effects on host health. Most often,
metagenomic shotgun sequencing of microbiome samples is used to assess total functional capacity. Yet, transcriptional
responses may vary dramatically between organisms depending on the context, with potentially large effects. Many
metabolic functions are only expressed after the organism acutely senses the presence of particular substrates in their
environment. Pathogens may only express virulence factors after obtaining a critical quorum of pathogens. Overall, stress
responses are critical for survival under changing abiotic and biotic conditions. Being able to comprehensively map out
these pathways, which determine the resilience, plasticity, and patho-functions of the microbiome, requires sensitive,
robust transcriptional –omics tools.
Performing traditional RNAseq analyses on bacterial communities has been the predominant method to gain
transcriptional information, but it is hampered by the need for technical workarounds and it provides incomplete
information about the transcriptional landscape. Ribosomal RNA needs to be depleted prior to sequencing, it has a poor
signal-to-noise ratio arising from varying RNA decay rates, and it is insensitive to the transcription of non-coding RNA
that has secondary structure or post-transcriptional modifications. Alternatively, the position of RNA polymerase (RNAP)
can be assessed, which provides a real-time readout of transcription. Although so-called nascent transcript sequencing has
been performed in E. coli, revealing transcriptional pause sites and other phenomenon elusive when using RNAseq alone,
these protocols rely on immunoprecipitation of RNAP and are therefore unsuitable for complex microbial communities
where RNAP may be quite diverse and require species-specific antibodies. As a solution, Precision Run-On and
SEQuencing (PRO-seq), a method originally created for examining transcription in eukaryotes, may provide an unbiased
method to examine transcriptional dynamics on cultured bacteria or in complex microbial communities, such as the
human microbiome.
Our goal is to test the feasibility of PRO-seq when applied to prokaryotes and to evaluate its ability to capture
transcriptional dynamics associated with canonical stress response pathways (heat-shock, oxygen exposure and DNA
damage), using a set of quantitative metrics. We aim to validate, and if necessary, modify the protocol so it can be used
robustly across species. We plan to develop a computational approach to test the full breadth of transcriptional phenomena
that can be observed using this method, such as transcriptional pausing, bidirectional transcription, differences in RNAP
function apparent across species, and RNA decay rates, among other aspects. If successful, we expect that PRO-seq will
be adopted to study the responses of human-associated microbiota to host diet, inflammatory signals, xenobiotics and to
human transcriptional circuitry, more directly."
10842282,"TITLE: CAFFEINE AND POSTOPERATIVE NEUROCOGNITIVE RECOVERY
PROJECT SUMMARY
Delirium is a distressing clinical syndrome characterized by failure of basic cognitive functions that affects
approximately 20-50% of older surgical patients. Delirium during surgical recovery is associated with increased
mortality, increased healthcare expenditures, and future cognitive and functional decline. Moreover, there is
pathophysiologic overlap between delirium and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias; patients experiencing
delirium demonstrate increased risk of future dementia. Unfortunately, the underlying neurobiology of delirium
remains incompletely understood, and there are no biologically informed, effective therapies for preventing
postoperative delirium and related complications. Our preliminary data suggest that caffeine reduces delirium
in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after major surgery by shifting cortical dynamics towards neural
criticality. Criticality refers to a system state that is poised to dynamically fluctuate to meet demands. For
cognition, neural criticality is a potential mechanism by which functionally segregated areas of the brain can be
dynamically integrated over space and time to optimize cognition. In our preliminary trial, participants receiving
caffeine at the end of surgery demonstrated increased electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of criticality in
the PACU concurrent with delirium reduction. Nonetheless, the relationships among caffeine, neural criticality,
and postoperative neurocognitive recovery require additional, rigorous testing. Our long-term goal is to improve
neurobiological understanding of delirium and related neurocognitive disorders, such that effective therapies
can be developed. The objectives of this proposal are to (1) test an intervention for reducing early
postoperative delirium while (2) identifying dynamic brain changes that reflect cognitive vulnerability. The
central hypothesis is that caffeine will improve postoperative neurocognitive recovery in older adults. We will
test this hypothesis via a randomized, placebo-controlled, quadruple-blinded clinical trial. Aim 1 will determine
whether caffeine reduces the incidence of early postoperative delirium. Participants (n=250) will be randomized
to placebo, low-dose caffeine, or high-dose caffeine in a three-arm parallel design. A sequential randomization
design will also be used to test one vs. two days of caffeine therapy. Aim 2 will identify cortical dynamics
underlying early postoperative delirium. A wireless, high-density whole-scalp EEG system will enable the
analysis of neural criticality and the associations with caffeine and delirium. Lastly, Aim 3 will use the same
EEG system to test baseline neural criticality in trial participants meeting criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment,
as deviations from criticality have been reported in patients with this condition as well as Alzheimer’s Disease.
Overall, the proposed research is significant because results may provide an effective, neurobiologically
informed intervention for reducing early postoperative delirium and related consequences. Additionally, results
will provide neurobiological insight into vulnerable cortical dynamics that portend delirium and, possibly,
subsequent neurocognitive disorders."

Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE) are continuously replaced from basal stem
cells and grow their axons to the olfactory bulb to maintain the sense of smell. Failure to reconstitute the OE
after injury, infection or aging, causes olfactory dysfunction which is a safety and a quality of life issue. No
treatments are available. Defining the signals that regulate olfactory neuroplasticity would reveal new
therapeutic targets to improve olfactory deficits. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is highly expressed in
horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), while the CNTFRα receptor is expressed
in the neighboring neuronal progenitor globose basal cells (GBCs). We found that CNTF is suppressed by
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and that intranasal application of an FAK inhibitor promotes OE neurogenesis via
CNTF. Importantly, FAK inhibitor further enhances CNTF expression caused by OE injury with methimazole.
We will use genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches in male and female mice to test the
hypothesis that FAK inhibition promotes olfactory neuroplasticity following injury by increasing CNTF
expression. Aim 1 will define the FAK-CNTF-CNTFRα pathway underlying GBC proliferation by first
determining whether FAK inhibition induces CNTF in HBCs, OECs or both. We will also determine whether
CNTF is released to activate CNTFRα signaling in stimulating GBC proliferation, and whether FAK inhibition
acts through this intercellular mechanism. To increase the relevance of our findings, Aim 2 will determine
whether FAK inhibition can increase olfactory neurogenesis via CNTF following acute OE injury. Thus, we will
use acute injury with methimazole and determine whether injury increases CNTF in HBCs and/or OECs which
leads to increased GBC proliferation and neurogenesis. The effect of FAK inhibitor treatment following
methimazole may be within HBCs and/or OECs, something we will test. To prepare for additional studies, we
will define an optimal dose of FAK inhibitor and then test whether CNTF mediates the effect of FAK inhibitor to
promote OE neurogenesis after acute injury. Chronic olfactory inflammation inhibits HBC proliferation and
increases FAK signaling in HBCs, suggesting that CNTF might be suppressed. To broaden the relevance to
more types of olfactory injuries, Aim 3 will use a refined chronic olfactory inflammation mouse model to
determine whether FAK inhibition increases CNTF and promotes GBC proliferation and olfactory
neurogenesis. Aim 4 will determine the ability of FAK inhibition to promote OSN axonal growth and olfactory
function recovery following acute and chronic types of OE injury, using genetic axon tracing methods combined
with behavioral tests. This proposal will define the role of FAK and CNTF and validate the therapeutic potential
of FAK inhibitors to improve olfactory function after injury. FAK inhibitors are well-tolerated in cancer clinical
trials and intranasal administration avoids systemic side effects."

10843113,"Project Summary
 Experiments outlined in this application, suggest a novel paradigm, that acute angiotensin II (AngII)-stimulated
PIP2 hydrolysis triggers cardiac CaV1.2 channel internalization, providing a means to rapidly tune cellular
excitability and modulate EC-coupling in health. In contrast, we propose that sustained deficits in plasma
membrane CaV1.2 expression, and PIP2 depletion during chronic AngII can trigger a maladaptive compensatory
sympathetic response that improves cardiac function in the short-term but ultimately leads to progressive,
pathological cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy, and potentially arrhythmogenic Ca2+ signaling dysregulation. We
provide compelling preliminary data indicating that PIP2 hydrolysis, downstream of acute AngII/AT1R/Gq
activation, leads to endocytosis of cardiac CaV1.2 channels. We can visualize this endocytosis occurring
dynamically in live ventricular myocytes upon perfusion with physiological concentrations of AngII (100 nM).
Initial results indicate a shift in the balance between channel insertion and removal, such that AngII-stimulated
removal of PM channels, leads to an ~30 % reduction in PM CaV1.2 abundance. We observe a strikingly similar
%-reduction in three other separate experimental approaches, finding decreased ICa in electrophysiology studies,
reduced channel cluster area and expression in super-resolution imaging, and a loss of PM CaV1.2 in surface
biotinylation. We isolate PIP2 as the critical executor of this response, distinct from the activation of PKC and
arachidonic acid production that accompanies AT1R stimulation with experiments that bypass the receptors and
instead utilize a rapamycin-stimulated dimerization system to recruit a 4’,5’ phosphatase to the membrane and
deplete PIP2. Our results support a novel mechanistic role of PIP2 on Cav1.2 channel trafficking and expression
which can be tuned in response to physiological signaling cascades to modulate EC-coupling during acute
regulation of blood pressure. We further propose that chronic depletion of PIP2 during AngII/AT1R signaling
associated with heart failure causes: (i) sustained destabilization of PM CaV1.2 and long-lived expression deficits;
(ii) a compensatory sympathetic response to boost cardiac function involving activation of PKA and CaMKII that
acts in combination with direct AT1R-stimulated CaMKII to enhance CaV1.2 and RyR2 phosphorylation,
producing enhanced Po and diastolic leak that stimulates CaN/NFAT and hypertrophic gene expression; (iii)
enhanced IP3 production that also stimulates CaN/NFAT and hypertrophic gene expression, and (iv) cytoskeletal
instability as a result of depletion of cardioprotective PI(3,4,5)P3 and enhanced ROS-induced microtubule
catastrophe that disrupts channel delivery and promotes biomechanical instability, t-tubule and loss of dyads.
We propose to rigorously test these ideas in two specific aims described herein."
10843117,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is diagnosed by clinical indicators (e.g., risky drug use, social/interpersonal difficulties linked to use, withdrawal/tolerance, failed efforts to control use, etc.), while craving (a strong desire or urge to take a drug) and relapse which can be linked to elevated stress and negative affect and compounded by exposure to cocaine and cocaine-associated environmental cues. Our team and others established that dampened signaling through the serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR), a member of the 5-HT2R family, is
a key element of the mechanisms of action underlying cognitive and behavioral vulnerability to CUD and relapse. We pioneered the development of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) for the 5-HT2CR and discovered our first generation of 5-HT2CR PAMs to bind to an identified, spatially distinct allosteric site to selectively potentiate 5-HT2CR, but not 5-HT2AR or 5-HT2BR, signaling in vitro without intrinsic activity at the three these receptors. As a proof-of-concept, two of our 5-HT2CR PAMs (CYD-1-79, CTW0415) potentiated in vivo effects of a full 5-HT2CR agonist in male rats, an effect which was blocked by a selective 5-HT2CR antagonist, verifying reliance on 5-HT2CR function. CYD-1-79 also suppressed cocaine-seeking in a relapse-like behavioral model in male rats. Our objectives are to optimize 5-HT2CR PAMs with favorable drug-like properties and analyze select molecules in proof-of-concept in vivo assays and models of CUD. To accomplish our goals, we will pursue three aims to discover next generation 5-HT2CR PAMs for illumination of 5-HT2CR allosterism, optimize 5-HT2CR PAMs with favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics profiles which will be assessed for efficacy in rodent preclinical models of CUD. There is a gap in our ability to maximize therapeutic strategies to reduce the psychological and medical impact of CUD in patients. We address this gap in treatment efficacy by presenting the novel concept that 5-HT2CR may prove useful in treating CUD. Importantly, the advances in novel molecule discovery and expansion of knowledge of allosteric modulation of the 5-HT2CR systems could have a profound impact in improving the course and treatment of an even broader category of neuropsychiatric disorders."

The MD/PhD program at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center has been in existence since 1978
and continuously funded as an NIH Medical Scientist Training Program since 1982. The goal of the program is
to train the next generation of diverse physician scientists as leaders in biomedical research and academic
medicine, helping meet the urgent needs identified by the NIH for the future biomedical and translational
research workforce. Program alumni include a dean, department chairs, two MSTP directors, and many faculty
members at leading academic medical centers. Outcomes of trainees in the past 15 years, described in this
application, are excellent; 91% of graduates who have completed all their training are physician-scientists in
academia or industry. Attrition over this same period was 7.6%. The large institutional commitment to the
program is evidenced by the investment of significant resources to pay for stipend and tuition costs not
covered by NIH, program administration, operations, and salary support for committed effort by the directors.
Our program integrates rigorous predoctoral training in basic biomedical sciences leading to the PhD degree
with intensive medical education leading to the MD degree, producing graduates who are superbly prepared to
become physician-scientists engaged in translational research. The MD and PhD phases of training are
distinct, but with numerous integrative and social activities, including seminars, retreats, dinners, journal clubs,
grand rounds, to promote program cohesion and inculcate identity among trainees as future physician-
scientists. There are presently 90 trainees in the program, all of whom are fully funded. Continued funding of
22 slots is requested to partially support trainees, generally for 24 months."
10843264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pathology is focused on providing medical diagnoses and prognoses based on laboratory methods to guide
patient treatment and management. Microscopy is fundamental for pathologists to examine tissues and cells.
Despite numerous advancements, there have not been many changes in the last century in terms of how
microscopy images are used in pathology. The current approach in anatomic pathology lacks standardization
and relies on the cognitive burden imposed on pathologists to manually evaluate millions of cells across hundreds
of slides in a typical workday. Deep learning-based methods have recently shown encouraging results for
analyzing microscopy images. However, they rely on standard computer vision architectures and pipelines,
which are limited due to the required time and cost of slide digitization and the computational constraints of
analyzing huge high-resolution images. Furthermore, developing accurate deep learning models requires having
access to large databases of labeled microscopy images, which is challenging. In this application, new
methodologies are proposed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of histopathology datasets and the
range of features in histology microscopy images to address these limitations. This project presents a novel
approach based on generative adversarial networks for difficulty translation to generate augmented data with
realistic, rare, and hard-to-classify histopathological patterns. This approach will mitigate data imbalances in
annotated histology datasets and improve the performance of deep learning models for histological classification,
particularly for uncommon and difficult-to-classify cases. Furthermore, a novel curriculum learning approach for
histology image classification will be developed based on the range of classification difficulty among
histopathological patterns and multi-annotator labeled datasets. This approach trains on progressively harder-
to-classify images, as determined by annotator agreement, and significantly improves the performance of the
resulting deep learning models without requiring additional data or computational resources. In addition, a self-
supervised knowledge distillation method will be developed to enhance the efficiency of histology image
classification. As large, labeled datasets are scarce, this method uses a self-supervised approach to distill feature
extraction capabilities at a high resolution into a student model operating at a lower resolution by leveraging
unlabeled datasets. The resulting distilled student models can achieve high classification accuracy on low-
resolution histology images while saving a significant amount of time and resources on digitization efforts and
required computational resources. The proposed methods in this application remove current bottlenecks in deep
learning applications for digital pathology. Therefore, the results from this project could have a major impact on
new opportunities that use deep learning technology in clinical workflows and integrate histopathological
information with other clinical and molecular data to improve patients' diagnoses, prognoses, and treatments."

Autophagy is a crucial catabolic pathway by which cellular waste is recycled. Autophagic dysfunction has
been implicated in cellular quality control, responses to stress, development, lifespan, and a range of
infectious and other diseases in humans, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. The
crosstalk of organelles including fusion and contact is a critical process involved in autophagosome
biogenesis. The exact molecular mechanism for the crosstalk of organelles in autophagy remains far from
clear and thus a major topic of investigation. Since organelle crosstalk could act as a switch to spatially and
temporally regulate the autophagic flux in human diseases due to its dysregulation, dissecting and
controlling the regulatory machinery is essential to understanding the exact roles of autophagy in specific
disease contexts. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of organelle crosstalk will provide the
opportunity to develop new therapeutic strategies in order to control activity of autophagy. We have
developed in vitro protein reconstitution systems and live cell super-resolution imaging assays to study the
dynamics and interactions of organelles. In this R35 renewal application, based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that the crosstalk of organelles including fusion and contact regulates autophagosome
biogenesis, in which SNAREs, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 33A (VPS33A), and Atg9 play a
critical role. In the next five years, we will 1) study v- and t- SNAREs and accessory proteins involved in
autophagosome maturation; 2) elucidate the role of Atg9 vesicle contact resulting in clustering for early
autophagosome biogenesis; 3) analyze and control the crosstalk between Atg9 vesicles and other
organelles. Systematical studies on the role of organelle fusion and contact in autophagosome biogenesis
through multiple biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological approaches are critical to elucidate detailed
molecular mechanisms, which could offer therapeutic advances. Moreover, an attempt to control organelle
dynamics and interactions by optogenetic tools would be an important expansion, which is also essential for
future drug development."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the esophagus, and one of the most
common causes of vomiting, feeding and swallowing difficulties, including esophageal food impaction in children.
EoE is difficult to diagnose and distinguish from other common esophageal diseases in real-time using white
light endoscopic imaging of the esophagus conducted via an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure.
Therefore, clinicians rely on multiple random esophageal biopsies which is obtained during this procedure for
histologic confirmation (gold standard). However, since EoE is a patchy disease even the multiple biopsies may
not yield accurate results. This can lead to a delay in diagnosis and ineffective treatment, and result in
preventable complications such as esophageal remodeling requiring surgical interventions. As such there is an
urgent need to develop alternative diagnostic tools which can quickly survey more regions of the esophagus, in
situ, and provide tissue-specific inflammatory biomarker information for real-time identification of EoE. Raman
spectroscopy (RS) is one such technology that can provide a solution as it relies on light interaction with
molecules to provide a unique “fingerprint” of the biochemical and molecular composition of a specimen within
seconds. Therefore, RS via an endoscope is uniquely suited for real-time biochemical assessment of active EoE.
This proposal, presents the development and assessment of a depth specific dual-wavelength Raman
endoscope to characterize both biochemical and water changes within the esophagus as it relates to active EoE.
To accomplish these goals, Raman biomarkers will be characterized and identified spatially and correlated with
known biomarkers of EoE in vivo as well as ex vivo. Computational modeling will be performed using a modified
Monte Carlo simulation to optimize probe design based on tissue optical properties. Ex vivo non-linear imaging
coupled with Raman maps will be performed on a subset of biopsies, obtained during the EGD procedures, to
further study the spatial distribution of key biomarkers and help guide the endoscopic Raman probe design. This
probe will be evaluated using optical tissue phantoms and in vivo patient measurements. Finally, a machine
learning classification algorithm will be optimized and evaluated to provide a mechanism by which in vivo RS
spectra can be classified into active EoE, inactive EoE, GERD (i.e., acid reflux disease) and other non-EoE
control. Furthermore, we aim to track patient’s response to treatment and assess Raman spectral changes over
time to determine the feasibility of using RS to provide a predictive treatment outcome model.
The successful completion of this proposal will yield a novel diagnostic tool for real-time detection and monitoring
of EoE in pediatric cases."

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that develops suddenly and carries
significant morbidity and a high mortality rate for which no biomarkers exist. The high mortality rate seen in NEC
could likely be prevented if there was a screening method that permitted early disease detection. Predictive and
prognostic tools for NEC are essential to advance our biological insight with a view towards non-invasive
detection and accurate and timely phenotyping. We have developed a NEC Biorepository with a variety of
specimen types and extensive clinical metadata obtained prospectively from premature infants before the
development of NEC. These samples allow us to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie NEC development,
including genetic or environmental factors. These factors include epigenetic mechanisms that regulate important
aspects of cellular differentiation and gut development. Importantly, the epigenetic mechanisms, specifically, at
the level of DNA methylation that take place during neonatal NEC are unknown. Our preliminary epigenomic
data demonstrate that numerous biological pathways are altered during NEC. Based on these findings, we now
hypothesize that non-invasive identification of methylation signatures can identify an infant at risk for necrotizing
enterocolitis. We will test this hypothesis by defining and quantifying the DNA methylation signatures in stool and
blood of premature infants before, during and after the development of NEC. Moreover, we will expand on our
observations that dysregulation of multiple key pathways is a defining pathogenic feature of NEC and use our
mouse model to gain additional mechanistic insights into NEC pathobiology. By the conclusion of the proposal,
we will have generated a considerable amount of genomic data from infants across the time course of
development and manifestation of NEC, and also during the normal extrauterine development of preterm infants.
These studies will advance our understanding of the epigenomic regulation of the pathways involved during NEC
development, and furthermore, may explain the unique susceptibility of the premature infant to NEC and identify
a non-invasive approach to diagnosing this devastating disease."

The Imaging and Engineering Core includes the following components: 1) Imaging platforms that harness UCI's
proficiency in multiphoton microscopy, fluorescence dynamics, and diffuse optical imaging. These platforms
enable data acquisition across various scales, from laboratory experiments to animal models and clinical
environments. 2) Tissue engineering and labeling approaches that, in conjunction with tissue clearing and
advanced imaging techniques, facilitate the exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships in the epidermis.
In the last four years, Core investigators have employed state-of-the-art technologies, including Multiphoton
Microscopy, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy, Coherent Raman Scattering, Spatial Frequency
Domain Imaging (SFDI), and Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI), to obtain groundbreaking findings in skin homeostasis
and disease. This research has yielded 28 peer-reviewed papers utilizing core services and 13 papers
contributing to the advancement of skin imaging technologies. Over this same timeframe, UCI Skin investigators
have expressed a need for advanced spatial phenotyping methods capable of visualizing molecular contrast at
cellular/subcellular resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in human skin at the bedside. In response to this need, we
develop advanced imaging methods capable of visualizing molecular contrast at subcellular resolution. To
explore how genotype impacts the spatial distribution of molecular contrast in tissue, we engineer tissue models
to examine genotype-phenotype relationships relevant to skin disease. The Imaging and Engineering Core has
a crucial role in offering resources for training, dissemination, and collaboration that foster and bolster
interdisciplinary efforts. Our aim is to unite technology developers, modeling experts, biologists, and clinicians
from UCI and the broader skin research community, forming teams that can exchange knowledge and utilize
new tools to address persistent challenges. This will be achieved through hands-on and didactic training, as well
as dissemination activities designed to equip skin biology researchers with advanced imaging tools for their

The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are filamentous polymers that regulate vital cell processes, including
but not limited to division, morphogenesis, DNA synthesis and repair, phagocytosis, and motility. Exactly how
the dynamics of individual actin filaments or microtubules are regulated and coordinated in these cell processes
is not fully understood. The goal of this research is to understand actin and microtubule assembly and their
coordination by 1) developing new tools to visualize these proteins and their regulators, and 2) examining the
emerging convergence between these proteins and membrane-less biomolecular condensates. This project
utilizes an advanced in vitro biomimetic microscopy system capable of simultaneously monitoring fluorescent
actin filaments, microtubules, and other regulatory proteins to elucidate detailed molecular mechanisms at single-
molecule resolution. To address these mechanisms in a more physiological setting, we plan to combine these
probes with an opto-genetic system that mimics several neurodegenerative disorders by repositioning
condensates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This innovative approach imitates the onset of most
neurodegenerative disorders and allows us to quantify pre- and post-disease state changes at high-resolution in
the same cell. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie these intricate biological systems (e.g., the

fundamental biological processes and the onset of most neurodegenerative conditions."

In all eukaryotic cells, export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an essential step in gene
expression. As such, mRNA nuclear export is fundamental for all cellular activities and has been linked to
various diseases when it is dysregulated, such as in cancer, neurological disorders, and viral infections.
Our research focuses on elucidating the mechanisms and regulation of mRNA export under physiological
and pathological conditions. Within the nucleus, newly synthesized mRNAs are processed and packaged
with proteins to form ribonulceoprotein particles (mRNPs). The core machinery that facilitates the assembly
of export-competent mRNPs is the TREX (TRanscription/EXport) complex. Through the enzymatic activity
of its ATPase subunit Sub2/DDX39B, TREX facilitates loading of export-specific factors including the export
receptor NXF1•NXT1 to form export-competent mRNPs. We have recently elucidated the architecture of
the TREX complex and defined key steps of Sub2/DDX39B’s activity. These findings provide a solid
foundation for us moving forward to investigate fundamental aspects of mRNA export that remain poorly
understood. In this grant period, we aim to identify and structurally characterize the physical and functional
interaction network that connects different steps of mRNA export and coordinates the export process with
other nuclear events. We envision that these molecular connections spatiotemporally regulate the ATPase-
driven mRNP assembly and establish selective export of mature transcripts. The resulting biochemical and
structural knowledge will generate hypotheses that we will test at the cellular level. In addition, we aim to
investigate how viruses exploit host mRNA export to facilitate their replication. We recently have elucidated
the molecular basis for how influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 target NXF1•NXT1 to block host gene
expression. We will continue to study the various mechanisms that influenza A virus uses to exploit host
mRNA export factors. Together, our work will provide mechanistic insights into the mRNA export pathway
and may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for viral infections."

10830313,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older patients receive fragmented healthcare that is of variable quality and cost. To address this problem, the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) developed accountable care organizations (ACOs). ACOs
create incentives for providers to work together, while being mindful of their spending. Evaluations of the
Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)—CMS’s largest ACO initiative—show that participating
organizations have improved care quality for older patients. Nonetheless, their costs remain high because they
do not have enough “skin in the game.” The majority of ACOs have contracts in which they share a small
percentage of the savings with Medicare when they reduce their annual costs below a benchmark but are not
penalized if they fall short (i.e., they have no downside risk). Without the financial threat of downside risk,
ACOs have less reason to innovate and increase efficiency. Thus, CMS announced “Pathways to Success” in
December 2018, requiring current MSSP ACOs to shift to downside risk in as little as one year. However,
shifting so quickly may be detrimental. The MSSP is voluntary, and many ACOs that have engaged in
meaningful care redesign may not be ready to take on the possibility of having to repay CMS millions and
leave the program instead. Indeed, 40% of ACOs facing contract renewal this July dropped out. Without the
potential for shared savings, exiting ACOs may divest their data systems and coordination capabilities needed
for population health management, which are costly to maintain. In turn, the ACOs’ patients may suffer lower
care quality and higher costs. The decision to stay in the MSSP may have unintended consequences, too.
ACOs may pursue cost-containment strategies like favorable patient selection. They may also limit their focus
to CMS-required metrics (at the expense of other clinically important ones). These moves would hurt older
patients who stand to gain the most from ACOs. In this context, we propose a combined qualitative and
quantitative study with three Specific Aims. 1) To examine decisions around MSSP participation and the
impact that these decisions have on an organization’s approach to care delivery after launch of
Pathways to Success. Using administrative data, we will purposefully sample 12 ACOs without downside risk
that faced contract renewal in 2019—six that renewed and six that did not. We will conduct semi-structured
phone interviews with key stakeholders to better understand what factors influenced their participation decision
and how their decision is affecting their efforts to improve care coordination and population health. 2) To
assess the effects of MSSP exit on clinical quality and costs among older patients. We will analyze
national Medicare claims (2008 to 2022) and identify MSSP-aligned fee-for-service beneficiaries. Among these
beneficiaries, we will then measure their healthcare quality and costs (based on CMS-required outcome and
process metrics and total price-standardized Medicare spending) before and after launch of Pathways to
Success. 3) To evaluate for unintended consequences on older patients from continued participation.
For ACOs identified in Aim 2 that remain in the MSSP, we will evaluate whether they take part in favorable
patient selection. We will also measure their organizational performance against CMS-required and non-

our study will provide policymakers with actionable insights as they incorporate downside risk into advanced

10862806,"SUMMARY
This project will use data from randomized controlled trials of cash transfers to poor households in Zambia and
Kenya to test whether these programs can protect food security, child health and youth lifecourse transitions
during periods of adverse climate conditions. Specifically, we will link longitudinal household data from these
two geographically dispersed trials to daily, high-resolution data on temperature and precipitation exposures.
We will then take advantage of the randomization of transfers and the effective randomization of climate
anomalies at the community level to test whether transfers modify the effects of climate shocks on a rich set of
household, child and youth outcomes. This will represent the one of the first studies to test whether transfers
can protect children and youth against temperature exposures, and will directly feed into the ongoing global
conversation about how best to protect vulnerable populations against climate change."
10838970,"Molecular effects of cannabinoids on the Blood Brain Barrier in HIV-infected brain
 Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes significant disease morbidity in the brain,
largely due to HIV-associated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, inflammation, and persistence of HIV-infected
CNS target cells such as microglia and macrophages, in spite of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Cannabis is a
commonly used drug by people with HIV (PWH). Recently, we made the important observation that the impact
of cannabis on BBB integrity markers is context-dependent, with signs of BBB disruption in non-HIV subjects,
but paradoxically improving BBB integrity in PWH. This observation makes it a high priority to understand the
mechanistic basis of this dichotamous influence of cannabis on the BBB. Cannabis and HIV interact in
multifactorial ways that are still poorly understood. Importantly, HIV brain target cells microglia/macrophages
express the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), while endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) express both
CB1R and CB2R and other cannabinoid receptors such as GPR55. It is also unknown how cannabis influences
HIV-associated brain inflammation or the active/latent status of HIV in infected microglia. By protecting vascular
integrity, it follows that cannabis will not only affect the select transport of substrates into the CNS, it will also
directly influence the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the passage of ART or other treatments to the brain.
The goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that cannabinoids positively impact BBB integrity in
the HIV-infected brain environment, leading to reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and ultimately
protection from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Our analysis of two human brain microvascular
endothelial cell (HBMEC) lines (hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ci18) with opposing vascular integrity responses to
cannabinoids in the context of HIV suggest a molecular mechanism that can explain the context-dependent
effects of cannabis in human BBB properties. Based on this preliminary data, our hypothesis posits that beneficial
effects of cannabinoids in the context of HIV occur via CB2R, while cannabinoid signaling via GPR55 may be
damaging. In the proposed studies we will model the human BBB in vitro using multicellular systems containing
the two HBMEC lines in parallel, along with pericytes, astrocytes and microglia, to replicate HIV-induced vascular
phenotypes characterized by loss of tight junction proteins and increased permeability to fluorescent labelled-
dextran. Implications to infection in the brain will be validated in vivo using the EcoHIV mouse model, which
develops BBB disorders. Successful completion of these experiments will define the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the dichotomous influence of cannabis on the BBB in the context of HIV, forming the basis of new
approaches aimed at optimizing BBB integrity."
10836589,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis is the most common psychoactive drug co-used with alcohol among individuals with alcohol use
disorder (AUD). The current proposal advances our team’s research on the impact of cannabis use (CU) and
cannabis-alcohol co-use on alcohol-related outcomes. Findings from clinical studies indicate that CU is
strongly linked with alcohol use, although evidence regarding whether cannabis reduces or increases drinking
is mixed. Our research has demonstrated that Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) acutely reduces relative alcohol
value and consumption in heavy cannabis and alcohol co-users under controlled laboratory conditions.
Evidence from animal models on cannabidiol (CBD) suggests CBD may also reduce alcohol craving and
consumption. An important gap in current clinical research is lack of human laboratory studies that examine
alcohol consumption in relation to cannabis varying in cannabinoid composition (THC and CBD). Moreover,
aside from data on pharmacodynamic interactions between cannabis and alcohol, no human laboratory studies
have examined the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis (i.e., marijuana; simultaneous use-SAM) on
alcohol consumption. Finally, no previous study has evaluated the impact of cannabis on alcohol use within the
same individual under both controlled laboratory conditions and in the natural environment. This project will
provide the most comprehensive tests of the impact of cannabis on alcohol outcomes using a multi-method
design: (1) controlled laboratory administration of THC versus CBD smoked alone versus simultaneously with
alcohol and (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of event-level contextual factors that can help
elucidate the associations between CU and alcohol-related outcomes in daily life contexts. The laboratory
phase will employ a 3 (within-subjects cannabinoid dose: 12% THC/<1% CBD, 12% CBD/<1%THC, placebo) X
2 (between-subjects: cannabis + an alcohol-priming dose versus cannabis + alcohol placebo) mixed factorial
design to examine these effects on subsequent drinking in 200 nontreatment-seeking heavy episodic alcohol
drinkers who use cannabis weekly (Aim 1). Data from this laboratory phase will be integrated with smartphone-
based data on CU patterns (amount, THC/CBD ratio, potency, mode), context (location, social), alcohol
craving, consumption, and consequences collected from the same individuals over a 4-week EMA period.
Integration of laboratory and EMA data enables examining the unique influences of laboratory-based cannabis
state-dependent alcohol response variables and field-based CU and contextual factors on alcohol craving,
consumption, and consequences (Aim 2). Cannabis (medical and recreational) and SAM motives and AUD
severity will be explored as potential moderators of the associations between CU and alcohol behaviors in the
natural environment (Aim 3). This research is well-aligned with the objectives of the Collaborative Research on
Addiction at NIH and has important implications for cannabis regulatory science and AUD treatment by
addressing the relative impact of specific cannabinoids as well as contextual risk in cannabis-alcohol co-use."
10837038,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heavy alcohol use and dependence has become a major public health concern within the United States and
across the globe, with limited treatments currently available to those who seek them. Binge intake of alcohol is
a significant risk factor to the development of dependence, and this form of intake leads to major health
consequences. While men are more commonly diagnosed with alcohol use disorders, the frequency for
diagnoses in females has risen in recent years. Furthermore, sex differences in drinking behavior and the
underlying neural mechanism remain largely unknown. Our lab, and others, have implicated the role of the
central amygdala (CeA) in ethanol consumption in animal models. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF)
modulates binge-like ethanol drinking in the CeA, and pilot data from our lab shows that silencing CRF+
projections from the CeA to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) leads to a sex-specific reduction of binge-like
ethanol drinking in male, but not female, mice. Similarly, CRF1R antagonism and CRF2R agonism in the LH
lead to male specific blunting of binge-drinking, suggesting this receptor system’s involvement in modulating
binge drinking. CRF, GABA, and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor (Y1R) are all closely expressed in the
CeA, and pilot work from our lab shows Y1R activation in the CeA blunts binge-like ethanol intake, similar to
effects seen in males with silenced CRF neurons in the CeA. However, sex-dependent ethanol consumption
differences in the NPY system remain uninvestigated. Thus, this proposal focuses on examining potential
sex-differences in CeA NPY and Y1R signaling, as well as the role of the Y1R+ CeA  LH pathway, in
the modulation of binge-like ethanol consumption. Proposed experiments will use a combination of
transgenic, chemogenetic, histological, and pharmacological approaches. The well-validated rodent model of
binge-like ethanol consumption known as “Drinking in the Dark” (DID) will be used throughout these
experiments to identify neural changes. For Aim 1, I will use the designer receptor technology (viral injections
of Cre-dependent Y1R-promoter DREADDs in the CeA) and cannulation of the LH in transgenic NPY1R-cre
mice to determine if silencing Y1R+ projection neurons from the CeA to the LH will attenuate DID binge-like
ethanol intake and associated blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) in male but not female mice. In Aim 2, I will
focus on the role of Y1R signaling in the CeA, and whether Y1R agonism can affect binge-like ethanol drinking
in a sex-dependent manner, using site-directed pharmacology and an NPY over-expressing viral vector. Lastly,
in Aim 3, I will examine changes in NPY and Y1R levels, and co-expression with CRF, after multiple cycles of
binge-like ethanol drinking in male and female mice. Binge-induced plasticity in the NPY system that are sex-
dependent are predicted, and will be assessed using immunohistochemistry, Western Blots, and real-time PCR
to quantify protein and mRNA in the CeA. Taken together, these results will provide new insights into the
neurocircuitry underlying sex-differences in binge-like ethanol intake."

The fundamental role of the immune system is to detect self from non-self. The detection and elimination of
microbial infection is critical for human survival. One challenge to the immune system is infection from an
intracellular microbe because the microbe masks its presence in a host cell. One strategy of the immune
system to detect microbes is the sampling of different kinds of antigens, such as peptides, lipids and
glycolipids, by antigen presenting molecules. A fundamentally unique arm of the immune system is MR1, which
is an antigen presenting molecule that is intracellular, ubiquitously expressed across tissues, and detects small
molecules derived from microbial metabolism. These features suggest that MR1 is poised to detect intracellular
microbes. MR1 presents antigens to MR1-restricted T cells. These T cells are highly prevalent in the lungs and
have the ability to kill infected cells. Because MR1 presents small molecule antigens and adopts an
intracellular distribution, the mechanisms governing MR1 sampling of the intracellular environment are distinct
from other antigen presenting molecules. Our hypothesis is that endosomal recycling and endosomal calcium
signaling are key for MR1-dependent antigen presentation, and that these features distinguish MR1 from MHC-
Ia antigen presentation. We use Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a model for intracellular infection and
have identified calcium-sensitive trafficking proteins and calcium channels important for MR1 antigen
presentation. In Aim 1, we will define the role of the endosomal trafficking protein Syntaxin 16 in MR1-
dependent antigen presentation. In Aim 2, we will define the role of calcium sensitive Synaptotagmins in MR1-
dependent antigen presentation. In Aim 3, we will identify the important calcium channels involved in this
process and examined the role of Two-pore channels. This research plan is part of a detailed training and
career development plan for the applicant. In addition to hands-on basic science research with an emphasis on
techniques such as measurement of intracellular calcium and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, the applicant
will complete coursework in scientific writing and biostatistics to expand scientific knowledge and will attend
scientific conferences to develop collaborations. Acquisition of all of these skills will lead to expertise in defining
intracellular signaling cascades in antigen presenting cells, with the goal of obtaining an R01 by the end of the
K08 award. The primary mentor has a long track record of training scientists and a Mentoring Committee will
track the applicant's progress and contribute to the applicant's development as a scientist. Finally, the
sponsoring institution, Oregon Health & Science University, has all the facilities and support necessary to
support the proposal."
10837198,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY

Maintenance of Plasmodium cases in Odisha, India, continues despite active efforts by the state malaria control program targeting high endemicity foci with mass screening and treatment (MSAT), intensified vector control measures (LLINs, IRS), and community education. An improved understanding of what is driving the maintenance of Plasmodium reservoirs in Odisha despite these efforts is the broad goal of Project 1, and the knowledge generated from three aims will be used to design new tools required to further the state's progress toward elimination. A four-year community-based cohort in three Odisha districts of differing endemicity will enable Aim 1 to be realized. In each district, 1000 individuals will be selected across 5 villages/hamlets and will be followed for the duration of the study (15 villages total; 3,000 subjects total). Visits and sample collections will be carried out at baseline and then every 6 months, including before and after rainy seasons. Infections will be determined by microscopy, RDT, and PCR, and changes in clinical status will be monitored over time. To obtain a true estimate of the impact of false negative RDTs leading to malaria detection and treatment failure, the cohort surveillance will be augmented with passive surveillance enrolling patients with febrile illnesses presenting for care at the three district healthcare centers. Using samples and survey data collected from the same cohort, Aim 2 will evaluate the frequency of false negative and erroneous species identification at the three sites by (i) comparing results between different diagnosis methods (microscopy vs. RDT vs. PCR) in our cohort, (ii) identifying Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 gene deletions in P. falciparum infections and their prevalence over time, and (iii) investigating whether other Plasmodium species are rising into the niche vacated by P. falciparum. Lastly, Aim 3 will focus on evaluating Anopheles species composition and density in households and adjacent cattle sheds of a subset of participants, and monitor changes in insecticide susceptibility over time. Understanding where, why, and how reservoirs of infection remain in Odisha is the key focus of Project 1, and the data generated through the three subprojects will support the design of new control and intervention approaches to advance the state's goal of elimination before 2030."
10837199,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Novel and more granular methods of diagnosis of Plasmodium infection are urgently needed in India, where
several important barriers to elimination have recently come to light. Through the development of new and
innovative detection tools across the spectrum of disease severity, Project 2 and its three subprojects broadly
aim to support and further India’s efforts toward malaria elimination. To help tackle the high prevalence of Pfhrp2/
Pfhrp3 deletions reported in Odisha, Subproject 1 will identify novel RDT biomarker candidates by deep learning
techniques to mine the P. falciparum genome and proteome. These potential new biomarkers will be filtered for
relative proteomic abundance and specific characteristics such as chromosomal location and essentiality, and
protein binders designed against them. Selected designed protein binders will be immobilized on a nitrocellulose
test strip and tested at our Indian field sites for sensitivity and specificity and benchmarked against PfHRP2 rapid
detection tests commonly used in India. Subproject 2 will evaluate ophthalmologic and plasma biomarker
signatures to identify patients at risk of cerebral and cognitive changes following falciparum malaria. The
prevalence of short and long-term neuro-disabilities in adults recovering from falciparum malaria will be assessed
using serial quantitative magnetic resonance imaging methods, ophthalmologic and neuropsychometric
assessments, permitting the detection of a potentially considerable but unrecognized impact of Plasmodium
infection on brain function not limited to WHO-defined cerebral malaria patients and inform follow-up and
rehabilitation strategies. Lastly, Subproject 3 will combine plasma RNA sequencing with proteomic screening
to determine circulating biomarkers associated with the presence of cryptic malaria parasites in the spleen of
individuals with asymptomatic infection. Circulating miRNA and protein profiles in blood samples from patients
undergoing traumatic splenectomy and categorized as with or without splenic parasites in Project 1 will be
compared. Candidate biomarkers associated with splenic carriers of Plasmodium parasites will be tested at our
three field sites to assess the prevalence of this reservoir in Odisha. Identifying, developing, and validating new
biomarkers across the whole spectrum of Plasmodium infection will provide valuable tools towards diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of infected individuals, with the overarching goal to support India's efforts towards
malaria elimination both at state and national levels."
10837210,"OVERALL SUMMARY
Malaria remains stubbornly entrenched in Malawi, a poverty-stricken, ecologically diverse country in south-
eastern Africa. A variety of reasons for this intransigence of malaria have emerged from our current and past
ICEMR-based research:
  Most severe disease and death occur in young children, but school-age children are more commonly
 parasitemic and represented an asymptomatic (and thus hidden) reservoir of infection
  Two Anopheles species transmit the majority of Plasmodium infections, but their abundances are very
 heterogeneous and increasing insecticide resistance has dramatically reduced effectiveness of the
 most important control methods: insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying
Other studies in Malawi have shown that important Anopheles vectors have evolved to bite at places (outdoors)
and times (early evening) when people are not sleeping under bed nets. In addition, a promising new anti-
Plasmodium vaccine, RTS, S/AS01 (RTS, S) administered to young children, appears to be efficacious in Phase
III and pilot studies in Malawi. These findings and insights are the basis for our proposed research program.
Following a WHO-sponsored pilot and recommendation, RTS, S vaccination roll out is currently happening in
several districts across Malawi, allowing us to study vaccination impacts on pediatric malaria risk (Epidemiology
Project). A national-level distribution of new dual-insecticide bed nets (dual-AI LLIN) creates an opportunity for
complementary analyses of vector and human behavior and infection patterns (Transmission Project). Multi-
factorial investigations will take place at 36 sites in 7 Districts of southern Malawi comprising diverse
environmental settings and three levels of transmission intensity. Analyses will assess:
  Impacts of RTS, S vaccination and dual-AI LLINs on the epidemiology of uncomplicated clinical malaria,
 and patterns of P. falciparum infection and transmission
  Long-term impact of RTS, S on the incidence and age-distribution of severe malaria
  Anopheles abundance across space/time in relation to biogeographic/weather patterns and vector control
  Outdoor and ""awake-time"" mosquito biting in relation to Plasmodium transmission and human infection
  Impact of a novel transmission-blocking compound on infection in field-derived Anopheles species
The Malawi ICEMR team has the capacity to sustain long-term observations of human cohorts in different
transmission settings and to collect extensive ecological, entomological and parasitological data. Most of our
ICEMR team have been working collaboratively for more than a decade and have developed close working
relationships based on mutual respect and common goals. We have the appropriate mix of diverse training,
skills, and perspectives to undertake the proposed cross-disciplinary studies."
10837211,"The roles of the Administrative Core include the enforcement of administrative policies and procedures that will
effectively support the proposed research and the ICEMR program in meeting its goals and objectives. The
ICEMR will be administered from two offices: one at the Malaria Alert Centre (a research center of the Kamuzu
University of Health Sciences) in Blantyre, Malawi, and the other at the University of Maryland, Baltimore with
the support of Prof. Miriam Laufer. Dr. Don Mathanga, who lives in Malawi, will lead the Amin Core from the
Blantyre office. The Blantyre office will be the responsible for the overall fiscal management of the grant, budgets,
hiring, procurement, administration of all research activities, and program management. The office in Baltimore
will support the Blantyre office through the procurement of travel services, specialized equipment, and laboratory
reagents that are not readily available in Malawi. At the University of Maryland, the Admin Core will be supported
by Prof. Miriam Laufer, a co-investigator on this application and long-term collaborator (≥ 20 years) of Dr.
Mathanga.
The Administrative Core will ensure that all administrative arrangements and agreements with the district health
management teams, implementing partners, and the Ministry of Health are enforced and that specific institutional
review boards have given the appropriate authorization for research projects to continue. The core will be
responsible for the management of the ICEMR inventory. The core will maintain and safeguard required
documentation for the ICEMR, KUHeS and the sponsor (the US National Institutes of Health) including IRB
approvals, evidence of training in human subjects research, quotations, invoices, and receipts.
The Admin Core will also be responsible for coordinating the monthly Steering Committee meetings, the weekly
Core and Project team meetings, writing the annual Progress Reports (and developing the attendant budgets),
organizing the twice-yearly meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) (one ‘face to face’, one virtual), and
for facilitating communications within the ICEMR, between ICEMRs, and with the NIH. The coordination will
support the dissemination of research findings within and beyond Malawi."
